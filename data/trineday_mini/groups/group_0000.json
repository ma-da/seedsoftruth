It began on the evening of the 14th with her ingesting the contents of bottled water while preparing for bed at her San Francisco mansion. The extremely bitter taste of the water, confirmed by her household help, resulted in an emetic and forced vomiting. An analysis of the bottled water confirmed the presence of strychnine. A detective agency was retained and they sealed off the mansion. On the 15th, Mrs. Stanford wrote to fellow Standford University trustee George Crothers expressing her horror that someone had tried to kill her. Then, accompanied by her secretary Bertha Berner and a maid, she sailed for Honolulu; but, it appears she did not go far enough… On the evening of the 28th at the Moana Hotel after imbibing bicarbonate of soda, she cried out that she had been poisoned again. Physicians were summoned, in whose immediate presence she succumbed from symptoms diagnostic of strychnine poisoning. Her last words were: “I have been poisoned again. This is a terrible death to die.” It was reported on March 1 that “the features of her postural abnormalities, liquid and cyanotic blood, and meningeal inflammation were typical findings of strychnine poisoning. Toxicological analysis revealed strychnine in her intestinal contents and in the bicarbonate On March 6-9, a coroner’s inquest was held at the Moana Hotel. The jury heard the testimony of Mrs Stanford’s secretary Bertha Berner, her maid May Hunt, the three physicians, Drs. Humphris, Day and Murray, who were involved in trying to save her, Drs. Shorey and Duncan, who performed the toxicological analyses and Dr Wood, who conducted the autopsy. Based on all the medical and toxicological evidence, on March 9 the official Hawaii State Inquest and Coroner’s Jury officially ruled murder by strychnine poisoning “by persons unknown.” Stanford President David Starr Jordan arrived in Honolulu on March 10, accompanied by trustee Timothy Hopkins, Detective Reynolds of the San Francisco Police Department, and Captain Jules Callundan of the Morse Detective Agency that had been retained in the prior poisoning. Their purported purpose was to conduct an “independent investigation” into the cause of Mrs. Stanford’s death and then accompany her body to Palo Alto. In our judgment, after careful consideration of all facts brought to our knowledge, we are fully convinced that Mrs. Stanford’s death was not due to strychnine poisoning nor to intentional wrong-doing on the part of any one. We find in the statements of those with her in her last moments, no evidence that any of the characteristic symptoms of strychnine poisoning were present. We think it probable that her death was due to a combination of conditions and circumstances. Among these we may note, in connection with her advanced age, the unaccustomed exertion, a surfeit of unsuitable food and the unusual exposure", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:0:d9d2feca2ee5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 1, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "not due to strychnine poisoning nor to intentional wrong-doing on the part of any one.

The fact that it is not in excess of usual medicinal proportions suggests either an error of a pharmacist or else that the combination was prepared for tonic purposes. Finally, in an interview with a reporter, Jordan stated that Mrs. Stanford’s primary attending physician at the time of her death, Dr. F. Howard Humphris, who lived at the Moana Hotel where Mrs. Stanford was staying, and the other physicians involved “knew nothing about strychnine poisoning” and were “deficient in the scientific side.” On March 17, the three physicians involved in Mrs. Stanford’s case issued a rebuttal of Jordan’s conclusions, saying “no Board of Health would accept Jordan’s diagnosis as correct.” Back at Stanford, on March 21, Jordan wrote Board President Samuel Leib to say that “if a tonic theory of the strychnine/bicarbonate mixture is not acceptable, the alternative for their use was that Humphris had put the strychnine in the soda after Mrs. Stanford’s death. Having made a diagnosis of poisoning, he laced the soda with strychnine to bolster his diagnosis.” Jordan described Dr. Humphris as “a man of no personal or professional reputation.” Immediately after the Honolulu autopsy, however, all of the organs (apart from the brain and heart which were fixed in formaldehyde) had been turned over to the Hawaiian chemists for analysis. They had been chopped, boiled and reduced to a slurry so the strychnine could be extracted. All that remained of them had been poured down the mortuary drain. They no longer existed. Their purported ‘re-examination’ was only possible as pure fiction. n July 29, 2001, while in London, I received a quite unexpected email from a retired Stanford Medical School neurologist and former Dean of Faculty, Dr. Robert W.P. Cutler, M.D. He had located a Stanford University internal administration memorandum written about a meeting I attended in 1983 in Hawaii, where researcher and historian Robert Van Dyke imparted to me his purported discoveries about the 1905 poisoning death of Jane Stanford. On a visit to Stanford later in 1983, I had mentioned my meeting with Van Dyke to a member of staff in the university’s Office of Development, Peter Sylvester. Thereafter I gave the matter no further thought and discussed it with no one.

Thereafter I gave the matter no further thought and discussed it with no one. In 1997, when London media investigators were looking into Court frauds against my company, Banner International, in Utah in 1993, they phoned Peter Sylvester as part of that investigation. I was listening in to the call and astonished when he launched into a phenomenal diatribe that I was obsessed with Jane Stanford having been poisoned, and going around saying that the Stanford University President at that time, David Starr Jordan, was responsible for her murder. The fact was: I had mentioned my meeting with Van Dyke to Sylvester just that once and then had completely dropped the subject. Far from being “obsessed,” I had forgotten all about it, and knew nothing other than what I had been told in 1983. What was going on? Was it because the Stanford and Requa families were related? Why would Sylvester allege that I was “obsessed” about Jane Stanford’s death when I had forgotten all about it for 14 years? Very strange things were happening. I write hoping that you are the Stanford alumnus who provided information in 1983 to Peter Sylvester in the Office of Development. If you are not, you may wish to read no further. Sylvester’s memorandum on the subject of your information was sent to me by the University archivist who is helping me research the death of Jane Stanford. I am a retired Stanford neurologist.… I have just completed a book on the history of magnesite mining in my home town (Livermore, Ca). That mine was also placed in receivership because of stock swindles in 1916. But for the last 8 months I have been researching the death of Mrs. Stanford. I have focused on the medical evidence, the physicians and toxicologists who were involved, and the efforts by David Starr Jordan to obscure what was certainly, in my view, a case of murder. The memorandum from Sylvester states that you are (were ) acquainted with Robert Van Dyke who was said to have written a lengthy manuscript documenting that Jordan and Darius Mills were involved in the death of Mrs. Stanford. I wrote to Van Dyke some time ago, but I did not receive a response (nor was my letter returned). I am overjoyed at hearing from you with your researches. I too tried to track down Van Dyke quite a few months ago, maybe about a year and a half.

He has a signed statement from the boy who delivered the prescription to Mrs. Stanford at the Moana Hotel that killed her. Needless to say, Van Dyke got the statement when the boy had also become a very old man many years ago. I’ll send you my chapter on Hawaiian Days that includes my meeting with Van Dyke. I’ll see what I can do to track him down for you. The value of the Stanford story lies in the moral it presents: very similar to the moral of the Banner story. It would be quite phenomenal if the University admitted to it and took Jordan’s name off everything. For more than three years thereafter I exchanged emails with Dr. Cutler – sometimes almost daily – in our mutual efforts and collaborating in our investigations. One result was his book published by the Stanford Press, The Mysterious Death of Jane Stanford. Its publication made front page national news, with some comments by myself, as also included in some articles. His conclusion that Isaac L. Requa, my great-grandfather, then President of the Stanford-originating Central Pacific Railroad was the “obvious second victim” to the poisoning of Jane Stanford (sent in March 2004); Isaac collapsed at lunch at the Pacific Union Club a couple of days after Jane’s funeral; I knew, with his emphysema, that his time was going to be curtailed, and he had e-mailed me recently that he had taken a turn for the worse. Fortunately, I had taken the opportunity to write him about how much our collaboration had meant to me. Indeed, he was like a guardian spirit, almost like a father. For almost three years he had been there, having come to me from out of the blue, to give me information that would help salvage my reputation, my life, and my career. But he did more than that. Somehow he instinctively knew what I had been through and had been there with sometimes daily e-mails to urge me on. His findings had restored my credibility, had shattered the credibility of Stanford, and had given me new faith. His wisdom, quiet brilliance, kindness, and keen insight into my dilemmas had enveloped my daily thinking for those years. Because of him I had even been quoted on the front page of the Los Angeles Times, and then syndicated nation-wide.

As I spoke the next day with a wise friend in whom I had been confiding, he said I could look at it another way: that Dr.Cutler had stayed longer than he might otherwise have done, just to help me out. That sounded right.… He had held on right up to that very day of completion with a film treatment. Among his last and most important messages to me had been: “Get your book out.” He knew that history and civilization needed these disclosures, as they had needed his about Stanford. First of all let me commend you on the work you have done with respect to the death of Mrs Stanford. It is clear to me that you have opened a can of worms and set out a very credible case of apparent murder based upon the Cutler evidence. Your diligence serves well the Stanford family and, although they do not realize it at this time, the entire Stanford community. Of course, I can only urge you to follow through with this work. There is, as you know, no statute of limitations involving murder. I have no doubt that it is a potentially very worrying matter for the university. The interviews by London journalists in 1997 showed that ever since 1983 corrupted Stanford administrators had been very worried about me. A phenomenal libel campaign had been instigated against me in 1993 at Stanford and elsewhere; and the discoveries about the scope of events around and after Jane Stanford’s death would mushroom beyond what I could imagine. Key figures in the poisoning death of Jane Stanford in 1905 were David Starr Jordan and Darius Ogden Mills. Looming in the background were Pres. Theodore Roosevelt, John D. Rockefeller, and Whitelaw Reid, who along with his father-in-law Darius Ogden Mills arrived in California just as Jane Stanford’s death in Hawaii was announced. My research has shown that many of these same people were also involved in the horrifying eugenics movement, but there was still very much more for me to learn. The day before the 1905 Hawaii inquest ruling of death by strychnine poisoning, Whitelaw Reid was appointed Ambassador to the Court of St. James (U.K.) by President Teddy Roosevelt. At that moment he was also serving as an executor for Jane Stanford, but I can find no record of Whitelaw Reid and Jane Stanford having ever even met. He lived 3000 miles away in New York City. He served in London until 1912 where he died.

He served in London until 1912 where he died. That same year Roosevelt was well paid by the bankers to stand as ‘Bull Moose’ candidate against President William Taft and Democrat candidate, Woodrow Wilson. The popular President Taft had refused to support the Aldrich Plan for a central bank because it offered only nominal government control and would place the bankers in the driver’s seat. As intended, Roosevelt split the Republican vote in 1912 and ensured that Taft failed to make a second term. The path had carefully been cleared for Woodrow Wilson – a political captive of Wall Street bankers who had agreed to their hidden agenda – to gain the Presidency and sign off on the corrupt Federal Reserve Act. Whitelaw Reid’s tenure as U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. may have been for purposes of liaising with the Rothschild banking cartel on the terms for the Federal Reserve Act. I was discovering this history while I was seeking to counter a libel campaign against me and my mining interests. Sylvester’s 1983 Memorandum had clearly started something major at Stanford. In his phone call with the investigators in 1997, while egregiously lying about me, he sounded a bit desperate. Twenty years later with Cutler in 2003, I found a university web site that was entirely based on the details provided by Van Dyke to me that were the basis for Sylvester’s Memo of 1983. Stanford had been stewing on those things that they had learned just from me in 1983 and that they were trying to debunk online twenty years later. Something in that Sylvester Memo of 1983 had struck a very raw nerve with the higher administration. With Cutler’s data in all his emails to me, I finally figured out what it was – but not until 2016. It will hopefully mean the end of corrupt control of Stanford University and the restoration of the Stanford University as Jane Stanford had intended before those who stole it in 1904/1905 then murdered her and Isaac Requa. Maybe they were not worried about Jane Stanford’s death exposures per se, but about what I might find if that was looked into: perhaps about institutionalized eugenics (i.e. Nazi eugenics) and that it was also the very same people who organized and passed the Federal Reserve Banking Act. Some strong evidence shows the bankers bribed TR Roosevelt with $100 million “donated” to a eugenics organization to swing the 1912 election, insure a Wilson victory, and his signature on the Federal Reserve Act.

Later, Wilson rued his actions, and had this to say: A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is privately concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men … [W]e have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated, governments in the civilized world – no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men. But there is more to it than that. Some of this has to do with my grandfather and Herbert Hoover having been brought together as the world’s leading mining engineers, with the seeming ultimate plan of monopolization of gold mining and control of gold reserves by the very same crowd, perhaps after they had reduced the value of the dollar to almost nil? Gold in 1912 was $20 per ounce. Now it is over $1200 . Looks like the “banksters” knew what they were doing in bringing Mark L. Requa and Herbert Hoover together. The very same forces who had been involved in the poisoning of Jane Stanford and Isaac Requa later organized for Isaac’s son Mark, my grandfather, and Herbert Hoover to collect the Requa/ Hoover Files. From the early 1930s “they” organized the funding of over a hundred of million dollars for Herbert Hoover, Mark Requa, and my father, Lawrence Requa to amass the exclusive Requa/Hoover Files, which covered thousands of mining properties throughout the Western Hemisphere. The task was complete enough by the time Nixon freed the price of gold for “them” to try to obtain those files in 1974. That effort through John Paul Getty failed when I refused his overtures after his Getty Oil had acquired the data on one property, the Mercur Gold Mine in Utah, with which data Getty with Barrick Gold were able to mine a billion dollars worth of gold and take Barrick public in 1983. But Getty’s efforts to acquire all the Requa/Hoover Files failed, even after it appears that murder was resorted to in 1974 to try to break my hold on the files by trying to frame me for the murder of one Samuel Edelman in San Francisco. That failed when by happenstance I", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:6:6027c22cb625", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "the Mercur Gold Mine in Utah, with which data Getty with Barrick Gold were able to mine a billion dollars worth of gold and take Barrick public in 1983.

That failed when by happenstance I unexpectedly removed myself from the murder scene just before it transpired. Stealing the Requa/Hoover Files would then require waiting for a fraudulent receivership in Utah in 1993 about which Cutler mentioned seeing information online. Cutler would not see the ultimate success of his research in finding the culprits of Jane Stanford’s murder – aside from convincing ourselves of Jordan’s and Bertha Berner’s culpabilities and seeing that Issac Requa was the “obvious second victim” – but he saw the compelling criminal story of the somehow Stanford-related crimes against me and my company, Banner International, which was destroyed with the theft of the Requa/Hoover Files in the Utah court frauds of the receivership in 1993. I learned yesterday that Requa [Isaac] was elected Pres. of the CP at the same meeting where Huntington was elected VP. Huntington and Mrs. Stanford had some major difference. Huntington and Mills could have a connection. I’ll try to flesh this out and provide a coherent synopsis of the Fur Seal stuff – my intuition is that there is not much there and it may be distracting. Cutler could little have imagined the ultimate organized evils that would surface in direct connection to the Stanford murder timeline from 1905 through 1913 with election-rigging. Nor would Cutler be able to see the hideous and then immediate connections of Jordan and his cohorts with eugenics – and ultimately with Nazism – to the agenda that immediately compelled the murders. Cutler, however, did give us his understated details of the extreme odiousness of Jordan’s character, the details of which could be made of great value in a Hollywood adaptation with Jordan as an ultimate fiend, as a spokesperson for eugenics, and organizing and covering up murder. The dialogue that Cutler has provided for Jordan is priceless for its exemplary and ultimate expressions of “human” evil. But Jordan is in the end rather pathetic with his disgusting academic frauds of eugenics, although those were magnified to the horrifying extreme with Nazi eugenics – not that Jordan and his apostles of that diabolic creed didn’t try to do equal things first in the U.S. In that they proved to be amateurs to Hitler, but Jordan gave Hitler the eugenics “blueprints” for doing what he did.

With Darius Og. - den Mills we have found the veritable Darth Vader responsible for dreaming up the whole timeline of depravity, murders, and all else, and then for financing it, at least on the ground in California and Hawaii. But much of the higher Stanford administration immediately knew who he was back in 1983 as soon as they read Sylvester’s Memo. That’s one reason why Sylvester and much of the upper Stanford administration was panicking and desperate, all the way from 1983up to the Utah Court Frauds in 1993 to destroy Banner International and steal its Requa/Hoover Files. It is clear that some at Stanford had jumped into bed with various syndicates of organized crime; clear why Sylvester was panicking in 1997 and telling people I was obsessed with Jane Stanford’s death and should be ignored. But unbeknownst to me at that time, what Sylvester and senior Stanford administrators were really panicking about – and trying to destroy me for – what I might reveal about Darius Ogden Mills. He was the “Founder” of the present Stanford University in 1905 after he organized and paid for the murders of Jane Stanford and Isaac Requa, while lining Jordan up with the Rockefellers and Rothschilds and Teddy Roosevelt. He had been doing high-level banking business for more than 20 years with the Rothschilds; and, most of all with Harriman and the Rothschilds he wanted Isaac Requa’s Central Pacific Railroad to merge with their Southern Pacific Railroad. Darius Ogden Mills is indeed the Darth Vader of our story, with whose exposures we may now bring down the Evil Empire – while we restore the authentic Stanford University as founded by Leland and Jane Stanford back in 1885 to its rightful status before they murdered Jane to steal it – or rather they murdered Jane Stanford to keep what they had already just stolen, as Professor Julius Goebel has clarified to us from 1904.

Cutler, M.D. This volume is dedicated to that wonderful human being; to bringing his spirit and his work to life again and enable him to say publically the things he said privately to me in his many emails.

In his memo Sylvester brought up the issues that I had reported to him after returning to campus from Hawaii, where I had discussed the matter with historian Robert Van Dyke. Cutler tracked me down on the Web and we began an intensive, almost daily, e-mail exchange for about two years. My intensive three year exchanges with Dr. Cutler began on July 29, 2001, starting first, with issues about Peter Sylves-ter who had written the Memorandum of 1983 that Cutler had found in Stanford University Archives.

Robert Van Dyke, the subject of that memorandum, was our second concern. He had made the allegations about his evidence for David Starr Jordan and Darius Ogden Mills being behind the poisoning of Jane Stanford in Honolulu. Our third set of initial concerns was with the mechanics of the poisoning in Hawaii. On September 13, 2002, I got word (below) from Cutler that he had signed the contract with Stanford University Press to publish the book that had thus evolved. I could hardly believe it! I had given the chance of it being published at Stanford as almost nil. But I got the surprise of a lifetime with this: Last evening, Norris Pope, Editor in Chief of SU Press called me to apologize for the long delays and to inform me that my book has been approved for publication (contract still on the way – people on vacation). But it is definitely a GO. The marketing folks think the market may be restricted to the Stanford community (quite large in my view), and they are going to publish it as a cloth covered hardback in the scholarly work category. Pope thinks the market is bigger and is happy to re-issue as a trade paperback if he is proven correct. My delivery date is Sept. 15 which I can easily meet. I still know nothing about film rights, etc., but of course I haven’t signed anything. I read your new chapter and found it very interesting. I’ve been meaning to reply but have been very busy lately. I’d like to read the chapter again and see if I can have anything more or less well informed to say. Has the Press made any further communication? Otherwise, any sign of the Men in Black from the Office of Development? finding time to work on your book – getting our two books out in the same time frame could be mutually beneficial. I have not heard from the Press, and I have given myself till the end of the month before I contact my friend C– to see what he can learn. The book could well be making some Stanford folk nervous, or perhaps, like all publishing companies they are just slow.

Heretofore, Stanford Press has published “field-related” scholarly books only. Now they need to have a line the purpose of which is to make them money, and I think my book falls into that category. For that reason, I believe runs and promotion will be executed for their advantage (and ultimately mine). We’ll see. In the meantime, I am working on an extra chapter which I know will be wanted by the Press – on the case of Professor Ross. It was the mismanagement of Jordan’s firing of Professor Ross that started the serious rift between Mrs. Stanford and Jordan. I am amazed about the Editor wanting to publish the book, considering the powerful spin doctors and fund raisers at Stanford, who would like to see this issue buried forever. It’s a testament to your medical acumen, clear thinking, judicious approach, restraint, and comprehensive research. Sylvester, who was ridiculing the idea in 1993 and using the issue to discredit me (for ulterior motives of the Office of Development and some of their donors who were involved in the schemes against Banner) will be pretty red-faced soon, as in bright red. Good to hear from you. I hope your financial ventures are proceeding satisfactorily. Has your writing been put on hold by these necessary activities? My son, Aaron, was happy to do the library work and wants no remuneration. Arsenic is cumulative and can poison over a long period, but it produces a severe peripheral neuropathy and a characteristic skin rash resembling a pattern of rain droplets on dusty skin. The forensic pathologist gave my manuscript a thumbs up and a strong recommendation to publish. I just learned this about two weeks ago. We now await a review by “a Stanford historian” which should be forthcoming soon. The Editor of the Press says he wants to publish my book. Hopefully, it won’t get scuttled, but if it is, you warned me. I would like to get this done with soon. Hope everything is well. Prior to these exchanges Cutler and I had been focusing on the more serious factual issues of the poisoning details per se in Hawaii and on the various issues of Robert Van Dyke. Cutler wondered how Van Dyke had been onto the case to start with. By July 2002, Cutler had ascertained the probability behind that as he wrote: I have long wondered why Van Dyke would have regaled you with stories of Mrs. Stanford’s death in 1983, nearly 80 years after the event", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:11:7feca6d3a140", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 12, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "Cutler and I had been focusing on the more serious factual issues of the poisoning details per se in Hawaii and on the various issues of Robert Van Dyke.

As far as I knew, it was not the talk of the town for all of those years. I have recently learned, however, that an article published in the obscure journal, Pacific Historian, by Gary Ogle in 1981 (the first to conclude poisoning and to expose Jordan’s cover-up) was reprinted in the Pacific Commercial Advertiser in Honolulu on July 27, 1981, complete with pictures and old headlines. Possibly that is what piqued Van Dyke’s interest. Just a cautionary note again to advise that you tell as few people as possible about your manuscript or any publishing intentions. Obviously Sylvester was trying to curry favor with the University over this, and other people would be inclined to do the same. Another reason for getting it published outside the US and far away from Stanford. Regards, I have received the necessary permission and now attach (hopefully) the memo on the Van Dyke matter. My equipment is antiquated and I see the copier has dropped characters and distorted fonts. But I think it’s readable. My Honolulu contact is away so I have nothing to report on the Van Dyke collection, or the man himself. I certainly don’t mistrust your use of my manuscript and will send it to you fairly soon. I am awaiting a couple of pieces of information that will allow me to finish it. I warn you there is a bit of medicine in it, but I don’t think it is overwhelming. Give me another month, or longer if we find the Van Dyke files. Your hurdle is to get it out in print, independently, without people making problems for you – which they WILL do, just to curry favor with whomever they can rile up in the University against you. That is what it appears Sylvester perhaps did to me – in alliance with those whom I was about to expose in some serious violations of securities laws. But as time has proved, behind it was much more than securities laws violations. It was about issues at the very jugular of Stanford University ever since it was taken over by a coup in 1905, under whom in very important respects it has remained subservient as exemplified by Condoleezza Rice, a Stanford mentor and proponent of Bush’s war-profiteering agendas.

Along with a “cover up,” which called the poisoning “heart disease,” which almost everyone knew was a transparent lie, but everyone sat still for. They knew they weren’t really fooling anyone; they intimidated them into silence. Glad to hear from you. I hope your major strides include the many endeavors in which you are engaged, including, of course, your book. I am still working on mine, mostly digesting newspaper accounts at present. Here’s the status on Van Dyke (from whom I have never heard): He sold his collection of photographs and historical documents to the Bishop Estate in 1996 for $422, 831 . A Bishop librarian, Sigrid Southworth spent about 7 months sorting through the stuff, and an attorney, Albert Jeremiah spent further months finishing an inventory. Southworth does not remember encountering anything about Mrs. Stanford. I have written to Jeremiah but have not had a response. So, we’ll see, and I’ll certainly keep you posted. I hope when I receive a bit more outstanding information to be able to close this project. I fear you will find it a bit dull compared to your own project. If nothing else, I hope it sets the record straight that Mrs. Stanford was murdered and that Jordan was not the hero Stanford made of him, at least in this case. I have essentially completed my small book. It is a factual account and shows the efforts taken by Jordan to cover things up. It includes some speculation as to why. I find I cannot bring myself to say he was covering his own ass, but readers can draw inferences. In doing some final editing today, it occurred to me the inferences could be more obvious if I could make some sort of reference to your book. I wondered how the attached endnote strikes you. If you do not approve, please do not hesitate to tell me. I do not want to steal your thunder, but on the other hand, if Stanford would publish my book, it would call attention to yours.

If you do A week later I received an email that included leads that ten years later would be vital in my understanding, especially about Darius Ogden Mills and Whitelaw Reid. Giving credence to Van Dyke’s claims, Cutler noted that Darius Ogden Mill was “in town” and at Stanford at that time, but he didn’t “know why.” Cutler speculated on a connection between Mills and the Requas at that time, and in fact Mills had financed the Eureka Palisade Railroad with Isaac Requa. Mills had been the richest man in California until he moved to New York City, where he became father-in-law of Whitelaw Reid. I posited, later, that Reid and Mills had hopped a train in New York making a bee-line to Stanford – arriving just in time for Jane Stanford’s demise to be announced. Cutler mentions Reid serving “later [as] Ambassador to England.” I was to ascertain, that “later” was just a few days later. Reid was appointed ambassador on March 8, 1905, the day before the Inquest and Coroner’s Verdict of death by strychnine had been announced in Hawaii. I feel that was the last day his appointment could have been made in light of the circumstances, Reid being the “executor” to a woman who the next day would be adjudicated having been murdered. No evidence has been found as to how or why Reid might genuinely have been Jane Stanford’s executor. He lived 3,000 miles away, and there is no record of them ever having met. Unlike Whitelaw Reid, Timothy Hopkins, a Stanford University trustee, accompanied Jordan to Hawaii to recover Mrs. Stanford’s body. While he was there the Honolulu newspapers, as covered in Cutler’s book, reported that Hopkins tried to bribe the autopsy doctors and toxicologists into dropping their verdict of strychnine poisoning. I have a copy of the Stanford will. Two million in trust to one of her brothers, one million to another, various sums to charities, $15k to Berner and $1k to various servants. Residue, including jewels, paintings, object d’arts, etc. to Stanford trustees. What I don’t know is what the residue amounted to, but I doubt if it was more than $1 − 2 million. Most of the Stanford endowment had been established in 1903. I don’t believe there would have been any financial incentive here for Jordan. Some relatives on Leland’s side were interviewed by reporters (I don’t have exactly who at my fingertips) and were said to have no resentment that they were not remembered in the will.

Some relatives on Leland’s side were interviewed by reporters (I don’t have exactly who at my fingertips) and were said to have no resentment that they were not remembered in the will. Darius Ogden Mills was an early banking, railroad, mining tycoon friend of Leland (and possibly the Requas) – started the Bank of California and the town of Milbrae. He lived in NY, and I don’t know why he was in town around the time of Mrs. Stanford’s death save that he had a mansion in Milbrae. He died a few years later. Whitelaw Reid was Mill’s son-in-law. He was the editor of the NY Tribune, later Ambassador to England, and a trustee of SU. Timothy Hopkins was adopted son of Mark Hopkins. His adopted mother, on the death of her husband, married a man about 20-25 years her junior. When she died, new husband got her money. Hopkins contested the will and won a good sum. Do you recall exactly the circumstances of your meeting Van Dyke and why he chose to tell you this stuff? As I think I must have mentioned (my memory could be better), he did sell a collection of material to the Bishop School through a private deal with one of the trustees. It has been in the courts for years, because the rest of the trustees had turned him down. I have correspondence that a librarian at the Bishop Schools worked on the collection for nine months. She saw nothing pertaining to Mrs. Stanford. An attorney was hired to complete the inventory. I corresponded with him and received no response. There is a lot of controversy about the Van Dyke collection and about Van Dyke himself. A few days later Cutler wrote about one of the most important issues: where the strychnine in the bicarbonate of soda had come from. Did it arrive with the bicarbonate from California? Was it put into the bicarbonate in Hawaii, or was the bicarbonate purchased in Hawaii and delivered with the strychnine added? Van Dyke had stated that a boy in Hawaii had delivered it from a pharmacy. If so, the strychnine came from Hawaii. It was crucial, however, for Jordan and Berner to maintain that the bicarbonate came from San Francisco and that the strychnine had thus had its origin there. This was of significant importance in getting the police investigation focused not on Hawaii (less corruptible to them), but on San Francisco where Darius Ogden Mills was on hand with plentiful money to corrupt and stifle any competent investigation.

Van Dyke through his own investigation in Hawaii alleging Darius Ogden Mills as a conspirator gives credibility to the rest of Cutler’s assertions. How would he have determined this, or even thought of it, from Hawaii? Mills must have left some “footprints” with the people in Hawaii. Was Mills the paymaster? Was his purpose in going to California and Stanford to be the money man to bribe away any loose ends? To arrange the bribes required to accomplish the poisoning of Isaac Requa two days after Jane Stanford’s funeral? These issues are reflected in Cutler‘s email: Neither Berner nor Hunt testified about where the bicarbonate was purchased. They said it came with them packed in Stanford’s favorite refillable bottle. A Palo Alto pharmacist disclosed in early March that he had sold it to them a week or so before they left. He was told they had a bottle to put it in and sold them a packet. The bottle of bicarbonate sat in an open room for nearly a week before they left. The room was accessible to all the servants (and probably others). The toxicologists measured the strychnine content in five capsules of cascara that they combined. Of course, if Berner put the capsule on the dresser, she could have The Cliff-Hanger with Stanford University Press pulled one from her pocket. But in my opinion, the bicarb had enough to kill an elderly person. The bottle containing the cascara capsules had an original prescription date of 1901 if I recall. The Honolulu newspapers reported that early in their investigation the police checked for strychnine sales in Honolulu. Remember, the Poland water contained nux vomica, the bicarb. pure strychnine. Berner certainly changed her story over time, but I think she did that in travel tales as well. I am told her accounts of Mrs. Stanford are not thought to be very accurate. I won’t disclose either the memo or you to anyone. Some time ago, I inquired of former SU Archivist Nilan (top of memo) to see if she had followed up on the Sylvester memo copied to her. She said she had not, but she also added that Van Dyke had visited the Stanford archives (she did not remember just when)… Why would he have visited Stanford do you suppose? I still think he’s our key. Maybe he would respond to a letter from you. I have his address as: — —. He never answered but neither was my letter returned.

That could be an important clue! … I did very much get the feeling that he was sincere and his evidence probably authentic. What he said rang true. About the bicarb bought in Palo Alto, I suppose there could have been any number of reasons why Mrs. Stanford might have wanted a new supply. It might have got lost or spilled. And, of course, maybe she got worried about it after the Poland water. If I had just been poisoned I would start suspecting anything and everything that I was consuming. Was it only Berner that testified to the bicarb being on a table for a long time? If Van Dyke’s evidence is authentic then Mrs. Stanford, or Berner, probably ordered some bicarb, and someone knew what was transpiring and was ready to intercept the delivery [as per the boy’s testimony to Van Dyke]. Very frustrating to know that there was a murder and the solution to it is so evasive. In 1983 he certainly seemed thoughtful and sensible and since he never got in touch with me again I presume he had no particular ulterior motive then regarding myself. Maybe after the funding here is completed we can send someone over to Honolulu to see if they can prompt and/or assist him with his “warehouses” of documentation. Well, I just spoke with Van Dyke for about half an hour. His number is 808-XXX-XXXX It’s listed under − − − − –. He’s obviously a wealth of information. The boy who was allegedly involved in the poisoning was the son of one of the ladies who worked at the Moana. The letter of Jordan was to Nathaniel B. Emerson, a police surgeon whose diary had six pages torn out corresponding to the Stanford investigation. Jordan’s letter to him thanked him for his cooperation and keeping certain things confidential. Unfortunately, Van Dyke returned that letter to the family and he doesn’t have a copy. You can assess what he has to say far better than can I. He recalls getting two letters (presumably from you) but was unsure whether the requests for information were for friendly purposes. I doubt very much, based on our conversation, that he has been influenced to sit on things. I think if anything, he’s concerned about his own safety. He got a lot of negative reactions to his investigations. He thinks Berner was probably influenced as well as some other male", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:17:538b9cee2fc6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 18, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "assess what he has to say far better than can I.

He got a lot of negative reactions to his investigations. He thinks Berner was probably influenced as well as some other male companion (?) of Mrs. Stanford’s party. Van Dyke, in pointing to Darius Ogden Mills being a key conspirator, gives much credibility to his other assertions. Van Dyke did not know, as Cutler had found out, that Mills was “in town” when Jane was reported dead, and thus Van Dyke must have had other reasons for Mills to be involved, reasons he could only have found out in context of his other discoveries in Hawaii. We must thus also concur with Van Dyke in context of the broad conspiracy now evident in both Hawaii and in California that the strychnine did originate in Hawaii and that it was simply placed into the different batch of bicarbonate that the boy reportedly had delivered to Berner. The Hawaii strychnine was pure strychnine, not nux vomica as had contaminated the Poland Water, so it was not from the same batch of poison. It could also only have been delivered to Berner at the Moana Hotel with careful arrangement so that she alone, without being seen, would take delivery of it. Van Dyke’s comments in Hawaii and later by phone seem to make one thing clear. He was receiving a lot “of negative response” to his investigation. This could only have come from someone who knew about the conspiracy and knew the scale of the conspiracy – that Darius Ogden Mills was involved. Was Van Dyke’s revelations about Mills behind his receiving intense negative reactions? It also appears very noteworthy that the six pages of journal that disappeared were from the police surgeon’s diary, along with the letter the surgeon had received from Jordan giving him some sort of thanks. Van Dyke may have found some fantastic evidence from among his old money friends, which then led to all the other evidence he tracked down. Not only was Van Dyke’s investigation the object of some negative pressure, but the statement in 1983 that his mother’s approval was necessary is also indicative. These things had been found out through their joint “old money” circle of long-time friends. In fact, Van Dyke’s interest in 1983 was to leave the Islands. He appears to have wanted to make a splash and then disappear to parts unknown. First, he wanted to sell his manuscript, “Murder at the Moana” as the basis for a TV series. He may have sought to do so and got another “negative” reaction.

He may have sought to do so and got another “negative” reaction. So Van Dyke was certainly stalled after 1983. Interestingly, Stanford University did not contact Van Dyke after my disclosures to Sylvester – he wrote a memo. Did the Stanford administration know that Jane Stanford was poisoned and continue the over-a-century-long cover-up? Even in his memorandum Sylvester referred to “the poisoning” of Jane Stanford, not to a “reported” or “alleged” one, but to “the” poisoning. He also wrote that it is hard to imagine that Van Dyke had come up with “something new.” Did Sylvester, along with all other recipients of his memo, ascertain that he had come up with something, perhaps not “new,” but something old and real? Obviously then, they were not going to send some Stanford hack around to see Van Dyke. What they appear to have done was to ascertain the exact source(s) Van Dyke had developed and would have put pressure on them – to put that pressure on Van Dyke to desist. Van Dyke did not sell his manuscript for a TV series and stayed in Honolulu; and, later, when he did try to sell his historical collection for almost half-a-million dollars he encountered problems. Possibly, “they” did not want him to have funds. Van Dyke having had a “lot of controversy generated around him,” as Cutler reported to be the case, is just what one can expect. He apparently went to Stanford, possibly to get more supportive evidence. But then, in the intervening years, he had three heart attacks. When I called out of the blue eighteen years after meeting him he was, however, still fresh and related the same account he had given me in 1983, plus some additional details. But then, as he contemplated a call from Cutler he would perhaps have done so with trepidation, given all the “controversy” and negative reactions that had accumulated since 1983. After my email about my conversation with Van Dyke, Cutler then also called him. His full email concerning that call should not be detailed for now, but the following was included: Good news about your financial support re mining. I hope it concludes well. My guess about Van Dyke is that your social portrayal is correct.… He told me that he had no idea where the affidavit was.

I think he said he might try to find his manuscript but not with great promise. [He seems to have retracted his certainty of being able to do so after my call]. Yet he was so quick to tell me that he had shown it to a rare book dealer, that I think he has some jottings that may or may not have been polished into a manuscript. Whether this man actually frightened him, I’m not sure. To be able to answer our questions with such facility implies to me that he had given the case more than casual thought. On the Emerson family: he told me the doctor had one son, the one who showed him the journal, who is dead. He said there were no direct descendants. I completely forgot about Darius Mills (who would also figure into Isaac Requa’s story perhaps) and failed to ask him. If you are going to ask him all of those things, ask him about his sale to the Bishop Estate and whether he thinks the missing items might be in that collection. That would give us something to pressure attorney Jeremiah with. I’ll let you know when I hear from SU Libraries. This fitted my own assessment of Van Dyke. He had at one time had this manuscript, and probably still did as he had told me days before, and maybe the affidavit too, and possibly had the items relative to Emerson, and all the other items he had been attentively collecting since. I missed an opportunity to quiz Van Dyke further. But this was just at the time Cutler was getting approvals from the Stanford Press. It was too late for its pending publication to attempt to resurrect Van Dyke’s collection, and it did appear that he had had some considerable negative pressures put on him in a number of ways. The “steam” seemed to have gone out of his fervor since 1983, when he told me his objective was to “vindicate” Jane Stanford. This, however, continues to be a renewed objective, now given new and much greater life with Robert Cutler’s book. Thanks to him we know with certainty that Jane Stanford was murdered and we have a panorama of the evidence for David Starr Jordan’s heretofore unimaginable evils, unimaginable perhaps to many of today’s readers, but observed day-by-day by many before and after 1905.

GREAT FIND! I have never seen that website. The “myth” of Mrs. Stanford’s death clearly includes your information to Sylvester – almost verbatim from his memo. The “truth” part clearly (to me also) shows Stanford continues to cover it up through its undying worship of Jordan. You need to get this in the last chapter of your book! I venture to say that at that late date, ten years after my Banner International company had been destroyed and had its assets stolen in Utah in 1993, the website was still there because they were worried I would figure out that there were connections between the crimes. It was still there to counter the allegations about the 1905 murder. They were very worried that the truth might be infectious. Anyway, I hadn’t told “the Legend” to anybody else except Peter Sylvester. They were concerned that I, or anybody else that I might have told, would have finally figured out their secrets, including, as Cutler saw, that my great-grandfather Isaac Requa was the obvious second victim – poisoned only a couple of days after Jane Stanford’s funeral. There my grandfather would have encountered all the murderers. Isaac was poisoned at lunch at the Pacific Union Club. According to an account of it written by my grandfather, Mark Requa, it was a second attempt on Isaac – the first coinciding with the first one on Jane. Some at Stanford already knew full well that Jane Stanford had indeed been murdered. They just didn’t want it made public. The Death of Jane Stanford: The Legend “While on vacation in Honolulu, Mrs. Stanford staggered out into the hall of her hotel and announced that she had been poisoned, after which she collapsed and died. The evidence proving that she was poisoned includes a signed statement from an old man who had been a boy at the time of Mrs. Stanford’s death. He stated that he had been delivering something to her from a pharmacy and that he had been asked to have it laced with what turned out to be the poison that killed her. “The primary culprit of the tremendous crime was David Starr Jordan, the founding president of the University! The evidence that supports this theory includes a thank you note from Jordan to some of her relatives for assisting in her untimely death. Jordan also had a motive – the University, under the leadership of Jordan, would receive all of Jane Stanford’s remaining wealth upon her death.

Mrs. Stanford and Jordan were in dispute about how the University’s money should be spent. Jane wanted to build more buildings and Jordan wanted to establish a more prominent faculty. “Lastly, there was a multifaceted cover-up that supposedly extends even to the current administration. Jordan apparently leaned on the San Francisco Police to obstruct an investigation of what the post mortem physicians, the toxicologist, and the coroner’s jury in Honolulu had ruled a murder. The persistent cover-up of the administration that extends to the present is regarded as a face-saving measure. This seemed to be critical. Stanford’s exercise in public relations and spin was made with direct reference to the things I had told Sylvester. What else had they been doing? As Cutler stated well, Stanford University did indeed worship David Starr Jordan in a very real sense (the same way that the FBI is still worshiping J. Edgar Hoover with their building in his name). For Stanford administration flatfoots, the cult of Jordan, and the whole Stanford founding myth with its revered notion of the university’s on-going sanctity and purity, are just like the way some equate God with country, and patriotism with blind, subservient loyalty. The methods that David Starr Jordan used to suppress the reality and the truth were the same that Stanford used against me. Jordan viciously slandered the credible medical authorities who attended Mrs Stanford and performed the autopsy and toxicology. A report issued by the executors of Mrs Stanford’s estate claimed that her internal organs had subsequently undergone thorough study in Stanford university laboratories and that no strychnine had been found. This acquired the status of a second autopsy, and the case was “closed.” The New York Times then issued a statement attributed to David Starr Jordan: “A post-mortem examination [at Stanford University] showed that the aorta had been ruptured … as the result of fatty degeneration of the heart.” The irrefutable fact is that there never was an examination of any internal organs which would physiologically concentrate strychnine at Stanford, or a post-mortem examination. Only one autopsy was possible because, as we Dr. Cutler noted, most of the internal organs had been examined, chopped up, liquefied, chem- ically tested for strychnine then disposed of in Hawaii. Jane’s remains had been buried and nothing but the previously dissected brain and heart (fixed in preservative) were left for Stanford.

Had the aorta – the major large vessel carrying blood from the heart – indeed ruptured, the thorax or abdominal cavity would have filled with blood and become apparent to all of the seven doctors present at the Hawaii autopsy when the chest and abdomen were cut open. A first year medical student could not fail to miss it. This wasn’t mere spin from Jordan; it was an outrageous lie and a dreadful slur on the professionalism and competence of the Hawaii doctors. When the heart was dissected and carefully examined at the autopsy in Hawaii, a few insignificant fatty changes were found in the left ventricle, valves and aorta, and some “whitish opaque areas” and “fatty infiltration of the muscle.” These are exceedingly common if not the norm for any person of that age. Dr Wood, the pathologist, reported that the organ was not enlarged and “all the valves of the heart and vessels competent.” In other words, there was no evidence of a recent coronary thrombosis which may have led to a heart attack, and certainly no sign of any rupture of the aorta. Medical staff at Stanford would have realized just how ridiculous Jordan’s statement to the Press was, and the official line was adjusted to the somewhat less egregious lie of death “most probably” due to “chronic myocarditis.” That was the myth and the legend (really, the blatant lie) that has persisted from 1905 to the present. It was a pure hoax perpetuated by Jordan and others using the power and prestige of the University to back them up, along with Roosevelt as President, and to browbeat the public and police. As Cutler documented, Jordan would continue for twenty years to repeatedly and maliciously degrade those doctors. Meanwhile, Dr Waterhouse, a young doctor he bribed in Honolulu in 1905 to write a report stating that there had not been “one characteristic sign of strychnine poisoning,” was ostracized by his fellow medical professionals and died penniless in a skid row hotel in San Francisco. Before his death, Dr Waterhouse admitted that he had been directed to write the report having never seen Jane Stanford. Those Jordan had libeled, on the other hand, all led very respected professional careers. Stanford are still involved in the cover-up.

He found these the most compelling things of all, and Stanford clearly recognized that others would also find them compelling if I were to take any initiative to develop them. That, however, was something I had given no thought to whatsoever after meeting Van Dyke in Hawaii back in 1983, nor throughout the following decade and more. A damning piece by another academic sleuth, recently published in the American Scholar, sidles a little closer to an answer. W.B. Carnochan, a Stanford humanities professor emeritus, details Jordan’s firing of Julius Goebel – a German professor who was closely allied with Stanford. Stanford was intent on firing Jordan when she died, Carnochan says. The timing of Goebel’s firing – set in motion just days after the first poisoning – suggests that Jordan may have known Stanford’s days were numbered. To be sure, Stanford University and others were worried from 1983 onward that I was thus a great risk. But I had no clue about any of this. I didn’t even start to think about it until I heard all the gross libels about me that Sylvester and other Stanford people were making in 1997 and afterwards, and that they had done starting with the Utah Court Frauds in 1993. were making sure those bits of information were made very difficult, or impossible, for me to follow up and further develop. That’s especially what the court fraud in Utah did in 1993, to basically confiscate all my assets. They did not want me to expand upon who were, and why those conspirators had murdered Jane Stanford, and then stole her university. It was strange that all the people since 1905 were just not getting it, that the whole motive (with just murdering Jane per se) was indeed that: to steal the whole university once and for all. I was pleased to learn that the manuscripts had arrived. Your final opinion will be of great interest to me. I have sent the manuscript to six people at Stanford – physicians and historians – whose opinions I also will respect, and they will be discrete I’m sure. I learned from one just today that his article on Jordan’s treatment of Julius Goebel, which further substantiates Jordan’s egregious and perhaps sinister behavior, has been accepted for publication in American Scholar.

I appreciate your thoughts on all of this. Requa, and contemplating a film treatment. Carnochan, through Cutler, would supply the information which, now, indicates just exactly what was so hot then about Jane Stanford’s murder – Jordan and Bertha Berner. And remains just as hot today. It was indicated by Professor Julius Goebel and his communications with Jane Stanford in 1904-1905. Some excerpts from letters by Professor Goebel to Jane Stanford include these: Events, such as the Gilbert affair, which called for concerted action for the purpose of “whitewashing” one of their members brought the [Jordan] “clique” together still closer.… For there are men at this University who are entirely out of place in an institution like ours. They are kept here, as I know on good authority, solely for the purpose of doing the detestable work of detectives among the students and faculty. As Carnochan has written, Goebel contended that after receiving his letter Mrs. Stanford intended to look into a number of controversial matters more carefully and to reinvestigate the Professor Gilbert sex scandal. The latter, writes Carnochan, “especially seemed to have aroused all the wrath of which, she as a virtuous woman and founder of a co-educational institution, was capable of. These matters had now led her to contemplate the final remedy … the removal of the President.” Mrs Stanford’s secretary, and David Starr Jordan’s secret lover, Bertha Berner, had notified Jordan of this right away. Indeed, she had been notifying him of everything, including Jane’s feud with Collis Huntington, multi-millionaire, one of the ‘Big Four’ in railroads in the west and president of the Southern Pacific. In addition to the theft of the university this was possibly a crucial factor in Jane’s demise, just as it definitely was in that of her close family friend and fellow murder victim, Isaac Requa. It is most likely that Jordan was in tow with Huntington and with E. H. Harriman. Harriman was a stockbroker who had gained control of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1898 and Huntingdon’s Southern Pacific in 1902 with credit from his close associate, J. D. Rockefeller. Determined to gain a total monopoly of all America’s great railroads, they set out to grab control of my great-grandfather Isaac Requa’s Central Pacific with its 421 locomotives, 8,000 freight cars and thousands of miles of track. Like Harriman, David Starr Jordan Isaac Requa", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:25:ff95e4122215", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 26, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 26, "text": "Huntington and with E.

Like Harriman, David Starr Jordan Isaac Requa was also the only one with the great wealth and clout to take these conspirators to the mat over Jane’s murder, as they no doubt realized when they all attended her funeral. Two days was about as long as they could leave it till Isaac’s lunch at the Pacific Union Club was laced with poison. The Ross affair concerned the firing of Professor Ross, at the insistence of Mrs Stanford, for extreme racist political remarks in public speeches in which he had referred to immigrants, such as the Chinese, as sub-humans. The significance of these factors quoted by Carnochan of Professor Goebel was not immediately apparent, the time frame concerned having been 1905. But this significance would start to become clear after 2010 when a re-invigoration of the original Stanford-based libel campaign against myself began anew while I was in Honduras. I then knew that the Stanford issues had to be got to the bottom of. Many of those conspiring against Jane Stanford or knowledgeable about her poisoning were fanatical eugenicists/ racists of the most embarrassingly rabid proportions ever allowed in the public sphere. David Starr Jordan, President of Stanford University, led the way in 1902, announcing racist/eugenicist principles in publishing Blood of a Nation in which he stated that, “The pauper is the victim of heredity, but neither Nature nor Society recognizes that as an excuse for his existence.” He could have interchanged (and did many times to come) several other words for pauper that his own unique evolving vocabulary and scientific terminology were producing, such as the unfit, degenerates, the feeble-minded, and those of inferior stock or, as Prof. Eduard Ross of Stanford had also been stating it at that time, the sub-humans for whom neither he nor Jordan believed had available from Nature or Society any excuses for their existence. Prof. Eduard A. Ross, allied at Stanford with Jordan, was an early supporter of the “Race Suicide” doctrine, and expressed his hatred of other races in strong and crude language in public speeches. Indeed, he objected to Chinese immigrant labor (on both economic and racial grounds). This position was at odds with the university’s founding family, the Stanfords, who had made their fortune in Western rail construction – a major employer of Chinese laborers. This was too much for Jane Stanford, who fired him in 1900. One of the most widely read books on the Race Suicide", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:26:d587851c7260", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 27, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "doctrine, and expressed his hatred of other races in strong and crude language in public speeches.

This position was at odds with the university’s founding family, the Stanfords, who had made their fortune in Western rail construction – a major employer of Chinese laborers. This was too much for Jane Stanford, who fired him in 1900. One of the most widely read books on the Race Suicide issue was The Old World in the New, by Ross. He believed in the conventional myth of Nordic supremacy and the need for a program of positive eugenics in order to preserve Anglo-Saxon Americanism against pollution through immigration with a chapter showing how “Immigrant Blood” was slowly polluting the purer “American Blood.” Obsessed with race, Ross was convinced that “the blood being injected into the veins of our people was sub-human”; the newer immigrants were “morally below the races of northern Europe”; and that it all would end in “Race Suicide.” Did he determine in his Stanford laboratory, with or without Jordan, which racial samples of blood were morally below or above any of the others? In any event, Jane Stanford had Ross, a Jordan protégé, fired for these expressed sentiments. Another key member of the front-line group of conspirators involved in Jane Stanford’s murder was Whitelaw Reid. He was owner-publisher of the New York Tribune, the largest U.S. newspaper, and the political “voice” of Roosevelt and the Republican Party. Reid was (supposedly) both an Executor of Jane Stanford’s Estate and a University Trustee. His father-in-law was also Darius Ogden Mills, formerly California’s richest man before Mills’ daughter married Reid and they moved to New York City. Reid was a staunch White-Supremacist in no uncertain political and rhetorical terms in his newspaper editorials – also warning in “Race Suicide” jargon of the impending “calamity” from an influx, for example, of Puerto Rican “inferior mixed-race blood.” The enemy, he wrote, (the Puerto Rican mixed-breed and half-savages) were at “the gate” ready to “breach the citadel.” Thus, when the need to eliminate Jane Stanford arose in 1905 before she could fire Jordan, this circle of virulent racist opportunists closed ranks. Reid exerted his Executor duties immediately to seize all of Jane´s President Theodore Roosevelt, an already notorious racist of frequent crude racial epithets, was magnetized by Ross’ and Jordan’s “Race Suicide” doctrine. TR made Race Suicide into a fullbore Republican political campaign slogan by 1903. He continued to correspond about these matters with Ross long after Ross’ firing and was already on close terms with Jordan by 1902 (as seen in letters), when Jordan published his Blood of a Nation tract. Jordan had already been pandering for years to large money interests hostile to Jane Stanford (e.g. railroad magnate Collis Huntington, President of Southern Pacific Railroad) with whom both Stanfords had been", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:27:85be8b33150f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 28, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "TR made Race Suicide into a fullbore Republican political campaign slogan by 1903.

Jordan had already been pandering for years to large money interests hostile to Jane Stanford (e.g. railroad magnate Collis Huntington, President of Southern Pacific Railroad) with whom both Stanfords had been feuding bitterly and publicly through the 1890s surrounding Central Pacific matters). Since the firing of Professor Ross in 1900, it may be deemed certain that Jordan was evolving contingency plans to avert, by any means possible, that fate for himself. He thus laid plans, if need be, to eliminate Jane Stanford and to seize full control of the University. There was also the factor of the racist fervor around David Starr Jordan’s and Eduard Ross’ pseudo-science racist eugenics. A planned push to enact forced sterilization and mixed-race marriage bans legislation was at stake in 27 states, starting most critically in 1905, just as Jane was deciding to fire Jordan. Thus Jane had to go. It was essential to preserve Jordan´s pulpit where his reasons or recognitions (or not) for excuses for existence could simply be declared and promulgated ex cathedra by Jordan for the foundations with the big money, and then for Legislators and Legislatures across the country – no questions asked (unless Jordan was fired). In 1901, the zoologist Charles Henry Gilbert, who had studied with Jordan at Indiana and was now one of his close associates – had been charged with carrying on an improper relationship with a young woman working at the library. Jordan, in Goebel’s account, had bullied an “innocent young man” (then an assistant librarian, and a Stanford graduate) who blew the whistle on Gilbert, threatening him with “incarceration in the insane asylum for sexual perversity … if he did not leave California at once.” Though the press got hold of the allegations, Jordan and his supporters were apparently successful in performing the “whitewashing” to which Goebel refers [in letters to Jane Stanford]. Per Carnochan, Goebel contended that Mrs. Stanford intended to look into a number of controversial matters more carefully and to reinvestigate the Gilbert scandal. The latter, especially, seemed to have aroused her wrath. These matters had led her to contemplate “the final remedy … the removal of the President.” In sum, to insure Jordan’s tenure as a stooge of higher interests, what actually precipitated Jane Stanford’s murder was an emergency: her threat to remove Jordan over a sex scandal involving his cohort Professor Gilbert, who may have also been able to blackmail Jordan by disclosing his affair with Bertha Berner and that Jordan was paying her to spy on Jane Stanford. The clincher evidence is in a letter Professor Goebel wrote to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:28:3a4f53891043", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 29, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 29, "text": "remedy … the removal of the President.” In sum, to insure Jordan’s tenure as a stooge of higher interests, what actually precipitated Jane Stanford’s murder was an emergency: her threat to remove Jordan over a sex scandal involving his cohort Professor Gilbert, who may have also been able to blackmail Jordan by disclosing his affair with Bertha Berner and that Jordan was paying her to spy on Jane Stanford. The clincher evidence is in a letter Professor Goebel wrote to Stanford Trustee Horace Davis in 1907 after he had moved on to Harvard. Dr. Goebel was unfortunately an eye-witness to some of these questionable incidents and strenuous efforts were made to induce him to declare publicly that he believed the accusation was groundless; but this he refused to do, and this refusal caused “permanent coldness between Goebel and the President’s intimates.” The Stanford campus was under surveillance. These “gangs” were professionals, in the same way CIA agents are today. Could the murder of Jane Stanford have been a well-planned contingency to insure a horrific elite eugenics agenda? With Jordan as a proponent and Stanford University as his necessary pulpit? It would also give behind-the-scenes long-term control of Stanford University. That’s about how it stacks up. The killing of Jane Stanford is perhaps the first demonstrable “coup” engineered by a U.S. President via murder. Taking over and maintaining Stanford University as a cornerstone and powerhouse for the New World Order, along with the Rockefeller Foundation may explain much surrounding the murder of Jane Stanford and the crimes against Banner International and myself. could see in 1993 that the Stanford administration was really worried about something. The Stanford police chief, as I I found out through calls made by London investigators later in 1997, had even sent out notices to faculty members in 1993− coinciding with the Utah receivership frauds against my Banner International company – about my posing some sort of a risk, a physical risk, to faculty members. It was surreal. My mailbox on campus was also closed down without any notice at the time of the receivership actions in Utah. They didn’t want me to receive the notice served on those court actions. Organized crime is all about criminals being able to utilize government agencies to channel their crimes. I discovered the truth of this during 1993, and detailed much of it in my book published in 2009. The Great American Gold Grab, was basically a 650-page affidavit on all those events. I had to detail everything I could think of while my memory was still fresh. At the time in 1993 I could imagine no direct connection between Stanford and the Utah court frauds. But with the materialization of Dr. Cutler in 2001 with the internal Stanford University Sylvester Memorandum he had found in university archives on my learning in 1983 about Jordan’s and Mills’ involvement in Jane", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:29:9445c1953216", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 30, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "Great American Gold Grab, was basically a 650-page affidavit on all those events.

But with the materialization of Dr. Cutler in 2001 with the internal Stanford University Sylvester Memorandum he had found in university archives on my learning in 1983 about Jordan’s and Mills’ involvement in Jane Stanford’s demise, there appeared to be some connection between the bizarre events at Stanford and the Utah actions. The takeover gang in Utah in 1993 had instigated the court actions and completed them within a 24-hour period – before the notice of them was even mailed to my already shut-down post office box. The instigators had very good reason for not wanting me to know about these actions for as long as possible. As my attorney, Dr. William Pepper, had assessed after I retained him in London in 1999, the receivership action had been baseless, with no legitimate legal rationale. The company had no material debt. All its essential obligations were paid a year in advance. We had $400, 000 in the checking accounts; and we were verging on great success in discovering major new gold deposits near Ely, Nevada and north of Elko. But, as I came to discover, the Stanford connection was much wider, deeper, and more complex than the superficial facts might suggest. There were many Stanford names on the Banner mailing list, including several professors. Initially, I had thought that they might have just been implicated in Vancouver and San Francisco securities rackets and that they were using their combined influence to create a smear campaign against me as a way of keeping me occupied and not able to expose it all. That seemed at the time the simplest and most obvious explanation. But, as would become apparent, that barely scratches the surface of what was going on. I had also distributed in June 1993 packets of information on the crimes in progress against my company to all the Stanford Law and Earth Sciences professors. Surely, I thought, some of those people could see that organized criminal activities were in progress and that Stanford people were implicated, even if only passively and without their being aware of it, in a substantial securities racket. I was therefore under the gross illusion that a great institution like Stanford University might actually be interested in rooting out some of its bad seeds. But as I found out, almost no one is ever interested in voluntarily rooting out anything. Rarely does anyone expose their own dirt – or anybody else’s – until forced to, like the Catholic Church over its child-molestation scandals. Things almost always remain covered up until the bitter end – especially with powerful institutions, and that includes", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:30:4ce16cd3f16a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 31, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "under the gross illusion that a great institution like Stanford University might actually be interested in rooting out some of its bad seeds.

Things almost always remain covered up until the bitter end – especially with powerful institutions, and that includes the federal government. But in 1993 it never occurred to me that Stanford might be worried about something very much worse than stock-exchange racketeering, and that because of that, they may have found some great incentive to see me and my company permanently destroyed. That “something very much worse” turned out, in the first instance, to be how and why Jane Stanford was murdered and by whom, more than 88 years earlier. My first indication of this came in 1997 in London when I prompted London media people to make calls on campus to those who had been on Banner’s mailing list. One of them was Peter Sylvester. In 1983, he had been an official in the Office of Development, the university’s fund raising office (and he would still be there in 1993). I had met Peter through my Banner company’s director and a geologist friend Joe Ash. One of the reasons I got them to call Sylvester, besides his being on the mailing list, was because of his ties with Ash, who had lived in his house as an undergraduate. I used to see Sylvester once in a while around the campus or in Palo Alto and before that at his home with Ash. I had seen him right after I had spoken with the Hawaiian historian Robert Van Dyke in 1983, and related to him Van Dyke’s comments about Jane Stanford’s 1905 murder and his compiled evidence on David Starr Jordan’s and Darius Ogden Mills’ alleged implication in it. Sylvester’s first reaction back in 1983 was to say to me, “Great, just in time to kick off the Centennial” – alluding to the big drive to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for Stanford to mark the 100th anniversary of its founding. Sylvester was seemingly quite concerned that such disclosures as Jane Stanford’s murder with the founding university President’s role in it could adversely impact his fund-raising programs. I would, however, scarcely give a thought about the issue of Jane Stanford’s murder until fourteen years later, when the London media people called Sylvester in 1997, and he launched into a phenomenal diatribe about me. He said that I was “in trouble” with my family and that I was “something of a playboy in Hawaii” When the media people weren’t buying Peter’s rap very readily, he suddenly grasped at more straws: “Oh, yes,” he said, I was “obsessed” with", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:31:84c9b5134528", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 32, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "I would, however, scarcely give a thought about the issue of Jane Stanford’s murder until fourteen years later, when the London media people called Sylvester in 1997, and he launched into a phenomenal diatribe about me.

He then added that even if it were true that Jordan had killed Mrs. Stanford, it “didn’t make any difference – not now, not at this point.” But that was not true. Stanford is still under the sway, as we shall see, of the same interests who had murdered Jane Stanford to get that control. They had to kill her before she could fire David Starr Jordan as university President, and they had to move quickly. That’s what prompted the rushed train trips to California for Darius Ogden Mills and his son-in-law, Whitelaw Reid, to get there in time to cover her murder up along with Jordan. In any case, Sylvester apparently knew the complete party line of smear by the Utah court fraudsters, and he employed it as though the contents of his accusations were a matter of personal knowledge. He also added that the interviewer would “love” Phillip Fay Stevenson’s op-ed letters to the San Francisco newspapers. Apparently, Peter wanted to get some PR in for Stevenson, who was nothing more than a cocktail hour chatter-box on the phone with people he was trying to get involved in his Vancouver securities rackets to defraud Banner. So Sylvester needed to put in a good word in PR for him for some reason. Then I asked the London filmmakers to call Dr. George Thompson, a geophysics professor and Dean of the Geophysics Department at Stanford who had also been on the mailing list. He was a friend of Dr. Dennis Burke years before when Burke had mapped our Merritt Mountain gold property. Thompson first said that he remembered me back in the 1980s, when I “was sane.” Then, in a mind-boggling stroke of denial, he said that I had never even been a Stanford student. That was something which would come as a big surprise to the university registrar. Thompson was also quite eager to discount the reality that the Nevada properties could shape up into mines, stating that there was just “a little bit of mineralization” there, which most likely wouldn’t make a mine. According to all the geologists who had seen it, however, the mineralization was widespread on both properties. $150 million in placer gold in 2008 values, one of the biggest placer amounts in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:32:adc2949686cb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 33, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 33, "text": "something which would come as a big surprise to the university registrar.

According to all the geologists who had seen it, however, the mineralization was widespread on both properties. $150 million in placer gold in 2008 values, one of the biggest placer amounts in Nevada history, had been taken out of Osceola. Thompson had never even been to either of the properties and knew absolutely nothing about them, but he was willing to posture with his Ph.D. credentials from his Stanford office as though he did. He questioned whether what I had found at the Nevada properties was just all “in Steve Requa’s mind.” He was quite friendly and even affable as he made these outrageous statements, and appeared casual and comfortable with what he was saying. Professor Thompson also added that the Stanford Police Chief, Marv Harrington, had circulated a memo to faculty advising them that I was to be considered dangerous – a possible threat to the safety of the faculty – and the faculty ought to know. That undoubtedly explained some disturbing things that happened to me during a visit to the university in October 1993. Professor Kincheloe, a shareholder in my Banner International Company, appeared to have been alerted to my presence on campus and was inexplicably nervous in my presence. I now finally understood the very uncomfortable feeling I experienced that day that I was being followed and constantly under surveillance as I moved around campus. It wasn’t my imagination. It happened – just as I had thought! When the filmmakers next called Chief Harrington at the campus police station, he refused to comment, aside from saying that he knew who I was, and referred them to the Stanford press office. As Thompson quoted him, Harrington had written in his memo to faculty that “this guy [me] is not wired correctly,” and that if I showed up, the police should be contacted immediately. So it had been reported to Kincheloe and many others that I was to be considered dangerous. Sadly, good people at Stanford who knew me bought into the charade that I was “crazy, armed and dangerous.” Of critical interest and importance at Stanford was the presence of a letter of recommendation written for me by geologist Roger Bowers in the early 1990s. The letter was kept in my personal file at the university’s job placement center. By 1997 the party line being spouted was that the Nevada properties had “no value,” and that very little had been spent on gathering data on them, when in fact over $2 million had been spent from 1973 to 1993. Therefore, it would be very inconvenient if Bowers’ 1991 recommendation", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:33:bd5c30416f78", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 34, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "of a letter of recommendation written for me by geologist Roger Bowers in the early 1990s.

Therefore, it would be very inconvenient if Bowers’ 1991 recommendation letter on file at Stanford extolling my Osceola work and its very great value was still on file at Stanford’s Placement Center. In that letter, Bowers had written about how I had personally solved the Osceola Mother Lode riddle, and that I had found where the lode was and had done by myself what large mining companies with big staffs very seldom accomplish. This letter also stated how valuable the Requa/Hoover Files were and that the company was well-poised for great success on several fronts. All of this was quite true, if suddenly inconvenient. Needless to say, I was therefore then very interested in what had happened to that letter. Not only was its praise of me in contradiction to the “crackpot” image that was currently being espoused, but the letter’s admission that I had found the mother lode, and its statements of the value of the files and the findings, were completely at odds with all the fictions of the takeover group and their securities racketeers who were stealing all Banner’s assets. In sum, any evidence for my accomplishments in Nevada and later in Honduras had to be eliminated. The obvious plan was for Bowers himself to be “finding” the Osceola “mother lode,” the same mother lode that his 1991 Stanford Placement Center letter had praised me for already having found. But they would have to get me out of the way first, one way or another. Sure enough, when I asked the film people to call the Stanford Placement Center and ask about the contents of my file, all my recommendation letters were there except the one from Bowers. Among the letters remaining were recommendations from professors in the Earth Sciences Department under whom I had studied, praising my demonstrated geological capabilities; and one from Henry Hunt Keith, a professor at the Business School of San Francisco State University, who had introduced me to Carlos Rodriguez-Pastor, the former Finance Minister of Peru. Professor Keith wrote that I was one of the most capable entrepreneurs he had ever known. All these letters were significant factors in my success; during the 1987–1992 period I would have the Stanford Placement Center send them out to potential investors, just as they do on behalf of job applicants.

Bowers letter from 1991, however, had conspicuously disappeared. The university had told me nothing about removing the letter, either before or after the fact. When I inquired about it in 1997, they just said the letter wasn’t there. Under continuing pressure from me, it would take four years for them to fess up. In 2001, after I started lobbying the Faculty Senate members en masse by email, the university counsel Debra Zumwalt finally stated that Bowers had asked them to remove it, and that they were obliged to do so. But they still wouldn’t answer why they hadn’t told me about it at the time, nor why it took four years of heated pressure on them before they admitted that they had removed it. From all of this, I therefore began to suspect that one reason for Sylvester portraying me as being “obsessed” about Mrs. Stanford’s murder was to destroy my credibility and to portray me as a “conspiracy theorist.” That was clear enough in Sylvester’s chats with London media people. In any case, back in 1983 the concern had been about the effect the reported evidence for Jane Stanford’s murder might have on the Centennial fund-raising campaign. What it all seemed to come down to at the time was that I knew too much, that I could not be depended upon to keep quiet about it all. Their best insurance against this was to discredit me and confiscate my assets. As a part of this agenda in both California and Utah, Sylvester could pitch the idea that I was trying to embarrass the university by attempting to prove that Jordan had murdered Jane Stanford – making me ipso facto a crackpot. But as I was to see years later, the uppermost university echelon, including Sylvester, already knew full well that Jane Stanford had indeed been murdered. They just didn’t want it made public. Of course, Sylvester knew their accusation that I was “going around” being “obsessed” about it was bogus; but he really did not like the idea of me knowing about it per se. Why could that have been?

In a subsequent conversation, she advised me that she had spoken to the University security officials and that they had confirmed her initial information that no security file on you was being kept. Ms. Zumwalt’s reported statements, in light of the four recordings of Stanford people, were therefore all gross fictions – either blatant lies or indications of the most amazing cluelessness and incompetence. At least a professor, the campus police chief, a fund-raiser, and the alumni director had all spoken about their knowledge of the matter and the files that the police were saying they were keeping on me in 1993 – “before Requa went to England,” as Thompson had said. With whom could Ms. Zumwalt have “checked” to determine that Stanford kept no security files on me? Evidently, she didn’t check with the police chief. In those conversations with Pepper, Ms. Zumwalt also made the requisite party-line references to Pepper that questioned my “mental stability” and “credibility.” She added that my emails to faculty members about the situation were “a nuisance,” and that they were “not taken seriously and quickly thrown away.” Nonetheless, I had succeeded, at least with some Stanford people, in countering the Stanford juggernaut of smear tactics. Sometime later, after issues surrounding Jane Stanford’s murder and Dr. Cutler emerged in context with the Banner ones, I would get the following email from a professor who stated: I have been following your emails to the [University] President. I’m not sure why you have copied the department but I have been encouraged to see someone stand up for truth and to hold the administration accountable. I am advocating for you and respect the courage it takes to stand up to the administration. It is apparent Stanford has lacked integrity in multiple areas and I hope your case is a lightning bolt One possible reason the takeover charlatans were so confident in their depredations of Banner International might have been because they had Stanford University on hand to remove Bowers’ letter, had its police chief to defame and discredit me, and were able to posture and spread the sorts of libelous things Ms. Zumwalt was still doing in 2000. Stanford was decisively and pro-actively on the side of Bowers and his employers. It would take me until 2004 – after a steady stream of communications over a two- year period with Dr. Robert Cutler to appreciate these facts. This period culminated in the publication by Stanford University Press of his book The Mysterious Death of Jane Stanford.

This period culminated in the publication by Stanford University Press of his book The Mysterious Death of Jane Stanford. The announcement of the book appeared on the Stanford Press website in 2003 as follows: Stanford University President David Starr Jordan promptly issued a press release claiming that Mrs. Stanford had died of heart disease, a claim that he supported by challenging the skills and judgment of the Honolulu physicians and toxicologist. Jordan’s diagnosis was largely accepted and promulgated in many subsequent historical accounts. In this book, the author reviews the medical reports in detail to refute Dr. Jordan’s claim and to show that Mrs. Stanford indeed died of strychnine poisoning. His research reveals that the professionals who were denounced by Dr. Jordan enjoyed honorable and distinguished careers. He concludes that Dr. Jordan went to great lengths, over a period of nearly two decades, to cover up the real circumstances of Mrs. Stanford’s death. As Cutler documented, David Starr Jordan went to great lengths over a period of twenty years to suppress these facts and to discredit and maliciously defame those who had established them. His position and his official actions as President of the university were enough to suppress a murder investigation. The person with the biggest obvious motive for the murder and who had the most to benefit from Mrs. Stanford’s death was Jordan himself, whom Mrs. Stanford had been preparing to dismiss at the time of her murder. Evidence Cutler provided also shows that Jordan had foreknowledge that Mrs. Stanford’s days were numbered. He was preparing just before her death to fire one of her most trusted faculty allies, Professor Julius Goebel. This goal would have been impossible to fulfill if she had stayed alive. Over the next two months, the reporting on Cutler’s book mushroomed. First, it was a front-page story in the San Jose Mercury News, the third-largest-circulation newspaper in California. That article arose from an email campaign I made to Stanford professors about the murder and the relationship of its ongoing cover-up to Stanford’s evident hostilities against me. One of the faculty who got my email sent it to the newspaper. One of their reporters then contacted me and interviewed Cutler. The newspaper also quoted my comments about it being appropriate for the university now to strip Jordan’s name from various buildings and memorials on campus. But cults die hard. As a case in point, the FBI building in Washington still bears J. Edgar Hoover’s name, and after all the world has been fully appraised of his grotesque realities.

A Los Angeles Times reporter based in San Francisco, Lee Romney, saw that article. She interviewed me by phone while I was in Holland, and wrote a more in-depth piece in which I was quoted at the beginning of the article. A quoted comment was, “Now comes a great evil from the heart of the myth.” This article was printed on the front page of the Los Angeles Times on October 10, 2003, and my quote ended up in other newspapers as the article was syndicated across the country. Stanford donors, or some potential Stanford donors, possibly needed me identified as a threat to the continuing influx of the university’s donations from them (aside from their convenient allegation that I was a danger to the public safety of its faculty). As I have found, when the very rich want to pull a major crime they often rely on philanthropy to give them a good cover and to get the recipients of their largesse (perhaps like Stanford University) to do whatever is needed – and those beneficiaries will fall all over themselves to do what they just think might be wanted of them. But, perhaps much more importantly, I figured out eventually that there was indeed the basis for an authentic U.S. national security operation here – warped and corrupt though it was. I had long ascertained that one very real issue was the control of the developing mineral wealth and gold of Central America, and in many of the new gold mines yet to be discovered there and in the western U.S. That – as former Peruvian Finance Minister Carlos Rodriguez-Pastor had told Alberto Fujimori in my presence – is what was “muy importante.” The right-wing political factions and their national security proponents, whether in the FBI or CIA or in Guatemala, Honduras, and the U.S. would want to make sure those gold mines were going to be in their hands (especially perhaps so that some of South America’s dirty cocaine money could be laundered through the mining operations). William Pepper had alluded to some of these involved realities in the video interview in 1999: Not wanting to be in the club, and very much wanting to keep control of your big assets – resources like gold and oil – is one way you get to be a “national security” threat, and can be enough to get you killed.

It can also be enough to get some right-wing criminals to contrive a “national security” issue with false reporting to the FBI (such as had definitely been done against me), falsification of FBI records by criminalized FBI agents to allege “radical” ties, and prompting naïve FBI agents to then participate in illegal hostilities. The latter is also surely what was happening with Banner International, although in Banner’s case the hostilities and the smear campaign were also coming from the top of the FBI, as FBI Agent Mike Christman in Utah told me in 1993. Stanford, regarding Banner International, may have become essential in the “national security” game. Consider that, in 2004, eight of the thirty-one individuals seated on the Pentagon’s Defense Policy Board were Fellows from Stanford’s Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank that gets much criticism from other Stanford faculty for its doctrinaire, right-wing Republican mentality. Many members of that board also have close ties to defense contractors who could benefit economically from the information they get at these Pentagon board meetings. George W. Bush’s former National Security Advisor and subsequent Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, besides being a Hoover Senior Fellow, was also a Chevron Director. The Hoover Institution and Stanford provide the credentials, the elite institutional backdrop, and the proper academic rationale and obfuscating rhetoric for much of the right-wing and defense-establishment political agenda – especially for their wars for profit. Many of the Hoover Fellows (and certainly Rice in the Bush II administration) provide essential validation for contrived wars and other policies, complete with palatable-sounding academic and scientific jargon. They and the Hoover Institution are, in essence, academic prostitutes, and much of the Stanford academic community realizes this. Stanford University pays the bills of the Hoover Institution and places many of Hoover’s Fellows into faculty positions. Anything that would seriously undermine Stanford’s credibility, its mythology, its finances, or its image and reputation would thus be a big negative to the Hoover Institution. Any threat to the Hoover Institution would be considered, in effect, a threat to “national security.” Without my knowing it, I had perhaps started to pose this threat to them in 1983 after my trip to Hawaii and after Sylvester wrote his internal university memos to Stanford administrators informing them that I had learned that Jordan and Darius Ogden Mills were being alleged, with new evidence, to be behind Jane Stanford’s murder.

First of all let me commend you on the work you have done with respect to the death of Mrs Stanford. It is clear to me that you have opened a can of worms and set out a very credible case of apparent murder based upon the Cutler evidence. Your diligence serves well the Stanford family and, although they do not realize it at this time, the entire Stanford community. Of course, I can only urge you to follow through with this work. There is, as you know, no statute of limitations involving murder. I have no doubt that it is a potentially very worrying matter for the university. As ever, That’s the question posed by retired Stanford physician Robert Cutler in his book, The Mysterious Death of Jane Stanford. The book has piqued the attention of the national media with a provocative claim: Contrary to the University’s official story – that Jane died of heart failure – she was actually poisoned in the Moana Hotel in Hawaii, and her death was covered up by then-University President David Starr Jordan. “The ‘Stanford community,’ as you call it, has been quick to say that all scrutiny is welcome,” said Leora Romney, a Los Angeles Times reporter who wrote a front- page feature on the book’s claim. “But at the same time, there is great reluctance to acknowledge that Starr Jordan may have had less than honorable motives. Cutler’s research is solid. His scholarship has not been challenged. So why not accept his conclusions? The University insists on stopping short of that.” Both the successor of Stanford Vice President Freelan, Gordon Earle, and the university’s Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Isaac Stein, commented that Cutler had “proved nothing.” They were, of course, not willing to take Cutler to task on any of the medical facts. As the Los Angeles Times noted in its front page article on October 10, 2003, everyone else was viewing Cutler’s case as medically and historically “irrefutable.” But the Stanford administration was saying that Cutler’s case for murder was “highly speculative.” If ever there was a solid medical case for poisoning, however – one that had nothing at all speculative about it – this was it. The Hawaii Coroner’s Jury in 1905 had ruled the same way. But Earle, their good spinmeister, was quoted in the California newspapers as saying the following: “Some have made the case that President Jordan was involved in a cover-up surrounding the circumstances of Jane Stanford’s death….

The University believes that this conclusion is highly speculative and not supported by any solid proof. And there is absolutely no evidence that President Jordan was directly connected in any way in Jane Stanford’s death.” Earle and Stein were being true believers in the Stanford cult, but they were also worried about something more palpable and threatening. Along this line I noted that Cutler had found a letter from Jordan to Stanford Board Chairman Samuel Leib. The following appeared in the front-page lead-column article in the Los Angeles Times on October 10, 2003: His first help came from Karen Bartholomew, a board member of the Stanford Historical Society who had written about the death for an in-house publication. In her file: a 12-point letter from Jordan to board of trustees President Samuel F. Leib that suggests he choose whichever alternative to poisoning he thinks most suitable. A damning piece by another academic sleuth, recently published in the American Scholar, sidles a little closer to an answer. W.B. Carnochan, a Stanford humanities professor emeritus, details Jordan’s firing of Julius Goebel – a German professor who was closely allied with Stanford. Stanford was intent on firing Jordan when she died, Carnochan says. The timing of Goebel’s firing – set in motion just days after the first poisoning – suggests that Jordan may have known Stanford’s days were numbered. In the context of the tissue-paper-thin denials by Earle and Stein, Pepper’s comment about there being no statute of limitations for murder set me to thinking. All the people involved in the murder were, of course, dead. But Stanford University itself was thriving, and I wondered about the university’s exposure as an institution. Could the University itself have been made culpable? Had Jordan irremediably implicated the University institutionally in the crime? I thus began suspecting that this was perhaps a factor that had so concerned Sylvester and the administration officials in 1983 and ever since. It is a question that is worthy of address in view of the extraordinary hostile actions of Stanford University against my person and reputation. It is also worth asking in context of the falsehoods issued by Stanford counsel and vice president, Ms. Zumwalt. Were those falsehoods merely knee-jerk, or were they made knowledgeably? In the context of her efforts to cast aspersions on my sanity to William Pepper, I would tend to suspect that they were knowledgeable lies.

In the context of her efforts to cast aspersions on my sanity to William Pepper, I would tend to suspect that they were knowledgeable lies. Will they be capable of providing a credible reply? I would certainly like to see someone subpoenaed to testify at the hoped-for (and critically required) Congressional investigations into these matters. With these things in mind, I then took another look at Sylvester’s 1983 memo to Freelan and noticed something that had not occurred to me before. As noted earlier, Stanford in public was claiming that there was no reason to conclude Mrs. Stanford had been poisoned. But, as we have already seen, in Sylvester’s memo to Freelan, in the very first sentence he straightaway refers to “the 2/28/05 poisoning of Jane Stanford.” He didn’t say an “alleged” poisoning or a “highly speculative” one. He called it just “the 2/28/05 poisoning.” He appears to be taking the murder for granted, and he apparently knew Freelan was also taking it for granted. Was it common knowledge? Did they all know Stanford’s dark, dirty secret already? What Sylvester was concerned about in his memo was “something new” that Van Dyke might have come up with to finger Jordan. During the 2003 syndication of the article in newspapers across the country that followed, I noticed some other interesting discrepancies. One was that Stanford had alleged – in a newspaper headline in 1905 – that “no poison” had been found in Mrs Stanford’s organs in Stanford’s own labs. But, as we have previously shown, the organs had been chopped up and liquefied for tests in Honolulu, then discarded there. The newspaper headlines about them were planned deceptions and complete fictions put out by Stanford. Stanford was controlling/lying to the press. Some conclusions therefore seemed rather certain to me. Several people at Stanford already knew in 1905 that Jane Stanford had been murdered. In addition to Jordan, these certainly included the Chairman of the Board and other Trustees. They knew that Jordan was putting out a barrage of deception. Samuel Leib (then Stanford Board Chairman) was advising Jordan. The Trustees were a party to this action. Some, certainly Jordan, knew before the fact that Jane wasn’t going to be around much longer. If all these other people knew Jane had been murdered, who were they thinking had done it? They all had participated in it one way or another. De facto, it was a coup, in which forces seized control of the university from Jane Stanford. sister Alice Herrick Stanford. Helen was my father’s first cousin.

Helen was my father’s first cousin. They were a tight family, constantly going back and forth to each other’s estates for weeks and months on end. I was also in fact an heir to another of my grandmother’s and Alice Stanford’s sisters, Margaret Cox Herrick, as was my father. Childless, Helen left her money to Stanford. Would she have done so if she had known that Jane was murdered and that the university as an institution was perhaps implicated in her murder? She would probably have left her fortune instead to family members, as her mother’s sister had. I, and other family members, would thus have standing in a civil action to sue the university to recover those funds for the family members. The key fact, however, was simply that I would have had some legal standing to act – just to bring all of this out into the open in court. It went well beyond one possible bequest. If Stanford University was sued, it would cause an upheaval in university politics and control. They would no longer be able to disperse Stanford holy water. Their prized mythology would collapse. “The great evil at the heart of the Stanford myths” would emerge. The heart of Stanford University was black. Legal actions against Stanford, successful or not, of merit or not, could be catastrophic … there is no statute of limitations on murder. And then there was (and continues to be) the very real National Security establishment presence at the Hoover Institution There are still (to me) some very big questions that have not been resolved to this day. Why did an “FBI Agent X,” as revealed in my previous book, The Great American Gold Grab, have a Utah Corporations office records falsification scheme all concocted and ready to go when I arrived in Utah in the spring of 1993? Who really got Stanford to lift the Bowers letter? In 2004 I had been hard at work in consultation with Dr. Cutler on a film treatment for the Jane Stanford murder case. He and I had been exchanging emails about it for two years and were focusing on some good ideas for a dramatization of the events. As it turned out, it would be much more dramatic than we expected. Cutler’s book had mostly been a research and academic book by a physician into the historical and medical records that had been suppressed.

Both Jordan at the time and Stanford University right up to the present had fabricated many myths, and outright lies, to support that suppression. Today they would be criminally chargeable as obstructions of justice, at least. After the publicity flurry in the newspapers, I could see that the Stanford issue was going to be a part of my salvation by helping to restore my credibility, which university people had tried systematically to destroy. Very damning for Stanford would be its heinous acts, now coming to light, to discredit the autopsy doctors – in 1905 and for 20 years thereafter – and then, nearly a century later, employing similar tactics to try to destroy me. For those two and a half years, Dr. Cutler and I corresponded several times a week. I sent him my book installments as I wrote them, and he was extremely perceptive and supportive. His wisdom and personality seemed to envelop my thinking for those years. He was an extraordinarily kind soul of both brilliance and modesty, with an ability to see through sham right away. He especially enjoyed my characterizations of the San Francisco socialites. In February 2004, Dr. Cutler sent me a very detailed timeline for the murder and cover-up events. The plot for a film treatment fairly jumped right off its pages. Then in early April he sent some books about Jane, two new signed copies of his book, and the article in American Scholar by Stanford Professor Carnochan about Professor Julius Goebel and something called “the Professor Gilbert Affair” back in 1905. The event narrated in Carnochan’s article was the stunning revelation of the Gilbert sex scandal that we have previously discussed. This had actually spun itself into the deadly web of events that culminated in Jane’s murder. The sex scandal was an affair between the married Professor Gilbert, who was a Jordan crony, and a single young lady who worked in the university library. Professor Goebel was going to expose it widely, along with Jordan’s efforts to keep it covered up. Jane was incensed on learning of the scandal, and it brought to a head her determination to fire Jordan. Over the weekend that I read that article, the final plot outlines for the film came into a stunning and compelling focus. It seemed obvious to me that Jordan had been trying to keep the lid on Professor Gilbert’s sex scandal, but Jane was hearing about it By this time I had", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:44:969ae78dae96", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 45, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 45, "text": "along with Jordan’s efforts to keep it covered up.

It seemed obvious to me that Jordan had been trying to keep the lid on Professor Gilbert’s sex scandal, but Jane was hearing about it By this time I had been posting information and commentary to several hundred faculty email addresses, including all the Faculty Senate and several whole faculties of departments. One professor from the Psychology Department had been writing encouraging notes for some time, and he had a good take on Jordan and Bertha Berner about which other people were also guessing. Some thoughts: As I may have mentioned, the three female reporters with whom we worked each [independently] were convinced Berner and Jordan had a relationship – how else would she presume to advise him on coverage of JLS death in his memoirs. The newspapers had her having an affair with the butler making her relationships a matter of speculation. She was Mrs. Stanford’s personal secretary. She wrote letters, took dictation, undoubtedly sliced open the mail. She certainly can be considered Jordan’s informant (and JLS betrayer). Berner was editing Jordan’s autobiography. She was the only one present at both poisonings, and because of that and her many fabrications and dishonesties in her later books, Cutler and I both had concluded she must have been the one who gave Jane the poison on both occasions. (And the evidence for the Berner/Jordan affair is, as Cutler says, convincing. They had even been seen together on a San Francisco cable car.) The materials I got from Cutler in early April therefore provided some essential keys, especially the information about Professors Goebel and Gilbert at the time of the killing. The affair surrounding those professors tied everything together into a topclass drama: sex, power, big money, murder. I surmised what their roles – and Jordan’s – were for the decade or so preceding the murder, and I outlined their roles in the film treatment. A full professor from the Psychology Department has commented the following: “I have just finished reading Cutler’s book cover-to-cover including all the footnotes. Reading between the lines and putting stray facts together, I find myself wondering about the relationship between Jordan and Bertha Berner. There may have been an additional motive at work in what transpired.” Thus the professor of psychology, on his own, came to the same conclusion as the three women reporters. I then rushed to complete a draft of the treatment for copyright registration with the Library of Congress.

I then rushed to complete a draft of the treatment for copyright registration with the Library of Congress. I also knew very well from my family’s history that my great-grandfather Isaac had collapsed while eating lunch at the Pacific Union Club, two days after Jane’s funeral in California, and that he had first collapsed a few weeks before, after he drank a glass of milk – nearly the exact time Jane first drank the Poland Water with strychnine (as a 1905 newspaper account that I had read years ago revealed). I conveyed these facts and again reviewed for Cutler Isaac’s known close business associations with Collis Huntington and Leland Stanford. On March 30, Cutler wrote me as follows: Jordan, according to Cutler, had perjured himself in Congressional hearings for the benefit of Darius Ogden Mills. And, his (Cutler’s) assertion that Isaac was “the obvious second victim” had virtually leapt off the page at me and became ever clearer when I started doing my film treatment. Isaac knew all the big players and “ol’ boys.” He had succeeded Leland Stanford as President of the Central Pacific Railroad and was still its president. He was powerful and influential in California. He was a long-term, loyal friend of Jane’s and related to her through marriage. With the verdict coming from the doctors and coroner’s court in Hawaii that Jane had been poisoned with Strychnine, but Jordan and Stanford University denying it, he would have been like a dog with a bone in his efforts to get to the truth. Additionally, just as they wanted I worked all of this into the treatment and I mailed it to the Library of Congress for copyright registration on April 9, 2004. In the treatment Isaac had figured out that the Jordan crowd was going to murder Jane, and opposed it. Then they tried to murder her with the Poland Water and it failed. That would have pushed Isaac into action. They had to try to kill him too. He was poisoned successfully within a few days of Jane’s funeral. he Stanford University website I came across in 2003 stated that the “most plausible scenario” of Jane Stanford’s death was “a natural heart attack.” Dr Cutler and I of course knew that the precise cause of death was exactly as determined in the official Hawaii State Inquest verdict that ruled death by strychnine poisoning. The university website was mendacious and fraudulent, and clearly made so knowingly. It was also cloying and unctuous, reflective of some university PR hacks on orders from Peter Sylvester’s Office of Development, an exercise in public relations and spin made in response to the things I", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:46:aeb7f2e8cd56", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 47, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 47, "text": "“a natural heart attack.” Dr Cutler and I of course knew that the precise cause of death was exactly as determined in the official Hawaii State Inquest verdict that ruled death by strychnine poisoning.

It was also cloying and unctuous, reflective of some university PR hacks on orders from Peter Sylvester’s Office of Development, an exercise in public relations and spin made in response to the things I had told Sylvester in 1983. Besides creating the website, Sylvester had written memos about me and the chief of security had put it about that I was crazy, dangerous and presented a physical threat to members of staff. Palpable desperation in Sylvester and the upper echelons of Stanford was clear, and now after many years of following up Dr Cutler’s hundreds of emails and documentation we can say why. What shifted the Stanford administration and the Office of Development into panic mode after Sylvester’s 1983 Memo was not so much Van Dyke’s evidence that Jane had been poisoned, but that Darius Ogden Mills was deeply involved. This was new; this was big, and this reached right into the inner-core of the circle of men behind the curtain who really controlled the United States. The massively wealthy, powerful and devious Mills was undoubtedly a member of that circle. We discussed previously how he hurriedly departed New York before the terrible event at the Moana hotel had even taken place that night, and sped 3000 miles across America by train to Stanford. Critically, the many items of evidence alleged by Van Dyke could only have been able to entail Mills in one way, and that was as the source of bribes. But we now know that there was very much more to it. Bertha Berner, working under orders from David Starr Jordan, poisoned Jane, but the green light for them to proceed would have had to come from an immensely powerful group such as Rockefeller, Roosevelt, Harriman, Mills and, likely, Rothschild in London. These were the men who controlled the United States, and Stanford University was not only significant for the development of their big eugenics program, but of crucial importance in their plans for consolidating their control in the foreseeable future and, indeed, covering up their own dirty business. Darius Ogden Mills clearly knew Jane was going to be murdered in Hawaii – hence his departure from New York timed to facilitate his arrival in California several days later by the time of her murder. David Starr Jordan was shown by both Dr Cutler and Professor Carnochan to have known Jane’s demise was pending. Certainly Mills knew this with Roosevelt poised to announce Reid’s appointment as the United States Ambassador to Great Britain shortly after he and Mills arrived.

Certainly Mills knew this with Roosevelt poised to announce Reid’s appointment as the United States Ambassador to Great Britain shortly after he and Mills arrived. Reid, as we have seen, was Mills’ son-in-law, and his ambassadorial appointment was surely well planned in advance. Mills had the wealth and experience “on-site” to organize and execute the plan. No others did. It was assuredly well planned and instigated by Mills from its inception. Substantial sums of money would be required to silence a great many individuals and leave nothing to chance. Mills’ sudden appearance right on cue for Mrs Stanford’s death would not arouse any great suspicion (other than possibly in Isaac Requa’s mind). He knew all the richest people in California and until he moved to New York was himself the State’s richest man. He had ready access to anyone who mattered. He still had massive clout in California plus the financial wherewithal to readily ensure that the police, university trustees, the press, private detectives and anyone else on the periphery were in his pocket and malleable. His power, wealth and influence ensured that Isaac Requa’s poisoning at the Pacific Union Club and buying silence would be straightforward. He was a member of the club, along with Isaac and the other power elite. Isaac had known them all for 35 years and had built the Eureka Palisade Railroad with Mills. On moving east, Mills became closely allied to the Rockefeller/Harriman clique in New Cutler also reported in his emails to me that Darius Ogden Mills was inexplicably then at Stanford, “in town” as he wrote; and that, as the papers reported, he was “huddled with Executors,” including Reid, whose real status as an Executor is subject to very serious doubt. All things considered, as now detailed, make it clear that the very rich Mills was the on-site “banker” for the operation and surely the source of funds provided to Trustee Timothy Hopkins, to go with Jordan to Hawaii, where they attempted unsuccessfully to bribe the autopsy doctors to change their cause of death ruling of strychnine poisoning to heart disease, as the Honolulu newspapers reported, and Cutler noted in his timeline. When a curious libel campaign against me struck up in Honduras in 2009-2010, very similar to the Stanford libels against me detailed in the last chapter, I knew that the whole Utah receivership court frauds had to be centrally tied to Stanford.

Now we may conclude that his purpose with the Executors was also to make bribes. One thing is certain regarding Jane’s murder: in 1983 when I met Van Dyke in Hawaii, he could not simply have picked Darius Ogden Mills’ name out of thin air to allege as a primary conspirator with David Starr Jordan. Mills supplied Stanford University trustee Hopkins with bribe money to go to Hawaii with Jordan to commence the immediate cover-up, but to their great credit the upstanding Honolulu doctors declined what must have been substantial offers to drop their cast-iron strychnine poisoning diagnosis in favor of ‘natural causes’. Did they later conduct their own investigations as to who was providing the money for Hopkins bribes, when their names and reputations were subsequently dragged through the mud? Had information they gained on Mills been passed down to Van Dyke as a ‘free-lance’ historian? On pondering this, Dr Cutler commented that Van Dyke’s interest in the murder could have been piqued by an article in the obscure Pacific Historian journal. It was the first to conclude that Jane had been poisoned and her death covered-up, but did not implicate Darius Ogden Mills. The article had been reprinted in the Pacific Commercial Advertiser in Honolulu on July 27, 1981 and doubtless went straight onto the Hawaiian grapevine. By whatever means Van Dyke got his information, we can now say with certainty that it was sound. He gave me a valuable lead on Darius Ogden Mills in 1983 and I have investigated and developed it since, but not until Peter Sylvester prompted me to do so after his bizarre and completely false allegations in 1997 that I was “obsessed” with Jane Stanford’s murder. That’s really the only way Van Dyke would have plucked Mills’ name seemingly out of thin air. Mills’ money was financing the poisonings and cover-ups behind the scenes. The primary function of Mills in California with his son-in-law Whitelaw Reid was to cover-up the murder of Jane Stanford by bribing people in order to protect Jordan’s place at Stanford. But the greater purpose was to ensure that no traces ever got back to the true perpetrators in the higher echelons of the Anglo-American Establishment on Wall Street and The City, London. In any case, Stanford learned with Sylvester’s Memo of 1983 that Cutler found in university archives and sent me that Van Dyke was claiming evidence for Jordan and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:49:985873c5c0e1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 50, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 50, "text": "Reid was to cover-up the murder of Jane Stanford by bribing people in order to protect Jordan’s place at Stanford.

In any case, Stanford learned with Sylvester’s Memo of 1983 that Cutler found in university archives and sent me that Van Dyke was claiming evidence for Jordan and Mills having organized the murder of Jane. The only way he would have alleged that from Hawaii was having found evidence there for Mill’s bribe money that Timothy Hopkins and Jordan were circulating in Hawaii, with rejected offer to the doctors, and surely to many of the others Van Dyke had evidence on. So Sylvester and his Office of Development immediately knew – or quickly found out – that in following up Mills and his sudden trip to Stanford with Whitelaw Reid, I could crack the whole case: that whole case being that Rockefeller, Harriman, TR, and Rothschild, were the top of the conspiracy, and that Stanford had been taken over by them under Jordan by 1904 (with “ops” on campus as per Goebel’s letter to Jane Stanford in 1904). Because of the Gilbert Scandal and other matters that Goebel wrote Jane about, Jane was going to fire Jordan, which would have ended their takeover of Stanford and all their eugenics organization plans for Stanford (which were very great), also tied in with laundering political payoffs and bribes as “donations” through eugenics organizations being formed by Jordan and TR Roosevelt. Sylvester and the whole line of administrators up to Stanford’s President would have been extremely anxious about me developing the Darius Ogden Mills link. That probably only abated when they successfully organized, with racketeers, the Utah Court Frauds of 1993 against me. Sylvester in his 1997 phone call interview clearly evidenced that he had come to know all about those frauds, and the players involved in them. My fully exposing Mills would have also exposed Whitelaw Reid’s role in having been the chosen one (with Mills for bribes) to go do the probate fraud. There is no evidence to be found that Jane Stanford had even met Reid, and no earthly reason that she would have appointed him as an executor. It appears very likely that all the things he did in the probate actions were frauds. Mills was “huddled all day with Executors” and clearly he and Reid were there to force all the Executors to go along with the ‘natural death’ charade.

As Dr Cutler revealed, they refused and reported it to the newspapers. Mills and Reid were a package from the beginning, with the former running the show. In addition to bribes, they prevailed on the Executors to accept the impossible lie that Stanford labs had analyzed Jane’s organs and found no strychnine. When Welton Stanford offered rewards for information on who poisoned his aunt, that very same day the Executors countered the reward saying that Stanford labs had just concluded there was no strychnine. That, as we have seen, was impossible. It was a ‘probate fraud’ “nine ways to breakfast,” as my father used to say. Whitelaw Reid took the appointment of Ambassadorship on the day before the Hawaii Inquest ruling (since he knew what it would be). That was the last day he could have accepted it, or that it could have been made. It is very unlikely to have transpired after the inquest verdict when he was sitting there claiming to be an Executor of a woman who had just been murdered. With this new-found status, Reid was able to assist Mills in browbeating the executors into doing exactly as they said. Hopkins, of course, was already on-board. Reid had long been chosen by the Eastern Establishment as the new U. S. Ambassador to Britain, basically in order to liaise with Rothschild about the forthcoming Rothschild/Rockefeller dominated Federal Reserve System. We have seen how he was rushed out to Stanford with his father-in-law, first to do the probate fraud and ensure that Isaac was silenced. Mills, in the background, and Reid were the on-site bosses of the cover-up of Jane’s murder, but at the top were Roosevelt, Rockefeller, Harriman and Rothschild. The public announcement of Reid’s spectacular appointment as Ambassador to the U.K. was made at that point in time to lend him gravitas. This is all plain as day now. But Stanford immediately saw in 1983 that I could unravel all of it from just Van Dyke’s evidence on Jordan/Mills. So Sylvester and his Office of Development started plotting immediately to bring me down before I could do that, after attaining resources and mining success. But with the Sylvester Memo of 1983 that Cutler found and gave me in 2001, and Mills being nailed by both Van Dyke and Cutler’s tell-tale email on Mills being “huddled with Executors,” I was able to unravel it.

The reason Mills was “huddled” with those individuals was to ensure that any of them who needed to be bribed to ensure silence, was bribed -all the while conveying them the good wishes of TR, Rockefeller, and the Rothschilds. Such power. But the primary thing for Mills to do was the engineering and bribing for Isaac Requa to get poisoned at lunch at the Pacific Union Club that his son Mark wrote about and that I read in Utah in 1974. They of course knew I would be upset about this discovery. Stanford, at the top, had assuredly known from 1905 right up to the present that Isaac as well as Jane had been murdered. The university is still run today by the same interests who had been in control of it at least since 1904, and had murdered Jane Stanford and Isaac Requa to preserve their control and to insure that their agenda for Stanford would stay on course. On learning of the role of Darius Ogden Mills in Hawaii in 1983, without knowing it I became an essential person to “incapacitate” before I could figure out the full scope of his involvement – and that of others in the higher echelons of the Eastern Establishment. That’s part one of the essential message that Sylvester broadcast in his internal memorandum of 1983: that I could ascertain who was at the top and expose them and their agenda, that did then become much of what the 20th century was to include, with vast new wars for profit and central banking controlled in their private hands. This scope of things included the reality that by 1904, as per Professor Julius Goebel, Stanford had been already taken over by that cabal of interests at the top, with their “ops” on campus, who had employed David Starr Jordan to run Stanford for them. Jane Stanford by then was living on borrowed time. One could say that the already taken-over university of 1904 is the entity that had then organized the murder of Jane Stanford in 1905. One could also say that it is that criminal entity that is still in control of Stanford University. That’s what Peter Sylvester was most desperate about in 1983, and from then up to 1993 when I encountered the full reality of that criminal entity with their corruption of the Courts and takeover of Banner International. That was all made clear with the phone interviews by the London film people in 1997, and with regard to the Stanford Police chief.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:52:6cbd99d35ca2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 53, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "1905.

That was all made clear with the phone interviews by the London film people in 1997, and with regard to the Stanford Police chief. I had become a “danger to the safety” of the university. The destruction of Banner International in 1993 by Utah Court Frauds resulted from that 1983 Memorandum of Peter Sylvester. Without even knowing it my hands were on the jugular of those presently in charge of Stanford University and the so-called New World Order gang that had taken it over in 1904-1905 as a corner stone in its century-long plans for all our futures. As for Stanford’s role in all this relative to myself, I wouldn’t know anything for eight years – until I heard from Dr. Cutler in 2001 with the Sylvester Memo he had found concerning me in university archives. I knew the university’s darkest secret. I had been informed in Hawaii in 1983 that Jane Stanford had been murdered and at the behest of the university’s president, no less – and they knew I knew it. That was true; but, I didn’t know that they were concerned about my knowing it until Dr. Cutler appeared in 2001. Indeed, thanks to Dr. Cutler, I found out that they had written and circulated memos about the murder and my being informed about it – and most critically that Darius Ogden Mills was the now easily ascertained bag-man for it, and with the closest of connections in New York City with Rockefeller, TR Roosevelt, Harriman, and others. Now-a-days the all-too-easily corrupted and/or duped elements in the FBI, in the Mafia-allied securities racketeers, and their socialites have coalesced around absolute necessity of Stanford University (and by Stanford I mean the Stanford as controlled still by the Rockefellers and Rothschilds) to hide all this. By all this I also mean not just to hide the fact of Jane Stanford having been poisoned. What was really “all” involved was the university having already been taken over by 1904 for all the objectives that included setting up eugenics organizations to establish forced-sterilization programs in what eventually became 27 U.S. states, with 60,000 victims (but with plans for millions), and then to do the same in Nazi Germany, and with the obvious objective also including Whitelaw Reid liaising with Rothschild in London to create the Federal Reserve Bank – and with a major objective to instigate World War I; to be financed by that bank to great obscene profits by these pathologically greedy utterly insane racists; and, then also for Stanford University to become the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:53:b8a8b4adb0bb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 54, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 54, "text": "what eventually became 27 U.S. states, with 60,000 victims (but with plans for millions), and then to do the same in Nazi Germany, and with the obvious objective also including Whitelaw Reid liaising with Rothschild in London to create the Federal Reserve Bank – and with a major objective to instigate World War I; to be financed by that bank to great obscene profits by these pathologically greedy utterly insane racists; and, then also for Stanford University to become the site for collecting and covering up all the incriminating evidence for the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and all their allied “Secret Elite” in instigating World War I and hugely profiting from it. It was a vast risk for them all to contemplate: for Van Dyke and then myself (independently) to be ascertaining the first critical role of Darius Ogden Mills in this vast scheme of things to come, with just his first step to be taken for a century of great crimes to come with murdering Jane Stanford and Isaac Requa. These risks for exposure were entailed by their New World Order in 1983 having had to encounter the long-dead past of Darius Ogden Mills that Van Dyke and I had suddenly been clued into. I could then expose all this. I was a marked man, without the slightest recognition of it for several years to come. The great difficulties Van Dyke was to encounter in Hawaii after 1983, and the far greater difficulties I would face in the Utah Court Frauds of 1993, were the results of my 1983 chat with Peter Sylvester. They were part of the same agenda that had proceeded with Peter Sylvester after 1983. Stanford and Utah were part of the same operation of the NWO, of which Stanford University – the criminal one – had become a cornerstone in 1905. Now to be seen, with this volume appearing, is what the faculty, alumni, and students at Stanford will do with this knowledge. They are in the midst, and bowels, of a very large covert criminal entity. A suggested first step is the creation of an almost entirely new Board of Trustees (under a restored legitimate Stanford University) with a new senior administration – with no connections whatsoever to be allowed with the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds with their endless wars for profit and not-infrequent assassinations. The legitimate restored Stanford may then proceed to seek all the assets of the Rockefellers and Rothschilds as restitution for their two centuries of Crimes against Humanity with their criminally-contrived wars. The Federal Reserve Bank, needless to say, should be immediately nationalized.

One of the great books of our new century will be some day written on the selection of men,the screening of human life through the actions of man and the operation of the institutions men have built up.It will be a survey of the stream of social history, its whirls and eddies, rapids and still waters,and the effect of each and all of its conditions on the heredity of men. The survival of the fit and the unfit in all degrees and conditions will be its subject-matter.This book will be written, not roughly and hastily,like the present fragmentary essay,still less will it be a brilliant effort of some analytical imagination. If any war is good, civil war must be best. The virtues of victory and the lessong of defeat would be kept within the nation. This would protect the nation from the temptation to fight for gold or trade. Civil war under proper limitations could remedy this. A time limit could be adopted,as in football, and every device known to the arena could be used to get the good of war and to escape its evils. he book entitled The Mysterious Death of Jane Stanford was a truly historic breakthrough, with Dr Robert Cutler M.D.’s restoration of the criminally-suppressed Hawaii State Inquest verdict that Mrs Stanford’s death was due to strychnine poisoning.

This marks the fruition of his labours, as well as a new fruition for the labours of Jane Stanford. The recognition and restoration of her surpassing accomplishment with Stanford University may now proceed following the complete revelations of her murder and its well organized criminal cover-up. By 2002, Dr Cutler had firmly concluded that Jane Stanford’s murder was engineered by Stanford University President David Starr Jordan who directed the poisoning by Bertha Berner, Mrs Stanford’s secretary and his secret paramour. There is no doubt whatsoever that Jordan was deeply involved, but with the dovetailing of our research, and based on the combined knowledge and evidence we shared, it is now also certain that the “paymaster” of the 1905 conspiracy to steal Stanford University was Darius Ogden Mills. Berner poisoned Mrs Stanford on the direction of Jordan, while Jordan was operating under the aegis of Mills. In turn, multi-millionaire banker Mills was financing the conspiracy in close cooperation and agreement with some of the richest and most powerful men in the United States. Jordan’s efforts to produce a fine legacy certainly succeeded with his student, Paul Popenoe, who learned early on one basic of eugenics as written by Jordan: “The pauper is the victim of heredity, but neither Nature nor Society recognizes that as an excuse for his existence.” Popenoe was distinguished enough with Jordan’s tutelage to write the forced-sterilization law for Nazi Germany and won the personal praise of Hitler for that. His corollary to Jordan’s precept was: “The value of execution as a means to maintain the standards of the race cannot be underestimated”. To advance this notion in his Applied Eugenics he advocated local neighbourhood execution gas chambers as a means to maintain those “standards of the race.” As noted in the The Horrifying American Roots of Nazi Eugenics, eighteen solutions were explored in a Carnegie-supported 1911 “Preliminary Report of the Committee of the Eugenic Section of the American Breeder’s Association to Study and to Report on the Best Practical Means for Cutting off the Defective Germ-Plasm in the Human Population.” Point No. 8 was euthanasia. The most commonly suggested method of execution in the United States was a “lethal chamber” or public, locally operated gas chambers. In 1918, Popenoe, the Army venereal disease specialist during World War I, co-wrote the widely used textbook, Applied Eugenics, which argued, “From an historical point of view, the first method which presents itself is execution.… Its value in keeping up the standard of the race should not be underestimated.” Applied Eugenics also devoted a chapter to “Lethal Selection,” which", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:56:3bd97e1328f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 57, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 57, "text": "The most commonly suggested method of execution in the United States was a “lethal chamber” or public, locally operated gas chambers.

All the fanatical eugenicists and “gangsters” that joined ranks with Jordan to take over Stanford in 1904 (about which Julius Goebel wrote to Jane Stanford) and then to murder Jane Stanford, were truly deranged, quite insane. Stanford is still controlled by these same interests with this same mind-set. Stanford’s spinmeister and vice-president of communications, Gordon Earle, states that Jordan’s legacy remains a strong one. “When you look at the entirety of President Jordan’s career at Stanford, it is clear that he was one of our finest presidents,” To Earle and others, nothing short of the Stanford mythology is at stake. He added, Jordan “deserves to be remembered – and memorialized.” Now we all know, however – given the “entirety of Jordan’s career” with murders and Nazi eugenics to his credit – just exactly how he became one of “Stanford’s finest”. He was deeply involved in the murder of the university’s co-founder, with the cover-up of that murder, and with the most egregious of further crimes possible. In a court nowadays, even aside from his certain direct implication in the murder, he would get many years behind bars for his obstructions of justice. Professor Carnochan stated: “When you have an institutional story that enshrines David Starr Jordan as a heroic figure and you find out that he seemed to have feet of clay, if not lead, you are bound to wonder whether you have been deluded”. Indeed, many have been deluded, but reading the facts and Timeline here should compel those with the very best interests of Stanford at heart to action. All Stanford-affiliated persons must now come together in a concerted effort to remove from the Stanford campus, and from all Stanford institutions, any ties or relics from Jordan and the unrestrained criminality of interest he represented.

The payoff has just begun, but we may now state that Dr. Cutler’s longed-for success in determining the whole picture underlying Jane Stanford’s murder is now at hand. This has been accomplished with Dr. Cutler’s leads, many of which are now seen as crucial, but when at first they seemed to be incidental facts of little import. These included, for example, Darius Ogden Mills being present at Stanford with Whitelaw Reid (i.e. “in town,” but for what reason Cutler did not know), and with Mills, as reported by newspapers, being “huddled with Executors” shortly after their 3000 mile journey by train to get to Stanford in time to do what they had set themselves out to do regarding Jane Stanford’s death. As shown in news reports in 2003, her death appears to have been anticipated beforehand by Jordan, so it was surely anticipated beforehand by others It appears quite evident that Mills was the “paymaster” for bribes in the Stanford take-over (and with Central Pacific Railroad included), and that he functioned as the paymaster in both California and Hawaii, with bribes having been offered to the autopsy doctors to change their ruling of cause of death. These bribes offered by Trustee Timothy Hopkins with Jordan, surely used Mills’ money. He had stayed in California; but the evidence for his money made it to Hawaii, as Van Dyke had reported in 1983, about which Peter Sylvester at Stanford’s Office of Development wrote his Memorandum to his fellow Stanford administrators. Darius Ogden Mills can now be seen as much more than just the paymaster. It is clear now that he was a major cog in the Stanford take-over, and with both the murders and their cover-ups. Especially with his son-in-law, Whitelaw Reid, being an executor, and then appointed U.S. Ambassador to the Court of Suppressing that verdict, they all knew was coming, would required extra clout, such as Reid could gain by his appointment to the Court of St. James, such as Mills had as the former richest man in California, and such as Roosevelt had as President. The desperation can be seen in the 3000-mile dash by Mills and Reid to Stanford to be with the other Executors, and to have been appointed Ambassador – all before the inquest verdict The trustees and executors in these circumstances could only be expected to sit on their hands and accept whatever it was that the Jordan/Mills/Reid juggernaut directed them to do, and to swallow all the blatant lies and charades, and mayber even earn some", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:58:0de057201a0c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 59, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 59, "text": "Roosevelt had as President.

Hence Mills was “huddled” with them when he had no legitimate reason to be, except to bribe them and make sure they did what they were told. Needless to say, this juggernaut of depravity progressed into a fraudulent probate charade. This included giving acceptance to fictional and impossible autopsies alleged by Jordan, even the Stanford labs. The organs of Jane Stanford had been disposed of in Honolulu after having the strychnine extracted from them. They no longer existed and surely the trustees and executors knew this. Mills had what was most crucially required to make their plan a success. With his well-heeled California connections, he knew how to get things done there, and he had the money to do it. He could bribe whomever was needed, most particularly the staff of the Pacific Union Club where the poisoning of Isaac Requa was essential. As a man of great wealth and also a Pacific Union Club member, he could surely get that done with a few snaps of his fingers. These conclusions are now quite clear and new facts continue to clarify. In 1983 when I reported the findings at Stanford of Van Dyke in Hawaii about Jordan and Mills being the conspirators in Jane Stanford’s poisoning, there was no other public domain evidence of Mills’ role as a participant, let alone as a principal, in the murders. At that time Dr. Cutler had not even revived the criminally-suppressed inquest verdict of murder. We can say in light of Stanford’s behavior from 1983 to the present that Stanford, among its higher administration, apparently knew about Mills’ role in the murder. Stanford’s top administration had assuredly known this in 1905 when Jordan had committed his flagrant crimes to suppress the inquest findings. . Thus there is the issue of Stanford culpability in very serious crimes that in fact have occurred. Another major issue involve the extent of the “cabal” that took over Stanford. Here the focus of interest is very much in the public interest. At issue are the means by which that cabal acts contrary to the law and in violation of the interests of “We the People.” It can only be asserted in this book, and for all Stanford alumni, students, and faculty that this cabal, a primary criminal syndicate in the world, operates with little regard to the law.

They do what they think they can get away with, which until now has been almost everything. The events detailed are of the greatest relevance to all US citizens, and to the world, that the cabal must not be allowed to continue: the murders of Jane Stanford and Isaac Requa, the crimes against Banner related shareholders, their Federal Reserve Bank, their wars-for-profit, their assassinations, their psychological war. Thanks to Dr. Cutler and to Robert Van Dyke the truth may been revealed. The genie cannot be put back in the bottle. Darius Ogden Mills involvement in Jane Stanford’s murder was somehow uncovered by Van Dyke in Hawaii and Dr. Cutler set it lose upon the world. The truth in these matters must now be faced – to the very great benefit of “We the People.” January 14, 1905 – San Francisco. In her mansion on Nob Hill, Jane Stanford becomes violently sick after drinking mineral water. Tests show the presence of strychnine, brucine and other chemicals indicative of the mineral water having been laced with rodent poison. Spooked after surviving the attempt on her life, Mrs Stanford sails for Japan via Hawaii. February 28, 1905 – Moana Hotel, Honolulu. After drinking a glass of bicarbonate of soda, Mrs Stanford cries out to her secretary, Bertha Berner, to run for the doctor. She complains of having no control of her body and, “I think I have been poisoned again.” Three doctors attend almost immediately, but Mrs Stanford is dead within 25 minutes. Her hands, legs and feet are noted to be distorted in the classical intense, rigid spasm of strychnine poisoning. March 6-9, 1905 – A Coroners Inquest is held at the Moana Hotel. The jury hears testimony of Bertha Berner and Mrs Stanford’s maid, May Hunt, the three physicians, Drs Humphris, Day and Murray who attended Mrs Stanford during the emergency, Drs Shorey and Duncan who performed the toxicological analyses and Dr Wood who performed the autopsy. March 10, 1905 – Dr. Jordan arrives in Honolulu, accompanied by university trustee Timothy Hopkins, detective Reynolds of the San Francisco Police Department, and Captain Jules Callundan of the Morse Detective Agency. Jordan had already started his plan of disinformation and denial before he departed San Francisco. On arrival he and Hopkins now begin in earnest to suppress the Coroner’s Jury murder verdict, start a libel campaign against Hawaii physicians and toxicologists, and March 15, 1905 – Jordan drafts a statement", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:60:4949dc38e0b1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 61, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 61, "text": "10, 1905 – Dr. Jordan arrives in Honolulu, accompanied by university trustee Timothy Hopkins, detective Reynolds of the San Francisco Police Department, and Captain Jules Callundan of the Morse Detective Agency.

On arrival he and Hopkins now begin in earnest to suppress the Coroner’s Jury murder verdict, start a libel campaign against Hawaii physicians and toxicologists, and March 15, 1905 – Jordan drafts a statement for the press that after careful consideration of all facts there was no evidence that Mrs. Stanford died of strychnine poisoning (outright fraud), that over-exertion and over-eating led to her demise. He attributes the presence of strychnine in the soda as a pharmacist’s error. He instructs Stanford alumnus, Judge Carl Smith, to release the statement after the Stanford party has sailed. He also instructs Smith to release a statement to the Associated Press that Miss Berner had taken the same dose of bicarbonate as Mrs. Stanford and had suffered no ill effects. This fabricated story was later retracted. Finally, in an interview with a reporter he states that Dr. Humphris and the other doctors knew nothing about strychnine poisoning and were deficient othe scientific side. March 21, 1905 – Jordan writes Stanford University Board President Samuel Leib to say that if the tonic theory of the strychnine/bicarbonate mixture is not acceptable, the alternative is to suggest that Dr. Humphris invented the diagnosis of strychnine poisoning and put it in the soda after Mrs. Stanfords death. Having made a diagnosis of poisoning, he laced the soda with strychnine to bolster his diagnosis. Jordan describes the highly competent and well respected Dr Humphris as a man of “no personal or professional reputation”. March 23,1905 – Jordan writes Stanford alumnus Judge Carl Smith that he is certain of his theory about the soda and requests he keep an eye on Humphris and Murray. At the time Smith is a Hawaii legislator. In these three letters and press statement, Jordan has managed to smear Humphris as an ignorant, disreputable and felonious physician. March 29, 1905 – Isaac Requa dies from poisoning after having lunch at the Pacific Union Club in San Francisco. Thallium or arsenic is suspected. It now appears that he had previously been poisoned around the same time as the first attempt on Jane’s life in mid-January, but, like Jane, he survived that attempt. Neither of the two events concerning Isaac were attributed to poisoning at the time, irrespective of the onset of symptoms of great disability suggestive of poisoning immediately after food consumption. The first occasion being from drinking a glass of milk provided him while out on business with a client of the bank of which he was President.

His sudden collapse on that occasion was reported in the newspapers as resulting from drinking “ice cold milk while overheated on the hot day”. This recalls Jordan’s initial diagnosis on Jane Stanford as having suffered her demise from over-eating and over-exertion on a picnic on a hot day. The second, and fatal, poisoning of Isaac occurred just two days after Jane’s funeral. March 25 - April 15, 1905 – Jordan exchanges letters with Humphris, Waterhouse, Shorey and Carl Smith concerning his statement to the press that Jane Stanford had not died of strychnine poisoning. Humphris discovers that Waterhouse consulted with Jordan and accuses him of unethical conduct. In April, when the Honolulu doctors are threatening to expose Dr Waterhouse in the medical journals, he gives up his medical practice and sails for Ceylon (presumably with a sizeable fee from Stanford) to set up a rubber tree plantation. May 26, 1905 – Stanford University officials issue a statement that re-examination of Jane Stanford’s organs in their laboratories reveals no evidence of poison, upholding Jordan’s conviction of death by natural causes. The organs in which strychnine would concentrate, however, had already been chopped up, boiled and liquefied in Honolulu in order to extract the poison. All that remained had been poured down a morgue drain. Stanford had the heart, but that was an organ which was known not to concentrate strychnine. The executors suggest that no result can come from Welton Stanfords reward as the theory of death by natural causes first advanced by Dr Jordan has been confirmed. The executors concurring with the fictitious re-examination are, of course, closely linked to Jordan. December 27, 1905 – Jordan receives the first of two letters from Jared Smith, head of the Hawaii Agricultural Experiment Station. The letters vilify toxicologist Edmund Shorey, claiming he has given fraudulent testimony in the Stanford case and, later, that he has been dismissed from government service. Smiths charges are all false (most likely having been requested by Jordan). December 31, 1905 – Jordan is quoted in a newspaper interview and states that the Honolulu physicians and police officials were involved in a conspiracy to extort money from the Stanford estate. Although he later denies this report, it is known that he harbored the conspiracy idea as early as April 1905. As described by Dr. Cutler, Jordan’s account “borders on fiction.” He describes Dr. Humphris as having been “drugged and dazed,” Dr. Shorey, the toxicologist as having been “dismissed for fraudulent reporting,” and Elizabeth Richmond, the maid in San Francisco,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:62:3ec12c2c200b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 63, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "and states that the Honolulu physicians and police officials were involved in a conspiracy to extort money from the Stanford estate.

The memorandum is copied to a number of files and individuals, including the president of the Stanford Historical Society and the Stanford University Archivist. The memorandum [in Photograph/Document section] summarizes information provided to Sylvester by this writer, Stanford alumnus Stephen H. Requa, who had been informed by Honolulu historian Robert Van Dyke that he possessed documentary evidence showing Jordan’s involvement in Jane Stanford’s murder. Stanford undertook no reported investigation of record on Van Dyke’s claims, but the details of the information provided by Requa were paraphrased and ridiculed on a Stanford website seen by Cutler and Requa much later in 2003. 2001-2004 – Dr. Robert W.P. Cutler, M.D. researches and collaborates extensively with Stephen Requa following Cutler’s discovery of the Sylvester Memorandum on Van Dyke and Requa in Stanford Archives. Cutler provides Requa with that memorandum and thereafter all on-going documentation in his research in + 300 emails. March 30, 2004 – Dr. Cutler writes that an “obvious second victim” in Mrs Stanford’s poisoning was Isaac L. Requa, the writer’s great-grandfather, who died shortly after Jane Stanford’s funeral. Isaac was Stanford-family related and President of the Stanford-originating Central Pacific Railroad from the time of Leland Stanford’s death in 1894 until own death – by murder – in 1905. The railroad had 420 locomotives, 8000 freight cars and 1500 miles of track. 2010-2016 – Investigations by Stanford Reconsidered, as based on the extensive documentation and leads provided by Dr. Cutler from 2001 until his death in 2004.

The conspiracy was deemed to have included then U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and Whitelaw Reid (whom Roosevelt appointed U.S. Ambassador to U.K. the day before the Hawaii Inquest Ruling), E.H. Harriman of the Southern Pacific Railroad (who coveted and then obtained Isaac Requa’s Central Pacific Railroad) and John D. Rockefeller, who wished for covert control of Stanford University via Jordan. They were all proponents of eugenics, as essentially founded in U.S. academic circles by David Starr Jordan with backing of Roosevelt, Harriman and Rockefeller. Also included in the scandal’s purview was formation of the Federal Reserve System. Wir stehen nicht allein: “We do not stand alone.” Nazi propaganda poster from 1936. The woman is holding a baby and the man is holding a shield inscribed with the title of Nazi Germany’s 1933 Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring (their compulsory sterilization law). The couple is in front of a map of Germany, surrounded by the flags of nations which had enacted (to the left) or were considering (bottom and to the right) similar legislation. “Hitler and his henchmen victimized an entire continent and exterminated millions in his quest for a so-called “Master Race.” But the concept of a white, blond-haired, blue-eyed master Nordic race didn’t originate with Hitler. The idea was created in the United States, and cultivated in California, decades before Hitler came to power. California eugenicists played an important, although little known, role in the American eugenics movement’s campaign for ethnic cleansing. “Eugenics was the racist pseudoscience determined to wipe away all human beings deemed “unfit,” preserving only those who conformed to a Nordic stereotype. Elements of the philosophy were enshrined as national policy by forced sterilization and segregation laws, as well as marriage restrictions, enacted in twenty-seven states. In 1909, California became the third state to adopt such laws. Ultimately, eugenics practitioners coercively sterilized some 60,000 Americans, barred the marriage of thousands, forcibly segregated thousands in “colonies,” and persecuted untold numbers in ways we are just learning.… “Eugenics would have been so much bizarre parlor talk had it not been for extensive financing by corporate philanthropies, specifically the Carnegie Institution, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Harriman railroad fortune.

Was he perhaps implying that he could get some of the answers (at least from “Science”) in his Stanford laboratory. rof. Eduard A. Ross, allied at Stanford with Jordan, was pressed his hatred of other races in strong and crude language in public speeches. Indeed, he objected to Chinese immigrant labor (on both economic and racial grounds). This position was at odds with the university’s founding family, the Stanfords, who had made their fortune in Western rail construction – a major employer of Chinese laborers. This was too much for Jane Stanford [who fired Ross in 1900]…. One of the most widely read books on the Race Suicide issue was The Old World in the New, by Ross. He believed in the conventional myth of Nordic supremacy and the need for a program of positive eugenics in order to preserve Anglo-Saxon Americanism against “pollution” through immigration … with a chapter showing how “Immigrant Blood” was slowly polluting the purer “American Blood.” Somewhat obsessed with race, Ross was convinced that “the blood being injected into the veins of our people was sub-human”; the newer immigrants were “morally below the races of northern Europe”; and that it all would end in “Race Suicide.” Did he determine in his Stanford laboratory, with or without Jordan, which racial samples of blood were “morally below” or above any of the others? In any event, Jane Stanford had Ross, a Jordan protégé, fired for these expressed sentiments in 1900.

In any event, Jane Stanford had Ross, a Jordan protégé, fired for these expressed sentiments in 1900. Today, we can assume that if Ross made these declarations in Germany, for example, he would be arrested – the propagation of eugenics (aka Nazism) there being a crime. But the “old boys” at the time in academia in various places cried foul on “Academic Freedom.” Roosevelt continued to correspond about these matters with Ross long after Ross’ firing and was already on close terms with Jordan by 1902 (as seen in letters) when Jordan published Blood of a Nation. There is a good case to be made that Jordan may have knowingly contrived his eugenicist/racist theories and quite gross “scientific” frauds to pander to Roosevelt’s virulent racism. In any case, it was an opportunity for Jordan to pander to and manipulate TR with his virulent racism. Jordan had already been pandering for years to large money interests hostile to Jane Stanford e.g. railroad magnate Collis Huntington, President of Southern Pacific Railroad (with whom both Stanfords had been feuding bitterly and publicly through the 1890s surrounding Central Pacific matters). Since the firing of Professor Ross in 1900, it may be deemed certain that Jordan was evolving contingency plans to avert by any means possible that fate for himself. He thus laid plans, if need be, to eliminate Jane Stanford and to seize full control of the University – while creating the big money and political connections with their combined clout for him to remain immune to any consequences. Feeding the racist fervor of Theodore Roosevelt, to be sure, would be one such obvious means. clout for him to retain his position at Stanford, come what may. As owner/publisher of the New York Tribune, the largest U.S. newspaper, and the political “voice” of Roosevelt and the Republican Party, Reid may likely have provided the original contact for Jordan with Roosevelt in New York. Reid was a Stanford University Trustee and, allegedly, an Executor of Jane Stanford’s Estate. His father-in-law was Darius Ogden Mills, formerly California’s richest man before Mill’s daughter married Reid and moved to New York City. Reid was also, like Roosevelt, a staunch white-supremacist in no uncertain political and rhetorical terms in his newspaper editorials – also warning in “Race Suicide” jargon of the impending “calamity” from an influx, for example, of Puerto Rican “inferior mixed-race blood.” The “enemy” he wrote (the Puerto Rican mixed-breed and “half-savages”) were at “the gate” ready to “breach the citadel.” Thus, when the “necessity” did arise to eliminate Jane Stanford in 1905 before she could fire", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt:66:3b5d64ca5a05", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 67, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634240340", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634240345_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "to New York City.

Both Roosevelt’s “Race Suicide” political demagoguery and his personal racist fervor had been structured some years back in 1900 around David Starr Jordan’s and Eduard Ross’ pseudo-science racist eugenics (that was to morph into the ideology of the Nazis). Moreover, a planned push to enact forced-sterilization and mixedrace marriage bans in 27 states was at stake – starting right then in 1905 – just as Jane was deciding to fire Jordan. Thus Jane had to go. Most essentially to preserve Jordan’s “pulpit,” where his and “Nature’s” and “Society’s” reasons or “recognitions” (or not) for “excuses for existence” could simply be declared and promulgated ex cathedra by Jordan for the Foundations with the big money, and then for legislators and legislatures across the country – no questions asked (unless Jordan had gotten fired). Without Jordan in his university pulpit pronouncing bogus “scientific” legitimacy for their racist fervors those legislations would likely all have failed. The non-existent and/or fake eugenics data would have accomplished nothing without the bluff of Jordan at Stanford (with the many pretensions and frauds he embodied). Equally calamitously and threatening their Murder Syndicate in 1905, Reid’s position as the “voice” of Roosevelt and the Republican Party through his New York Tribune would also be in jeopardy. T. Roosevelt could easily tell Reid, Jordan, Mills and all involved what to do. All these matters TR would need to get done through them. Thus, for all these White-Supremacists, and for their Republican Party “eugenics” Legislative Agendas to proceed unrecognized – for the grossest, greatest, and most long-enduring national, political, financial, and scientific data frauds that they were to become, and to preserve their criminal political machine intact through Jordan at Stanford – Jane Stanford had to go. For them all combined, especially with TR on the stump or in the White House, it was easy to do (to murder Jane) and to keep it covered up – until now. Jordan’s mistress, Bertha Berner, also Jane Stanford’s Secretary, simply gave Jane a half gram of strychnine in Honolulu – and “presto” 65,000 forced sterilizations were kept on track.

Jordan’s personal and scientifically fraudulent solicitudes paid off well. For the twenty years before and after 1913/1914, the total sum was in the many hundreds of millions of dollars! Where in fact did those many hundreds of millions of dollars in Foundations’ funds go? It went for what the Carnegie Institute later in 1939 determined was “worthless” research they had funded for more than 20 years. Some of it went (very unlawfully) into paying lobbyists to push Republican Party bills to enact fraudulently-based eugenics laws in at least 27 states. Where else did it go? To whom? There is much more to account for. Several hundred million dollars did not go for just some Republican Party lobbyists and “worthless” and non-existent data. It assuredly went to, and greatly enriched, certain individuals. Aside from being murderers, Jordan and Roosevelt created the greatest, most costly, most long-enduring, and most criminal scientific, financial, and political frauds in history with incalculable costs in human suffering. That it continues still is shown by a Los Angeles Times front page report: http:// articles.latimes.com/2012/ian/25/nation/la-na-forced-sterilization-20120126 This the world primarily owes to the U.S. Republican Party – having provided the rationale and the methodologies of Adolf Hitler. Stanford Reconsidered began its on-line Stanford-based pub-lications of articles and opinions in 2003 in association with Robert W.P. Cutler, M.D. on the occasion of the publication by the Stanford Press of his volume The Mysterious Death of Jane Stanford. That volume had one central and simple objective: to restore the Hawaii State Inquest and Coroner’s Jury verdict of the death of Jane Stanford in February of 1905 by strychnine poisoning. It was also to show the evidence, with very minimal comment by Dr. Cutler, on Stanford’s then-President David Starr Jordon in assiduously covering up and suppressing that verdict while alleging her death to have been from heart disease. In the process, Jordan alleged two other completely impossible autopsies on Jane Stanford, one even in Stanford labs that allegedly showed no strychnine in Mrs. Stanford’s internal organs (that no longer even existed).

Dr. Cutler’s book has since become the universally accepted truth in this matter. By the time of Dr. Cutler’s death, we had mutually concluded, privately, that Jane Stanford was poisoned by Jane Stanford’s Secretary Bertha Berner at the Hotel Moana in Honolulu in a conspiracy with Stanford’s President David Starr Jordan. Dr. Cutler could easily have made many most damning of comments and conclusions about Jordan’s behavior and acts over several years and most particularly right after Jane Stanford’s death. Indeed, any all-inclusive review now of the timeline Cutler established for Jordan’s well-evidenced actions could hardly avoid identifying many very serious criminal offenses of obstructions of justice and conspiracy “to pervert the course of justice” as it might be phrased in England. This conclusion for us re-enforced by our discovery and ascertaining of a $100 million bribe paid to “TR” in 1912 by Rockefeller for “throwing” the 1912 election to Woodrow Wilson by running as a Bull Moose third party candidate. This was so Woodrow Wilson, a puppet of Rockefeller/Rothschild, would be assured as President to sign the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. The $100 million had been paid to the Eugenics Research Office (the ERO) as ostensible donations. Jordan and Roosevelt were the founders and real power behind the ERO, and the $100 million “donations” were then passed on from the organization to Roosevelt as bribes. The possibility that some made its way into the pocket of Woodrow Wilson cannot be discounted. “TR” could not possibly have won the 1912 election. He just established himself as a spoiler to insure the election of Woodrow Wilson to sign, for Rockefeller/Rothschild, the Federal Reserve Act. By this time in 1912, Whitelaw Reid, having finished his assignment to liaise in London with Rothschild in drafting the Federal Reserve Act, dropped dead. Stanford Reconsidered ascertained all these aspects of the 1905 murders, based on Cutler’s evidence and data, but only beginning in 2012. The “clincher” for reaching these conclusions, and now for establishing the final outcome of the Stanford/Requa murders of 1905, was provided by the evidence from Stanford Professor Julius Goebel from 1904 onward. It was his letters to Jane Stanford in 1904 that set her on the path to firing Jordan – which Jordan and the Rockefellers and Rothschilds had to prevent by any means. The contingency plans to poison Jane Stanford had long been formulated.

They were then rushed to get Darius Ogden Mills and Whitelaw Reid to Stanford as quickly as possible to enforce the charade by Jordan et al., that Jane Stanford had died of heart disease. Mills and Reid were necessary to suppress the Hawaii Inquest ruling of murder by strychnine poisoning, hence Reid’s Ambassadorial appointment was made just the day before the expected Inquest ruling (and as expected of death by strychnine poisoning). Mills’ primary task was then to arrange the poisoning of Isaac Requa during his lunch at the Pacific Union Club two days after Jane Stanford’s funeral, while Reid and Jordan browbeat the Trustees and Executors to disregard the Hawaii State inquest ruling of murder by strychnine poisoning. The final all-inclusive verdict on these 1905 murders can be stated based on the letters of Prof. Julius Goebel to Jane Stanford. In one such letter on June 6, 1904, he wrote: “Events, such as the Gilbert affair, which called for concerted action for the purpose of “whitewashing” one of their members brought the [Jordan] “clique” together still closer.… For there are men at this University who are entirely out of place in an institution like ours. They are kept here, as I know on good authority, solely for the purpose of doing the detestable work of detectives among the students and faculty.” From a contemporary perspective, with that observation in mind, we might conclude that the campus was intensively “under surveillance” for the needs of a Jordan-allied Rockefeller/Rothschild-funded clique with covert and nefarious purposes. Goebel compared this clique to gangs in inner cities. The Jane Stanford murder was in fact a coup with the backing of the U S. President, Roosevelt, and John D. Rockefeller. Perhaps the first coup, a domestic one on Stanford University, by corrupt U.S. Federal power as controlled by Rockefeller, TR, and Rothschild. Who employed these 1904-1905 “ops” on the Stanford Campus? Assuredly not Jordan on his Stanford academic scale of pay. “TR” Roosevelt? Perhaps. But far more likely the Rothschilds and Rockefeller. What the “ops” on campus were insuring and enforcing was the evident already-established control of Stanford University (through their puppet Jordan) by 1904 by the Rockefeller/ Rothschild cabal. This conclusion is pervasively re-affirmed by the charade at Stanford in 1905 that Jordan performed as evidenced in Dr. Cutler’s Timeline after their murder of Jane Stanford.

Jordan, with Reid as the suddenly appointed Ambassador to the Court of St. James, could easily browbeat all the Executors and Trustees to sit on their hands and keep their mouths shut while Jordan with Mills and Reid made absurd pronouncements that a 2nd (and then 3rd) autopsy in Stanford labs and elsewhere had found no evidence of strychnine in Jane Stanford’s internal organs. One reason, of course, that they couldn’t find any strychnine in them was because Jane Stanford’s internal organs no longer existed. They had been consumed, as Dr. Cutler pointed out to us in 2003, in the one-and-only autopsy in Honolulu. For the Jordan/Mills/Reid charade, however, they concluded for the record that Jordan was right: Stanford labs could find no strychnine in Jane Stanford’s non-existent internal organs. If Dr. Cutler had wished to, he could have damned Jordan and Stanford explicitly and conclusively for many of the most serious criminal offenses possible, simply by annotating the events in his Timeline. Had he done so, needless to say, his book would not have been published by the Stanford Press. The Stanford administration would have got the word and stomped on the publication. Instead, Dr. Cutler could make his private conclusions in these matters to us alone in his emails. These included his conclusion, with many others, that Jordan had a relationship with Bertha Berner, and that she was the obvious poisoner of Jane Stanford for Jordan, and that Isaac Requa was “the obvious 2nd victim.” Cutler could easily have vented his total contempt for Jordan’s evident very serious crimes and for Stanford covering up for them and “worshiping” Jordan. But if he had done so, his book would not have been published and there never would have been front page nationally-syndicated articles about him and his publication by the Los Angeles Times and many others, as attached. By withholding many of his conclusions from his book, Dr Cutler kept his powder dry for very good reasons, but it is those readily reached conclusions about the serious crimes by Jordan to obstruct justice in a murder – and especially in context with the Prof. Goebel’s letter to Jane Stanford – that will now make the final verdict on the murders of 1905.

Little did the party realize the extent of the danger which had threatened them earlier until this morning as railroad officials began transporting passengers toward Willits in motor speeders. About nine miles south there suddenly loomed a scene that struck terror in the hearts of all for three hundred feet of track hung suspended in mid air above the river. A few hours after the train had passed Thursday night, the slide had begun to take formation. When my mother, decades ago, gave me a copy of Hanson’s article she talked about the stress that she had endured during the traumatic event, foremost of course worrying about the imminent danger in which the passengers and train crew found themselves, and also about her two small children being hungry due to the small amount of food that was available for the three days. The personal significance of this intense experience for me was brought home in a recent article by Hemley Gonzalez, “Science has a New Explanation for Homosexuality,” published on May 7, 2017, at unitedhumanists. com. The article was based on a TED talk given by medical doctor James O’Keefe. O’Keefe had an 18-year old son who had come out publicly as gay. As his father, O’Keefe “wondered about the genetic and evolutionary factors that made his son gay.” Gonzalez wrote that “epigenetics basically states that similar genes express themselves in different ways based on external circumstances.” O’Keefe declared in his TED talk found at https://youtu.be/4Khn_z9FPmU that: “If the family is flush with plenty of kids and/or it’s a stressful place in time, nature occasionally flips these epigenetic switches to turn on the gay genes. This alters brain development that changes sexual orientation.” I was born gay, my sexual orientation having been determined three months previously by the stress endured by my mother in a harrowing experience that lasted three days, one that she remembered her entire life. In the back of my mind I have a feeling that she gave me the Hanson article because she and my father had come to realize that I was gay through no choice of my own. While they were alive we never discussed the subject of my sexual orientation, and I never publicly acknowledged that I was gay until after their deaths, not wanting to embarrass them in any way. None of my brothers and sisters are gay, nor are any of their children.

None of my brothers and sisters are gay, nor are any of their children. So this is my story of being an eyewitness to history, born gay, and as a result, having to overcome the immense difficulties encountered in being dealt such a hand in life. Among these was my being targeted for murder because of my sexual orientation by military intelligence Agent Carl Shoffler under the Huston Plan in the early days of the Watergate scandal, who also feared that I knew too much, not only about Watergate, but also the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This was because of what my close friend, Howard Hunt, a key figure in both historical scandals, might have told me about the role of military intelligence and the CIA in both events. But I am getting ahead of my story. Both my mother and father were born in the early 1900s. My mother was raised on rural land that is now the Nashville, Tennessee airport, and my father grew up in sparsely populated Wyoming, attending a one room school with 25 students, half of whom were Indians. He rode to school on horseback. He later attended Stanford University from which he graduated with a degree in chemistry in the early years of the Great Depression and soon got a job with Shell Chemical Company. During World War II the government exempted him from military service because he was a key chemist at the Torrance, California plant of Shell Chemical that manufactured synthetic tires for our armed forces. My two brothers and two sisters and I at the time attended public schools in the Long Beach area. I had an Aunt Nina who lived in Hollywood, just off Hollywood Boulevard and four blocks from Hollywood and Vine. I stayed with her and my uncle frequently during the war years and we would occasionally go to the movies at the neighborhood theaters: Graumann’s Chinese, The Egyptian and the Pantages. My aunt was a member of the Hollywood Beverly Christian Church that was directly across the street from where she lived on Gramercy Place. Ronald Reagan attended services at the church. In 1946 when I was eight years old my aunt decided to take me to the Spiritualist Church in Hollywood. At one point in the service she had me stand on a chair and asked the spiritualist to predict my future. I can still see the scene in my mind’s eye these many years later.

The spiritualist looked at me for a full minute and then pronounced that I would never reach society’s first level to become a national leader, but would reach the level directly underneath where I would know and work with many who did and witness how the world works. In late 1954 two local activists, Kent and Phoebe Courtney, announced that they were holding a public meeting in a pavilion in Audubon Park to enlist citizens who opposed the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy pending before the U.S. Senate. Our residence was only a few blocks from Audubon Park, so I decided to attend as my parents admired McCarthy’s spirited fighting against communism. An enthusiastic crowd of about 40 persons attended the Courtneys’ meeting and assignments were handed out. My assignment was to set up a card table in the plaza in front of St. Louis Cathedral in the French Quarter to collect signatures on a petition that opposed the censure of McCarthy as part of a national petition drive headed by General Bonner Fellers. I had little difficulty in collecting signatures as the Catholics who attended services at the Cathedral were sympathetic towards McCarthy who was a fellow Catholic. A few months later Kent and Phoebe announced they were starting a monthly conservative publication, Free Men Speak, which subsequently became The Independent American. I volunteered to work on the publication after high school. As a result Kent started taking me to meetings such as Toastmasters International and to a radio station where he had a weekly radio show. Several times during the period of 1955-1956, while still in a high school student, I would accompany Kent to meetings with Guy Banister, a former FBI agent, then Assistant Supervisor of the New Orleans Police Department. The topic at these meetings was the extent of organized crime in the city and more particularly the efforts of the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans headed by Aaron Kohn to combat it. So how did Lee Harvey Oswald manage to enter into the picture during this period? Well, he was living with his mother in the Vieux Carre section of the French Quarter, less than a five minute walk from Banister’s office. Oswald was then about 16 years old and enrolled in a different high school than the one I attended. During his early childhood and adolescence in New Orleans, Lee Oswald lived with his divorced mother at a number of different locations, usually in small rented houses or apartments in a moderate-to-lower-income section", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:2:f6b5a643b444", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 76, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "during this period?

During his early childhood and adolescence in New Orleans, Lee Oswald lived with his divorced mother at a number of different locations, usually in small rented houses or apartments in a moderate-to-lower-income section of the city. While the record of residences is not complete, one address was 126 Exchange Alley. During her testimony before the Warren Commission, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald indicated that she and her son lived there when Oswald was about to 16-years old, roughly the years 1955-56. They were “living at 126Ex− change Place, which is the Vieux Carre section of the French Quarter of New Orleans.” During her testimony, Mrs. Oswald noted that “the papers said we lived over a saloon at that particular address … that is just the French part of town. It looks like the devil. Of course I didn’t have a fabulous apartment. But very wealthy people and very fine citizens live in that part of town.” … While Mrs. Oswald correctly noted that “wealthy” citizens resided in some sections of the French Quarter, Exchange Alley was well known as the location of other elements; it was an area notorious for illicit activities. As the managing director of the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans, Aaron Kohn recalled, “Exchange Alley, specifically that little block that Oswald lived on, was literally the hub of some of the most notorious underworld joints in the city.” He noted further that Exchange Alley was the location of various gambling operations affiliated with the Marcello organization. Noting the openness with which such activities were conducted there, Kohn said, “You couldn’t walk down the block without literally being exposed to two or three separate forms of illicit activities and underworld operations.”1 In1959, a New Orleans man, Richard C. Bell, in conjunction with a Chicago group, organized a group of students to attend the 1959 World Youth Conference in Vienna. His plans attracted opposition from the local American Legion, especially Kent Courtney, Festus Brown and James Pfister. The Legion organized a Free Enterprise Seminar “to alert local college students to the dangers involved in attending the communist-sponsored World Youth Festival in Vienna.” Speakers at the seminar include Guy Banister, Medford Evans and Douglas Caddy. Bell and his group did make it to Vienna.2 In 1963 President John Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Oswald was branded the alleged assassin.

Years later I ended up representing Howard Hunt, an alleged key figure in the assassination, who claimed that Lyndon Baines Johnson was at the top of the conspiracy. Later, I also was destined to represent Billie Sol Estes, LBJ’s bagman and silent business partner, who maintained to his death that LBJ killed JFK. n 1956, after graduating from high school, I enrolled at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., the oldest Catholic and Jesuit university in the country. My ultimate goal was to join the country’s diplomatic corps. I was a Protestant and so was the first student that I met, Tongsun Park, who was from a wealthy Korean family. He had an engaging personality and our talk soon turned to campus politics. With two other newly enrolled students we formed “The Four Freshmen” and in a class election Tongsun was elected president of the freshman class and I was elected class treasurer. Tongsun years later was the major figure in the Koreagate scandal that followed on the heels of Watergate in which a number of members of Congress were implicated and resigned – one went to prison. Still later Tongsun got caught up in a scandal involving the buying and selling of oil from Saddam’s Iraq and was sent to prison. In my sophomore year I became class president and editor of the Foreign Service Courier, the school’s student publication. I never met John F. Kennedy, but he did enter my life for a brief moment in a most unusual way. Three of the girls on the Courier’s staff had baked a birthday cake and planned to surprise me with it at a staff meeting. Senator Kennedy and Jackie lived on N St., N.W., just a few blocks from the university’s campus. By chance Senator Kennedy came out of his Georgetown townhouse just as the girls walked by and seeing them carrying the cake inquired what the occasion was. Once that was explained to him to the shock and delight of the girls he took a finger and pushed it part way into the cake, tasted it and pronounced the cake “delicious.” Then with a smile and a wave of his hand JFK entered his vehicle and was driven away. The girls were beside themselves with excitement when they arrived shortly thereafter at the Courier’s office, and we sat around for awhile trying to figure how the cake could be preserved for posterity.

In the end the cake was eaten and since it was my birthday I got the piece that bore the hole where JFK’s finger entered. Today I wonder if I got some of JFK’s DNA in me when I ate that piece, since beyond the grave he has continued to play a role in my life. In my second year at Georgetown I was offered a part-time working scholarship at Human Events, the conservative publication. The conservative movement at that time was non-existent. David Franke, my roommate who was also a scholarship holder at Human Events, and I believed that a national conservative movement could be organized and to achieve this we decided to form the National Student Committee for the Loyalty Oath to keep the oath in the National Defense Education Act. Senator John Kennedy was sponsor of legislation to remove it. The New York Times published a letter-to-editor on February 5, 1960, that I wrote about our group’s effort that brought us some publicity, some favorable and some not. Gerald Johnson wrote a scathing article in The New Republic titled, “A Plea for Servility.” William Shannon, columnist for the New York Post, interviewed Franke and me and by his reaction we could tell that he was surprised at how dedicated we were to our mission. I received letters from around the country addressed to me c/o Georgetown University that prompted the Jesuit Vice President of the university to open my mail without permission and to initial it after doing so before I got it. He did this until a large envelop arrived in the mail bearing a letter from Republican Senator Styles Bridges of New Hampshire, who enclosed a copy of the Congressional Record that contained a speech that he had made on the floor of the Senate endorsing our Committee. Thereafter he ceased opening mail addressed to me. It was one thing to run roughshod over a mere student, and yet another to be caught illegally opening personal mail sent to him by a powerful U.S. Senator.

The formation of our committee in 1958 put Franke and me in contact with several dozen other students and young people around the country who considered themselves conservative. In 1959, when it was widely acknowledged that Richard Nixon would be the GOP Presidential candidate the next year, Franke and I formed Youth for Goldwater for Vice President as our next step towards creating a national conservative movement. After I made a speech publicizing our group the Washington Star carried an article titled, “A Solid Goldwater Caddy.” In my senior year at Georgetown I worked with Forrest Davis on a book opposing the admission of Communist China into the United Nations. Davis was a prominent author and longtime writer for The Saturday Evening Post. The Texas oil magnate H.L. Hunt at one time visited Davis and Davis asked if I wanted to be interviewed by Hunt for a position in his Facts Forum organization. However, in doing so Davis described H. L. Hunt to me as “having the mind of a brute,” and a result I turned down Hunt’s offer of employment after we had the interview. In retrospect I am glad I did so – for many reasons. Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1960, I went to work for Marvin Liebman Associates in New York City in charge of the McGraw-Edison Company account. Marvin had arranged funding for the book on which Forrest Davis and I worked. One of Marvin’s key clients was former New Jersey Democratic Governor Charles Edison, the chairman of McGraw-Edison Company, who lived in the Towers of the Waldorf Astoria. His neighbors in the Towers were Herbert Hoover and General Douglas MacArthur with whom he occasionally played bridge. Governor Edison, who had served in the Roosevelt Administration as Secretary of the Navy, was the son of Thomas Edison and looked exactly like his father. His political philosophy was that the American eagle should have two strong wings, a right wing and a left wing, if it is to fly and soar. He believed the country’s right wing at the time was too weak and needed strengthening. One memorable experience in 1961 was being invited by Governor Edison to join him and William Buckley to tour Thomas Edison’s famous laboratories in West Orange, New Jersey.

One memorable experience in 1961 was being invited by Governor Edison to join him and William Buckley to tour Thomas Edison’s famous laboratories in West Orange, New Jersey. As our limousine was driven through Manhattan en route to New Jersey we passed a townhouse that caused Buckley to shiver visibly. Both Governor Edison and I were surprised and asked what had caused this and he responded: “There is where Ayn Rand lives.” Buckley was one of Rand’s most vehement critics not only for her extreme view of cutthroat free enterprise but for her outspoken atheism. Buckley was an avowed practicing Catholic. With a donation of four hundred dollars from Governor Edison, our Youth for Goldwater for Vice President Organization opened headquarters in the Pick Congress Hotel during the July 1960 Republican National Convention in Chicago at which Nixon was nominated for president. The New York Times carried an article about our effort there in which I was characterized as a “young fogey” The mass media did not foresee that a groundswell for conservatism was in the making. Senator Goldwater came to our committee’s headquarters during the convention and urged us not to let the organization die but to form a permanent conservative youth group. Buckley was present and offered his family estate, Great Elm, in Sharon, Connecticut, to be the site for the founding of the new organization. I sent out a letter [copy in Appendix] to our small list of known young conservatives. Its letterhead was “Interim Committee For A National Conservative Youth Organization.” In September 1960, about 60 young conservatives from around the country gathered to found Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). I was elected as its National Director. Robert Schuchman, a brilliant student at Yale Law School, was elected chairman and Howard Phillips, president of the Harvard Student Council, was elected to the board of directors. While at the [1960 Republican National Convention] Buckley and Liebman met with Douglas Caddy and David Franke, both of whom attended as representatives of Youth for Goldwater for Vice President. Together, these four men would turn their disappointment in Goldwater’s loss [in not being nominated as Vice President] into a national conservative youth movement. Impressed by the passion of Caddy and Franke and their attempts to organize conservative youth in the past, including the creation of the Student Committee for the Loyalty Oath in 1958, Buckley and Liebman decided to mentor them. The loss of Goldwater for the Vice Presidential nomination convinced Buckley that young conservatives in the GOP needed to be fostered from the top down. He believed that young conservatives, with his guidance, could change the American political discourse.

He believed that young conservatives, with his guidance, could change the American political discourse. Consequently, Buckley hired Franke to intern at the National Review and Caddy worked for Liebman in public relations. Their first major task was to organize a national youth group for conservatives funded by Buckley. In September of 1960, on the Buckley family estate in Sharon, Connecticut, over 100 students from 44 different colleges and universities across the country assembled to devise a plan to capitalize on the growing conservatism of American youth and turn it into an organized political movement. The result created the Young Americans for Freedom, officially chartered on September 11, 1960, and the adoption of the Sharon Statement at the conference… Buckley announced the birth of the Young Americans for Freedom to his readership in the National Review and reaffirmed the dual goal of YAF as not only to establish chapters on college campuses across the nation but to also promote the truths manifested in the Sharon Statement. “Every chapter of YAF,” he wrote, “in every college will shape a program rooted in the principal concerns of its own campus; except that no one will be accepted as a member who does not endorse the Sharon Statement.” The Sharon Statement, like the New Left’s Port Huron Statement, announced YAF’s ultimate vision for the county. It contained the broad principles all young conservatives, Libertarians and Traditionalists, wanted to incorporate into a national political debate. More than anything, the Sharon Statement expressed a pronounced fear about the fate of the United States. It felt personal to young conservatives because they saw their futures hanging in the balance, as the US federal government continued to grow and Communism continued to spread across the world. Contrary to popular belief about the 1960’s and the New Right, the appeal of the Young Americans for Freedom was not simply a young conservative’s reply to the widely publicized Radical Left but an attempt to build a movement for young people, based on the ideals of the Sharon Statement.1 On March 3, 1961 YAF sponsored a Conservatives Rally at Manhattan Center on 34^(th) Street in Manhattan that had three thousand six hundred persons crammed inside the Center, which was its capacity, and another three thousand on the outside.

The rally marked the birth of the modern Conservative Movement. The rally led to more publicity about the burgeoning conservative movement and that same year The New Leader magazine carried an article about YAF with a picture of me on its cover. Life magazine in its June 9, 1961 issue published an article “A Liberal Meets Goldwater” in which Goldwater singled me out for special attention to interviewer Gore Vidal. This was heady stuff for someone who had only graduated from college the year before. Born March 23, 1938 in Long Beach, California, [Douglas] Caddy attended high school first in Houston, Texas and then in New Orleans, where he graduated in 1956. Caddy had admired Senator Joseph McCarthy, circulated petitions supporting McCarthy’s efforts in New Orleans while a sophomore in high school, and was an inveterate writer of letters to the editor in support of such conservative causes as the Bricker Amendment. He later became a volunteer worker for Phoebe and Kent Courtney’s early publication, Free Men Speak, which grew out of that petition drive. While YAF was quickly taking off as a powerful voice for conservatism, I faced a personal dilemma. The U.S. was not engaged in a war but nevertheless young men of my age were still being drafted. I had registered for the draft, but chose in June 1961 to join voluntarily the National Guard and saw active duty for six months at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and served in the U.S. Army Reserves for another seven and a half years until I received an Honorable Discharge at the end of my tour of duty. When I left for basic training Buckley sent me a long handwritten letter counseling me as to what After I was released from active duty in the Army in December 1961, I discovered the board of directors of YAF to be engaged in a bitter internal dispute. The issue was how close YAF’s relationship should be to the Young Republican National Federation. Those who favored a close relationship prevailed. This was dispiriting to me because I had always believed YAF’s purpose was to promote conservatism independently and not become an appendage of the Federation. So I ceased active participation in YAF, and in 1962 I enrolled in night school at New York University Law School.

During the day I worked in Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s private Manhattan office at 22 West 55^(th) Street, where I served on the staff of Lieutenant-Governor Malcolm Wilson, who was as conservative as Rockefeller was liberal. A memorable event occurred while I was working there. On November 22, 1963, I received a phone call from John Holmes, a close friend who was also an evening law school student at NYU. He worked in the daytime for a Wall Street financial firm. In an excited voice he told me in our brief 15 second phone conversation that he had just received news that President Kennedy had been shot in Dallas and then hung up. I walked thirty feet to the office of Lt.-Gov. Wilson and told him of Holmes’ call. He said, “Go downstairs to the press office and check on this.” So I rode on the elevator from the fifth floor to the ground floor where Governor Rockefeller had his press office. I entered and found only a receptionist on duty as Carl Spad, the press secretary, was out of the building at lunch. I blurted out: “President Kennedy has just been assassinated.” The receptionist gave me a look like I was out of my mind but did point to a closet. I went over to it, opened the door and found a Telex machine whose bells were ringing endlessly as it typed out the news of the assassination in Dallas. At this point the receptionist made a call to summon Spad back to the office. Rockefeller’s personal townhouse office on 55^(th) Street had only thirty employees. I walked through each floor alerting everyone of what had occurred. This is how the Rockefeller inner sanctum first heard the news of the Kennedy assassination, not from the famous Rockefeller intelligence organization but from a law school student who worked on the fifth floor for the Lieutenant Governor. While going to night law school and working during the day, I lived in a spectacular coop on East 72^(nd) Street owned by journalist Alice Widener that had sweeping views of Manhattan and the East River. I had written an article for Alice’s newsletter, USA, while still at Georgetown. Barron’s Financial Weekly often published articles by Alice and she had Robert Bleiberg, its editor, and James Dines of The Dines Letter as a frequent dinner guests.

Alice was a true unsung patriot. Upon graduating from law school I went to work for General Foods Corporation at its corporate headquarters in White Plains, New York. The company in 1969 sent me to Washington to be its Washington representative. For the first year I was to work out of the Robert Mullen Company, which General Foods had retained for years as its public relations firm. In 1970 Howard Hunt joined the Mullen Company staff, having been placed there by Richard Helms, the CIA director, upon Hunt’s alleged retirement from that agency. Hunt and I soon found we had Buckley as a friend in common: he was godfather to Hunt’s four children and had worked under Hunt as an agent for the CIA in Mexico City years earlier. Buckley had left Mexico City and returned to the U.S. to write God and Man at Yale, which became a famous book. It wasn’t until 1974 that I learned definitively from a Senate Watergate Committee supplementary report issued by Senator Howard Baker that the Mullen Company was a CIA front and had been incorporated by the CIA in 1959. My employer, General Foods Corporation, knew this, but kept the information from me on a need to know basis when I was transferred from its headquarters to Washington, D.C. to work out of the Mullen Company. I was outraged that the corporation had deliberately placed me as an innocent employee in a CIA front. In 1971 I left General Foods and became an attorney employed by the Washington law firm of Gall, Lane, Powell & Kilcullen. Hunt became an early client and Robert M. Scott, a partner of the law firm, and I represented him for more than a year on sundry personal legal matters. It was during this period that Hunt joined the White House staff upon the recommendation of Charles “Chuck” Colson, one of Nixon’s key advisers. Hunt and Colson both claimed Brown University as their alma mater and had bonded as members of the university’s alumni association. Hunt asked me to write a letter of reference to the White House to supplement Colson’s recommendation. I was pleased to be asked and promptly did so.

Hunt asked me to write a letter of reference to the White House to supplement Colson’s recommendation. I was pleased to be asked and promptly did so. Then the Watergate case broke on June 17, 1972. One casualty of the Watergate case would be that the Conservative Movement that I had been instrumental in founding evolved over the succeeding years into something far different from what its founders had envisioned. It got hijacked by hypocrites and opportunists, so that today I no longer consider myself a conservative. Carrying three heavy attaché cases, I entered the Pennsylvania Avenue door, showed my blue-and-white White House pass to the uniformed guards, and took the elevator to the third floor. I unlocked the door of 338 and went in. I opened my two-drawer safe, took out my operational handbook, found a telephone number and dialed it. The time was 2:13 in the morning of June 17, 1972, and five of my companions had been arrested and taken to the maximum-security block of the District of Columbia jail. I had recruited four of them and it was my responsibility to get them out. That was the sole focus of my thoughts as I began talking on the telephone. From the safe I took a small money box and removed the $10, 000 Liddy had given me for emergency use. I put $1, 500 in my wallet and the remaining $8, 500 in my coat pocket. The black attaché case containing McCord’s electronic equipment I placed in a safe drawer that held my operational notebook. Then I closed and locked the safe, turning the dial several times. The other two cases I left beside the safe, turned out the light and left my office, locking the door. H mind my entry in the case began indirectly two months earlier, in oward Hunt accurately describes how I got involved as his attorney in Watergate within hours after the burglars were arrested. Yet to my April 1972, when I was called into the office of John Kilcullen, a partner in the Washington law firm of Gall, Lane, Powell and Kilcullen where I worked. Kil- cullen, a loyal Republican as was I, declared, “Doug, our firm has been asked to volunteer an attorney to work for the Lawyers Committee for the Re-Election of the President and you are being volunteered. Call George Webster, the Committee’s chairman, and get your assignment.” So I called Webster, who told me to report to John Dean, Counsel to the President.

During my first meeting with John Dean in his White House office, shown on his appointment calendar as April 25, he gave me my first assignment. This was to research contributions to candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, one of whom was certain to oppose Richard Nixon in the November election. Over the next two months Dean gave me additional runof-the-mill legal assignments. The last one that his office gave me took me to syndicated columnist Jack Anderson to get any background information that Anderson might have not used in a recent newspaper column he wrote about Democratic Senator Edmund Muskie, one of the presidential contenders. This was on the day before the arrests of the burglars at Watergate. The significance of my doing volunteer work, under the direction of John Dean, beginning in April 1972 will become apparent as I relate here how Watergate evolved in the first weeks of the case, and how the ultimate outcome of the case could and should have been vastly different but for Dean. This will include Dean selecting me to be the first person approached to pass “hush money” to the five arrested burglars and to Hunt and Gordon Liddy, and my refusal to do so; Dean withholding vital information from President Nixon, as shown by the Oval Office tapes of July19 and 20, 1972, about my volunteer campaign work under Dean’s direction and his attempt to get me to distribute the hush money. This untold story of Watergate is vital history, because the entire case could have been resolved in the first month or so, had it not been for Dean devising a secret agenda for his own purpose to protect himself from the legal consequences of certain of his activities prior to Watergate, even if ultimately it meant the betrayal of President Nixon and of the nation. Dean tells his latest version of Watergate in his most recent book, The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It (Viking, 2014). The book’s publication was timed with the 40^(th) anniversary of President Nixon’s resignation. Critics of the book attacked it for being misleading and deficient in its history of the scandal. We shall have to wait and see if, somewhere down the road, Dean repudiates what he has written as he did with his first book, Blind Ambition.

Another significant event for me also happened in April 1972 besides that involving Dean. Hunt asked me to join him and Lawrence Houston, General Counsel to the CIA, at a restaurant on the Maryland side of the Potomac River. Houston asked if I was interested in going to work for the CIA and said that if I did, my assignment would be to construct a luxurious hotel on the seashore in Nicaragua into which the Communist Sandinista leaders would be lured and compromised. I told Houston and Hunt that I would have to think about their proposal, but in my mind I already knew it was something I could not pursue for personal reasons. The Burglars’ Arrests at WatergateThe arrests of the burglars at Watergate took place sometime directly affrom his White House office after he and Gordon Liddy had fled their room in the Watergate Hotel, upon being alerted that the police had caught the five burglars. Shortly after calling me, he arrived at my apartment located less than a mile from both the White House and Watergate. Hunt explained to me what had occurred inside the Democratic National Committee headquarters at Watergate culminating in the arrests of James McCord and the four Cuban-Americans. I was appalled at what I heard and immediately realized the dire threat it posed as a criminal case to the survival of the Nixon Administration. From my apartment Hunt telephoned Gordon Liddy, whom I had come to know because George Webster at one point had assigned me to do election law research for Liddy in the latter’s capacity as Legal Counsel to the Finance Committee for the Re-Election of the President. Shortly before 5 a.m. both Hunt, in my apartment, and Liddy, on the telephone with me, retained my services as their attorney to represent them and the five arrested burglars in the case. I telephoned Robert M. Scott, the partner of the law firm who in the past had worked with me on Hunt’s personal legal affairs, briefed him on what had transpired, and told him I needed to obtain an attorney skilled in criminal law to assist me in the case. Hunt departed my apartment, some four hours after the burglars’ arrests, and proceeded to his home, Witches Island, in Potomac, Maryland. His son, Saint John Hunt, has recounted what happened upon his dad’s arrival home and in the days immediately thereafter in his illuminating book, Bond of Secrecy: My Life with CIA Spy and Watergate Conspirator E.

Howard Hunt (Trine Day, 2012). My intent and Joseph Rafferty’s was to get the five arrested burglars out on bail as soon as possible without attracting undue publicity. That proved impossible because, as I learned later, Carl Shoffler, the police officer who arrested them, had telephoned the Washington Post within a few hours of the arrests and alerted the paper to the significance of the event at the Watergate. Shoffler, who was a 27-year-old military intelligence officer assigned to the Washington police, had, as his goal bringing down President Nixon. Those wishing additional information about a nefarious and clandestine military intelligence apparatus operating inside the Nixon White House without the President’s knowledge should consult Silent Coup by Len Colodny (Trine Day, 2016). As the five were being arraigned in court late that Saturday, a Post reporter named Bob Woodward, himself a former military intelligence agent assigned to the Nixon White House, sought me out. I found myself in the awkward position of providing evasive answers, because at that point few persons knew of the involvement of Hunt and Liddy, and anything I might say could place them in legal jeopardy. The Post the next day carried an article that Woodward helped write, “5 held in Plot to Bug Democrats.” The article described me as “one of the attorneys for the five men” and noted that “Caddy, who says he is a corporate lawyer, attempted to stay in the background at yesterday’s 4 p.m. court hearing. He … brought another attorney … who has experience in criminal law, to do the arguing.” While I was in the federal courthouse working on the case on June 28, Assistant U.S. Attorney Donald Campbell approached me and handed me a subpoena to appear “forthwith” before the federal grand jury that had been convened to investigate the case.

And Caddy was ordered to testify before a federal grand jury about his relationship with Howard Hunt, the one-time White House consultant. I answered hundreds of questions, and even had my bank account subpoenaed by the prosecutors, but I refused to answer 38 key questions that had been publicized by the prosecution and which attempted, through my lips as their defense attorney, to implicate and incriminate Hunt and Liddy. My refusals to answer were based on the advice of five senior attorneys that included three former Assistant U.S. Attorneys, all of whom strongly believed that my answering the 38 questions would violate the attorney-client privilege. For example, two questions asked were: “At what time did you receive a telephone call in the early morning hours of Saturday, June 17, 1972?” and “From whom did you receive a telephone call in the early morning hours of June 17, 1972?” Obviously if I answered these and the remaining 36 questions Hunt and Liddy would inevitably have been implicated in the break-in, although they had not been arrested. You see, to put the matter perfectly bluntly, if the government is trying to get enough evidence to indict Mr. Caddy as one of the principals in this case even though he might not have been present at the time of the alleged entry in this place, I don’t know what the evidence is except what has been disclosed here, if the government is trying to get an indictment against Mr. Caddy and he feels that way and you feel it and the rest of your attorneys feel it, all he has to say is I refuse to answer on the grounds what I would say would tend to incriminate me. That ends it. I can’t compel him to say he knows Mr. Hunt under the circumstances. He doesn’t do that, understand? He takes the other road. He says there is a confidential communication. Who is he to be the sole judge whether or not it is confidential or not? That is what I am here for. Your Honor, the professional burden I carry at the moment weighs very heavy on me and I shall be extremely glad when these issues are resolved. Mr. Caddy has been asked questions pertaining to his relations with a number of people, all of whom have been his clients, some of whom are his friends.

It is therefore apparent that the answers he gives may have long-lasting and profound effect on both his professional and his private life. After much soul-searching and prolong conferences last night after we left this courthouse, with some six or eight attorneys present, Mr. Caddy was advised that in light of these foregoing factors and the seriousness of the legal questions involved he should not answer until the United States Court of Appeals for this circuit has ruled on the matter. He is prepared once the Court of Appeals has ruled to follow that ruling and to appear immediately before the grand jury and answer the questions according to the Court of Appeals’ ruling. We on our part are prepared to file an appeal upstairs with the Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals and have papers present here in the courtroom. The only request I have, Your Honor, is in view of these circumstances Your Honor would commit Mr. Caddy to my custody pending the ruling of the Court of Appeals. Needless to say, I warrant that he will be here when the Court wants him. Judge Sirica, before holding me in contempt of court, then asked me if I had anything to say. I responded tersely, “I would just indicate that I did invoke the lawyer-client privilege to these questions, and I did so upon the instructions of my clients who asked me not to waive the privilege.” After reading his order holding me in contempt, Sirica told me to step back and placed me in the custody of the U.S. Marshal. I was immediately led from the courtroom. After spending a short time in the cell block directly behind Sirica’s courtroom, I was taken down the elevator to the basement and placed behind bars in the central cell block imprisoning people awaiting their various trials upstairs. On July 18, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Sirica’s order holding me in contempt. Its order was gratuitously insulting regarding my attorney-client privilege relationship with Howard Hunt. The court declared: “Even if a relationship does exist, certain communications, such as a consultation in furtherance of a crime, are not within the privilege.” Ehrlichman: That fellow [Douglas] Caddy, the lawyer who wouldn’t answer questions because it was privileged communications, refused to answer, the Judge cited him for contempt.

Ehrlichman: He represented the five guys who got caught the night they were caught, and he was at the police station within minutes after the police brought the prisoners there. He’d obviously been called by someone from the outside. Well, I think what had happened is that Hunt was in the neighborhood, and when he saw those guys get caught or heard it over the bug, he called Caddy and Caddy went down and tried to arrange bail and advised them not to talk and so forth. So he’s been asked by the grand jury, who called you? And he’s refused to answer. First, Dean had withheld from Nixon the information that I had been working as a volunteer lawyer under Dean’s direction from April 25, when George Webster and I met with him in his White House office, until the Watergate case broke on June 17. It doesn’t get much closer to the White House than that. Second, beginning about two weeks after the case broke, I started to receive mysterious phone calls from someone I never met who called himself “Mr. Rivers.” The purpose of the calls, if I was to believe the caller, was to arrange for me to pass “hush” money to the five arrested burglars and Hunt and Liddy. When I comprehended what Mr. Rivers was apparently talking about, I consulted with Jerome Powell, the managing partner of the law firm where I worked and a former Assistant U.S. Attorney. Powell said that while the precise intentions of Mr. Rivers remained unclear, as well as, who he was and whom he actually represented, and that if I accepted any money for any purpose from him, subsequently I could be blackmailed to do anything Mr. Rivers and those associated with him wanted done – I would no longer be a free man. When Mr. Rivers called back on July 6, a partner of the law firm was in my office. I told Mr. Rivers I wasn’t at all certain what his intentions were and what he wanted me to do, but I wanted no further contact with him. As I hung up I heard Mr. Rivers give a big exasperated “aaugh.” Later, I learned that Mr. Rivers was actually Anthony Ulasewicz, a former New York City detective, who before Watergate had carried out numerous assignments for the White House primarily but not exclusively from Dean.

Ulasewicz disclosed that one assignment in April 1972, two months before the June 17 break-in, was to visit and case the layout of the Democratic National Committee headquarters using the guise of a casual visitor. Mr. Kalmbach: Again, as I have tried to reconstruct this, Mr. Dash, the first instruction that I received, which I passed to Mr. Ulasewicz, was to have Mr. Ulasewicz give $25, 000 to Mr. Caddy. I don’t know much of Mr. Caddy. I understand he is an attorney here in Washington. And as I recall it, this was probably from approximately July 1 through July 6 or 7. There were a number of calls. I would either talk to Mr. Dean or Mr. [Fred] LaRue [a presidential aide.] I would then call Mr. Ulasewicz who, in turn, would call Mr. Caddy. He would have some response from Mr. Caddy, and I would call back up to Mr. Dean or Mr. LaRue. I have just had an opportunity to review the Court of Appeals’ opinion, in docket 72-1658, which affirms the District Court’s Order directing you to testify. It appears the Court of Appeals’ opinion is predicated on the assumption that the existence of a bona fide attorney-client relationship between you and myself has not been established before the grand jury. As you know, you have represented me in various matters over a considerable period of time. In addition, during the months of June and July, 1972, I consulted you, in your capacity as an attorney, seeking legal advice concerning matters which are now apparently under investigation by the Federal Grand Jury sitting in the District of Columbia. At no time during the confidential discussions that we had were we involved in any way in matters that could possibly be construed as on-going criminal activity. As I am sure you are aware, I sought your advice only in your capacity as an attorney, and we therefore discussed many things that were confidential and which I would not have discussed with you but for the attorney-client privilege. This letter is to advise you of my understanding of the relationship which we had, of my understanding that the discussions which you had with me during June and early July 1972 were in your capacity as my attorney, and in connection with matters which are apparently now under investigation by the Federal Grand Jury, and my desire and instruction that you not, in any way, waive the attorney-client privilege.

Before going into the grand jury room, I had decided to disclose my volunteer work for John Dean, which, for a reason that one could only surmise, was not among the 38 questions publicly listed by the prosecutors and had never come up in my prior appearances. Neither had the “mysterious” phone calls I had received from Mr. Rivers. I answered all the questions posed to me by the prosecutors from their list of 38 queries. The opportunity then arose in my testimony to begin telling about the “mysterious” phone calls. I was beginning to describe the calls about the “hush” money, when one of the three prosecutors, Seymour Glanzer, peremptorily cut me off and switched to another line of questioning. I was stunned. Here I had been falsely accused by the prosecutors of engaging in conduct that was “specious, dilatory and … an obstruction of justice,” falsely accused by Sirica of being “one of the principals in this case even though he might not have been present at the time of the alleged entry in this place,” and my professional reputation gratuitously insulted by the U.S. Court of Appeals declaring: “Even if a relationship does exist, certain communications, such as a consultation in furtherance of a crime, are not within the [attorney-client] privilege.” Now when I attempted to testify about being approached with the “hush” money, my grand jury testimony was cut off by the prosecution. The question arises: who was behind this scheme to prevent me from so testifying? Haldeman: Another thing I didn’t know that [ John] Mitchell told me is that John Dean … went into [Henry] Petersen and laid out the whole scenario to him of what actually happened, who was involved and where it all fit. Now, on the basis of that, Petersen is working with that knowledge, directing the investigation along the channels that will not produce the kind of answers we don’t want produced. Petersen also feels that the fact that there were some lines in this case that ran to the White House is very beneficial because it has slowed them down in pursuing things, because all of them are of the view that they don’t want to indict the White House, they only want to indict the – they want to tighten up that case on the criminal act and limit it to that to the degree that they can… [Italics added].

There can be no doubt that the “we” here is John Dean, who had his own personal agenda that conflicted with serving President Nixon. Dean, having kept vital information from President Nixon, was behind the scenes orchestrating the investigation through Petersen, including circumventing my attempt to tell the grand jury about Dean’s involvement with me, so as to assure that my testimony on July 19 “would not produce the kind of answers we don’t want produced.” After I refused to accept the “hush” money on July 6, the prosecutors increased their abusive handling of me. In retrospect I believe that Dean, who was micro-managing the cover-up, ordered through Henry Petersen that this be done without the latter knowing why, and that Petersen obligingly passed the word to the prosecutors who were also ignorant of the reason behind it. I was to be punished because I had refused to participate in Dean’s “hush” money criminality. Pursuant to the Director’s instructions of 5/14/74 for the Office of Planning and Evaluation (OPE) to conduct a complete analysis of the FBI’s conduct of the Watergate and related investigations the enclosed study has been prepared. The General Investigative Division participated in major portions of the study… Comments: On June 19, 1972, WFO [Washington Field Office] by teletype requested authority to interview Charles W. Colson since information had been developed that Hunt had worked for Colson in the White House. On June 22, 1972, Mr. Gray [Acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray] telephonically authorized then Assistant Director Bates to have WFO contact John Dean to set up an interview with Colson. Dean subsequently indicated that he would sit in on interviews of White House personnel and all requests for investigation at the White House had to be cleared through him. With respect to the submitting of copies of FBI reports to Dean, this is probably the most serious blunder from an investigative standpoint made by Mr. Gray. The facts concerning this development became known outside Mr. Gray’s staff for the first time on February 5, 1973. This is long after the substantive investigation into the Democratic National Committee Headquarters (DNCH) break-in was completed and, in fact, was after the trial of those originally implicated was completed.

While Dean’s role as the master manipulator of the cover up was unknown, and, in fact, the cover up itself was unknown during the investigation, obviously the furnishing to Dean by Mr. Gray of our reports allowed Dean the total opportunity to plan a course of action to thwart the FBI’s investigation and grand jury inquiry. There was no way that FBI personnel could have avoided this situation since it was unknown that Mr. Gray was furnishing the reports to Dean. The principal lesson to be learned from this is that rarely should we conduct interviews in the presence of an attorney and never should we allow the same attorney to sit in on all interviews relative to a certain situation. Further, FBI reports should be disseminated only to the prosecutor and certainly never to the White House.1 How does Dean handle my role in the Watergate case as it relates to him in his new book, The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He on from knowing, among other key information, about the two big “problems” that I presented to the White House. A more appropriate title for his book would be, The Nixon Defense: What He Did Not Know And Why He Did Not Know It. “…I hate to see it, but let me say, we’ll take care of [ Jeb] Magruder [Deputy Director of Nixon’s reelection committee who had prior knowledge of the break-in plan] immediately afterwards.” The president reassured Ehrlichman that ${ \\bf \\tilde { \\tau } } [ \\bf i ] _ { n }$ his case it would be easy as pie, it’d be a case of [unclear], you could treat him like those Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and I mean, you could just give amnesty to all of ‘em.” ing lead story in the Washington Post about the lawyer who showed up to bail out the Watergate burglars without being called, Douglas Caddy. Caddy had refused to answer questions, because he claimed the information was privileged communications, but Judge Sirica cited him for contempt; Caddy’s appeal had been denied by the local court of appeals. Ehrlichman explained how this could draw in not only Hunt and Liddy, but Colson as well, because Caddy was handling the divorce of Colson’s secretary. Both concluded that that was too remote to be a problem and returned to the Magruder situation. That’s Dean’s version in its entirety.

Nowhere in his new book does Dean acknowledge our meeting in his White House office on April 25, 1972, where as a volunteer lawyer I received my first campaign research assignment. Nor does he mention his effort to get me to distribute “hush” money to the defendants starting less than two weeks after Watergate broke. It is a fair question to ask. What if Nixon had known of the two big “problems” that led right to the White House, before I testified in front of the grand jury on July 19, problems kept from him by Dean? Nixon, being a shrewd lawyer and shrewd politician, might have analyzed the situation as follows: Caddy will disclose to the grand jury that for two months before Watergate broke he was working as a volunteer lawyer doing ordinary campaign legal work under the direction of Dean. This leads directly to the White House, but does not present an insurmountable problem. Caddy will also disclose that he was approached to pass “hush” money to the burglars and Hunt and Liddy, but from whom he does not actually know. So that remains murky. The blunt truth of the matter is that the five burglars were caught red handed. There is no possibility that they will be found innocent at trial. Ditto for Hunt and Liddy because Caddy’s testimony coerced by Sirica and the U.S. Court of Appeals will clearly implicate them in the crime. So let Caddy, who is Hunt’s attorney and friend, disclose to the grand jury the failed attempt to pass “hush” money to him as the burglars’ lawyer. This gets Hunt off our back if he presses for future cash payments or tries to blackmail us. He can only blame his own attorney for the disclosure. The cover-up, even if there is one, is in its incipient stages. Let’s end whatever it is right now, and just characterize those involved in the break-in as a bunch of reckless campaign rogues who engaged in a third-rate burglary. tempt order and that of the Appeals Court to the Supreme Court? I think the answer Caddy would give is that he and his attorneys built a strong enough court record that if Hunt, Liddy and the five arrested individuals were found guilty, their convictions could be overturned on appeal because of Sirica’s and the Appeals Court’s abuse of him as their attorney. Clearly the record shows he was mistreated and as a result the defendants will not receive a fair trial.

Of course, if the convictions are not overturned on appeal, I can always pardon or grant clemency to the seven after the trial, which will take place when the November election is behind us, although I can only do so in a manner that does not constitute obstruction of justice. The Democrats will make a big deal of all of this, but we control the Justice Department and its investigation. They will be relegated to filing a civil lawsuit that will take years to litigate and to holding committee hearings in the Senate and House. We’ll take some heavy blows but we shall survive. If Nixon had taken this approach the Watergate case may likely have been essentially wrapped up within the first two months. There would have been no lengthy cover-up. Hunt would have been precluded from making any further demands for hush money. Hunt’s wife might not have died in a mysterious plane crash. James McCord would not have written his explosive letter to Sirica exposing the cover-up. There would have been no Senate Watergate hearings. The Oval Office tapes would never have been made public. Nixon could have served out his second term, somewhat bruised, but still wielding power. Why was Dean doing this? For two principal reasons: (1) Dean had comprehensive prior knowledge of the Nixon White House plans to target and subvert the Democrats in the 1972 presidential campaign, of which the Watergate break-in was an outgrowth, and (2) Dean’s girlfriend, Maureen Biner, had a unique roommate relationship with Erika L.“Heidi” Rikan, the madam who ran prostitution ring allegedly operating out of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, a ring that was managed behind the scenes by Rikan’s boy friend, Joseph Nesline, a Mafia figure. Dean married Maureen in October 1972, four months after Watergate broke, and it has been widely alleged that this was done so that neither could be forced to testify against the other under the marital privilege. Heidi Rikan was bride’s maid at their wedding. that discuss it in detail: Silent Coup by Len Colodny, Nixon’s Secrets by Roger Stone (Skyhorse, 2014) and White House Call Girl: The Real Watergate Story by Phil Stanford (Feral House/Process Media, 2013).

A list of the files and depositions can be found here: http://watergate.brightpixelstudio.com/Content/Colodny%20Collection%20tape%20Interview%20list.pdf n early December 1972 at William Bittman’s request, one of my attorneys I and I met with him. Bittman was the lawyer who succeeded me in representing Hunt. The meeting was to discuss the pending trial of Hunt, Liddy and the five burglars scheduled for January. Bittman had previously been a high level Justice Department lawyer; among cases he had prosecuted was that of Jimmy Hoffa. After we were seated, Bittman said, “Your testimony is going to be crucial at the trial. It will be gone over with a fine tooth comb. The government is worried now that it may have fatally tainted its case against the defendants by calling you before the grand jury.” He continued that shortly before the trial to refresh my recollection, the prosecutors would call me to their office to have me read my five grand jury transcripts. “Then,” Bittman replied, “I plan to call Silbert to the witness stand to question him about them. Hunt deserves a fair trial, and I am going to see that he gets one.” Bittman was worried that the transcripts had been altered to weaken the attorney-client privilege so as to benefit the government’s case. Indeed, a few weeks later Silbert asked me to come to the U.S. Attorney’s office to read the transcripts of my five appearances before the grand jury. In reading the final one I found to my astonishment that at least one key question and answer had been altered and did not reflect what I has testified. It boggled my mind that after all Sirica and the Court of Appeals had done to me, forcing me to testify under threat of contempt of court, that my final grand jury transcript had been altered.

There may have been other witnesses whose testimony was altered by the original prosecutors, but who never knew it. Later in December 1972, Howard Hunt’s wife, Dorothy, was killed in a mysterious plane crash in Chicago. This left Hunt psychologically almost a basket case. His attorney, William Bittman, pressured him to plead guilty at the start of the trial the next month, which he did, and the four Cuban-American defendants followed his lead and did so also. Hunt later came to believe that he had been pressured wrongfully to plead guilty by Bittman because the latter was worried that at trial it might be disclosed that he accepted the initial $25, 000 “hush” money from Ulasewicz after I had turned it down. Bittman had a major conflict of interest: was he representing Hunt or protecting himself from prosecution? This left James McCord and Gordon Liddy as the defendants who stood trial. I was called as a witness by both the prosecution and the defense. I was an involuntary witness for the prosecution as Silbert reminded Sirica of my prior assertion of the attorney-client privilege for which he had held me in contempt. At the beginning of the trial I had a conversation with prosecutor Silbert in which I told him that I expected to be asked about the work as a volunteer lawyer that I had done for John Dean and for his assistant, David Wilson, in the two months before Watergate. Silbert’s short response was that he had never heard of David Wilson. When I testified, Silbert failed to ask me about Dean or Wilson. I wondered why. …If Mr. Liddy or any citizen of the United States or any person under the jurisdiction of the United States has a Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel … it ought not to matter one whit whether he exercises that right at three in the morning or three in the afternoon and what Mr. Silbert is suggesting is that there should be some limitation as to the hours when one can consult with an attorney and have no adverse inference drawn there from.

He hasn’t made any showing. Does your client want to take the stand? He will be cross-examined as to the relationship between Mr. Liddy and Mr. Caddy. There are many cases even though there is a relationship of attorney-client, the court can lift the confidentiality where it is in furtherance of a criminal venture although we are not saying it here. I am just citing an example where lawyers are called to testify or testimony is admitted with respect to lawyers of defendants at trial. There are no Sixth Amendment claims raised in those cases. It is preposterous. In March 1973 McCord, fearing Sirica would impose a long sentence on him, wrote his famous letter to Sirica alleging that there had been a cover-up and hush money paid. Soon thereafter I was called by the prosecutors to appear again before the grand jury. This was my sixth and final appearance before the grand jury. Before going into the grand jury room, I reminded the prosecutors how my attempt to tell the grand jury on July 19, 1972, in the early weeks of the case about the “mysterious” phone calls I had received from Mr. Rivers had abruptly ended when Glanzer had cut my testimony off. Months later, after the Special Prosecutor had been appointed to investigate the case, I requested an appointment to inform that office of the details of my July 19, 1972, grand jury transcript being altered. I started the meeting by remarking about how it was obvious that Silbert, Campbell and Glanzer had purposely limited the case to the original defendants so as to make certain it would not reach the higher-ups. The Special Prosecutor’s representative smiled broadly at this and nodded his head vigorously in agreement. However, as I got deeper into the details of my grand jury transcript, his face took on a serious and then alarmed look. When I finished he looked somewhat shocked and said that he would relate what I had said immediately to the Special Prosecutor himself. However, I was never contacted afterward by the Special Prosecutor.

After all was said and done with the Watergate case, notwithstanding the vicious attacks and false accusations against me by the prosecutors disciplined by the District of Columbia Bar, named as a defendant by the Democrats in their civil lawsuit after Edward Bennett Williams had taken my deposition, or even contacted or called as a witness by the Senate Watergate Committee. Sirica wrote a book To Set the Record Straight (Norton, 1979) for which he was paid $1 million (about $4 million in today’s dollars), which he pocketed instead of donating it to charity. Professor Stanley Kutler of the University of Wisconsin has acknowledged that he had been approached to ghost-write the book. Nowhere in his book did Sirica discuss what he had done to me, or how he shaped the trial to achieve the outcome wanted, while being paid with taxpayer dollars so that he could profit from it. I was reluctant to follow such unexpected instructions, feeling I might be regarded as a fugitive even though no warrant had been issued for me (nor ever was). However I went home and began to pack, and soon afterward Liddy phoned me to rescind his previous orders. But shaken by the appearance of confusion and indecision among our sponsors, harassed by the press and lacking even basic legal guidance, I decided to fly to California and quietly await developments. From there I placed frequent calls to Washington in order to obtain legal counsel. Douglas Caddy, my first – until then only – lawyer, was reluctant to speak with me, as was my employer, Robert Bennett. Through press accounts I learned that Caddy had been summoned before a grand jury and then hauled off before Judge John J. Sirica who ruled no attorney-client privilege existed between Caddy and myself. He ordered Caddy to answer the grand jury questions and subsequently thrust my attorney in jail. Sirica’s savage handling of Caddy made me realize how desperately I needed expert criminal counsel. Moreover, the cognomen “Maximum John” had begun appearing in the press, and the combined implications were clear: if Sirica was treating Caddy – an Officer of the Court – so summarily, and Caddy was completely uninvolved in Watergate, then those of us who were", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:28:b37130e9f5b1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 102, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 29, "text": "existed between Caddy and myself.

As events unfolded, this conclusion became tragically accurate. Among the many legal scholars who were later to criticize Judge Sirca’s conduct of the Watergate proceedings, Dean John Roche of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy has this to say: “…there is one sinister relic of that era: Watergate ‘justice.’ One appalling aspect of Watergate was the extent to which liberals and civil libertarians deserted traditional principles of due process. The slogan was: ‘No due process for the bad guys: get the bastards.’ What Sirica did was clearly cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Bill of Rights. He used the sentencing process as a medieval rack.” On September 25, 2014, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein spoke at the Brilliant Lecture Series in Houston. At a reception before the event, I renewed my acquaintance with the two famed reporters whom I not seen in the four decades since Watergate. We reminisced about the early days of the scandal, and Bernstein disclosed that Judge Sirica had personally encouraged them to pursue the case. This was typical of Sirica’s abuse of the judicial process so as to deny the seven defendants a fair trial. One wonders what other persons he interacted with in the case in violation of judicial ethics in his maniacal and insatiable quest for fame and money. In November 1974, while the second Watergate trial was underway that dealt with the cover up, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued its decision on Liddy’s appeal of his conviction. Liddy had listed as one of his five grounds for reversal that Sirica’s “instructions improperly allowed the jury to consider the time and circumstances under which the appellant retained an attorney as bearing on his state of mind.” In its decision, the Appeals Court declared: We agree with the Third Circuit’s analysis that admission of a request for counsel raises Sixth Amendment problems.… In the present case, even it is assumed that there was error in the admission of evidence, the prosecutor’s summation, or the instruction, or all of these, the error would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence against appellant … was so overwhelming that even if there were constitutional error in the comment of the prosecutor and the instruction of the trial judge there is no reasonable possibility it contributed to the conviction. The Court of Appeals in its", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:29:c4f8857ef683", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 103, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "In the present case, even it is assumed that there was error in the admission of evidence, the prosecutor’s summation, or the instruction, or all of these, the error would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

The Court of Appeals in its Liddy decision made no reference to its upholding Judge Sirica’s contempt citation against me two years earlier, after he had falsely accused me of being a “principal” in the crime. Both Judge Sirica and the Court of Appeals were complicit along with Silbert in denying Hunt, Liddy, McCord and the four Cuban-Americans a fair trial and in effect causing the cover-up in so doing. Ironically, among the most telling criticism was that from Bob Woodward, who in a post-Watergate speech to the Young Lawyers Section of the District of Columbia Bar declared that a “Sirica Myth” had developed around the whole Watergate matter despite the fact that “the job of a trial judge is not to conduct a grand jury session and to some extent he did.” Woodward left the impression that he believed Time magazine misspoke when it named Judge Sirica “Man of the Year,” and that “revisionist historians will re-evaluate and downplay Sirica’s role.” That tenacity takes on a new rhythm in the performances of Redford and Hoffman, a rhythm that doesn’t romanticize the reality but choreographs it into a compelling dramatic shape. This happened immediately as Redford is assigned to the routine story of the break-in at the Democratic National headquarters. Sitting behind a mysterious defense lawyer at the arraignment, Redford strains forward, trying to see right through the guy’s shoulder blades. His alert body, his glancing eyes, his tense, open mouth, ex- It would be pleasant if someone really would set the record straight about this tin pot tyrant. Sirica is a vainglorious pooh bah, as ill-tempered and autocratic as any judge since Samuel Chase of Maryland 180 years ago. When the Watergate criminal trials were assigned to him in the fall of 1972, he set out to enjoin the whole countryside with an encompassing gag order that perfectly reflected his lust for power. The order was patently absurd – it embraced even “potential witnesses” and “alleged victim” – and had to be watered down. During the trial the following January, Sirica was seldom content to let the prosecutor Earl J. Silbert do his job. He repeatedly took over the questioning, hectored witnesses, postured to the press. Sirica’s grandstand performance provoked attorney Gerald Alch to the kind of biting criticism seldom heard from a practicing lawyer about a sitting judge; he charged that Sirica “permeated the whole courtroom with prejudice.” It seems ironic that those most", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:30:5d1de37f33e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 104, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "“alleged victim” – and had to be watered down.

Sirica’s grandstand performance provoked attorney Gerald Alch to the kind of biting criticism seldom heard from a practicing lawyer about a sitting judge; he charged that Sirica “permeated the whole courtroom with prejudice.” It seems ironic that those most opposed to Mr. Nixon’s lifetime espousal of ends justifying the means should now make a hero of a judge who practiced this formula to the detriment of a fair trial for the Watergate Seven. Indeed, Sirica was quite frank about all of this with statements during the trial such as “I could care less about what happens to this case on appeal” and “I could care less what the Court of Appeals does, if this case ever gets up there.” In response to a letter that I had written the FBI, I received a reply from that agency dated April 18, 1978, that stated, “A thorough search of our central indices revealed that you never have been the subject of an investigation by this Bureau.” I wonder how the venomous and venal Judge Sirica would have reacted upon learning this. The point man in orchestrating this was Washington, D.C. police detective Carl Shoffler. Shoffler was the officer who arrested the burglars. He had asked to work overtime instead of going off duty to attend a family birthday party and was very conveniently parked in a police vehicle one block from Watergate when the call came into the police headquarters about a possible burglary in progress. In the book, Secret Agenda (Random House, 1984), Jim Hougan wrote: Adding to the suspicions surrounding Shoffler is the fact that he is no ordinary cop. Prior to joining the police department in Washington, he had served for years at the Vint Hill Farm Station in Virginia. This is one of NSA’s most important domestic “listening posts.” Staffed by personnel assigned to the Army Security Agency (ASA), Vint Hill Farm is thought to be responsible for intercepting communications traffic emanating from Washington’s Embassy Row. By itself, this proves nothing, but it is ironic that the police officer responsible for making the most important IOC (Interception of Communications) bust in American history should himself have worked in the same area only a few years before. Shoffler’s work at Vint Hill was mentioned in passing in the staff interviews for the Ervin committee. This occurred as the result of an allegation against Shoffler by his former commanding officer at Vint Hill, Captain Edmund Chung. According to Captain Chung, he had occasion to dine with Shoffler in the aftermath of the Watergate arrests.

Chung claimed that Shoffler told him the arrests were a tipoff, that [Alfred] Baldwin and Shoffler had been in contact with each other prior to the last break-in, and that if Shoffler ever made the whole story public, “his life wouldn’t be worth a nickel.” Shoffler, who was a military intelligence agent assigned to the Washington police, in 1969 recruited an informant, Robert Merritt. Merritt’s assignment was to infiltrate the “Left” and sabotage its activities using illegal and unscrupulous schemes devised by the FBI, military intelligence and the Washington police. In Watergate Exposed, Merritt provides a lengthy and detailed account of what he did as informant for the government, which was Cointelpro on steroids. who worked as a telephone operator at the Columbia Plaza Apartments where “Heidi” Rikan’s prostitution ring was located near the Watergate, he learned of the plan for the June 17 break-in at Watergate two weeks before it happened. His gay friend had overheard it being discussed while surreptitiously listening in on a telephone conversation from an outside caller, who asked to be connected to a supposedly non-working number on the switchboard. Merritt claims that he immediately told Shoffler about the planned break-in, which is why Shoffler was purposely parked a block away from Watergate when the burglary telephone call to police headquarters was made by, Frank Wills, a guard there. Shoffler, whom I came to believe was a classic self-hating homosexual and blackmailer, expressed his outrage at the original attorney for the Watergate Seven turning up as a closeted gay. He determined different ways to destroy my reputation and career, and even allegedly planned to have me killed in the first few weeks of the case using a poison suppository in a staged sexual encounter, according to a sworn affidavit signed by Merritt. Merritt has stated that Shoffler dropped his plan after the prosecutors subpoenaed me on June 28, 1972, to appear before the grand jury because, as he told Merritt, my murder was no longer needed since the prosecutors would effectively destroy me through the grand jury process. Some of Shoffler’s other measures included arranging for Merritt to telephone key Senators on Capitol Hill to spread the word that I was gay, and also to expose my sexual orientation to the media.

In the publication Merritt was asked, “What was your contact with the Watergate affair?” He responded: One of the documents released by the Archives was from a box labeled, “Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, Staff Files, James C. Moore, Box B186, Bob Merritt.” It was a memorandum to assistant chief counsel of the Watergate committee, Terry Lenzner, from Watergate investigator Jim Moore with its subject being “Interview with Earl Robert Merritt, Jr.” dated July 24, 1973. The document states in part: On July 13, 1972, Merritt’s one association with the Watergate affair began. Detective Schaffler [sic] and Sergeant Leper [sic] of the DC police visited Merritt and asked him to find out all he could about Douglas Caddy, who was representing some of the Watergate defendants. Caddy lived at 2121 P Street, N.W., across the street from Merritt’s residence at the time. Merritt did not know Caddy. Schaffler and Leper told Merritt that Caddy was homosexual and pro-Cuban. In response to Merritt’s questions, Schaffler and Leper said that this assignment did not come from the police intelligence unit or the FBI or Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division or the CIA. They further denied that the assignment was involved with the Justice Department in any way. They would not tell Merritt who authorized their request, but Schaffler laughingly said it could possibly come from sources higher than the Justice Department. They told Merritt that it would be his biggest job and that it was one of the best things he could do for his country. Merritt refused to carry out the assignment. He said he was periodically asked during 1972 to find out about Caddy, these requests coming from Schaffler or Leper. As recently as February 22 or 23, 1973, Schaffler asked him if he knew anything about Caddy or could find out anything about him. According to Merritt … on May 16 or 17, 1973, Leper testified before the Senate Watergate Committee that there was no police involvement in Watergate in any way after the apprehension of the burglars on the night of the break-in. Merritt says that Leper was personally involved in the effort to enlist him, Merritt, in the investigation of Caddy. Consequently, Leper committed perjury before the committee.

Isbell [David Isbell, Merritt’s attorney] and Merritt are interested in pursuing possible perjury committed by Leper and in pursuing the more general question of possible DC police involvement in postbreak-in investigations and activities. Schoffler [sic] was questioned about the incident involving [redacted]. Schoffler stated that at some time after the Watergate arrests, Schoffler and Leper [sic] were in their car and met Merritt near his residence at 2121 P Street. Schoffler stated that he had first seen [redacted] the day after the arrests when [redacted] came to represent the Cubans. When Schoffler and Leper met Merritt, Merritt stated that he might know [redacted] and Merritt had an article from the newspaper with a picture of [redacted] on it. Schoffler told Merritt to let him know if Merritt found out who [redacted] was and if he was “funny”, i.e., homosexual. Schoffler stated that this was an off-hand comment and he never expected Merritt to do anything, and Merritt never told Schoffler anything about Caddy. Schoffler stated that in the summer of 1973, after he had testified in the Watergate hearings, Schoffler met Merritt. Merritt stated that he had made all sort of calls to Senators concerning Watergate and the Caddy incident with Schoffler. Schoffler stated that he told Merritt that if he, Merritt, reported a crime that was one thing, but if he reported something that was only in his head it was going to come back on him. Schoffler said that he did not in any way threaten Merritt. Federal records confirm that Mr. Merritt worked with the Washington police and the F.B.I. to infiltrate left-wing groups in Washington in the early 1970s; that his police handler apprehended the Watergate burglars; and that he was interviewed by investigators for the Watergate Special Prosecutor, Archibald Cox. I guess that it is a singular distinction that my sexual orientation as a closeted gay man became an issue in Watergate and that evidence of this can be found in the U.S. National Archives. After all, Watergate occurred only three years after the Stonewall riots and the gay revolution was still not thought of as being a realistic possibility.

This was because the alleged principal purposes of the burglars going into the Democratic headquarters, in addition to getting lists of the clients of both the female and male prostitution rings thought to be there and to plant a new wiretap bug, was also to copy secret Cuban government intelligence reports suspected to be there. The documents, through a chain of events decision by Vice President Nixon in 1960, linked him to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy three years later. It was about that “Bay of Pigs” thing. Possible possession of these reports by the Democrats, which included additional intelligence as to persons involved in JFK’s assassination, if released publicly during the 1972 presidential campaign, posed a serious threat to Nixon’s reelection, but an even far more serious one to the CIA. Understanding what happened in Watergate is impossible without con-sidering the roles of two persons whose significance in the case has never been appreciated. These are Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) Detective Carl Shoffler and Robert Merritt. When Watergate broke in 1972, Shoffler was 27 years old and Merritt was 26. This is how Shoffler described his life in a deposition in 1995 in the case of Maureen K Dean and John Dean, Plaintiffs vs. St. Martin’s Press, Inc. et al., Defendants: I became fed up with my mother’s alcoholism, my two bigoted uncles, my lying and conniving Aunt Tiny and, most of all, being sexually abused by Catholic priests, So I dropped out of high school just two months short of being graduated in 1962. Hurt, humiliated and ashamed, I ran away from West Virginia to begin a new and hopefully more peaceful life with a new identity in the nation’s capital, Washington, D.C. In 1969 Shoffler recruited Merritt as a “Confidential Informant.” He told Merritt at the time that military intelligence had been profiling Merritt for months and had concluded that Merritt was a flawed individual because of the abuse he had suffered back in West Virginia, especially the sexual abuse by the two Catholic priests. Military intelligence viewed Merritt as a pliable sociopath through no fault of his own, and because he was the flawed product of this abuse, he was someone who could be used and manipulated. However, Merritt turned out to be street-wise to the ninth degree and talented and inventive in his own right. Shoffler also was a flawed individual. He was a sociopath, even borderline psychopath, and given to acts of extreme", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:35:06d38c9fa4cc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 109, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 36, "text": "especially the sexual abuse by the two Catholic priests.

However, Merritt turned out to be street-wise to the ninth degree and talented and inventive in his own right. Shoffler also was a flawed individual. He was a sociopath, even borderline psychopath, and given to acts of extreme cruelty against innocent strangers as Merritt recounts in Watergate Exposed. Even though Shoffler was married and had two children, he initiated an intense gay sexual relationship with Merritt that lasted for two years until Watergate broke, when he realized that it was too dangerous to continue. From the spring of 1970 until October 1971 I worked both for Carl [Shoffler] and for the MPD Intelligence Division. While in the employ of the latter I received many orders from Sgt. Scrapper and Sgt. Robinson, although most were from Sgt. Scrapper, who sometimes issued them through Connie Fredericks. These instructions included engaging in multiple criminal acts, such as planting drugs (they gave me about 500 “dime” bags of pot valued at $10 each and 5 or more ounces of cocaine) to clandestinely place upon unsuspecting protesters against the Viet Nam War or radical political foes of the Nixon White House, bugging, instigating violence at demonstrations by throwing the first rocks at the police, cutting wires to sound equipment at left-wing public events and protests, giving misinformation to protesters, spreading lies and rumors, creating racial friction, causing thousands of protesters to be arrested, engaging in theft, burglary, mail fraud, filing false police reports against individuals, and many other crimes against citizens who were merely exercising their First Amendment rights. Sgt. Scrapper specifically ordered me to break into the Community Book Store, the Third Day Book Store and various offices at 1029 Vermont Avenue, N.W. in order to remove anti-Viet Nam war petitions, plant drugs, steal files, photograph documents and destroy office equipment. He also instructed me to steal thousands of names, addresses and phone numbers of directories of citizens who were supporting and financing these left-wing organizations. On one occasion Sgt. Scrapper ordered me to break into the Red House Book Store. This was actually to test my prowess in carrying out an intelligence operation because the radical book store was in reality a police front operation. The test was whether I could break in and steal records under the very eyes of the police. I passed it with flying colors. Because I was gay I was ordered to seduce and engage in sexual acts, including sodomy, with over 70 targeted individuals. The MPD Intelligence Division was especially interested in my being able to establish sexual contact with Senator William Proxmire, a Democrat from Wisconsin, whom they said was bisexual.

The MPD Intelligence Division was especially interested in my being able to establish sexual contact with Senator William Proxmire, a Democrat from Wisconsin, whom they said was bisexual. While I was able to worm my way into jogging with the Senator on one morning, nothing more came of this. The MPD Intelligence Division also ordered me to break into the embassies of two foreign countries, which I successfully did. My attempt at one embassy, which was timed to occur during its Christmas party, was made easier when I was invited inside by the daughter of the ambassador who asked me to smoke pot with her in the library. In October 1971, after working with the MPD Intelligence Division for about a year, Carl arranged for me to be transferred to the Washington, D.C. field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I was delegated to work with Special Agents Terry O’Connor and Bill Tucker. The FBI assignment primarily dealt with targeting the Institute for Policy Studies and the Weatherman Underground, two organizations deemed radical and dangerous under the government’s COINTELPRO program, although no organization in the country was immune from investigation. COINTELPRO stood for co ∣ = counter, intel=intelligence and pro ⊩ program. The FBI assigned me the code names of the Reverend, then Eric and eventually Top Cat. Under the FBI’s expert training I became an even more proficient CI. I was trained to be a spy, eaves-dropper, saboteur, infiltrator, provocateur, instigator, male prostitute, thief and burglar. Activities that normally would be considered to be illegal became routine, any means to an end. I could become your confidante and cut your throat at the same time. My task was to demoralize, dehumanize and deprive my targets and ordinary American citizens of their lives, freedom and liberty. I had no gun or badge, but I literally had the power to destroy anyone whom I targeted or got in my way. I was your best friend or your worst enemy. All this time Carl was interacting with any number of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, such as the FBI, Department of Justice, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and military intelligence. One time I chose to resurrect the forbidden topic between us, joking with Carl about his being a federal agent himself, and not merely a lowly police detective, to which he replied, “How do you know that I am not?” My suspicion that this might be so was heightened by Carl always having large wads of cash, and I mean really large wads, on his person for use in his", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:37:09f78638a3da", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 111, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 38, "text": "Justice, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and military intelligence.

As recounted earlier and related in Watergate Exposed, CI Merritt had his own informants, one of whom tipped him off on June 1, 1972, of the burglars’ plan to break into the Democratic National Committee two weeks later. He passed the information along to Shoffler who set up an entrapment scheme that caused the burglars to change their break-in date from June 16 to June 17 because the latter date was his birthday. His plan was to become the most famous detective in the world on his birthday. He then arrested the burglars inside the DNC at Watergate on Saturday, June 17, 1972, shortly after midnight. I, Robert Merritt, attest to the following facts regarding my involvement with the Watergate attorney Douglas Caddy, who represented the burglars known as the Watergate Seven. On Saturday, June 17, 1972, five burglars broke into the Democratic National Committee offices in Watergate and were arrested at 2:30 a.m. by Washington, D.C. Police Officer Carl Shoffler. At the time the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department employed me as a Confidential Informant and assigned me to work directly with Officer Shoffler. Two weeks before the arrests at Watergate I provided information to Shoffler about the planned break-in of the DNC that I had obtained as a Confidential Informant from a highly unusual source. By using this advance information, Shoffler developed a successful triangulation strategy that in effect set the burglars up in a form of entrapment. The Watergate scandal thus began and ultimately forced the resignation of President Nixon. Shoffler came to my apartment in Washington, D.C. late in the morning of the day of the events at Watergate and exulted in having made the arrests. He told me that he had secretly telephoned the Washington Post soon after the arrests to tip the newspaper off to what had occurred. He then demanded his special birthday present from me, which I was only too happy to perform. (First meeting) Three days later, on June 20, 1972, Shoffler showed up at my apartment with his supervisor, Police Sgt. Paul Leeper. They asked me if I knew someone by the name of Douglas Caddy, who lived at the Georgetown House, a high-rise apartment, at 2121 P St., N. W., which was directly across the street from my apartment. They told me Douglas Caddy was an attorney who was representing the Watergate burglars and that Douglas", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:38:00fa252a6e10", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 112, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "too happy to perform.

They asked me if I knew someone by the name of Douglas Caddy, who lived at the Georgetown House, a high-rise apartment, at 2121 P St., N. W., which was directly across the street from my apartment. They told me Douglas Caddy was an attorney who was representing the Watergate burglars and that Douglas Caddy was a communist and pro-Cuban and was a leader of the Young Americans for Freedom. They wanted me to establish a sexual relationship with Douglas Caddy to find out how Douglas Caddy knew to show up for the arraignment of the burglars after their arrest. They asserted that Douglas Caddy had to be in on the conspiracy with the burglars and that in the past he had been shadowed when he frequented a leather-Levi gay bar in Greenwich Village in Manhattan. Shoffler and Leeper related that Douglas Caddy had been working as a White House attorney in a sensitive position. They claimed that I was butch enough to entice Douglas Caddy, a masculine gay guy, into a sexual affair to obtain the information they wanted. They told me that this was the most important thing that I could do for my country and that I would be well-paid if I undertook the assignment. Their initial offer was $10, 000 . Two days later, on June 22, 1972, which was my birthday, Shoffler came to my apartment to give me my birthday present. He spent the entire day with me. Afterwards, when we were relaxing in bed, he gently tried to persuade me to cooperate with him and Leeper regarding the Douglas Caddy assignment. I emphatically told him ^(′′)N̄o.^(′′)I didn’t know Douglas Caddy and I didn’t know how to get to know him and I was bothered that undertaking the assignment could lead to the destruction of another gay person who apparently was still in the closet and merely attempting to represent his clients. Shoffler said that there were hidden motivations involved, such as the fear of law enforcement agencies that their turf would be reduced by President Nixon through a scheme known as the Huston Plan, the CIA’s concern that President Nixon planned to reorganize the intelligence agencies and their operations, and the Defense Department’s opposition to President Nixon’s new China policy. (Third meeting) In the March 1973, nine months after the initial overture and a month after the first Watergate trial ended, I met with Shoffler and Leeper, FBI agents Terry O’Connor and Bill Tucker and their FBI Agent-In-Charge, whose name escapes me. Leeper did most of the talking. He again tried to persuade me to take on the Douglas Caddy assignment, making an initial offer of $25, 000. refused outright.

Leeper did most of the talking. He again tried to persuade me to take on the Douglas Caddy assignment, making an initial offer of $25, 000. refused outright. The group then said that I could be paid as much as $100, 000 if I took the assignment but I still refused without providing any explanation. Once it was understood that I would not accept the offer, Leeper declared that the least I could do was to spread the rumor around Washington, D. C. that Douglas Caddy was gay in an effort to force him to come out of the closet. Their intention was to defame Douglas Caddy. This was the last attempt to persuade me to take the Douglas Caddy assignment. The group departed angrily, with the exception Shoffler, who secretly winked at me as he went out the door. On June 17, 2009, 37 years after Watergate, I notified Douglas Caddy, now an attorney in Houston, Texas, of a well kept secret and informed him of a new Watergate revelation. (Previously I had disclosed to Douglas Caddy that there had been two meetings regarding the Caddy assignment as discussed above.) I then informed Douglas Caddy that there had been a second meeting about the Caddy assignment. It took place on June 28, 1972, with Shoffler and four others agents who were never introduced to me. I am quite certain that these agents were from either military intelligence or the CIA. I know that they were not FBI agents from their manner and the special type of assignment they asked me to do regarding Douglas Caddy. I asked the agents what the reason was that they wanted for me to go to this length and why they and the government were taking such a risk. I was told that this matter involved a high national security situation that they were not at liberty to disclose. The agents stated that their orders did not allow them to know the answers and that they were only following orders from their superiors who sometimes did not know the answers either and merely implemented instructions from those above. However, from the agents’ comments I inferred that because Douglas Caddy was gay, that was reason enough. Only in July of 1986 when I was subpoenaed by Shoffler to testify before the grand jury in the Lenny Bias case in Upper Marlboro, Maryland did he ever discuss this subject again. At that time he said, “Butch, I am glad that you did not go through with that Douglas Caddy assignment because I found out that those two little blue pills would", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:40:292027e0d508", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 114, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 41, "text": "from the agents’ comments I inferred that because Douglas Caddy was gay, that was reason enough.

At that time he said, “Butch, I am glad that you did not go through with that Douglas Caddy assignment because I found out that those two little blue pills would have caused your instant death.” Some of the background information in this affidavit about my relationship with Shoffler as a Confidential Informant was disclosed by Jim Hougan in his 1984 best-selling book, Secret Agenda: Watergate, Deep Throat and the CIA (see pages 320-323). Some was also disclosed in the Watergate Special Prosecution Force Memorandums of its two interviews of me and one of Officer Carl Shoffler in 1973. (1) Martin Luther King was on the train in 1962 that took Merritt from West Virginia to Washington, D.C. after he had dropped out of high school two months short of being graduated and became a runaway. Merritt’s mother was white and his father was black. His father was a solder in the Korean War and was killed. This background allowed him to make the longtime acquaintance of several key members of King’s entourage on the train. (2) A few years after Merritt arrived in Washington he got a job as a soda jerk in a drug store that was just around the corner from the Chancery of the Soviet Union. An attaché at the chancery named Boris became a regular customer at the fountain each day and he and Merritt became friends. This evolved into them having breakfast together at the drug store each morning. Merritt found Boris to be a kind man who had tears in his eyes after Merritt recounted the sexual abuse by the two priests and familial abuse he had suffered that caused him to flee West Virginia. One afternoon Merritt was sitting not far from the drug store in Dupont Circle that was known as a gathering place for anti-war activists and radicals of all stripes. Two men approached him and quietly flashed the CIA credentials. They showed him a dozen photographs that had been taken of him and Boris having breakfast at the drug store on various occasions. Then the two men made veiled threats against him that slowly evolved into strongly advising him that it was in his best interest to become an undercover agent for the CIA. They assured him that he would be well paid if he agreed. Merritt so agreed and signed on as an undercover agent for the CIA and worked for the organization for over a year. He was given two assignments during that period: (a) monitor and report on anything of substance that Boris might tell him, and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:41:99c250a52663", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 115, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 42, "text": "against him that slowly evolved into strongly advising him that it was in his best interest to become an undercover agent for the CIA.

He was given two assignments during that period: (a) monitor and report on anything of substance that Boris might tell him, and (b) monitor and report on the activities of L. Ron Hubbard who regularly hung out at Dupont Circle. Hubbard lived nearby in a townhouse and also had a building in the neighborhood where a dozen followers were engaged in the planning stages of Hubbard’s Scientology. The CIA was intensely interested in Hubbard’s Scientology. Merritt knew a beautiful girl from Georgia who regularly hung out at Dupont Circle and introduced her to Hubbard who promptly invited the girl to his townhouse. She accepted the invitation on the condition that Mer- (3) Shoffler raped a 13-year old girl whose mother was a drug dealer who lived on the edge of the Georgetown section of Washington. When Shoffler returned to the undercover police vehicle after the rape Merritt expressed his shock. Shoffler replied, “If they are old enough to bleed, they are old enough to be butchered.” This was classic Shoffler behavior. (4) Shoffler ordered Merritt to murder an attorney and provided him with the means to do so under a Huston Plan operation. The innocent victim was killed in Alexandria, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington. Shoffler pointed out the target to Merritt as the target walked down the street and the killing was carried out using a poison dart in a closed umbrella that caused the victim to have a fatal heart attack that left no evidence of it being a homicide. Merritt was never given the victim’s name. (6) Merritt was the sole employee of the Huston Plan that Nixon set up as a clandestine auxiliary and competing organization to the FBI, CIA, NSA and Military Intelligence. Merritt was paid in cash that came from the White House and was doled out to him by Sergeant Dixie Gildon, an officer in the Intelligence Division of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department. (7) On one occasion Merritt was with Shoffler in front of the Ol’ Stein Restaurant on Connecticut Avenue in Washington while Shoffler waited for the arrival of General Alexander Haig and John Dean from the White House. When Dean stepped out of his vehicle, Shoffler introduced him to Merritt, saying, “Butch, this is J.D., your boss.” Dean looked startled and disturbed that his cover had been blown by Shoffler. Just then General Haig arrived, and Haig, Dean and Shoffler watched a large anti-war gathering at nearby Dupont Circle before the three entered the restaurant.

Just then General Haig arrived, and Haig, Dean and Shoffler watched a large anti-war gathering at nearby Dupont Circle before the three entered the restaurant. (8) Both Bob Woodward and Shoffler received training in military intelligence at the same time at the Vint Hill Station in Virginia operated by the NSA. Each was enrolled under an alias. As a result they knew each other before Watergate broke. Vint Hill Station was one of the NSA’s most important listening posts, regularly monitoring Embassy Row. Part of the military intelligence training there was becoming skilled in wire-tapping and electronic eavesdropping. (9) Woodward served in military intelligence before he went to work at the Washington Post. He was a Yale educated officer [also a member of the Yale secret society “Book & Snake”] with a top security clearance. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff assigned Woodward to brief members of the President’s National Security Council staff and in particular General Haig in the White House on military intelligence matters. It is interesting to note in passing that after both Woodward and Shoffler left military intelligence around the same time. Woodward ended up working for the Post and Shoffler ended up working for the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, two key positions in the campaign that destroyed Nixon. Were they “sleeper agents” of Military Intelligence who were placed in these positions? (10) The Joint Chiefs of Staff and military intelligence began monitoring Nixon when he became the Republican nominee for president in 1968. A scandal broke out in 1971 when Nixon’s Plumbers Unit discovered that Navy Yeoman Charles Radford in his capacity as the Pentagon’s liaison to the White House had secretly copied thousands of national security documents, many of them from Henry Kissinger’s briefcase. Radford’s assigned task was to funnel these so that they went up the chain of command to Admiral Thomas Moorer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This Pentagon secret endeavor was part of a plan to bring Nixon down that ultimately succeeded through Watergate in which (former) military intelligence Agents Woodward and Shoffler played key roles. The Pentagon was vehemently opposed to Nixon’s opening to China and his attempt to engage in nuclear disarmament talks with the Soviet Union. (12) The CIA had its own operation inside the White House to monitor both the activities of Nixon and Kissinger and also the Pentagon’s secret intelligence operation inside the White House. The CIA’s plan was allegedly known as Crimson Rose.

The CIA’s plan was allegedly known as Crimson Rose. Merritt says he was involved in an operation of military intelligence headed by Shoffler that stole the Crimson Rose file from within the CIA by blackmailing the CIA’s General Counsel. Military intelligence wanted possession of the file for fear that the Senate’s Church Committee investigating the CIA would get hold of it and expose its spy operation inside the White House. (14) Dean had a personal interest in the break-in. His name allegedly appeared in the clients list of a prostitution ring on Capitol Hill that was exposed early in June 1972. Four months after Watergate broke he married Maureen Biner, who was the roommate of Heidi Rikan, the madam in charge of the prostitution ring. Joseph Nesline, a Mafia Capo, ran the ring. Dean might have been compromised. (15) Merritt allegedly met with President Nixon on three occasions. The first occurred in a few days before J. Edgar Hoover died on May 2, 1972. Merritt was awakened from a sound sleep around 2 a.m. in the morning in his apartment about a mile from the White House by a Secret Service Agent knocking on his front door. The agent told him the President wanted to see him immediately. Merritt hurriedly dressed and was driven by the agent to the White House. Once there he was led through a secret entrance and then into an elevator. The elevator appeared to go down, then sideways, then up, and then down and eventually opened onto a long corridor deep beneath the White House. The agent escorted him to a room. When they entered the President was seated behind a desk. He motioned that Merritt should take a seat in front. The agent stayed inside the room, standing by the door. The President made some small talk and then ordered the agent to leave and go the end of the corridor. The agent protested, but reluctantly obeyed. Nixon again made some more small talk, and then went to the door checked to make sure that the agent had gone down to the end of the corridor. It was obvious that he wanted complete privacy in his talk with Merritt. Nixon told Merritt that it was the White House that originally chose him to become a Confidential Informant in 1970 for the Washington Police. He was chosen after having been profiled for a long time. Shoffler did the actual recruitment of Merritt, but unbeknownst to him the recruitment decision actually came from the White House and not Military Intelligence.

Merritt not long thereafter was selected to be the first employee of the Huston Plan. A second meeting allegedly took place about five days before Watergate broke on June 17, 1972. Again Merritt was summoned in the early morning hours after midnight and transported to the White House. He was escorted through a secret entrance and into an elevator. When the elevator arrived at its destination the agent escorted him to the office of the President. The President expressed great confidence in Merritt’s ability to carry out assignments, again praising him for his many accomplishments under the Huston Plan. He then said he had a number of new assignments that he wanted Merritt to carry out. Foremost among these were he wanted Merritt to bomb the Institute for Policy Studies and to assassinate a professor of history at American University. What followed thereafter was the President speaking fast and listing assignment after assignment. These were numerous but centered on conducting criminal and quasi-criminal actions against individuals and organizations aligned with the anti-war movement. These targets were all located in the area of Dupont Circle in Washington. The President repeated the assignments three times to instill these in Merritt’s memory as Merritt had not been provided with pen and paper. Merritt assured the President that he would faithfully carry out the assignments, just as he had done in the past. Merritt then decided to bring to Nixon’s attention that his friend, Rita Reed, had alerted Merritt on June 1 of the telephone conversation that he overheard the day before while operating the switchboard at the Columbia Plaza Apartments. The conversation revealed that enemies of Nixon were aware of a plan to break into the Democratic National Committee on July 18 and that the break-in would result in the downfall of Nixon from the presidency. Nixon responded that he was aware of a general plan to break into the DNC that had been authorized by the government agencies involved in the Huston Plan. He said he did not know any of the details as to who exactly would carry out the break-in, and that his decision was to sit back and just watch to see what would happen. He said that he had no concern that the break-in would be tied to the White House.

He said the purpose of the break-in was to gather evidence of a prostitution ring being operated out of the DNC that would be used in his reelection campaign. He asked Merritt whether it was his opinion, or a fact that there was prior knowledge possessed by his enemies that the break-in would be used to end his presidency. Merritt said it was his opinion because Officer Shoffler was keeping from him the de- tails of how the burglars were going to be entrapped. Merritt, like the President, was unaware of who would comprise the team of burglars. It did not occur to either that it would be “all the President’s men.’ Merritt did disclose to the President that at the request of Shoffler he had a blank safe deposit box key made that Shoffler planned to plant on one of the arrested burglars with the key taped inside a notebook. Nixon did not respond to this. So Merritt urged the President to consider carefully what he was disclosing to him. Nixon took offense at this, and asked Merritt sharply, “Who is President, you or me?” as if to question Merritt’s temerity in forthrightly offering unsolicited advice on how he should act. There was some further discussion about the planned break-in that was wrapped up when the President became quiet and thoughtful and then mused aloud, “I wish I could get a handle on this.” Merritt’s third and final alleged meeting with Nixon took place in the second week of July 1972, three weeks after Watergate broke. The Secret Service agent picked him up around 1 a.m. He was driven in a heavy black sedan that looked like it was bullet-proof. The vehicle arrived at the Executive Office Building (EOB) that is adjacent to the White House. Upon a signal the guard inside let them in the front door. They walked into a small elevator that when moving did so smoothly one could not tell it was moving at all. The elevator opened somewhere deep underneath EOB or White House. They walked a short distance and went down a short stairwell to a corridor. They then walked down the corridor and through three doors and then to fourth door. They walked a short distance and the agent told Merritt to enter an office. Inside they found President Nixon distraught with some tears rolling down his checks.

Once Nixon composed himself and made some small talk, he reviewed the Watergate affair. He said that he had been betrayed by many in White House who were motivated by power and money. He could trust no one in the White House; he could only trust Kissinger and Merritt. He said Dean was a traitor, and that he had small elite group of detectives that monitored and taped Dean and others. The group discovered Dean had visited Nixon’s enemies on Capitol Hill before and during Watergate. He singled out by name General Alexander Haig, Carl Shoffler, T.D. (Shoffler’s police buddy) and Captain Edmund Chung as traitors. planned under the Huston Plan but had known nothing of its details. He expressed remorse for not taking more seriously the information that Merritt had provided him at their prior meeting about the burglars’ break-in plan that his enemies had discussed in a telephone conversation overheard by Rita Reed. He said that the CIA had hijacked the break-in plan and had purposely sabotaged it, resulting in the arrests of the burglars. He was especially incensed at the role played by military intelligence directing Shoffler to set up an entrapment scheme to catch the burglars. Nixon blamed the NSA, FBI, CIA and military intelligence for wanting him destroyed and implied that he had been set up for a fall because of his sponsoring the Huston Plan that encroached upon the powers of these government agencies. Nixon regularly received raw intelligence reports from Washington Metropolitan Police Department’s Intelligence Division. Merritt surmised these came from Officer Dixie Gildon, who knew Nixon. These reports showed Merritt regretted his role in alerting Shoffler of the planned break-in, based on the information given to him by Rita Reed, because he did not want to see Nixon hurt, and that he admired Nixon. Nixon said he knew that from these reports and from Merritt faithfully carrying out his Huston Plan assignments that he could trust Merritt. Merritt told him that since their last meeting he had begun to carry out his assignments given to him at that time. The President broke in and said that the plans to bomb the Institute for Policy Studies and to assassinate the professor of history at American University had to be cancelled. Such violent events in the wake of the burglars’ arrests at Watergate would likely focus attention on the activities of the White House. Then the President swore Merritt to secrecy.

Such violent events in the wake of the burglars’ arrests at Watergate would likely focus attention on the activities of the White House. Then the President swore Merritt to secrecy. Once Merritt has assured him of this, the President said that he had prepared a document that would explain why and what he had done to assure national and international security. The document was his “Message to the American People.” He had hidden this historical document inside the White House in a secret location where it might be many decades before it was discovered. He informed Merritt of the secret location, and told him that if the time came when Merritt was still alive, and believed it was the right time for the document to be revealed, he was giving permission to Merritt to reveal its secret location. Merritt, Nixon disclosed that he had prepared research dossiers on the FBI, CIA, military intelligence and one other that Merritt cannot remember. Nixon criticized all the agencies, declaring that should the country be attacked in a nuclear war these agencies would not be up to the task of defending the country. He said he was tired of reading reports from these agencies that were composed with the primary intention of the agencies’ claiming questionable accomplishments designed to make themselves look good. Nixon expressed grudging admiration for columnist Jack Anderson whom he said was brilliant and who could take a small clue and develop it into the real story. It was as if Anderson had his own crystal ball. He said that Bob Woodward was not a reporter but instead was a skilled intelligence agent trained in all aspects of that craft. He wondered aloud whether John Dean had been brought into his administration to bring him down, as it was Dean who decided the Watergate burglars would be White House men and issued the order for the June 18 break-in that was later moved up to June 17 by Shoffler in one of his wiretapping schemes that fooled the burglars so that it would take place on his birthday. He said it was addressed to Henry Kissinger. He told Merritt that he was going to give the letter to Merritt to deliver to Kissinger in person or by mail. He told Merritt to remain quiet and not say a word as he read the letter out loud. Merritt wondered if Nixon was secretly taping what he was reading out loud.

Merritt wondered if Nixon was secretly taping what he was reading out loud. In essence, Nixon talked about “life as we do not know it.” He said that during the previous twenty years “Knowledge” had been obtained that could make the human race on Earth “the supreme beings in the universe.” This Knowledge came in part from helpful information provided from an extra-terrestrial being from Planet X, Nibiro, who was in a secure location in a building in the U.S. Nixon said the Knowledge also came as the result of discovery made by scientists working at the Los Alamos Laboratories in New Mexico who In his letter Nixon instructed Kissinger to deliver his letter only to a president of the U.S. who succeeded him whom Kissinger believed could be trusted with the Knowledge. He also instructed Kissinger to devise a precautionary means for trusted persons to deliver the letter to such a successive president should Kissinger die naturally or unexpectedly. After reading the letter out loud, Nixon asked Merritt to come around to his side of the desk so that he could show him the two lines in the letter that spelled out the formula/code/equation for the supreme Knowledge. Merritt of course was unable to comprehend the intrinsic meaning of the two lines that were written in red ink. Merritt returned to his seat. The president took the handwritten letter with a folded note attached and two small cassette tapes that were in small individual padded envelopes and put these in a larger envelope, which he sealed and taped and placed a scrawled signature across the tape and seal. He then placed a handwritten note on the back of that envelope that directed Kissinger to contact Merritt upon receiving the letter to acknowledge its receipt. He then placed that envelope into a second larger envelope and sealed that with tape. The second envelope was addressed to Kissinger at his home address. It had stamps on it and had the appearance of an ordinary business mail solicitation. The President reiterated to Merritt that the contents of the letter were vital to the security of the nation. He remarked that if Merritt were to open the envelopes and offer its contents for sale he could make millions of dollars. However, Merritt’s record of past performance had convinced the President that he could be trusted to deliver the envelope.

Nixon reiterated his trust in Merritt and said that Merritt’s ability in carrying out assignments exceeded in some ways that done by the best FBI agents, because Merritt was street wise and knew how to get something done better even when in doing so he violated the directions he had been given. He praised Merritt as being a “Super Plumber,” better than any member of the White House Plumbers Unit. He said that he knew Merritt never graduated from high school, but that he was bright and had a good mind. Once all this was accomplished, Nixon asked Merritt if he had any questions. Merritt said he did. The first was could the scientists in Los Alamos be trusted with possession of the Knowledge? Nixon said that the scientists were the elite of the elite but were monitored at all times both by camera and by human eyes. All their movements were monitored closely. Nixon told him this was their final meeting and that he was entrusting Merritt to carry out a mission of supreme importance in getting the envelope safely to Kissinger. There was no one in the White House he could trust. Merritt started crying and Nixon took his handkerchief, wiped the tears away and told Merritt to keep the handkerchief. The Secret Service agent drove Merritt home. The next day Merritt went to Kissinger’s home where the maid told him Kissinger was not present. Merritt then deposited the envelope in a mail box at the street corner located outside Hartnett Hall where he lived [and by coincidence across the street from where I lived.] He burned the type ribbon’s pieces in a picnic area in nearby Rock Creek Park. Merritt’s attorney before and during when all these meetings with the President took place was David Isbell, a partner in the prestigious Covington and Burling law firm. He was also head of the capital’s chapter of ACLU. Merritt had told Nixon that Isbell was his attorney. After each meeting with the President Merritt met with Isbell and informed him of what occurred. When Merritt told Isbell of what Nixon had said to him in their third and final meeting, Isbell remained silent in contemplation for a few moments and then commented, “I don’t know what to do with this information. It affects our country and the world. Nixon is a patsy just like Oswald was.” Merritt got the impression from Isbell’s verbal analysis that Nixon’s downfall stemmed from his negotiations with the Soviet Union on nuclear arms control and his opening the door to relations with Communist China, both of which were adamantly opposed by the Pentagon and the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:50:e368a76d1473", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 124, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 51, "text": "Isbell remained silent in contemplation for a few moments and then commented, “I don’t know what to do with this information.

Isbell added that there could be perhaps a more important reason for the president’s pending downfall, that being the existence of the Huston Plan that threatened the power of the FBI, CIA, NSA and military intelligence. Isbell then asked Merritt for permission to tell Leonard Boudin, a prominent left-wing attorney known for his anti-war views, of what Merritt had told him and Merritt gave his consent. When Isbell had first agreed to represent Merritt as a client in 1971 he told Merritt that he believed Merritt’s life was danger because of what he knew about the Huston Plan. Isbell then telephoned Jack Anderson, the columnist, and spoke to him about Merritt. Isbell then sent Merritt to meet with Anderson in his office. Anderson questioned Merritt closely at several meetings the two had, and then wrote a dozen columns about Merritt that were published in the Washington Post. In one column Anderson threatened that if Merritt suffered any physical harm there would be hell to pay. Merritt entrusted Isbell with his personal files for safe keeping on everything he had done for the government over the years. Isbell assured him that they would secure in the law firm’s vault. Isbell is now deceased and Merritt’s attempts to recover his files have been to no avail as they appear to have disappeared after Isbell died. It is important to remember that allegedly it was the White House that selected Merritt to become a confidential informant for the government in 1970 after having profiled him for a long time and found in him the qualities being sought for such a person: a young man who had been so severely abused in his home and in school by priests that he had become a sociopath. As such, he could be counted on to fulfill assignments involving criminal of actions under the belief that in doing so he was to protecting the national security of the nation.

Merritt had shown extraordinary capability and dedication in carrying out these Huston Plan assignments successfully without being caught. Nixon had concluded this track record showed he could trust Merritt to carry out a supremely important assignment. The reason Nixon selected Merritt to allegedly deliver the envelope with its all-important document and tapes to Henry Kissinger was, as he told Merritt, there was no one left in the White House whom he could trust. Nixon knew that both the CIA and the military had spies in the White House reporting back to their superiors what was happening there. The two-dozen pages of memoranda, transcripts and notes – once among the most sensitive and privileged documents in the Executive Branch – shed important new details on a unique crisis in American history: when investigators working for President Richard Nixon discovered that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, using the stenographer as their agent, actively spied on the civilian command during the Vietnam War. The episode became known as “the Moorer-Radford affair,” after the chairman of the Joint Chiefs at the time, the late Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, and the stenographer involved, Navy Yeoman Charles Radford. The details first surfaced in early 1974 as part of the Watergate revelations, but remained obscure until historians in the 1990s and this decade began fleshing out the episode. The affair represented an important instance in which President Nixon, who resigned in 1974 amid wide-ranging allegations that he and his subordinates abused the powers of the presidency, was himself the victim of internal espionage. In adding to what has already become known about the episode, the latest documents show how the president and his aides struggled to “get a handle on” the young Navy man at the center of the intrigue and contain the damage caused by the scandal A trained stenographer, Radford was in his late twenties when he was assigned to the NSC staff of Henry Kissinger during Nixon’s first term. The yeoman worked out of the Executive Office Building under two admirals, Rembrandt Robinson and Robert O. Welander, who served as formal liaison between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the NSC. As Radford later described his work – in polygraph tests, sworn testimony, and interviews with historians and journalists – he spent 13 months illegally obtaining NSC documents and turning them over to his superiors, with the understanding that the two admirals were, in turn, funneling the materials to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and other top uniformed commanders. Radford’s espionage took many forms: making extra photocopies of documents entrusted to him as courier; retrieving crumpled drafts from “burn bags”; even brazenly rifling through Kissinger’s briefcase while the national security adviser slept on an overseas flight… Under intensive polygraph testing", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:52:066c8424c51f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 126, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "spent 13 months illegally obtaining NSC documents and turning them over to his superiors, with the understanding that the two admirals were, in turn, funneling the materials to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and other top uniformed commanders.

( Jack Anderson died in 2005 without ever disclosing who had been his source, but he told author Len Colodny in November 1986: “You don’t get those kinds of secrets from enlisted men. You only get them from generals and admirals.”) However, the young stenographer did eventually break down and tearfully admit to Nixon’s investigators that he had been stealing NSC [National Security Council] documents and routing them to his Pentagon superiors. Radford later estimated he had stolen 5,000 documents within a 13-month period… He [ John Ehrlichman’s aide, David Young] encouraged Ehrlichman to mention to Admiral Robinson that the young stenographer-spy had already told investigators that he believed the material he had been stealing was destined to go to “your superiors,” meaning the Joint Chiefs. Young also urged Ehrlichman to determine the extent to which Kissinger’s top NSC deputy – Alexander Haig, who had personally selected Radford to accompany Kissinger on his overseas trips, and who later went on to become secretary of state in the Reagan administration – was “aware of Radford’s activities.” So Nixon knew it was not safe to give the all-important document and tapes directly to Kissinger inside the White House for fear that Haig or some other Pentagon or CIA spy would learn about it. In Nixon’s opinion the document and tapes were so important to the nation’s national security that he had to summon Merritt to a clandestine meeting deep beneath the White House to assign to Merritt the task of getting the document and tapes to Kissinger without anyone knowing about it. This Merritt faithfully did.4 The Huston PlanTom Huston, the co-author with President Nixon of the Huston Plan, which was when I first got to know him. He is now one of my Facebook friends. During the time he was employed by the Nixon Administration he was kind enough on one occasion to give me a tour of the White House and to introduce me to Pat Buchanan, the president’s speech writer.

Merritt maintains that Gildon has a fairly detailed knowledge of the Huston Plan. Chaired by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, ICI [Interagency Committee on Intelligence] membership included the major intelligence agencies, including Richard Helms of the CIA, Donald Bennett of the Defense Intelligence Agency, William Sullivan of the FBI, and Noel Gayler of the National Security Agency. The White House liaison was Tom Charles Huston, a conservative-minded attorney and former intelligence official, whose name will be forever associated with the mysterious report. performed by the intelligence community in recent years, due to hackers, than we do about such activities from more than four decades ago. Some scholars have even floated the idea that the Huston Plan was a forerunner to the authorities granted to the intelligence community in section of 215 of the Patriot Act, which authorizes the bulk metadata collection program. When the existence of the Huston Plan first became public during Watergate, we were led to believe that it was never implemented. Nixon ordered the plan and then recalled it, so the story went. However, the reason the Huston Plan remains classified today is likely because at least portions of it were indeed implemented after all. The basis for its continued classification is to protect secrets that were operational… When word reached the intelligence community that the Huston Plan was no longer in the custody of the White House, panic swept across the FBI, CIA, and NSA on May 17. The FBI feared it could end up in the hands of congressional investigators then looking into Watergate, with the result being that “inference is likely to be drawn by Congressional committees that this committee (the ICI) was a prelude to the Watergate affair and the Ellsberg psychiatrist burglary.”… There was indeed a “cancer on the presidency,” as Dean said to Nixon on March 21, and the apparent answer of the national security establishment was to cut it out – to cut Nixon out. The President had to resign, and he had to be pardoned to ensure that inquiries into broader U.S. government wrongdoing could not continue indefinitely.

Senator Howard Baker asked the committee’s reporter/stenographer to leave the room so that there was be no written record of Merritt’s disclosures. The Senator then asked Merritt the first question, “What do you know about the Huston Plan?” Merritt responded that he was reluctant to answer the question. Senator Baker expressed surprise and asked why? Merritt responded that he had been escorted to the executive session by a committee staff member named Wayne Bishop who threatened him that if he told what he knew, he would be arrested on the spot and placed in a jail beneath the Capitol Building. The Committee members expressed shock at hearing this. Merritt remembers Committee Chairman Sam Ervin and Senator Baker conferring and then Ervin inform- ing him that the hearing was being cancelled and he could depart but would be called back at some future date to testify. Some weeks later Senator Ervin did call Merritt and told him the Committee still planned to call him back for his testimony and that he should not worry about Wayne Bishop being involved anymore. There is brief mention in the Senate Watergate Committee hearings of Merritt’s initial appearance before the committee. He was never called back to testify about the Huston Plan. As a result the committee forfeited it chance to learn about the Huston Plan from that plan’s sole employee who alleges that at one point in time, he took his orders directly from the president. Merritt says that Shoffler told him the reason he was never called back to testify about the Huston Plan in executive session of the Watergate Committee was because Senator Ervin had been threatened that his family members would be in danger if he pursued the inquiry through Merritt. The Huston Plan and the activities carried out under it are crucial to understanding what Watergate was about.

As a result of his giving the document to the courts, it became out of the reach of congressional subpoena and out of the reach of the Freedom of Information Act, even though it was a document created by the executive branch and should have been reviewable under the FOIA. The document and associated records have been in the custody of the court ever since. (Incidentally, we have a petition backed by the American Historical Foundation to review and hopefully release these records. In addition, there are still [in 2015] 700 hours of Nixon White House tapes that have not been released by the Archives.) It will take a skilled professional reporter like Michael Powell to weigh the credibility and value of Merritt’s disclosures, including those above. I have worked with Merritt on Watergate for almost eight years in an on-andoff relationship and have come to the conclusion that because his life’s work has been being a confidential informant for the government, his manner of thinking is decidedly different from that of the normal person. One only has to read what he says in Watergate Exposed to realize that this is true. I have advised Merritt to cooperate fully with Powell and to hold nothing back as Powell represents the last and best chance for Merritt’s story to be told. Merritt is 73 years old and in poor health. Andy Thibault, an award winning reporter and columnist, contacted me in 2016 to call my attention to a cold murder case in which General Foods Corporation had misled and abused me as an employee by sending me to represent the company in Washington in 1969, and requiring in doing so that I work out of the Robert Mullen Company that had handled its public relations for years. The Mullen Company, unbeknown to me, but well known to General Foods, was a CIA front that had been incorporated by the CIA in 1959. Thibault asked me analyze the role of General Foods in the murder case because of its close relationship with the CIA. Thibault jump-started my investigation by providing me with a copy of his book, More Cool Justice (Icebox Publishing, 2014), in which there is a chapter titled, “Who Killed Gabe Caporino?” In it he wrote that “On March 3, 1974, Caporino, 40-year old married father of two daughters, left his home in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. for a week-long business trip to Houston and New", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:56:114edd772550", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 130, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 57, "text": "the role of General Foods in the murder case because of its close relationship with the CIA.

Caporino was a 17-year executive with the coffee division of General Foods. [General Foods was acquired by Philip Morris in 1983.] … The night that he disappeared [in New Orleans] – March 7, 1974 – Caporino spoke with his wife and daughters, asking about a school parents’ night and confirming a dinner date with friends for the weekend. Found in his hotel room were his return flight tickets and his suitcases partially packed with gifts for his family.” It intrigued me that Caporino’s disappearance took place in March 1974, which was when the Watergate scandal was approaching its peak that occurred when President Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974. From the onset of the Watergate case the Mullen Company and tangentially one of its client, General Foods, were subjects of public and prosecutorial interest because when the burglars were arrested at Watergate Howard Hunt was a vice president of the Mullen Company and Robert Bennett, Mullen Company president, reported to the CIA on a regular basis. The last thing that General Foods wanted in March 1974 was for the media to take notice of the disappearance of one of its executives in New Orleans and start asking questions that might lead to its relationship with the CIA and on into Watergate. What made this a sensitive matter for General Foods? Because of the possibility that Gabe might have stumbled upon or inadvertently discovered something General Foods might have been doing in behalf of the CIA that would have catapulted the company deep into Watergate. It is highly significant that thousands of cans of coffee were later to have been found missing from the company’s inventory at a time when it was recognized by law enforcement that sealed coffee cans were being used to transport heroin because drug dogs were not able to sniff the cans’ contents. The CIA had for decades been deeply involved in drug trafficking and had laundered some of its drug money through the casinos in Havana, Cuba; that is, until Castro took power and closed the casinos to the outrage and distress of the CIA and organized crime. What followed were numerous attempts by the CIA (with the help of organized crime) to assassinate Castro and reopen the casinos.

What did General Foods do when Caporino’s wife, Grace, expressed alarm at his not returning home on March 8, 1974? It assigned its chief of security, Jack Ison, to investigate the matter. Ison had been a FBI agent for nine years before becoming employed by General Foods. His efforts to deflect the focus of Gabe’s disappearance and classify him as a missing person include the following: refusing to investigate forgery of Gabe’s credit card, which the FBI crime lab confirmed, and his fabrication of incriminating data in the New Orleans Police Department file as well as in the FBI file. In John le Carre’s book, The Constant Gardner, he alludes to the accepted fact that the heads of security at large corporations are often responsible for arranging the deaths of people who pose a threat to the business interests of the company. Such heads of security are also often responsible for conducting internal investigations that end up making findings that favor the corporations at the expense of the truth. Carre is a former MI5 agent and is knowledgeable about matters of this type. Soon after his arrival in New Orleans, Ison met with the New Orleans Police and purposely excluded members of Caporino’s family from being present. As Thibault recounts in his book, “Instead of trying to find Gabe Caporino, the General Foods corporate leadership acted in concert with New Orleans police to trash him with unsubstantiated allegations ranging from gambling and unspecified industrial espionage to mob connections and inept whore mongering.” Before Caporino went to New Orleans in 1974 he was a trusted employee of 17 year tenure, having serious company responsibilities. Overnight with his mysterious disappearance he was transformed by the company into an employee with a horrible reputation. What could motivate the leadership of a General Foods suddenly to adopt such a position in regard to Caporino? To make matters even worse, the company took steps to sever its obligatory relationship with Grace Caporino, Gabe’s wife, so as to deny her and her two children financial assistance. These include Workmen’s Compensation widow’s benefits, Social Security widow’s and children’s benefits, and all contractual employee insurance death benefits. By chance, on a visit to the New Orleans Police, Grace was briefly able to peruse a three-and-a-half inch file on his husband’s case before it was whisked away. Later the file disappeared and to this day has not been found.

Much later it would take almost ten years of Grace’s Freedom of Information Act requests to obtain the FBI file, which was redacted as to sources but replete with damning fabrications against Gabe. On November 3, 2017, NOLA.com/Times-Picayune carried an article titled, “Public corruption in Louisiana ‘can’t get much worse,’ says outgoing FBI New Orleans director.” The outgoing New Orleans FBI special-agentin-charge, Jeffrey Sallet, declared in the article that “I have had the unique opportunity of working in the area of corruption for the four New England states of Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. I had the perspective of being the national chief of corruption and civil rights, and I would say that the corruption in this state is at an extremely unacceptable level.” In 1954 and1955 I had attended meetings in New Orleans organized by Assistant Police Superintendent Guy Banister, a former FBI agent, which focused on the efforts of the Aaron Kohn Crime Commission’s to investigate organized crime in the city. Almost seven decades later not much has changed. Corruption is still a way of life in the Big Easy. What makes the cold murder case of Gabe Caporino unique from that of other persons who have gone missing in New Orleans is the possibility that he had learned something about heroin being transported in General Foods coffee cans in an operation orchestrated by the CIA. It could also be that he by chance saw something else happening in General Foods that he should not have seen. Whatever it was, it cost him his life. 2.

Robert Merritt was the only employee of the Huston Plan. Another fellow – Jared Stoute – was assigned for a whole year to monitor Merritt’s activities on a daily basis, starting when Merritt woke up. He was like a shadow and wrote down in a notebook everything Merritt did. He did this from June 1971 to June 1972, right up until when Watergate broke. He even knew what Rita Reed had told Merritt about the telephone conversation she had overhead on the switchboard. Stoute most likely was a member of Nixon’s “private detective team” as was Tony Ulazewicz. Whatever he learned went back directly to Nixon in a report. That is why Nixon sent for Merritt in May 1972 and had three meetings with him. Stoute had reported to Nixon that Merritt was a “Super Plumber” and could be trusted. “I am a New York Times columnist and writer and I’ve worked on and off with Robert Merritt for many years. He can be excitable and passionate, but in my experience he is also remarkably level-headed and his work has benefited many federal and city investigations. He has worked everything from city investigations to the Watergate and the undermining of a president. He now appears to be the victim of a concerted attempt to undermine his credibility and it is taking a grievous and unfair toll on his health and safety.” saw Howard Hunt only three times during the Watergate case. The first was when he came to my residence in Washington on June 17, 1972, at 3:35 a.m., after he had telephoned me from his White House office a half hour earlier. At that meeting he explained what had happened at Watergate and retained me as his attorney to represent him and the five arrested burglars. The second time I saw Howard was at the funeral of his wife, Dorothy, in December 1972, after she had died in a mysterious plane crash at Midway Airport in Chicago. I am not alone in thinking that Dorothy was killed after Howard made this recorded threatening phone call demanding “hush” money to Charles Colson in the White House in November 1972 once Nixon was re-elected.1 Howard thought so too.

He said to them that he was afraid that if he did not do this, they would be killed next. When he pleaded guilty the next month all the work that I had done on his behalf to protect the attorney privilege that led to my being held in contempt and jailed by Judge Sirica was dropped down a memory hole as the Watergate case mushroomed. The third and last time I saw Howard was in early 1975 when he telephoned and invited me to join him at a dinner. He said that he would soon enter prison to serve his sentence for Watergate and that he wished to express his appreciation for my legal representation of him in the case. Even though I had been Howard’s attorney before Watergate broke, legally we had not been able to have a conversation once I was served with a “forthwith” subpoena to appear before the grand jury by Prosecutor Silbert on June 28, 1972, after which my role evolved into being a voluntary witness for the seven defendants and an involuntary witness for the prosecution. But now the case was over and we could talk. Hunt and I chose the Yenching Palace, a popular Chinese restaurant, as our place for dinner in 1975. When the restaurant went out of business in 1997, the Washington Post published an article, “Five Decades of Secrets to Go,” because so many important decisions had been reached inside it, including the U.S. representative and his Soviet Union counterpart agreeing over dinner to settle the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. As our dinner progressed I wanted to ask Howard some basic questions about Watergate but sensed that he would be reluctant to answer these. I prefaced my remarks to him by saying that Watergate could lead ultimately to the destruction of Western Civilization. I believe this to this day. Watergate, along with the Kennedy assassination and 9/11, were steps that hastened the decline of Western Civilization and could usher in the future Empire of Chinese Civilization. Howard showed no emotion when I said this. Nevertheless I pressed forward and asked him, “Why did the burglars go into the DNC?” After a pause he said, “I told them to photograph any piece of paper that had numbers on it.” “Well,” I said, “As you know I was a witness at McCord’s and Liddy’s trial, and when I was on the witness stand I saw a long table", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:61:fb086b01452e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 135, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 62, "text": "and could usher in the future Empire of Chinese Civilization.

Didn’t the burglars go into the DNC to fix a defective bug left there from a previous break-in?” After a long pause I then asked, “There was a lot of publicity about a prostitution ring being operated out of the DNC. In fact, another prostitution ring was uncovered on Capitol Hill a few weeks before the DNC break-in in which the book of clients had been recovered. So didn’t you go back into the DNC to get the book of prostitution clients that was there?” Knowing the names of the clients of the rings could lead them to being compromised and subjected to blackmail. I pressed on, saying “Burglary of any sort is a serious criminal offense. While fixing a bug and getting a list of the clients of a prostitution ring are significant matters, they in no way could justify such a reckless break-in with so much at stake with Nixon’s re-election. There had to be a more important reason, a crucial one, for justifying the break-in.” At this point Howard raised both his hands so that their palms were facing me and waved them from side to side. It was his way of ending our discussion about Watergate. It was obvious that the burglars were arrested before they could do any of their assigned tasks inside the DNC and there was no way of knowing if Cuban Government documents were there. So the rest of our dinner was devoted to discussing how his children would cope with their mother being dead and with his going into prison and also with my personal circumstances. After dinner and when we were outside the restaurant on the sidewalk I decided to make one more stab at learning what was behind Watergate. I asked Howard, “Why was Kennedy assassinated? What could have been in the Cuban Government documents on his assassination that was so important to justify a break-in?” In 1975 at the time of the dinner I was not a student of the Kennedy assassination. Nor was I very familiar with Aliens and UFOs. Neither of these subjects was on my radar screen so to speak. So Howard’s parting comments did not register much with me although I did recognize because he had uttered them that they were significant and something to remember.

So Howard’s parting comments did not register much with me although I did recognize because he had uttered them that they were significant and something to remember. It was not until 2006 when the Kennedy Assassination Topic of the Education Forum based in England started a members’ thread on me that I began to acquire detailed knowledge of JFK’s assassination. The forum’s thread was initiated because Billie Sol Estes, LBJ’s silent business partner and bagman, had told me in 1984 about LBJ being behind JFK’s assassination. It was also around that same time that I started listening to Coast-to-Coast am on the radio each night whose moderator was the charismatic Art Bell. Many of its programs dealt with the circumstantial evidence of UFOs and Aliens. Only then did I start to connect the dots as to what Howard had told me forty years earlier. Corso says a covert government group was assembled under the leadership of Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, the first director of Central Intelligence (see Majestic 12). Among its task was to collect all information on off-planet technology. The US administration simultaneously discounted the existence of flying saucers in the eyes of the public, Corso says. Corso distributed Alien artifacts to major corporations in his position as Chief of the Pentagon’s Foreign Technology desk in Army Research and Development, working under Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau. He did this in 1961 through 1963, the years that Kennedy was president. Such distribution required approval by the president as distribution of the Alien artifacts to major corporations was a highly classified project. There is reason to believe that Kennedy first learned of the Alien Presence when he was in Naval Intelligence in the 1940s. He was a close friend of Secretary of Defense James Forrestal in the Truman administration who allegedly had full knowledge of the Alien Presence. Professor of Astronomy Dr. Donald Menzel at Harvard, a member of Majestic 12, knew Kennedy when the latter was a member of the university’s Board of Overseers and also a U.S. Senator and offered in 1957 to tell him what he knew after he received a high security clearance. Finally, on November 12, 1963 – just ten days before his murder – he signed National Security Action Memorandum 271 addressed to the Administrator of NASA that directed specific steps be taken to implement cooperation with the Soviet Union on outer space exploration and a landing on the moon. He personally signed the memorandum and sent a copy to each major official in his administration that this was now to be national", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:63:397733f6469b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 137, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 64, "text": "knew after he received a high security clearance.

He personally signed the memorandum and sent a copy to each major official in his administration that this was now to be national policy. Kennedy’s end run around the sector of the Deep State that dealt with the Alien Presence posed a threat to that all powerful group and led to the decision that Kennedy must be assassinated. There are many theories as to why Kennedy was killed but this is the one I embrace. As Mary Meyer Pinchot, JFK’s mistress, was later quoted as saying, he was moving too fast and he could not be controlled. She, too, was killed the year after JFK’s death because she knew too much. This is the only paradigm in the JFK assassination that makes any sense and in which all the contradictions, inconsistencies, and anomalies disintegrate. The operation was no different in principle from the ones carried out in places like Iran, Guatemala, Chile, and Cuba and for the same reason: to protect U.S. national-security from a political leader whose policies were perceived to pose a grave threat to U.S. national security. One of the fascinating aspects of the Kennedy assassination has always been the reluctance or the refusal of the mainstream press to consider the matter from the standpoint of one of the bedrock principles of American jurisprudence – the presumption of innocence, especially since Oswald was claiming that he was an innocent man. In fact, not only did Oswald deny that he killed the president, he went a critically important step further – he claimed that he was being framed. The mainstream press has never shown any desire to confront that possibility and deal with it. Indeed, they have simply accepted a set of very pat facts, all of which have all the earmarks of good frame-up. Moreover, within an hour of the assassination, it was being conveniently blamed on a purported communist, Lee Harvey Oswald, whose communist bona fides were being established with a press release by a CIA front organization in New Orleans called the DRE, almost immediately after Kennedy was pronounced dead. A few weeks later the New York Times broke the decades long silence about the Alien Presence in an article published on December 14, 2017, “Glowing Auras and ‘Black Money’: The Pentagon’s Mysterious U.F.O.

Because– Who knows? What if? Remember the “Deep Throat” scoop? – it just might be true. In October 2006, I was summoned to the office of Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair’s editor. I entered, blinking back the glare of the eggshell carpet, the blond wood walls, the midday sun streaming in through wraparound windows. Carter slid a letter across his swooping desk, slick as a skating pond. It was marked privileged confidential communication. His mother … only recently told my client that John F. Kennedy was his father. My client’s physical appearance and personality closely resemble JFK. He has been stopped on the street on numerous occasions by strangers who have told him such resemblance is remarkable.… It is my client’s desire to give the exclusive rights to his story to Vanity Fair … subject to his paternity being validated by Vanity Fair through a DNA test involving blood, saliva, hair root or semen. The references to bodily fluids threw me for a moment. But my focus soon narrowed to the giddy gist of it. The chance to bring to light a stealth claimant to the Camelot mantle was the media equivalent of the Holy Grail. Here was the tale of a boy raised in obscurity, ignorant of his origins, living for years in the distant provinces, who had suddenly discovered his roots. To make matters even more enticing: the secret, if true, had been kept for nearly 45 years. Alarm bells, naturally, were going off. How many times had would-be Kennedy heirs come out of the woodwork? And how many tall tales had originated, as did Caddy’s letter, in the dark heart of conspiracy country – vast, incorrigible Texas, where J.F.K. was murdered, L.B.J. connived and thrived, and two presidents Bush catapulted from the oil business to the Oval Office?

And who, for that matter, was Caddy? The Vanity Fair article, with its twists and turns, can be read online. David Friend is a talented writer and author a highly praised book published in 2017, The Naughty Nineties. Upon reading the article the reader is forced to ask why Jack Worthington never took the final steps necessary to prove that JFK was his father. It remained a mystery to me until a mutual friend of Jack and I, author Barr McClellan, cleared it up when he told me in 2016 that Jack became afraid if it were proven he was the son of JFK, he might be killed as were JFK and other family members. In the course of the interview Jim Marrs makes the unrelated observation that the deaths in the Kennedy family all took place in the same hour in sidereal time. Sidereal time is calculated on the movement of the stars and is used by the astronauts, astrologers, and astrophysicists. We, of course, use Greenwich Mean Time based on the movement of the Earth around the Sun, which, like Sidereal Time, is broken into 24 hours. For a description of Sidereal time, check out the link below: Jim Marrs discloses in the interview that all the Kennedy deaths took place in the 16th hour of Sidereal Time: Joe Kennedy, Jr. in 1944, JFK in 1963, Bobby in 1968, John Jr. in 1999 – and Ted Kennedy in a near fatal plane crash in 1964. He says it is like saying the deaths all took place between Noon and 1 P.M. Abstract: When four members of a given family are killed at the same time of day on different dates, the implications of a conspirator planning these incidents are overwhelming. Surprisingly, this has passed right under the noses of the law enforcement agencies and the American people when we consider the reality of the prominent Kennedy family deaths. Four members of this highly placed political family have died within a span of 60 minutes out of a 24 hour day when measuring time by an astronomical timing convention used by astronomers, NASA and the DOD. Joseph Patrick Kennedy Jr. in 1944, John F. Kennedy in 1963, Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 and John F. Kennedy Jr. in 1999 all died within this period. Furthermore,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:66:e70445bfb1ec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 140, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "the American people when we consider the reality of the prominent Kennedy family deaths.

Joseph Patrick Kennedy Jr. in 1944, John F. Kennedy in 1963, Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 and John F. Kennedy Jr. in 1999 all died within this period. Furthermore, the attempted as- sassination of President-elect JFK in 1960, and Ted Kennedy’s alleged airplane accident in 1964 also fall within this 60 minute astronomical or sidereal time interval. The odds of these eight incidents to have occurred by random chance is less than one in 191-million. This “Kennedy” example will provide an illustration of how not only itinerary timing but the placement of incidents has been applied to other historically significant events in American history, including the incidents that occurred on September 11th, 2001.2 The key point is that they all occurred within the same “sidereal hour” out of a 24-hour day. The sidereal time is the time that a given star passes directly along a north-south line (that is, “transits”) overhead, regardless of your position on Earth. Hence, whenever the star Vega transits your position, day or night at your location, it is 18:37 local sidereal time. (The clock on the wall and local sidereal time are only synchronized once a year at a given location due to Earth’s advancing annual orbit.) Decades later in what amounted to a death bed confession of JFK’s assassination Howard sent a recording to his son, St. John, in 1997 that implicated Sturgis. St. John later wrote a book about his father, Bond of Secrecy (Trine Day, 2013). Amazon, in offering the book for sale, describes it as follows: A father’s last confession to his son about the CIA, Watergate, and the plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy, this is the remarkable true story of St. John Hunt and his father E. Howard Hunt, the infamous Watergate burglar and CIA spymaster. In Howard Hunt’s near-death confession to his son St. John, he revealed that key figures in the CIA were responsible for the plot to assassinate JFK in Dallas, and that Hunt himself was approached by the plotters, among whom included the CIA’s David Atlee Phillips, Cord Meyer, Jr., and William Harvey, as well as future Watergate burglar Frank Sturgis. An incredible true story told from an inside, authoritative source, this is also a personal account of a uniquely dysfunctional American family caught up in two of the biggest political scandals of the 20th century.

In 2013 I was listening to national Power Hour radio show on which Robert Merritt and retired New York Police Detective James Rothstein were being interviewed. My name came up in the interview and so I contacted Rothstein, whose legendary exploits as a NYPD detective are profiled in the book, Times Square (Bantam, 1980). As a result he and I in recent years have been engaged in collaborative research into sundry types of criminal activity. Rothstein’s mantra as a detective is “You learn that ‘The Street” talks to you. It tells you “everything.’ All you have to do is learn to ‘listen’.” Rothstein has given me permission to reproduce his detective report on his historical encounter with Frank Sturgis in 1977, which illuminates an untold story about the Kennedy assassination. What follows is his report about Sturgis’ visit to New York City to murder Marita Lorenz. Lorenz was Castro’s girl friend until the CIA recruited her to kill him. In 1963 she accompanied Sturgis and other Cuban Americans in November 1963 as they drove from Miami to Dallas to assassinate JFK. Lorenz was another person who knew too much and was marked for death. n the morning of October 31, 1977, Halloween day, Det. Rothstein re-Iceived a call from Paul Meskil, a reporter for the New York Daily News. Meskil was beside himself. Monica Lorenz, the daughter of Marita Lorenz, had just been arrested in front of her apartment on York Avenue in possession of a loaded gun. She was to be the last line of defense for Marita. Monica was hiding in the bushes in front of the apartment building on Eighty Eighth Street and York Avenue; she was going to ambush Sturgis when he showed up to kill Marita. Meskil knows that the only two Detectives he can trust are Rosenthal and Rothstein; he knows they will not back down or be stopped. The Detectives notified members of the New York Senate Select Committee on Crime, their present assignment, of the call. They jump into action. They first call the arresting officer of Monica and verify that the arrest had been made for possession of a gun. They then set up a meeting with Marita Lorenz and Paul Meskil at a small restaurant on the East Side. They all meet at the restaurant at approximately 11:00 a.m. Marita verifies what Meskil had told the Detectives. She was very upset, anxious, and scared. She feared for her and her children’s lives. Marita tells the Detectives that she is scheduled to testify at the House Assassination Hearings in Washington, DC, concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:68:004bfc5d84be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 142, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 69, "text": "a gun.

Marita tells the Detectives that she is scheduled to testify at the House Assassination Hearings in Washington, DC, concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Meskil tells the Detectives that he is in possession of a tape recording made of a conversation between Marita Lorenz and Frank Sturgis; the tape is hidden at his residence in Nassau County, New York. In the tape Sturgis tells Marita, “You know what the rules are and what happens if you talk.” Meskil tells the Detectives to pick up the tape at his house and that his son would give the Detectives the tape. Meskil tells the Detectives that he will be leaving for the Far East as soon as our meeting is over. At approximately 1 : 00 P.M. ., the Detectives leave the restaurant with Marita and go to her apartment on Eighty Eighth Street and York Avenue. When Detectives Rosenthal, Rothstein, and Marita enter the apartment, the detectives do a quick canvass of the apartment. They see 10 to 15 boxes sitting against the wall in the dining room. The rest of the day and early evening were spent interviewing Marita in preparation for the arrival of Sturgis. Marita tells the detectives that the boxes contain documentation concerning OP40, the Cuban invasion, Castro, planning for the Kennedy assassination, and other covert operations that she had knowledge of. These documents were going to be delivered to the House Assassination Hearings. The Detectives believe they have more than sufficient evidence to arrest Sturgis. On October 31, 1977, at approximately 2130 hours Det. Mathew Rosenthal and Det. Jim Rothstein arrested Frank Sturgis when he came to assassinate Marita Lorenz, a witness to the planning of the Kennedy assassination. When Sturgis rang Marita to gain entry to the building, Rosenthal and Rothstein assumed their position. They crouched low next to the door with their guns drawn and their shields pinned to their suit jackets. When Sturgis entered the premises, Rothstein placed his gun in Sturgis’ mouth and shouted, “Police! You’re under arrest mother xxxxer; don’t move.” Sturgis mumbles, “I hope you’re Detectives.” Rosenthal had his gun put to Sturgis’ chest and identified himself as a Police Officer. The Detectives searched Sturgis. Once the Detectives knew that the scene was under control, Rothstein congratulates Sturgis for assassinating John F. Kennedy. Rothstein tells Sturgis that he was present when Kennedy ordered the bombing and support to stop, just as the invasion of the Bay of Pigs began.

Rothstein tells Sturgis that he was present when Kennedy ordered the bombing and support to stop, just as the invasion of the Bay of Pigs began. Sturgis says, “The only way you can know that is if you were on the Essex.” Rothstein replies, “Yes, I was.” Rothstein and Sturgis shook hands; they were both professionals and were doing their job. Detectives Rothstein and Rosenthal questioned Sturgis for approximately two hours at Marita’s apartment before taking him for booking at the local precinct. During this time, Sturgis was very frank with the Detectives. He admitted that he was on the Grassy Knoll at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, when Kennedy was assassinated and that he was one of the shooters from the Grassy Knoll. The Detectives received valuable information from Sturgis. Sturgis tells the Detectives that OP40’s mandate was “to protect our country at all costs.” When Sturgis was asked why Kennedy was assassinated, he told the Detectives that there were three reasons. Number one was that Kennedy had double-crossed OP40 in the Bay of Pigs Invasion by pulling back the support. Number two was that he (Kennedy) had been told to stay away from the women, especially the Russian woman, Ellen Rometsch, because he would be compromised and jeopardize national security. Number three was that Kennedy was destroying the black community through his liberal social programs. The second part of the questioning was about his involvement in the Watergate Break-in that occurred on June 17, 1972. Sturgis was one of the five burglars arrested by Sgt. Paul Leeper, Det. Carl Shoffler, and Det. John Barrett, of the Washington D.C. Police Department. Sturgis said it was a set-up from the start, there had to have been a rat on the inside who sold them out. Sturgis said the break-in was to get the “book” that had the names of clients who used the prostitution and pedophile ring operating out of the Democratic National Headquarters. This information was to be used to compromise both Republican and Democratic clients who used the ring. The break-in led to the fall of President Richard Nixon on August 8, 1974. President Nixon had nothing to do with the planning of the break-in. In fact he had no prior knowledge that the break-in was going to occur. Later Shoffler would tell Rothstein that he had somebody on the inside and had received information that the break-in was going to happen. Shoffler’s shift had ended one and a half hours before he made the arrest. In 2012, Robert Merritt called retired Det. Rothstein and stated that he was Shoffler’s informant.

In a book written by Robert Merritt, Watergate Exposed, he tells the tale of the break-in. When Sturgis was taken to the local precinct the Detectives identified themselves and told the desk lieutenant that they were booking Frank Forini (Sturgis’ real name). They took Sturgis to the Detectives room and began processing the arrest. That’s when things got strange. Rosenthal advises Sturgis of his rights. Sturgis asks to make a call, which Rothstein does. He tells Rothstein to call Gaeton Fonzi, the investigator in the House Assassination Hearings. Rothstein is surprised, that a suspect would call the investigator and he is the suspect. When Fonzi answers the phone, Rothstein identifies himself and tells Fonzi that Sturgis is under arrest and wants to talk to him. Fonzi was dumbfounded. (See The Last Investigation, by Gaeton Fonzi, page 103). Shortly after the call was made the desk officer calls the Detectives to inform them that a Frank Nelson (CIA and Organized Crime in Cuba) was at the desk and was looking for Frank Sturgis, and, if in, fact Forini was Sturgis. The answer was yes. Within minutes all hell broke loose. Every big boss in the Police Department was calling to find out what happened. The Detectives finished booking Sturgis and were requested to report to the offices of John Guido and Harold Hess, two of the top bosses involved in this type of case. When the Detectives arrive at Guido and Hess’s office they are asked if they had anything eat. The Detectives said no. Hess sends out one of his staff to get a six pack of beer and sandwiches. He asks the Detectives, “Is it good and clean arrest?” The Detectives say, “Yes, it is and it is solid.” Hess replies, “Good that is all I want to know.” The Detectives advise Guido and Hess of what happened. Rosenthal and Rothstein are asked to arraign Sturgis and go home and get some rest. At the arraignment of Frank Sturgis in Manhattan Criminal ADA Broomer is assigned to the case. The Detectives inform Broomer of the tape corroborating the allegations made by Marita and Meskil. Broomer asks the Detectives where the tape is. They inform Broomer that they will pick up the tape at Meskil’s residence in Nassau County on their way back to the city from their residences. Early the next morning all hell breaks loose again.

Unknown members of the New York City Police Department went to Meskil’s residence to get the tape. When Meskil’s son answers the door, he sees that it is not Detectives Rosenthal and Rothstein. The son calls the Nassau County Police Department and tells them that somebody was at his door trying to take evidence of the Kennedy assassination. Nassau County Police responded in full force. The New York City Cops were sent packing. Detectives Rosenthal and Rothstein are notified by Guido and Hess of what happened; somebody had sand-bagged them and they should immediately proceed to the Meskil residence and retrieve the tapes. Rosenthal and Rothstein meet with the son at Meskil’s residence and the son was so proud that he had protected the tapes for Rosenthal and Rothstein, as his father had told him to do. The son gives the tapes to the Detectives. The Detectives knew what was coming; the cover-up was started. Detectives Rosenthal and Rothstein take the tape to ADA Broomer’s office and the tape is played. Marita and Meskil were right. Sturgis is heard telling Marita, “You know what the rules are and what happens if you talk.” Broomer and the powers to-be decide that is not a threat. The Detectives argue vehemently that it is clearly a threat and you have to be totally stupid if you don’t understand that. The Detectives know the fix was in. The charges against Sturgis were dropped. Subsequently, Rosenthal, Rothstein, and the City of New York were sued by Sturgis for $16 million for making a false arrest. The case was tried by Judge Leonard Sand in the Federal Court in the Southern District of New York. Sturgis was represented by Henry Rothblatt. Rothstein was called as the last witness late in the day. He was sworn in by the judge and the case was adjourned till the next day. As Det. Rothstein was getting ready to leave the court house, he was warned by unnamed sources that his life was in danger and that he should not go home. Det. Rothstein called one of his informants, who lived in the neighborhood near the court house, and asked her for assistance. She was connected to organized crime figures in the same area. Det. Rothstein left through the back door and was safely taken to an apartment by his informant and her friends. The next morning, Det. Rothstein took the stand to testify.

Before anything was said, Judge Sand was summoned to his chambers. After an hour or so, Det. Rothstein was called to the Judge’s Chambers. Det. Rothstein was asked what it would take for him not to testify. Everybody in the courtroom, especially the media, knew Det. Rothstein was going to let it all hang out. An agreement was reached that the City Of New York was going to pay $2, 500.00 to Sturgis and Det. Rosenthal and Det. Rothstein were to be commended for acting above and beyond the call of duty. Judge Sand advised Det. Rothstein that he would be called in front of the bench and, if Det. Rothstein wanted to make a statement, he could say anything he wanted to say. Det. Rothstein realized it was in his best interest to keep his big mouth shut. As Rothstein turns to leave the courtroom, Sturgis and Rothblatt shake Rothstein’s hand and asked if he would be part of their organization. Rothstein replies, “It is an honor for you to ask, but I cannot do that.” He left the courthouse. ometime during the summer of 1983, Retired Detective Rothstein was Ssitting at the bar in Georgia’s Bar and Restaurant at 722 South Wellwood Avenue, Lindenhurst, New York talking to customers. A well-dressed man, wearing typical “spook” attire, came in and sat next to Rothstein. He introduced himself as a former New York City police officer who had moved to Florida. During an hour conversation he told Rothstein that when Detectives Rosenthal and Rothstein arrested Frank Sturgis he was sent with a “bag of money” from Florida to get Sturgis out of jail. He did not say where the money came from. He knew all the facts about Sturgis. Rothstein has never seen or heard from him again and never knew why he came in the first place. Will the mystery of the Kennedy assassination ever be solved? It is unlikely as the Secret Service destroyed all its records dealing with the event and the CIA continues to stall release of all its key documents and when some of these are released they are heavily redacted.

Just as in Watergate the new scandal came out of nowhere, and I had no prior knowledge of any of its criminal activity. At its center was Tongsun Park who was the first student I met upon enrolling in Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service in 1956. We became close friends while at Georgetown and remained so in the years following my graduating in 1960. When I was released by the Army following my six months of active duty at Fort Jackson at the end of 1961, Tongsun invited me to be his house guest at his spacious Georgetown residence in Washington. I stayed there for five months before moving back to New York City in June 1962 to enroll in New York University’s School of Law at night while working in the daytime in Governor Rockefeller’s private office in Manhattan for Lieutenant Governor Malcolm Wilson. Tongsun and I continued to be in touch with each other thereafter in a sporadic fashion. He had known of my involvement in the founding of Young Americans for Freedom and in the birth of the modern Conservative Movement. So when in October 1964 Tongsun incorporated the International Youth Federation for Freedom (IYFF) in Washington he invited me to serve on its board of directors and I agreed to do so even though both of us recognized that my being in New York City in night law school and working in the day meant that I could not play an active role in the new organization. Park’s activities in the United States first came to the attention of the intelligence community in 1962 when one of the domestic components reported that Park and his Georgetown roommate, Douglas Caddy, were forming “a new and hopefully potent international anticommunist youth organization,” called the International Federation of Free Youth. The intelligence officer who reported this information noted that his source, a close associate of Park, had not asked for support or guidance, but had passed the information along because U.S. intelligence “should be informed of this type of activity from the beginning.” Although the intelligence officer told his superiors he would “appreciate an expression of interest in pursuing the development,” there is no indication in intelligence files that any further action was taken.

Moreover, relevant intelligence components have informed the Committee that they have never had any relationship with Mr. Caddy. The same intelligence source which provided information about the International Federation of Free Youth was questioned several years later about the George Town Club and Park’s involvement in the Club. There is no indication of what generated this later intelligence interest in that subject, nor is there evidence of any response to the intelligence officer’s request to be notified by his superiors if there were interest in access to Park through the source. Intelligence files do reflect that at about this time a proposal was made, but rejected, to utilize the George Town Club as an operational base.1 As it worked out IYFF was basically a paper organization. It was essentially dormant during its entire existence although the manager’s office of the exclusive George Town Club in Washington that Tongsun owned also served as IYFF’s office. The George Town Club’s membership comprised the elite of Washington who flocked to the exclusive dining facility not only for its superb menu but for being able to mingle with senators and congressman who comprised the bulk of the membership.2 Earlier when General Foods Corporation had sent me in 1969 from its White Plains headquarters to Washington to be its Washington Representative Tongsun had given me a free membership in the George Town Club. I regularly attended dinners there that Tongsun hosted that were attended by many members of congress. Congressman Richard Hanna (D-CA) on many occasions entertained the diners with humor and songs. (Hanna would later be the sole member of Congress to go to prison for involvement in Koreagate.) As described in Wikipedia, “Koreagate was an American political scandal in 1976 involving South Korean political figures seeking influence from 10 Democratic members of Congress. An immediate goal of the scandal seems to have been reversing President Richard Nixon’s decision to withdraw troops from South Korea. It involved the Korea Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) allegedly funneling bribes and favors through Korean businessman Tongsun Park in an attempt to gain favor and influence for South Korean objectives.” I was thrust into the scandal when the Washington Post published an article on me by reporter Maxine Cheshire that attempted to implicate me in the scandal.

Cheshire’s article implied that I was somehow a central figure in Koreagate. I was puzzled by this unfavorable attention being lavished on me since I knew nothing about the payoff scandal. It wasn’t until decades later in reading a deposition of Washington Police Detective Carl Shoffler in which he declared that Maxine Cheshire was one of his closest friends that I realized what likely motivated her animosity. Shoffler, having failed to have me killed in the weeks after Watergate broke and being frustrated that I came out clean in that scandal, allegedly influenced Cheshire to reopen his abuse of me. I wonder what a psychiatrist would make of this fixation on me by Shoffler, a closeted married gay with two children. As an undergraduate in Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service in the late 1950s, Tongsun already was a budding host. He rented a duplex on Q Street and threw spectacular parties, with live bands and an abundance of food and drink. Washington lawyer Douglas Caddy, a classmate and one of Park’s best friends, says Tongsun “became an instant celebrity on campus,” winning the freshman class presidency. He took a year off from school, and with funds from his wealthy oilman father bought a parking lot and several pieces of real estate and worked at meeting people. “He is completely generous,” says Caddy, “He seems to anticipate people’s problems and offer help even before the problems are voiced.” Park recently solved a problem for columnist Abigail (“Dear Abby”) Van Buren. She liked his Korean mother-of-pearl-inlaid living room table so much that he had one made for her in Korea and shipped it over. It took eight months.… Now bigger revelations seem inevitable. Says Park’s friend Caddy: “I don’t rule out anything. I think it goes very deep. Tongsun moved in very powerful circles.” Sure enough two days later there was a knock on my front door and when I opened it a man thrust a paper in my hand and declared, “You are being served with a subpoena.” After he departed I examined the subpoena and I discovered it was from the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and gave a date and time for me to appear at the Committee’s office.

I then remembered that I had introduced Tongsun to McKneally but this occurred many years before McKneally was elected to Congress. McKneally, a former National Commander of the American Legion, at that time was a close associate of Lieutenant-Governor Malcolm Wilson for whom I worked. So I explained my relationship with McKneally to the investigator, which satisfied him. The investigator then left the room, leaving behind an inch-thick file on the conference table that was labeled in large letters, “Douglas Caddy file.” I sensed it was a trap to see whether I would be tempted to look at the file while the investigator was out of the room, so I made no effort to move. To me it was obviously a fake file and I had been given a test. I was surprised and shocked at this announcement because I knew nothing about the details of the Koreagate scandal that involved a large number of Members of Congress. After a moment I replied, “I shall be happy to testify before your committee at its public hearing. I shall prepare an opening statement in which I shall declare under oath that I know nothing about payments by Tongsun Park to members of congress and that this hearing sounds like a rerun from Watergate wherein the original prosecutors focused on the little people like me who were not involved so as to let the big fish get away.” (Among the big fish that got away in Koreagate was Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill.) Most of the largess Park passed out in little white envelopes had been detailed before in the press in months of front-page headlines. Fewer than 10 members were seriously implicated by his testimony – far less than the 115 that had been predicted in one New York Times account. And those most incriminated were no longer in Congress…. In 2005 Park was accused of acting as an intermediary with corrupt United Nations officials in the oil-for-food conspiracy orchestrated by Saddam Hussein. His name surfaced as part of investigations into the oil-for-food scandal. In July 2006 he was convicted in a U.S. federal court on conspiracy charges. He became the first person convicted through the oil-for-food investigation. On February 22, 2007, he was sentenced to five years in prison. He also was fined $15, 000 and required to forfeit $1, 200, 000. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons Web site, he was released from prison on September 10, 2008.

The next day, he left the United States for South Korea. n 1979, I moved from Washington, D.C. to Houston, Texas and was admitted to the Texas Bar to practice law that same year. I had been admitted to the District of Columbia Bar in 1970. In 1980, George Strake, Jr., who was the Texas Secretary of State in the first administration of GOP Governor William Clements, asked me to join his staff as Director of Elections for the State of Texas. Enforcement of the Texas election code in the state’s 254 counties fell within the purview of the Secretary of State and still does today. In 1981, while still employed by the State of Texas, I was contacted by Howard Phillips, Chairman of the Conservative Caucus, Inc., of Vienna, Virginia, who had been one of the original founders of Young Americans for Freedom. Phillips asked me to become legal counsel to the Texas Policy Institute, which was about to receive a $250, 000 grant from the Moody Foundation of Galveston, Texas. After receiving the grant, the Texas Policy Institute in 1982 organized a National Conference on the Star Wars space defense initative to encourage the authorization of the Star Wars Project, which later was officially proposed by President Reagan. Howard Phillips invited Senator Jesse Helms, an early advocate of the Star Wars Project, to address the conference at its opening session, which took place at a well-attended dinner at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas. At the dinner Phillips presented an award to Senator Helms, who left early the next morning to return to Washington. Among the Star Wars Conference attendees was historian J. Evetts Haley, author of the best-seller book, A Texan Looks at Lyndon (Palo Duro Press, 1964). However, I knew next to nothing about Moody’s activities in the period before 1981, when I met him for the first time. When I worked with him he had serious health problems stemming from high blood pressure and had long since stopped giving wild parties at his ranch in Galveston. He spent much of each year in Durham, N.C., where he was enrolled under supervision on the low-sodium rice diet made famous by a doctor associated with Duke University.

As I was to learn the Moody Foundation and the Moody family’s American National Insurance Company also of Galveston had been linked to organized crime funding of casinos in Las Vegas in the 1960s, foremost among these being the Sands. This occurred when Shearn Moody and his brother, Robert, as trustees lost control of their foundation. The Moody family eventually got control back after bringing a lawsuit that ended the mob funding. Here is the link to a New York Times article, “Intrigue, Texas Style,” about this period of time that preceded my working in the early 1980s with Shearn Moody and the Moody Foundation. http://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/06/archives/intrigue-texas-size-questionable-dealshaunt-caretakers-of.html In 1986, Shearn Moody, Jr. fell under the influence of a con man, William Pabst. His association with Pabst eventually led to his losing his post as a trustee of the Moody Foundation. Pabst fled Houston in 1986 and is today still a fugitive from justice, wanted by both federal and Texas law enforcement for his criminal activities. His conviction was later reversed and remanded on two of the thirteen charges by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. His other conviction for bankruptcy fraud, however, was affirmed. His close adviser for many years, Norman Revie, was convicted with him of bankruptcy fraud and is today, like Pabst, a fugitive from justice. The IRS turned out to be its own worst enemy in the case of Shearn Moody defrauding the Moody Foundation. I had moved to California in 1988 when months later I received a letter in the mail from the IRS that had been forwarded to me from an old Houston address. The letter requested that I appear before the IRS at its Houston office. Because I believed it was my duty to assist the authorities investigating the Moody Foundation case, I decided to make a quick trip to Houston to answer any questions the IRS might have. Big, big mistake. When I showed up with my attorney/accountant the IRS agent could not have been more abusive in his tirade. I and my attorney/accountant were shocked. As the meeting ended the out-of- control agent yelled at me, “Since you appeared today the IRS now has jurisdiction over you.” My attorney/accountant became alarmed and scared at this IRS abuse and withdrew from representing me in the case. I felt like a fool.

I asked that both I and the agent be required to testify under oath with the penalty of perjury about the transaction. The U.S. government refused to let the IRS Criminal Intelligence agent testify because my evidence was air-tight and as a consequence the federal judge who oversaw Moody’s foundation trial dismissed all 13 charges on which Moody had been convicted upon a motion by Moody, apparently on the ground that the U.S. government had failed to disclose the role of the IRS agent at Moody’s trial for defrauding the Moody Foundation. On October 6, 1976, Rep. Henry Gonzales (D-TX) spoke on the House floor about IRS Project Southwest, terming it “clearly a political operation.… Nixon’s people wanted some action against Texas Democrats.… It was a classic case of the abuse of governmental power – deliberate and with malice aforethought.” As disclosed by the BNA Securities Regulation and Law Report of December 7, 1977, “IRS’s election-year Project Southwest focused on 164 Texans with political connections in the state, although the only IRS target identified so far is Shearn Moody, Jr., a wealthy Galveston banker with Democratic ties. At its height, the covert operation – designed in IRS’ words, ‘to learn as much as we can about Texas political relationships, influence and payoffs’ – utilized 27 revenue agents from Treasury and the IRS. “The SEC cooperated with the IRS in investigating Shearn Moody, Jr. It eventually permitted Moody’s attorneys to inspect 12 volumes of investigative files early in 1977. When the BNA later that year requested under the Freedom of Information Act the same files, according to the BNA the SEC “said all the records detailing its own investigation of Moody, and its Forbes of October 22, 1990 reported, “But documents unearthed by the Senate Watergate Committee prove that there was indeed a Project Southwest, the apparent goal of which was to harass wealthy Texas Democrats. The documents also show that Treasury Department Secretary Connally had been briefed concerning Project Southwest by the IRS in March 1972.” For Caddy, the front-row seat in a money-and-power scandal is an all-too-familiar occurrence.

As a defense attorney and witness in the Watergate scandal, a friend and former roommate to South Korean lobbyist Tongsun Park, and a one-time publicist in a CIA front company, Caddy turns up in the strangest places. A graduate of Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service and New York University Law School, Caddy became involved in the Watergate scandal just half an hour after the arrest of five burglars in the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Hotel – when he received a 3 a.m. call from former CIA operative E. Howard Hunt. Through it all, Caddy remained active in conservative Republican politics and helped found two youth groups, the Young Americans for Freedom and the International Youth Federation for Freedom. And in 1974, he wrote a book, The Hundred Million Dollar Pay-off, about organized labor’s role in campaign financing. Those grants are now among more than $3 million in grants under investigation. Caddy says the investigation of him is “retaliation” for his raising the initial allegations with officials. He also attributes the probe to what he says is a friendship between the Moodys and Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox. Among his grant-funded projects were conferences on terrorism, Hispanics and the “Star Wars” technology, and – at Moody’s request – an investigation into allegations raised by convicted West Texas swindler Billie Sol Estes. Estes has long claimed to have information implicating former President Lyndon B. Johnson in wrongdoing. Shearn Moody on numerous occasions told me how John Connally had attempted to take over the Moody Foundation. At one time the Foundation was placed in the hands of strangers and only through a lawsuit filed by Shearn did the Moody family regain control. Moody provided documents showing that one means Connally utilized his power illicitly was through Project Southwest, which was instituted by the Internal Revenue service under the Nixon Administration when Connally was Secretary of the Treasury. It was essentially a list of Connally’s enemies whom he wanted the IRS to target. After Professor John A. Andrew of Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania published his book The Other Side of the Sixties: Young Americans for Freedom and the Rise of Conservative Politics, he informed me that he had begun writing another book that would deal with abuses by the Internal Revenue Service.

I provided Prof. Andrew with materials that Moody had given me on Project Southwest. Prof. Andrew was intrigued by what he read and through the Freedom of Information Act obtained additional documents on IRS abuses, including more on Project Southwest. However, before he finished his book he suddenly died in 2000. His manuscript was later completed, using his writings and research materials that he left behind, and was published in 2002. Its title is Power to Destroy: The Political Uses of the IRS from Kennedy to Nixon and is available from amazon.com. Among the documents that I gave to Proffesor Andrew was a letter-to-editor from me on Project Southwest that was published in the Wall Street Journal in 1998. A few days after my letter was published, Journal published a responding letter-to-editor from a former IRS Commissioner, who served in the Nixon Administration, disputing my allegation of IRS abuses through Project Southwest while he was Commissioner. Proffesor John Andrew, who had previously studied at the University of Texas and written a book on Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society, contended in his communications to me that Connally, while serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the Nixon Administration, had used IRS Project Southwest to go after his political enemies in Texas. He maintained that Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski, also from Texas, had indicted Connally in part in retaliation for devising Project Southwest. The indictment charged that Connally had accepted a bribe while serving as Secretary of the Treasury. The evidence was strong that he had done so but a Washington, D.C. jury, comprised mainly of African-Americans, found Connally not guilty after the Rev. Billy Graham and Member of Congress Barbara Jordan of Texas, a prominent African-American, testified as character witnesses in his behalf. As historian Prof. Andrew (Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society) shows in this dense study, during the 1960s and ′70s the White House used the power of taxation to attack enemies-and reward friends-with relative impunity. President Kennedy, for example, started an “Ideological Organizations Project” that used the IRS to challenge the tax-exempt status of (and thus choke off the funding from) such right-wing opponents as the John Birch Society. Johnson often promised tax favors to wealthy individuals who could deliver votes. But these abuses pale in comparison to the corruption of the Nixon administration, which used the IRS to persecute people on the president’s notorious “Enemies List.” At Nixon’s request, the IRS launched audits and investigations of a host of real and imagined opponents, including the Jerry Rubin Foundation, the Fund", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:82:c03440225d8c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 156, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 83, "text": "tax-exempt status of (and thus choke off the funding from) such right-wing opponents as the John Birch Society.

The basic intent, Nixon aide John Dean wrote, was to “use the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies.” Though known to Watergate prosecutors, these abuses went largely unreported in the mainstream media because they weren’t sexy enough for the general public. In 1995 I was a witness in an excise tax case that the Internal Revenue Service brought against Shearn Moody on Moody Foundation grants that he had sponsored. I agreed to testify in behalf of Moody because he was in severe ill health and because the out-of-control abuse heaped on me by the IRS had totally alienated me. (Moody died the following year after the Tax Court trial.) In my testimony I wanted to bring out that an IRS Criminal Intelligence Agent directed that $38, 000 of the first Moody Foundation grant I received was to go to a person that he selected. I had the proof in writing of this. However, on the morning of the trial in Tax Court, Moody’s attorney who specializes in tax court cases cautioned me that I should not disclose this in my testimony. He said that the tax court judge was a former IRS agent and might first rule against the admissibility of my evidence to protect the IRS and then might retaliate against Moody in his final decision. When he told me this, I asked him, “Is the fix in?” He shrugged his shoulders and did not respond. I reluctantly acceded to the strategic legal advice given to me by Moody’s tax lawyer. So this crucially important aspect of the case was never entered into the court’s testimony with the result being that Moody generally prevailed in the judge’s final decision. Fortune Magazine opined “The court reduced Moody’s fine and penalty to around $1.4 million. ‘A 97% victory,’ says Moody lawyer William Cousins of Dallas. And maybe a 100% loss for the IRS, since the likelihood that Moody will ever pay the fine is close to zippo.” Moody had been adjudged bankrupt. But for me the case was an eye-opener into the Tax Court just as Judge Sirica’s actions in Watergate were a revelation because while the Tax Court judge basically ruled that all the Moody foundation grant funds that I administered were done properly, my actions in doing so", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:83:1587086c38e0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 157, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 84, "text": "lawyer William Cousins of Dallas.

The trial in Tax Court refused to acknowledge in any manner the elephant in the room: that the federal district court which tried the criminal case that convicted and sent Moody to prison for defrauding the Moody Foundation later dismissed all the charges against him and ordered that Moody be freed from prison because of the refusal of the IRS to let its criminal intelligence agent testify as to the $38, 000 payment when I demanded that he do so before the grand jury. The person who received the $38, 000 as directed by the IRS Criminal Intelligence Agent told me in an unguarded moment in 1986 that IRS Criminal Intelligence had discovered a secret and illegal $1.5 million campaign fund that Vice President George H.W. Bush had set up in Houston for use in the 1984 Reagan-Bush reelection campaign. The money was allegedly held and distributed by Robert Eckels, the Harris County judge, a GOP public official. In 1989 I filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission about the secret fund and asked that it be investigated. While the FEC investigation was underway Eckels, who had retired as county judge, was quoted in the local newspaper as saying that he was writing his autobi- ography in which he would make shocking disclosures that would result in heads being rolled.

Senator Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio even sent an emissary to Houston to visit with me to gather more information. My evidence gained added credibility with the senators considering the proposed reform bill when an employee of the IRS office in Houston offered her personal testimony as to massive wrongdoing in that office. The chickens had finally come home to roost for the out-of-control IRS when Congress enacted the Taxpayer Bill of Rights III after holding congressional hearings where witnesses were hidden behind a screen to prevent retaliation by the IRS as they recounted to the lawmakers their litanies of abuse by the IRS. As will be shown in the next chapter history owes Shearn Moody, despite his many flaws, a debt of gratitude for responding favorably when Billie Sol Estes contacted him about his wanting to come clean by publicly telling the story of his criminal relationship with Lyndon Johnson. Had Moody not encouraged Billie Sol to do so, much of what is now known of LBJ’s use of the stone cold killer Malcolm (Mac) Wallace to commit murders would still be cloaked in secrecy. After the Texas Policy Institute under a Moody Foundation grant sponsored a highly successful conference that I had organized in that I visit him at his ranch there. He told me that he had received a phone call from his former lobbyist in Austin, Jimmy Day, who was then in the federal prison in Big Spring, Texas. It appeared that Day had moved on to Washington, D.C. after he was no longer working for Shearn and had gotten himself in big trouble there. As explained to me by Shearn, Day on a visit to the White House had clandestinely heisted some White House stationery, and then wrote fraudulent letters on it recommending his superior lobbying talents. Shearn termed the felony charge against Day as being “puffery.” In any event Day had called Shearn to say that he wanted Shearn to talk on the phone with another prisoner. When Shearn inquired who that might be, Day said that it was Billie Sol Estes, an infamous criminal whose notoriety approached historical proportions. Day gave the phone to Billie Sol who then informed Shearn that he wanted to tell all he knew about his close criminal relationship over many decades with President Lyndon Johnson, who had died ten years earlier in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:85:5a4f7f35a800", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 159, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 86, "text": "event Day had called Shearn to say that he wanted Shearn to talk on the phone with another prisoner.

Day gave the phone to Billie Sol who then informed Shearn that he wanted to tell all he knew about his close criminal relationship over many decades with President Lyndon Johnson, who had died ten years earlier in 1973. He asked Shearn for a grant from the Moody Foundation that would enable him to do this. Shearn, a history buff, requested that I visit with Billie Sol in prison and get more details. A few weeks later I traveled to Big Spring and met with Billie Sol who told me that he had a story to tell about LBJ that would rock the world. I advised him that the best way to do so would be to write a book and his response was that he would think about it. As our meeting ended I said that I would report back to Shearn what Billie Sol had told me in the event there was a possibility of a Moody Foundation grant. Nothing more happened until early January 1984, about six months after my prison visit, when Billie Sol telephoned Shearn from his home in Abilene and said that he had been released from prison and wanted to tell his story in a book under a Moody Foundation grant. Shearn asked that I travel to Abilene and confer further with Billie Sol. Shearn said that for a foundation grant to be awarded it would require a tax-exempt entity agreeing to sponsor Billie Sol’s proposal. I arrived in Abilene and talked with Billie Sol who readily agreed that writing a book was the best way to tell his story. This was because after I had visited him in prison, he had encouraged his daughter, Pam, to write a book, which she did, “Billie Sol Estes, King of the Wheeler-Dealers.” Her book had been well received and gotten lots of publicity. He said his daughter’s book was only concerned with how the family survived while he was in prison and did not contain any substantive disclosures of his criminal activities with LBJ. He boasted that his tell-all book would be a best-seller. I explained to him that a tax-exempt entity had to be the recipient of the foundation grant under which Billie Sol would write his book. He said that would be no problem and picked up the phone and called the President of Abilene Christian University who agreed to meet us later that afternoon. Billie Sol was a prominent member of the Church of Christ and the university was affiliated with that Church.

At the meeting the university president agreed that if a Moody Foundation grant were forthcoming to the university a portion of it would be allocated for Billie Sol to write his book. Upon returning to Galveston I reported this to Shearn who said that he would sponsor such a Moody Foundation grant in the amount of $500, 000 of which $400, 000 would go to Abilene Christian University for its unrestricted purposes and $100, 000 to Billie Sol. A short time later I returned to Abilene and informed both the university president and Billie Sol of Shearn’s intention of getting a grant approved at the next quarterly meeting of the foundation’s trustees. When I told Billie Sol this news he responded that to disclose what he knew of his and LBJ’s criminal activities he would need to receive immunity from prosecution from the U.S. Department of Justice. By a twist of fate I found myself in a position of possibly securing such immunity. Investigative Research Foundation, which had received Moody Foundation grant, was preparing to sponsor a National Conference on Terrorism, this being 1984 when few persons were talking about it. As the organizer of the conference I had retained as a consultant Edward Miller, former associate director of the FBI, to assist in developing the speakers list and agenda. Miller and former assistant director of the FBI, Mark Felt, had been convicted of doing illegal “black bag” jobs against members of the Weather Underground and other far left-wing radical grounds engaged in illegal activist activities such as exploding a bomb in the U.S. Capitol Building that caused a crack in the building’s famous dome. President Ronald Reagan had pardoned them, asserting they were heroes and not criminals. The key person who had shepherded their pardon process to success was Stephen Trott, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division in the Justice Department. Miller believed that he and I could get an appointment with Trott to discuss Billie Sol receiving a grant of immunity. Estes appearance before the grand jury had been arranged by Clint Peoples, the U.S. Marshal for the Northern District of Texas. Peoples had followed Estes career as a businessman and criminal for 25 years, starting when he was first a Texas Ranger.

During one of these visits Peoples’ pulled out a file from a cabinet that contained a large quantity of material on Estes and LBJ and showed me about a dozen photographs of Henry Marshall’s body when he had been found dead in the field. In her book, Faustian Bargains: Lyndon Johnson and Mac Wallace in the Robber Baron Culture of Texas, Professor Joan Mellen goes to extraordinary shameful lengths to attack and darken the character of U.S. Marshal Clint Peoples, a truly great American whom I feel privileged to have known. Mellen’s book, nevertheless, is definitely worth reading to get an overall picture of what Texas was like when LBJ and his crooked cronies ruled the state unchallenged. Mellen focuses in her book on Malcolm (Mac) Wallace, whom Billie Sol asserted was a stone cold killer that LBJ used when necessary. In her book, Mellen writes, Mac Wallace is a case in point, his history with Lyndon Johnson is a window into Johnson’s methods. Wallace’s story is so intriguing because, unlike other of Johnson’s acolytes, it is difficult to prove what he did for Lyndon Johnson and what Lyndon Johnson did, in turn, for him. More than any other of Johnson’s protégés and acolytes, Wallace’s connection to him remains cloaked in secrecy. I have considered the materials and information you have provided to me in connection with your representation of Billy Sol Estes. I understand that Mr. Estes claims to have information concerning the possible commission of criminal offenses in Texas in the 1960’s and that he is willing to reveal that information at this time. I also understand that Mr. Estes wants several things in exchange for this information, such as a pardon for the offenses for which he has been convicted and immunity from any further prosecution among other things. Before we can engage in any further discussions concerning Mr. Estes’ cooperation or enter into any agreement with Mr. Estes we must know the following things: (1) the information, including the extent of corroborative evidence, that Mr. Estes has about each of the events that may be violations of criminal law; (2) the sources of his information; and (3) the extent of his involvement, if any, in each of those events or any subsequent cover-ups.

Accordingly, if we are to proceed with meaningful discussions concerning Mr. Estes’ proffered cooperation, we must receive a detailed and specific written offer of proof from you setting forth the information noted above. The government will hold your offer of proof in strictest confidence and will not make any use of it other than to determine the credibility of the proffered information and whether it warrants further discussions with or debriefings of Mr. Estes. I must make sure that several things are understood at this time concerning Mr. Estes’ proffered cooperation. First, if after reviewing your offer of proof we decide the information that Mr. Estes can provide is credible and in all other respects warrants further investigation – a decision which will be made unilaterally by the government – it will be necessary for Mr. Estes to be interviewed and to reveal everything he knows about the possible criminal violations. He will have to do so completely, truthfully and without guile. Second, it must be understood that the government is not now making specific promises to Mr. Estes except with respect to the confidentiality and use of your offer of proof as noted above. If it is decided that Mr. Estes should be interviewed, the extent of promises concerning the confidentiality or use of the statement or promises of reward or consideration to Mr. Estes, if any, will be determined only after we receive a detailed written offer of proof from you. or any investigative agency.

Here is my letter back to Assistant Attorney General Trott: My client, Mr. Estes, has authorized me to make this reply to your letter of May 29, 1984. Mr. Estes was a member of a four-member group, headed by Lyndon Johnson, which committed criminal acts in Texas in the 1960’s. The other two, besides Mr. Estes and LBJ, were Cliff Carter and Mac Wallace. Mr. Estes is willing to disclose his knowledge concerning the following criminal offenses: Mr. Estes is willing to testify that LBJ ordered these killings, and that he transmitted his orders through Cliff Carter to Mac Wallace, who executed the murders. In the cases of murders nos. 1-7, Mr. Estes’ knowledge of the precise details concerning the way the murders were executed stems from conversations he had shortly after each event with Cliff Carter and Mac Wallace. In addition, a short time after Mr. Estes was released from prison in 1971, he met with Cliff Carter and they reminisced about what had occurred in the past, including the murders. During their conversation, Carter orally compiled a list of 17 murders which had been committed, some of which Mr. Estes was unfamiliar. A living witness was present at that meeting and should be willing to testify about it. He is Kyle Brown, recently of Houston and now living in Brady, Texas. Mr. Estes states that Mac Wallace, whom he describes as a “stone killer” with a communist background, recruited Jack Ruby, who in turn recruited Lee Harvey Oswald. Mr. Estes says that Cliff Carter told him that Mac Wallace fired a shot from the grassy knoll in Dallas, which hit JFK from the front during the assassination. Mr. Estes asserts that Mr. Ronnie Clark, of Wichita, Kansas, has attempted on several occasions to engage him in conversation. Mr. Clark, who is a frequent visitor to Las Vegas, has indicated in these conversations a detailed knowledge corresponding to Mr. Estes’ knowledge of the JFK assassination. Mr. Clark claims to have met with Mr. Jack Ruby a few days prior to the assassination, at which time Kennedy’s planned murder was discussed. Mr. Estes desires to discuss the infamous illegal cotton allotment schemes in great detail. He has recordings made at the time of LBJ, Cliff Carter and himself discussing the scheme. These recordings were made with Cliff Carter’s knowledge as a means of Carter and Estes protecting themselves should LBJ order their deaths.

In connection with Item #1 , I wish to declare, as Mr. Estes’ attorney, that Mr. Estes is prepared without reservation to provide all the information he has. Most of the information contained in this letter I obtained from him yesterday for the first time. While Mr. Estes has been pre-occupied by this knowledge almost every day for the last 22 years, it was not until we began talking yesterday that he could face up to disclosing it to another person. My impression from our conversation yesterday is that Mr. Estes, in the proper setting, will be able to recall and orally recount criminal matters. It is also my impression that his interrogation in such a setting will elicit additional corroborative evidence as his memory is stimulated. Perhaps no other president has a more ambiguous reputation than Lyndon Johnson. A brilliant tactician, he maneuvered colleagues and turned bills into law better than anyone. But he was trailed by a legacy of underhanded dealings, from his “stolen” Senate election in 1948 to kickbacks he artfully concealed from deals engineered with Texas wheeler-dealer Billie Sol Estes, defense contractors, and his Senate aid Bobby Baker. On the verge of investigation, Johnson was reprieved when he became president upon John F. Kennedy’s assassination. Among the remaining mysteries of his life has been LBJ’s relationship with Malcolm “Mac” Wallace, who, in 1951, shot a Texas man having an affair with LBJ’s loose-cannon sister Josefa, also Wallace’s lover. When arrested, Wallace coolly said, “I work for Johnson.… I have to get back to Washington.” Charged with murder, he was overnight defended by LBJ’s powerful lawyer John Cofer, and though convicted, amazingly received a suspended sentence. He then received a secret security clearance to work for LBJ friend and defense contractor D.H. Byrd, which the Office of Naval Intelligence tried to revoke for years without success. In 1984 I arranged for Lucianne Goldberg, a prominent literary agent in New York City who later became famous in the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal, to meet with Billie Sol and me in Abilene to discuss his writing a book and getting it published. Among the murders he disclosed at our meeting with that of Josefa Johnson, LBJ’s sister. Billie Sol asserted that in 1961, Josefa was served on Christmas Eve a portion of a cake that contained poison and that she died the next day and was quietly buried the following day in the Johnson family cemetery on the Johnson ranch. For a time after the Kinser death, Josefa Johnson kept her mouth shut, but soon there were additional reports of her talking.

For a time after the Kinser death, Josefa Johnson kept her mouth shut, but soon there were additional reports of her talking. In the end it was decided she could never be trusted. On Christmas day [1961] she became ill and died. I was told she was given poison. When Cliff [Carter] told me this, I had an empty feeling in my stomach. My family is dear to me. I would never consider doing something to them. I believe Lyndon was guided by the vision of his destiny and considered the sacrifice was needed by the people. At the meeting in Abilene attended by Lucianne Goldberg, Billie Sol remarked about the mysterious circumstances that surrounded the death of the daughter of John Connally who died on her wedding night. Lucianne was familiar with the mystery. Billie Sol added that the only man LBJ was ever afraid of was John Connally, one of LBJ’s political allies, because Connally was even more ruthless than LBJ. As the result of Edward Miller and I meeting with Assistant Attorney General Trott he arranged for three young FBI agents to examine the agency’s file on Billie Sol to determine if the pursuit of granting immunity to him was warranted. They concluded it was and the three agents and I flew from Washington to Abilene to meet with Billie Sol to hear what he had to say. Billie Sol showed up at the meeting at a hotel with his daughter, Pam, and immediately stated he would not talk to the FBI agents and was withdrawing from negotiations to gain immunity. He was adamant about this, so the three agents departed and flew back to Washington. After a further series of letters, a meeting was set up at a hotel in Abilene. As the day approached, I received a series of telephone calls from my Italian friends. I was informed my discussions with the Justice Department was a mistake. They insisted that if I appeared to be going through with the discussions, my life would end. I do not know how they found out about the discussions. Now I may be dumb but I am not stupid and I do not have a death wish.

This was that Billie Sol had confessed to me that he had paid a $500, 000 bribe to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark when the Supreme Court was considering a case in which Billie Sol was appealing his conviction for violating Texas law. Billie Sol said that the $500, 000 in cash was delivered to President Johnson on Johnson’s plane at an airport in Texas by Billie Sol and his lawyer, John Cofer. LBJ later disbursed the bribe to Justice Clark, who originally was from Dallas and was part of the Texas Mafia The question presented here is whether the petitioner, who stands convicted in the District Court for the Seventh Judicial District of Texas at Tyler for swindling, was deprived of his right under the Fourteenth Amendment to due process by the televising and broadcasting of his trial. Both the trial court and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found against the petitioner. We hold to the contrary and reverse his conviction. The average American citizen would be shocked upon hearing that a U.S. Supreme Court justice had taken a bribe in a case and had even written the court’s opinion in the case. No doubt that the same citizen would be shocked upon learning that another Supreme Court justice, who had been appointed to the bench by President Johnson, was accused to accepting money then forced to resign from the court. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson nominated Abe Fortas (1910-1982), at the time an associate justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice. In becoming the first such nominee to appear before a Senate committee, Fortas faced hostile questioning about his relationship with LBJ, which had improperly continued while he served on the high tribunal. persuaded a federal judge to take Johnson’s name off the general election ballot while allegations of corruption – including 200 votes cast in alphabetical order for LBJ – were investigated. But after Fortas persuaded Justice Hugo Black to overturn the ruling, Johnson managed to win the general election. On the Senate floor, conservative senators mounted a filibuster against the chief justice nomination, using as a wedge issue Fortas’ acceptance of a $15, 000 fee for a series of university seminars. When supporters could muster only 45 of the 59 votes needed to end debate, Fortas asked the president to withdraw his name – becoming the first nominee for that post since 1795 to fail to win Senate approval. Soon, a larger problem arose.

Soon, a larger problem arose. In 1966, Fortas took a secret retainer from the family foundation of Wall Street financier Louis Wolfson, a friend and former client subsequently imprisoned for securities violations. The deal provided that in return for unspecified advice, Fortas was to receive $20, 000 a year for life. John Cofer represented Billie Sol in his 1965 case before the Supreme Court. Cofer, like Fortas, was involved in rigging the 1948 election that sent LBJ to the Senate. Cofer was Mac Wallace’s attorney in the 1951 homicide trial in which Wallace was found guilty of homicide with malice aforethought in the murder of John Kinser but was awarded a suspended sentence. Cofer was Billie Sol’s attorney in his state and federal criminal cases. In 1998 California producer Lyle Sardie released a fascinating and encompassing documentary, LBJ: A Closer Look. It traces Johnson’s fraudulent rise to power and his behind the scene involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy. I was privileged to be among those interviewed in the documentary, which can be viewed on YouTube. n 1989 a Vietnamese doctor in Houston who performed cosmetology operations such as face lifts retained me as his attorney. His practice was comprised of fellow Vietnamese who had fled Vietnam began to decline precipitously when a competing clinic opened in Southern California. The clinic there paid the roundtrip airfare for Vietnamese living anywhere in the U.S. to travel to the clinic for cosmetology operations. These were performed, but the clinic billed the patients’ insurers for vast amounts, not for the cosmetology operations, but instead for complex surgery operations that were never performed. It was a classic $50 million insurance fraud case. In the midst of the case I was suddenly arrested in 1990 for indecent exposure inside a gay movie theater that required a patron to pay a membership fee to enter. It was a classic anti-gay setup case and I decided to fight it. I learned from a friend, Ray Hill, that the police officer who arrested me had previously been demoted to the vice squad because he had engaged in grossly unprofessional activity. Ray knew what he was talking about because he was the plaintiff in City of Houston vs. Hill, a 1987 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court by a vote of eight to one decided in favor of Hill in a case involving police abuse.

I had Greg Glass, one of most skilled criminal defense attorneys in the city, representing me at trial. The presiding judge could not have been more fair minded. When testifying I spoke directly to the jury. To my surprise the prosecutor introduced into evidence the inch-thick file on the California insurance fraud case that I had provided to it and to the chief of police soon after my arrest. When the prosecutor placed the file before the judge he looked at it and exclaimed, what is this? I replied it was my file on a California insurance fraud case and that I believed my arrest stemmed from someone wanting to kill the investigation into the fraud. This sudden and dramatic twist registered with the jurors who now realized there was more at stake than an indecent exposure case. Their attention quickened noticeably. judge that it wanted to examine my California insurance fraud file. After fifteen minutes those of us in the court room heard howls of laughter from the jury room. This is always a good sign for the defendant. The prosecutor began to look alarmed at what had appeared to him to be a slam dunk case. After another fifteen minutes the jury sent word that it had reached a verdict and filed back into the court room. The judge asked the foreman for the verdict and she responded forthrightly, “We find the defendant not guilty.” Then she gave a handwritten note to the bailiff who took it to the judge. The judge examined it and gave it back to the bailiff and told him to show to me. As he approached me the bailiff ’s eyes were bulging. He showed me the note. All the jurors had signed it. They agreed that I should not have been arrested in the first place because intent to violate the law was lacking. I have chosen not to have my arrest record expunged but instead to let it stand as a testament to gays everywhere that the best legal strategy when faced with such a setup charge is to stand trial and speak directly to the jurors, letting they become familiar with you and hear your side of the case.

Russell Anderson, Third Division Commander, was informed by P. O. Rothstein that the first Deps. (Deputy Commissioners) office had the Stonewall on the “Pad,” and it was time to take action. D.I. Pine was convinced by D.I. Anderson to do a joint division raid, First and Third Divisions, on the Stonewall. This was a “front” for D.I. Anderson to knock off and raid the Stonewall after the First Dep’s “Bagman” had picked up the payoff. When P.O. Rothstein received the signal from bartender/informant Skull Murphy from inside the bar that the payoff had been made to the “Bagman,” it was time for the raid to begin. After the raid the riots started. It was a sight to behold. Transvestites, lesbians, fags, chickens and pedophiles were fighting with the police. The patrons felt they had been double crossed. They had paid off the police and then the police The State of Texas vs. Michael Douglas Caddy raided the premises. They had had enough. The rallying cry, “Go getem girls” could be heard throughout the block. Skull Murphy was said to have escaped, handcuffed to a “drag Queen.” Really!!! The gay community knew it was time to stop the shakedowns, extortions and harassment at the hands of the police and the Mafia. D.I. Pine and all the other Police Officers never knew what really happened. Only P.O. Rothstein and two ranking officers knew the real reason for the raid, which were the illegal payoffs being made to the police and organized crime. It solidified P.O. Rothstein’s trust within the homosexual underground that he was a standup guy. The Stonewall raid led to an official investigation in 1970, the Knapp Commission. The Knapp Commission investigated corruption in the Police Department. It was headed by Whitman Knapp. Maurice Nadjari was named the Special Prosecutor in 1972. In my letter to FBI Director Comey I stated that “I knew Roger Stone of the Trump presidential campaign forty years ago in Washington. Because of this Harley Schlanger of the LaRouche organization, whom I also knew, earlier this year asked me to arrange a meeting between him and Stone. I agreed to do so. Such a meeting took place in February [2016].

This ultimately led to Russian intelligence hacking the emails of the Democratic National Committee, which became a major issue in the presidential campaign and continues to do so to this day. Stone may have played a role in Wikileaks being given the hacked emails for distribution to the public. With my letter to Director Comey I attached a number of emails that I had received from Schlanger and Stone on this matter. Relevant quotations from some of these follow later in this memo. In addition I sent copies of my letter to Director Comey to President Obama and CIA Director Peter Goss as a safeguard that it would not be deep-sixed. “On December 10, 2016, I sent the enclosed letter with its email attachments to FBI Director James Comey about the above referenced matter. I never heard back from him and hence I am writing you. My motivation in doing so is because I fear that our democracy was severely endangered by Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election. Alarmingly, this Russian threat is unabated. The continued existence of the United States as a free nation is at stake. “Here is a brief summary of my letter to Director Comey: In January 2016 Harley Schlanger of the LaRouche organization contacted me to request that I set up a meeting for him with Roger Stone of the Trump Campaign. Their meeting was held in Austin, Texas, in February 2016. I was unable to attend but my impression is that as a result of that meeting the LaRouche organization agreed to use its extensive Russian contacts to open up a back channel for the Trump campaign to communicate directly with Russian intelligence. “A month before Schlanger contacted me to set up the meeting with Stone, a LaRouche delegation sympathetic to Russia attended the RT anniversary dinner in Moscow in December 2015 where Premier Putin was seated next to General Flynn. For confirmation see the bottom of page 15 and top of page 16 of the famous Christopher Steele British Dossier. Schlanger may have been among those who attended. There are essentially five persons who lead the LaRouche organization today: Lyndon LaRouche (age 94), his wife, Helga, Jeffrey Steinberg, Harley Schlanger and Anton Chaitkin.1 “I am writing you because you possess the investigative power and authority to determine if any of the information provided in this letter and my prior letter to Director Comey merits further investigation.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:97:58d30129b04c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 171, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 98, "text": "page 15 and top of page 16 of the famous Christopher Steele British Dossier.

It may or may not. As a private citizen I am in no position to make that determination. However, I believe it is my solemn duty both as a private citizen and an attorney who is a member of the District of Columbia and Texas Bars to call this matter to your attention.” …former members say LaRouche is omnipotent within the organization.” It further declares that, “According to his 1979 autobiography, The Power of Reason, LaRouche was born into a Quaker family in New Hampshire in 1922 and had only two friends until late in high school. He says the reason for his lack of friends was that his mental capabilities exceeded those of his peers…. As a young man, he joined a socialist group where he ‘perfected’ the theories of Marx.’” I find myself in agreement with some of the policies espoused by the LaRouche organization, such as constructing a modern, transnational “silk road” and reform of the U.S. financial system, including Glass-Steagall reinstatement and creation of a national credit institution for infrastructure and manufacturing. Where I vehemently differ with the group is its alleged role in assisting Russia in influencing the 2016 presidential election. This issue is paramount above all others. first met Roger Stone in 1975 soon after the National Conservative Po-I litical Action Committee (NCPAC) was created. Its chairman was Terry Dolan, a really nice guy who questioned the moral leadership of the conservative movement at the time. He was upset that republican Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina was driving around Washington, D.C. in a convertible with a young blond woman at his side. Charles Black, a key leader in NCPAC, was from North Carolina and was a protégé of Senator Jesse Helms, a racist demagogue if there ever was one. Stone was another leader. Paul Manafort was on the scene but not prominent in the organization. I was the organization’s legal counsel. A short story will suffice in my finding out that Stone was a classic sociopath. On one occasion in 1975 Dolan, Stone and I had lunch together in the greater Washington area and had left the restaurant and were walking down the street. We noticed that on the opposite side of the street an elderly woman who suffered from severe curvature of the spine was walking with what appeared to be her two children, a man and a woman in their thirties.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:98:68eb129a4d39", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 172, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 99, "text": "story will suffice in my finding out that Stone was a classic sociopath.

We noticed that on the opposite side of the street an elderly woman who suffered from severe curvature of the spine was walking with what appeared to be her two children, a man and a woman in their thirties. The poor woman’s agonizing bent over posture was such that her face was almost parallel with the sidewalk. When Stone saw her he immediately let out a yell of delight and began to walk and prance in the same way as the poor woman was doing. He did so while gesturing towards the trio on the other side of the street so as to attract their attention. I was so embarrassed and shocked at Stone’s gross behavior that I ran into a public garage in an attempt to distant myself from him. About twenty years ago I received a phone call from Fox commentator James Rosen (if my memory is correct) and who asked me what I thought of Stone. I told him about the above disturbing incident. In a sense I bear some responsibility for their rise to prominence. While an undergraduate at Georgetown University in 1958 I co-founded with a college friend, David Franke, the National Student Committee for the Loyalty Oath. We did this because there was no conservative movement in existence at the time and we thought we could start such a movement using college students. Senator Styles Bridges of New Hampshire brought us national exposure by endorsing our organization in a speech on the floor of the Senate. The following year, 1959, Franke and I founded Youth for Goldwater for Vice President, which was another major step toward building a conservative movement. Here is an account of what happened next from the book by Professor John A. Andrew III, The Other Side of the Sixties: Young Americans for Freedom and the Rise of Conservative Politics, (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1997), pp. 217-218: William F. Buckley and Marvin Liebman met Douglas Caddy and David Franke, both of whom attended as representatives of Youth for Goldwater for Vice President. Together, these four men would turn their disappointment in Goldwater’s loss [at the 1960 GOP convention in Chicago that nominated Nixon] into a national conservative youth movement. Impressed by the passion of Caddy and Franke and their attempts to organize conservative youth in the past, including the creation of the Student Committee for the Loyalty Oath in 1958, Buckley and Liebman decided to mentor them. The loss of Goldwater for the Vice Presidential nomination convinced Buckley that young conservatives in the GOP needed to be fostered from the top down. He believed that young conservatives, with his", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt:99:75f6f6cc5f4d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 173, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241142", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241144_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 100, "text": "Chicago that nominated Nixon] into a national conservative youth movement.

The loss of Goldwater for the Vice Presidential nomination convinced Buckley that young conservatives in the GOP needed to be fostered from the top down. He believed that young conservatives, with his guidance, could change the American political discourse. Consequently, Buck- ley hired Franke to intern at the National Review and Caddy worked for Liebman in public relations. Their first major task was to organize a national youth group for conservatives funded by Buckley. In September of 1960, on the Buckley family estate in Sharon, Connecticut, over 100 students from 44 different colleges and universities across the country assembled to devise a plan to capitalize on the growing conservatism of American youth and turn it into an organized political movement. The result created the Young Americans for Freedom, officially chartered on September 11, 1960, and the adoption of the Sharon Statement at the conference. In the Sharon statement, YAF articulated its critique of American society and proclaimed, ‘In this time of moral and political crisis, it is the responsibility of the youth of America to affirm certain eternal truths.’”4 So Black and Manafort and Stone, sad to say, are ethically challenged by-products of the modern conservative movement which decades ago was taken over by opportunists and sociopaths. Stone was active in successfully rigging three presidential elections: In Florida in 2000 for G. W. Bush, in Ohio in 2004 for G. W. Bush and in 2016 for Trump. He has utter contempt for honest elections. Rigging is what he does. Liberals rejoiced with Nixon being forced to resign the presidency but the immediate result was the rise of the radical right with Black, Manafort and Stone being formed as a lobbying/PR firm and the extreme right-wing oligarch Joseph Coors founding the Heritage Foundation, headed by Edwin Feulner, and the Committee for a Free Congress, headed by Paul Weyrich Thus, it came as a surprise three decades later when in 2012 I was contacted by Roger Stone who requested that I supply him with any material in my possession on President Lyndon Johnson. This came about because I had been the attorney for Billie Sol Estes, LBJ’s silent business and political partner, in Billie Sol’s quest in 1984 to obtain a grant of immunity from prosecution from the U.S. Department of Justice in order that he could tell what he knew about LBJ crimes that took place before and during his presidency. In email of May 5, 2016, Schlanger wrote me: “I have continued to work with Roger.

In email of May 5, 2016, Schlanger wrote me: “I have continued to work with Roger. He and I have done three radio interviews together, and I have set up several more for him, with my contacts. Obviously, he has played quite a brilliant role in the Trump campaign, outflanking completely the lead-footed GOP establishment. While I find some of what Trump says to be good, I’m still and not sure what a Trump presidency would mean.” In an email of July 25, 2016, to Schlanger, I wrote after the GOP presidential convention: “Well, you picked an exciting time in Germany to find a new home there. On the other hand, the U.S. as you can see from afar, is an exciting place, too, these days as both major parties are melting down. Neither candidate is worth a damn. “After watching Trump’s acceptance speech, I realized what a dangerous and hypocritical man he is. He plans to turn domestic and foreign policy over to his VP Pence and spend his time making ‘America Great Again,’ which means acting out his narcissism on steroids. I have lost all respect for Roger Stone and realize my belief that he had changed from his sociopathic past was misplaced. “Roger and his business partner Paul Manafort will undergo minute media and governmental scrutiny in the coming weeks for their past political and business dealings. Manafort is increasingly linked to being a back door to Putin for the Trump campaign. The whole scandal will get radioactive if the Intelligence agencies produce evidence of a tie there.” Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. 1. https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html 2. https://larouchepac.com/20160328/eir-participates-moscow-economic-forum 3. https://larouchepac.com/20161121/lyndon-larouche-radio-interview-roger-stone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBx6uHA05gg 4. https://www.slideshare.net/ClaireViall/rebels-with-a-causethe-growth-and-appeal-of-the-young americans-for-freedom-in-the-1960s 5. http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/nbc-news-exclusive-memo-shows-watergate-pros ecutors-had-evidence-nixon-n773581 6. http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/topic/21500-memoir-on-being-original-attorney-for-the watergate-seven-by-douglas-caddy/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jKBlJQNtek 7. https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Killed-Kennedy-Against/dp/1629144894/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UT- F8&qid=1503279918&sr=8-1&keywords=the+man+who+killed+kennedy 8. http://home.earthlink.net/~sixthfloor/estes.htm 9. http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/topic/24039-message-to-the-private-detectives-harassing-me/ his has been the story of my life.

In answer to a question from a listener Linda said that perhaps the most haunting thing that she ever experienced in her career as a reporter occurred in the mid-1980s when a source told her about his assignment as a military officer to work with a group associated with Majestic 12. Discussion arose between the military officer and one of the group’s members as to the question, “What is the real nature of our universe?” The group’s member told him that there are as many universes as there are grains of sand on Earth and that around all these universes is a cold dark sea. When the military officer asked for more information about the cold dark sea the group’s member replied that he could not tell the officer more because such knowledge would change his life forever. aeton Fonzi was a widely regarded investigator for the House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations. The Com-Gmittee was established in 1976 to investigate the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. It completed its investigation in 1978 and issued its final report in 1979, which it concluded that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. sernara Barker Teteran intelIigence agent.

On Jan.28 Senator John Kennedy reintroduced in Congress hi bill designed to remove the nonsubversive affidavit presently required of college students participating in the National Defense Education Aot.This year’s bill,S.2929,is a modified version of the Kennedy-Clark bil of the last session of Con– gress,which asked that both the oath of ailegiance and the nonsubversive affidavit be removed from the N.D.E.A One of the statements put forth by Senator Kennedy in support of his bill was that the present affidavitrequirementdiscriminates against a particular segment of the American society-that of college students.The Senator claims that college students participating in the N.D.E.A.have been singled out and their loyalty questioned by the affidavit requirement.

Other segments of our society todaywho have to sign the affidavit are students participating in the National Science Foundation Act, members of the staffs of all Congressmen (including the staffs of those advocating removal of the N.D.E.A.affidavit）,all employes of the Federal Government and even private citizeng who volunteer for Civil Defense work.Can it then truthfully be said that college students are being singled out by the N.D.E.A.affidavit？ It should be noted that while only nineteen colleges and universities have refused or withdrawn from participation in the N.D.E.A.because of the affidavit requirement, 1.370other institutions （88 per cent ot the total college student body) are participating without any sign ofprotest.

As time passed, PizzaGate morphed into #PedoGate representing a movement raising awareness about child sex abuse. The hashtag became a symbol of America’s pedophile crisis and was no longer focused on any single allegation. A popular uprising expressing outrage about impunity for child sex abuse was beginning to emerge. The essay, “State Dept Dan Rosen’s Arrest: Cheat Sheet for Journos,” that captured so much interest was originally posted in February 2015, three days after the State Department’s Director for Counter-terrorism was arrested for attempted sodomy with a child under 14-years-old; in reality an undercover police officer in Fairfax, Virginia. I had a list of government employees arrested on child pornography charges because of the research I had been doing for this book that no one wanted to publish. As I watched mainstream media report on Dan Rosen’s arrest, I became exasperated. Not one journalist conducted even the most basic search of government employees arrested on similar charges. I posted my essay expressing frustration with amateur reporting and called it a “Cheat Sheet for Journos.” Shane Harris, then with The Daily Beast and now with the Wall Street Journal, contacted me. He said he was shocked by my list. He had no idea. He planned to issue a four-part series profiling the hundreds of arrests I had gathered. Harris published “The Sickening Child Porn Crisis Infecting U.S. Government Agencies,” referencing my research but his intended series never materialized. I do not know why. Harris stayed in touch for a while and then went silent. My essay received about 12,000 shares and stagnated until, nearly two years later, when the PedoGate crowd discovered it and shared it widely. In mid-February 2017, I posted “Professors & Staff Arrested for Trading in Child Rape.” This essay received 8,000 shares overnight and escalated to 20,000 and then 30,000 shares a day. Within four weeks the essay had over 400,000 shares. People began asking me to include professors who were absent from my list. Clyde Fant, a former dean at Stetson University, was one request. When I contacted Stetson University to ask if this former dean still had emeritus status, despite his federal conviction for trading in pre-teen hard core (PTHC) – the brutal rape and torture of very small children, Stetson, unaware of Fant’s conviction, held an emergency meeting of their Board of Trustees. They immediately revoked Fant’s awards and emeritus status. Stetson also issued a press release stating unwavering opposition to crimes against children. If only all institutions took such an immediately powerful public stance. Fant’s arrest was not covered by the media and represents the importance of reporting on child pornography crimes.4 Had Fant’s arrest been reported, Stetson would have been able to act at the time of his arrest.

I have structured this book in a manner I hope will enable readers to understand the extent of extreme sexual violence being perpetrated against our children. Arrest samples are in text boxes throughout the book and within each chapter. Longer lists of arrests are on my Medium profile. The compiled arrests are not complete data sets but are rather sample raw data. The scope of the crime is so immense it is impossible for one person, with no institutional support, to build a complete data set of all child pornography arrests in America. The data collected so far is the best I can do with limited resources. I have focused, mostly, on government employees in our military, law enforcement, judiciary, prosecutorial offices and education system. There are many arrests in religious communities, among coaches, child protection staff, children’s charities, the mental health profession, the medical community and other professional categories. This book is just the beginning. More than anything else, it establishes the critical need for comprehensive, demographic data on child pornography arrests in America. The website www.Data4Justice.org describes the vision for this kind of database. I hope to secure employment and funding to build a public database allowing transparency and analysis of the child rape epidemic sweeping America. Perhaps this book will attract the attention of an employer and donor willing to make this possible. I hope people will read this book and take action; document the epidemic, create public policies and demand our government allocate resource to halt this crime that is destroying a generation of American children. 2 Lori Handrahan, “To Catch Government Workers with Ties to Child Porn, call the IRS,” Forbes Magazine, 19 September 19, 2012, accessed July 14, 2017, http://www.forbes.com/ sites/85broads/2012/09/19/to-catch-government-workers-with-ties-to-child-porn-call-theirs/ and Lori Handrahan, “Executive Branch Porn Problem,” The Washington Times, August 10, 2012, accessed July 14, 2017, http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/10/executive-branch-porn-problem. area.The child is depictedas being bound,with her hands behind her back,ankles are bound with handcuffs,there is a leash hanging down the front of her body and a gag in her mouth.Anadult woman is standing over this child.

There is a growing movement objecting to the term and a corresponding debate about what this crime should be called. Some argue child sex abuse is not adequate because sex describes legal, consenting adult behavior rather than the illegal rape of children. Child exploitation, others say, is a weak phrase that does not capture the reality of the crime. These arguments are accurate. What is being done to our children is not child pornography, exploitation or sex. It is rape and torture often meeting the Convention Against Torture (CAT) definition.1 Mr.Levin instructedD.C.Blackadarto“play”withthischild inorder to“prepare her for being fucked\".He also instructed D.C.Blackadar to spank this child for her own pleasure and digitally penetrate her.Mr.Levin askedD.C.Blackadar if she would hurt her child to “please him”. Benjamin Levin’s Statement of Facts describing his online activity Pedophiles also discuss, and are involved in, killing children with what seems to be alarming frequency. In 2000, for example, the Guardian reported on a British child-snuff network which included a video series titled Necros Pedo where children were raped and tortured until they died. Many of the children had been taken from Russian orphanages.4 In June 2017, Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commander Lesa Gale warned about child snuff films seen by the AFP in their investigations.5 More than a few of those arrested in America, including people holding government positions, have discussed killing children. People like the former Acting Director of Cyber Security at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Timothy DeFoggi, who “expressed an interest in the violent rape and murder of children” and planned these crimes with other pedophiles.6 Additionally, murdering and/or attempting to murder the child witness is not uncommon. As Rita Karakas, of Save the Children Canada, explains “sexual abusers kill children to eliminate witnesses.”7 Such as Michael Gardner, Democratic Party Chair in Falls Church, Virginia. Gardner attempted, from jail, to have the children he abused killed so he might avoid prosecution. He had used his own children as bait, as pedophiles often do, to sexually assault their The “trade in child rape and torture” is the phrase I am most comfortable with because that is what is occurring. Although I agree with Interpol’s position “terms such as ‘kiddy porn’ and ‘child porn’ are used by criminals and should not be legitimate language used by law enforcement, judiciary, the public or media,” I do use “child pornography” throughout this book because it is still a current legal description in the United States.9 Of course, this term needs to change. The crime should be legally called what it is and prosecuted as such.

The crime should be legally called what it is and prosecuted as such. Prosecutors should use the Convention Against Torture. Organizations devoted to ending torture, such as Amnesty International, should focus on aiding American children depicted in these crime scenes. There is also a debate about the word “pedophilia.” Some believe the term should be “pedosadism” because what is being done to children dism. While I agree with this logic, I use the term pedophile because it is commonly understood in America. I do not use any of the terms that seek to differentiate pedophiles, like hebephilia, because I find the views of some mental health professionals who use these various terms to be incorrect and, perhaps, based on false premises. This crime is not about sexual attraction. The “sexual attraction to pubescent youngsters” is not normal – as some mental health professionals argue.10 It is important to note, when considering the mental health research, that more than a few in the mental health sector have been arrested for trading in child rape. So many, indeed, it is a subject for an entirely separate book. Mental health experts making the argument that pedophilia is normal may be creating a legal cover to justify their own crimes. In naming the crime, it is important to consider three key flaws with the mental health argument about “attraction.” First, from my own extensive reading of hundreds of child pornography arrests, what pedophiles most often discuss is a desire to harm children – not an attraction to children. They trade files labeled “torture12. jpg.”11 They write “slut hurt me” across the bodies of small children before raping them. They want to see the children bound and gagged, hurt, bleed and sometimes murdered. If there is any “attraction” within this crime in America, judging by the arrest records, it is white men in leadership positions “attracted” to their own power to harm society’s most vulnerable; our children. The type of images in Garner's collection is also relevant under the Guidelines.Garner admits that the images he possessed included images of prepubescent minors and material portraying sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.(Plea 2） Included in the images possessed by Garner are the following five examples: ！IMAGE #1 “mar32089.jpg”is acolor image of one(1)white,naked,brown haired female,approximately are the words“slut hurt me.”The female's legs are spread apart exposing her vagina.On her right knee is what appears to be a sticker or fake tattoo ofa green frog.In the upper left hand corner of the image,there is a text", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:3:280f4ff88202", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 183, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "possessed included images of prepubescent minors and material portraying sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.(Plea 2） Included in the images possessed by Garner are the following five examples: ！IMAGE #1 “mar32089.jpg”is acolor image of one(1)white,naked,brown haired female,approximately are the words“slut hurt me.”The female's legs are spread apart exposing her vagina.On her right knee is what appears to be a sticker or fake tattoo ofa green frog.In the upper left hand corner of the image,there is a text in red letters reading:“nifty-star.com,home-made pictures.” 7-10 years old,lying on her back on top of a bed.The bed has a tan colored sheet.She is holding a black plastic sword with both hands above her chest.Written on her chest and stomach,in red, The Dean of Education at University of San Francisco - William Gardner’s Criminal Complaint describing what he was trading in. Second, it is documented that most offenders “do not automatically have a sexual preference for children.”12 Pedophiles rape and abuse children because it is easy to do. The more vulnerable the child the better. They do this because they care about obtaining gratification for themselves, regardless of the damage it does to anyone else. In fact, the pain they inflict on others is often what gives them gratification. Children are easier to control and abuse than adults, with a far greater chance of impunity for the crime. That is why pedophiles target children. They are an easy and safe mark. It is a strategic choice, not a sexual preference. Third, the extensive involvement of organized crime in the trade of child rape is well established. Organized crime’s sexual exploitation of children “is motivated by the vulnerability of the child rather than a specific sexual interest in children.”13 People who obtain pleasure watching, possessing, trading and producing the rape and torture of children are criminals. Pedophiles are situational offenders who rape children and trade in child rape because they can, “simply because it is available.”14 Because we, as a society, have allowed child pornography to be easily and profitably accessible. t is beyond the scope of this book to provide a detailed description of I the history of child pornography and legal statutes prohibiting the offense. It is also outside my remit to include a complete analysis of all the literature. Instead, I provide a brief overview of key literature for those interested in reading more extensively about this crime. The body of academic research on child pornography is not extensive, largely out-of-date and broadly divided into three categories: (1) legal analysis of prosecution and sentencing guidelines, (2) investigative techniques and (3) mental health/therapy for perpetrators, with a notably limited focus on victims. The best journalistic work has been done by Julian Sher in his book Caught in the Web: Inside the Police Hunt to Rescue Children from Online Predators.15 Research by government agencies appears to be the most detailed and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:4:9e9c66338d40", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 184, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "body of academic research on child pornography is not extensive, largely out-of-date and broadly divided into three categories: (1) legal analysis of prosecution and sentencing guidelines, (2) investigative techniques and (3) mental health/therapy for perpetrators, with a notably limited focus on victims. The best journalistic work has been done by Julian Sher in his book Caught in the Web: Inside the Police Hunt to Rescue Children from Online Predators.15 Research by government agencies appears to be the most detailed and current. The International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC) provides information on child pornography laws in 196 countries.16 In America until 1977, when The Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act was passed, there was no federal law against child pornography.17 Child pornography was legal in Europe in the 1970s with Denmark and the Netherlands producing magazines exported to America. Publications were also domestically produced and, apparently, freely available. Says Philip Jenkins, author of Beyond Tolerance: Child Pornography on the Internet, “it was easy to walk into a store in New York, Los Angeles, or London Robert Geist, police chief of Brecknock Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested in 2013. He was trading files including ∵6∀0 babyj – Bedtime rape.” Geist pled guilty on three counts and received five years probation and 100 hours of community service. Geist was the “number one possessor and distributor of child porn” in Pennsylvania. and purchase what was frankly advertised as child porn.”18 Pedophiles also openly organized groups such as North American Man-Boy Love (NAM-BLA) and the Pedophile Information Exchange (PIE). In 1996, the Child Pornography Prevention Act was passed in America, criminalizing sexual images of individuals under eighteen.19 While there is now a federal child pornography statue, at the state level definition and sentencing vary widely. Usually but not always when federal prosecutors take over a case, the state will drop charges. The state can and sometimes does pursue charges concurrently with the federal government. What a pedophile is sentenced to is extremely inconsistent at both the state and federal level, despite the federal statue. Sentencing depends on the judge in the district and the person being prosecuted.20 A police chief, like Robert Geist, Pennsylvania’s number one possessor and distributor of child pornography trading in files like “6Yo babyj – Bedtime rape ,” may not spend a day in jail, while people who do not enjoy government positions or personal wealth, like Patricia and Matthew Ayers, can be sentenced to 1,590 years and 750 years, respectively, in prison.21 It is important to note that the investigation and prosecution of child pornography in America occurs within the context of a broken, sexist and racist judicial system.

Women, people of color, and the poor are destroyed by America’s judicial system. Why? In my opinion, far too many white, racist, sexist men dominate our criminal justice system and more than a few have been caught engaged in trading in child rape and torture themselves. This is further discussed in Chapter Six on the legal profession. nternational government and law enforcement agencies are produc-I ing important reports. In June 2017, the national police in the Netherlands issued their Annual Trend Report, describing, for the first time, child pornography as a “threat to Dutch society.”23 Europol, the European police agency, is releasing perhaps the most detailed reports. Europol’s Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Online 2015, and Strategic Assessment of Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Online 2013, are excellent sources of knowledge on the crime. Australia’s 2016, Online Child Exploitation Material – Trends and Emerging Issues Research Report of the Australian National University Cybercrime Observatory with the Office of the Children’s eSafety Commissioner, is also a must-read. The National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings in the Netherlands also issued a comprehensive report in 2011, Child Pornography: First Report of the Dutch National Rapporteur.24 In April 2017, the European Parliament released Combating Sexual Abuse of Children Directive.25 In America, the most recent U.S. Sentencing Commission report is from 2012, Report to the Congress: Federal Child Pornography Offenses. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) published The National Strategy for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction in 2016, updating the first National Strategy for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction, from 2010. DOJ’s Child Exploitation and Obscenities Section (CEOS) has some material available in their resource section, the most recent from 2010, and the latest Congressional Testimony, with one exception, from This crime is expanding so fast that material more than a few years old is already out of date. It is not clear why the U.S. government lags behind in reporting on this crime compared with Europe and Australia.

In Canada, Michael Seto, a psychologist, has published Internet Sex Offenders, in 2013, and Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children: Theory, Assessment, and Intervention in 2007.31 Some of the mental health research employs a disturbing tone of empathy for pedophiles. Given that pedophiles exhibit sadistic pleasure in harming children and rarely demonstrate even the pretense of remorse for the crimes they commit, a mental health focus on empathy for pedophiles, and not the child victims, is misplaced. There is also a suggestion in some of the literature that pedophiles should be “cured” by therapy rather than sentenced to jail. Of course, it would benefit the mental health profession, enormously, if judges started issuing court-ordered therapy across the country instead of jail time. Many therapists would earn a lucrative living.

It is a horrific crime perpetrated, most often, by organized crime and men in positions of power against the most vulnerable in our societies – our children. The only acceptable legal and societal response to this crime is prison for the perpetrators followed by life-time supervised release and life-time sex offender registration. Mandatory chemical castration should also be considered. Yes, pedophiles should receive therapy – in jail. If mental health professionals had to visit pedophiles in prison to provide court-ordered therapy, I suspect the call for therapy as a policy solution to this crime would decrease substantially. There is a near total gap in the literature, both in governmental reports epidemic. Most of the research on child pornography begins with a disclaimer explaining that there is little research being conducted and, as a result, there is no definitive data on how many children are being destroyed, how many and who engages in the crime, what the arrest rates are, how much illegal money is generated, how profits are being laundered, how and where supply-lines to children are established, how many and which government employees have been arrested, etc. Despite the need for in-depth and complete data, the government is not stepping up and there is not one U.S.-based public policy organization or academic institution devoted to supporting a child pornography research center to gather the data. Because there is no comprehensive data on child pornography arrests in America, journalists do not have academic studies or government data to report on. Consequently, a lack of media attention to the epidemic means that most people in America have no idea a child pornography epidemic is even occurring. As a result, the criminals know far more about this crime, and how to avoid prosecution, than almost anyone else.

No one knows the numbers because no one is gathering the data. We are trading in these rapes, or how much money is being made through this crimewave. At the moment, we can only guess. The numbers in this section do not represent any complete set of comprehensive, analyzed data. Instead, they are small bits of partial knowledge; windows into the scope of the epidemic. A complete statistical analysis of estimated and partial data gathered by various organizations should be performed to obtain credible average quantitative data. I regret that I have not yet done so. This task is on my future research agenda, once I receive funding and support to continue this work. Behind every number there is a child. A real child. Someone’s son or daughter. Maybe yours. The production of child pornography depends on the sexual abuse of children – American children. When a journalist reports on an arrest with 10,000 child pornography images, these are real children being raped by someone they know, trust and love. Children are being abused by teachers, coaches, religious leaders, baby-sitters, grandfathers and fathers. Indeed, child exploitation rings led by fathers have become, what some are calling, a “widespread tragedy.”36 It is almost certain, given the numbers, someone in your social, professional or family circles is trading in child rape. It is highly probable you know a child being sexually abused. Unbeknown to you, your own child might even be in a video shared widely on the Internet. You may not know of your child’s abuse for decades – if ever. ca was hosting 40 percent of the world’s child-sex abuse images/ videos. In 2006, IWF reported 82 percent of all web domains hosting child pornography were in America. The European police, Europol, reported, in 2013, that nearly half of all servers hosting child pornography were located in the United States.37 Europol’s 2015 report details a dramatic increase in U.S.- based sites from 516 sites in 2013 to 2,617 sites in 2015; far greater than any other country. In 2014, the Australian Communications and Media Authority reported a 500 percent increase in child pornography sites with 64 percent on U.S.-based servers.

Fifty-three percent of children on these sites were tenyears-old or younger.41 In 2015, IWF removed 1,000 webpages every week with 69 percent of the children on these sites under ten-years-old and 1,788 of the children two-years-old or younger.42 In 2015, the FBI shut down one U.S. based website called Playpen that had 214,898 members trading in child rape and torture.43 Just one website out of thousands. Imagine. In 2017, Canada released a report detailing a six-week period when the Canadian Centre for Child Protection’s Project Arachnid processed over 230 million child pornography web pages with over 40,000 unique images of child sex abuse.44 A small sample of the staggering volume of child rape being traded on the Internet. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) reported from 2007 to 2013, a 5,000 percent increase in child sex abuse images/videos and an estimated 22 million images/videos available on the market. In 2014, NCMEC processed 24 million child sex abuse images/videos – a 48,000 percent increase since 2002. Of these, 75 percent were of children under twelve-years-old and ten percent were infants and toddlers. Microsoft, working with NCMEC, says 1.8 billion images of child sex abuse are shared online every day. Terre Des Hommes estimates there are 750,000 pedophiles online every second worldwide. The global industry may be yieldingyear.45 No one knows for sure. An e $20 $50 billion or more per million children are trafficked globally every year.46 One investigator calls the child pornography industry “very tempting” with lots of “sales to be made.”47 For example, in 2013, Germany estimated some 250,000 Germans spent $27 billion U.S. dollars on child pornography.

Children are a renewable resource. They can be sold multiple times a day over many years and are easy to transport. Their rape can be sold online and in-person. Their organs can be sold on the black market. As early as 2012, child sex trafficking was reported to be America’s fastest growing crime, expanding by some 150 percent each year.50 The Department of Justice reported, in 2012, pedophiles can earn $1, 000 per night raping children in front of a live web camera.51 In March 2015, the Ontario Provincial Police in Canada seized a data-hosting server with 2,200, out of a total 7,500, Internet provider (IP) addresses based in America. Germany had 843 users. There were 534 in Japan, 457 in Russia, 394 in Canada, 380 in the United Kingdom and 374 in France. In this one bust, Canadian investigators seized over 1.2 petabytes of data – more than four times the amount of data in the U.S. Library of Congress. This one server netted $18 million in revenue over a three-month period. urrently, there is no coordinated reporting and data collection among Cfederal or state law enforcement agencies on child pornography arrests. Therefore, to my knowledge, no one has calculated the total number of federal and state child pornography arrests per year. This lack of coordination and data collection underscores the need for a national child pornography arrest database housing complete arrest and prosecution records. The Department of Justice (DOJ) reported between 2011-2016, federal prosecutors filed 20,260 child pornography cases against 19,111 defendants.52 According to DOJ’s Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), from 2010-2014, there were 17,054 child pornography arrests and 12,334 corresponding prosecutions at the federal level.

Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) Chart Sent to author via email from BJS Other information from some federal agencies conducting child pornography arrests includes a random set of available data. This fragmented data, however, provides a scope of the epidemic. The FBI reported 2,900 child sexual exploitation arrests in 2014. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reported 35,000 child exploitation arrests from 2003- 2015. The U.S. Postal Inspectors claimed 500 arrests from 2010-2015.55 In 2014, USA Today reported “last year, more suspects were arrested for child exploitation crimes – 7,386 – than at any time in the past five years, according to Justice Department records gathered from sixty-one Internet Crimes Against Children (ICACs) task forces across the nation.”56 By 2015, the ICACs had made 8,500 child pornography arrests.57 The U.S. Marshals, from 2010-2015, arrested 2,671 people who had violated their court-ordered federal sex-offender registration obligations.58 One element of perpetrator data that is known is from the U.S. Sen-tencing Commission. Those convicted on child pornography charges in America have been, overwhelmingly, white men. The U.S. Sentencing Commission documents data from federal prosecutions in 1992, 2004, and 2010. For every year, more than eight-five percent of child pornography convicts were white men averaging forty-three-years-old.59 This perpetrator information will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter Four. The U.S. Sentencing Commission needs to update this data to determine if this trend is continuing. What percentage of thousands of arrests reported by DOJ and others include infant and toddler rape? How many of the perpetrators were in positions of power over vulnerable children, such as pediatric oncologists, special education teachers, child protection staff or law enforcement themselves? How many were parents molesting their own children? What is the social-economic and racial composition of the perpetrators? How many were government employees? We don’t know because these kinds of detailed demographics are not being tracked. We need to know the details of who is committing this crime and how, if we hope to stop the epidemic.

When it comes to child pornography arrests and prosecution demographics, no one has solid methodology. Reports, even by national law enforcement agencies, all begin with a disclaimer that researching the scope of the crime is nearly impossible because the data is not consistently documented, collected and collated at local or federal levels and not shared well across state or international borders. Researchers cobbled together methodology, attempting to create reasonably valid results. Even law enforcement working in cyber-crimes units, with access to data others lack, say the same thing; researching child pornography presents unique methodological problems. This “unique methodological problem” is entirely human-made. When government agencies fail, or refuse, to gather and publish the data a “unique methodological problem” does develop.60 The lack of perpetrator data is acutely concerning. How many teachers, lawyers, police officers, child protection staff, etc., have been arrested, at what institutions, receiving what kind of sentences and trading in what kind and volume of child rape? No one knows because the U.S. government has failed to gather this data. DOJ’s Office of Juvenile Justice (OJJ-DP) responded to my freedom of information act (FOIA) request about prosecution data, saying OJJDP does “not collect prosecution rates” related to the ICAC arrests.61 DOJ does not track the employment status of offenders prosecuted for federal offenses because, Bureau of Justice Statistics informed me, employment status is not a variable provided in the data received from federal law enforcement.62 While it is troubling that the Department of Justice is not collecting, analyzing and publishing detailed arrest and prosecution data on America’s fastest growing crime, to be fair to DOJ, there also seems to be little interest or demand from academics, journalists, public policy experts, Congress or the general public to document this epidemic. It is a subject almost everyone has avoided. Nonetheless, at the very least, the U.S. government should publish annual data on how many and which government employees have been prosecuted on child pornography charges. The people who know the most about this crime, other than pedo-philes, are dedicated law enforcement officers and prosecutors on the front-lines of this war being waged on our children. Behind every pedophile in jail is a team of investigators and lawyers who put their own mental health on the line to investigate and prosecute these crimes and bring justice to child victims.

America’s criminal justice system cannot keep up because the public and our policy leaders have not demanded necessary resources be allocated. We have not insisted on substantial funding because very few people even understand that there is a war being waged against our children. Police and prosecutors ask if I know what happened with a certain case, because cases get lost in the system. For example, Julian Sher detailed how Canadian police spent two years on a case only to discover the perpetrator had been caught by the FBI and was already in jail.63 No one can afford to investigate a case that has already been solved. Resources are too little, too late for redundant investigations. Investigators and prosecutors need easy access to individual cases and comprehensive statistics about the crime. There is raw federal child pornography arrest and prosecution information available for a fee on Public Access to Court Electronic Reports (PACER).64 This data has not yet been gathered and analyzed. Collecting the data and building a database using PACER data is possible. It would require reading, researching and entering information on over 20,000 federal arrests and prosecutions. This would be a time-consuming endeavor , but could be accomplished with a team of researchers employed to gather, enter and analyze the data. This book is, in many ways, a preface to that future research goal if funding becomes available. America’s fastest growing crime is one we know almost nothing about. The absence of collected and published data by the U.S. government is inexcusable. The U.S. government must publish comprehensive annual data on this crime. Private funds must be found to document the epidemic. How is it possible for child pornography to be categorized as the fastest-growing crime and there is little detailed data about this war against our children? A war we are we are already losing. 8.

There is no credible evidence that child rapists can be “cured” by therapy. There is a volume of reports about corruption within the mental health profession around this subject. Most recently, [as reported by David Rose, “The scandal of the sex crime ‘cure’ hubs: How minister buried report into £100million prison programme to treat paedophiles and rapists that INCREASED reoffending rates,” The Mail on Sunday, June 24, 2017, accessed July 17, 2017, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/ news/article-4635876/Scandal-100million-sex-crime-cure-hubs.html] a British report that UK’s former Justice Secretary, Liz Truss, kept hidden a report that documented “rehabilitation courses taken by thousands of jailed rapists and paedophiles make them more dangerous once they are released. According to the study, prisoners who take the courses are at least 25 per cent more likely to be convicted of further sex crimes than those who do not, suggesting that the sessions may have created hundreds of extra victims. The controversial Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP), a six-month psychological group-therapy course, is believed to have cost taxpayers well over £100 million since it was set up in 1991.” 37.

Europol reports “Analysts engaged in the assessment of global criminal phenomena such as online child sexual exploitation (CSE) invariably face methodological challenges regarding data collection. In the first instance, data on online sexual offences against children is not always collected at national level: this is particularly the case where countries lack national police intelligence and recorded crime databases. Secondly, without exception data is recorded and collected at national level according to the relevant articles of national penal codes. By this token, even where national legislations are approximate, variations in the precise previsions will mean that data collected according to these specifications will never be truly comparable to those of other countries.” Europol, “Strategic Assessment of the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Online,” October 15, 2013, accessed July 16, 2017 https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/new-cybercrime-report-examines-disturbing-trends-commercial-online-child-sex-abuse, 7. n July 2016, The Canadian Press reported on a government memo describing the illegal trade in child rape as having reached “a level of epidemic proportions.” In addition to being an American problem, trading in child rape is also a global crisis.2 Images, videos and live-streams of children in America are transferred internationally. Children abused elsewhere are shared across the United States. Pedophile networks do not remain within national boundaries. They are highly organized with vast transfers on file-sharing software world-wide. According to Chad Steel, a forensic investigator at George Mason University, “it is not atypical to have a single case that involves terabytes of data and over one million images and movies.”3 One terabyte fits into about 1,428 CD-ROMs holding some 3.6 million images, or 300 video hours. Global TrendsThe European Union (EU) police, Europol, issued one of the most staggering reports; Strategic Assessment of the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Online. This report, first released in 2013 and updated in 2015, documents the “disturbing trends” of what Europeans call child-abuse material (CAM) or child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) known in America as child pornography.4 Three developments, explained by Europol, are important to consider. Understanding these global trends is vital for those wishing to protect children in America. First, the proliferation of online advice forums “has made even lower level offenders better informed on how to protect themselves.”5 Pedophiles protect each other. They provide advice on how to groom, access and drug children. They educate on how to avoid arrest and prosecution. Pedophiles have become so brazen they no longer only help each other in private dark web forums.

They provide advice on how to groom, access and drug children. They educate on how to avoid arrest and prosecution. Pedophiles have become so brazen they no longer only help each other in private dark web forums. In Arizona a radio station, Cave 97.7, was finally forced in May 2017 to stop playing a public service announcement (PSA) instructing pedophiles how to avoid “being caught.” The radio station had been airing the PSA for two years.6 The second trend Europol describes is, “a higher proportion of new, home-made material has been observed.”7 More pedophiles are producing and distributing their own so-called “home-made” child pornography, i.e., the rape and abuse of children they have access to, often their own children or grandchildren. While pedophiles sometimes travel to places like Thailand, the Philippines or Cambodia to access to children, most often pedophiles look for children in their own homes, communities, workplaces, or schools.8 In January 2017, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection released a study documenting that more than half of child survivors were abused, starting between birth and four-years-old, by a parent. Over half also reported being shared with other pedophiles.9 Most child pornography is produced in North America and Europe.10 Children in North America and Europe appear to be targeted by their parents, most often their fathers, and are frequently “shared.” The third trend is that as self-produced child rape videos/images proliferate, there is a parallel surge in computer security used by pedophiles which frustrates law enforcement and prosecution efforts.11 As American journalist Lex Talamo explains, “The Internet has forced law enforcement to evolve methods of tracking and catching online predators. But they’re often outgunned.”12 One example is the arrest of Jonathan Walsh, a 47-year-old pediatrician in the United Kingdom who used “military-grade” software to protect his trade in child rape.13 Another example is a pedophile in Louisiana who had “wired his computer to wipe the hard drive if a pass code wasn’t entered within the first few seconds of opening the device.”14 edophiles joining online networks must first prove they are pedo-Pphiles. To do this, they are required to offer images/videos of child rape to other group members. This serves as both an entry fee and verification code. Anyone viewing child rape, therefore, is also by nature of these gate-keeping strategies distributing child pornography. To have child pornography to share, a child must be sexually abused. The production of child pornography requires contact with children. Unless the pedophile is a parent, or has a relative or friend willing to share his/her children, pedophiles do not always have effortless access to children. In addition, children grow older quickly. These problem factors in accessing children result in pedophiles cultivating personalities that appear to be extremely child-friendly.

These problem factors in accessing children result in pedophiles cultivating personalities that appear to be extremely child-friendly. Pedophiles must be likable to spouses, parents, neighbors, teachers and children. A pedophile is not someone you look at and fear for your children’s safety. A pedophile is someone you willingly leave your child with because this is a person you trust. An investigation called Project Spade, a 2013 Canadian and US Postal Inspection joint operation, provides helpful examples of average pedophile profiles. Toronto’s Sex Crimes Unit said “Of concern to the investigators was the number of people who have close contact with children. The arrests included 40 school teachers, nine doctors and nurses, 32 people who volunteered with children, six law enforcement personnel, nine pastors or priests, and three foster parents.”15 All in just one investigation. Pedophiles are close to home, familiar and in positions of power over children. Men, and it is overwhelmingly men, who trade in child rape “are for the most part educated, intelligent individualswho are well integrated into society and successful in other areas of their lives.”16 A pedophile is the priest who takes an interest in your children, the swimming coach willing to spend extra time with your son, the math teacher who stays after school to tutor your daughter, the piano teacher you leave your child with as you run errands, the relative who is always there when you need an extra hand, the decorated military veteran who volunteers with the Little League Your friendly local pedophile, raping children here in America, is sharing these images across the globe.18 It is entirely possible, for example, your child may be abused and these images shared without your knowledge. For example, let’s say a coach has been abusing your six-year-old daughter and sharing images online. These photos are given to a pedophile in Australia who gets caught. He has, as most pedophiles do, an enormous collection of images/videos of child rape. Your daughter is only one of thousands. Most of images/videos seized in child pornography arrests are never investigated. Instead, a “dip analysis” is performed where a handful of videos/images needed for prosecution are selected and the rest are sent to a central database. The Australian National Victim Image Library, for example, has six million images.19 Law enforcement does not have the financial resources or the staff to go through every image and video in every arrest and locate all the children.20 This means images, in the hypothetical case of your child in an Australian pedophile’s collection,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:19:b579dc9623ee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 199, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "never investigated.

The local pedophile in your neighborhood continues abusing children even if images of children he abuses have been captured by law enforcement half-way around the world. As the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre explains, the “sheer number of images and limited resources makes “We’ve seen cases lately where we can’t even catalogue them all,” said Lt. Chad Gremillion, who works for the Special Victims Unit of the Louisiana State Police. “We’re talking about terabytes, literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of images. Videos that are an hour in length of a child being sexually assaulted, raped, forced into oral sex and bondage scenarios.” Law enforcement is, increasingly, cooperating on international child pornography investigations, but these investigations are time-consuming, expensive and difficult. Sometimes, some of the children do get rescued. Those children are the rare and lucky ones. Most often, hundreds of thousands of images/videos are simply confiscated and dumped into various un-linked databases around the world where they remain unexamined. As Europol explains “internationally comparable crime data remains an aspiration.”22 Pedophiles know this. They know they are far ahead of the law. By and large, pedophiles have no fear they will be caught because so few are found out. They also know that if they are arrested prosecution is often light and jail can be avoided altogether.23 As discussed in Chapter Six, in America prosecution depends on wealth and race. Judges are routinely bought.24 Pedophile judges, as detailed in Chapter Six, do sit on the bench.25 Pedophiles network. They know each other. They protect each other. On many levels. Locally and globally. When law enforcement is at their best, they also network globally and rescuing children. Europol, on the cutting-edge of innovative police work, launched, in June 2017, an initiative program called Trace an Object.26 Background images of places and objects are posted on Europol’s website. Investigators ask the public to help identify these objects and locations which may be key clues in rescuing children and arresting pedophiles.27 When police ask for the public’s help, they inspire confidence and harness a unique resource: citizens willing to devote time and energy to ending child sex-abuse and impunity for the crime. American law enforcement should comprehensively implement Europol’s, Trace an Object, model.

In 2012, Danish Police discovered images of a woman sexually abusing two children; 4 and 6-years-old. Danish police believed the images were being produced in America and contacted Homeland Security. Homeland Security asked, on social media, for public help locating the woman abusing the children. “Literally hours after we asked the public for their assistance in identifying Jane Doe, a tip came in that led to her identification and arrest,” Homeland Security reported.29 This is how all child pornography investigations William Gazafi, an Air Force officer, was indicted on six counts of sexually exploiting a minor to produce child pornography. He had been in incest chat rooms and bragged he drugged and raped young children including infants. Upon his arrest, he had videos/images he produced including the rape of a five-monthold baby as well as other drugged children, bound and handcuffed and raped. That’s the bad news. The good news is that from America to Australia there is, increasingly, greater awareness of the crime and its cover-up. Private citizens, activists, politicians and law enforcement who care about children’s rights and the rule of law are using social media to raise awareness, share information and demand accountability. There is a growing sense of outrage at what many are calling a global epidemic of child rape distributed online. People in America and around the world are refusing to be silent and are raising their voices for children and against pedophiles. In Australia, prompted by Detective Peter Fox - who refused to continue be part of the cover-up, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse by child services, children’s non-profits, politicians and the church was established.30 Since 2013, this Commission has held 6,000 private sessions with people who shared information about child sex abuse. Some of these accounts are available in audio files on the Royal Commission’s website. As of May 2017, 1,500 more individuals are scheduled to meet with investigators. Australia’s Royal Commission is a best-practice model. The US government should follow Australia’s example and create a national investigative committee examining and exposing institutional responses and cover-ups of child sex abuse in the United States.

Australia’s Royal Commission is a best-practice model. The US government should follow Australia’s example and create a national investigative committee examining and exposing institutional responses and cover-ups of child sex abuse in the United States. In the United Kingdom (UK), a Member of Parliament (MP) Tom Watson dropped a bombshell, in 2012, during Parliamentary question time asking about an elite political pedophile ring, later described in Australia’s 60 Minutes-style news show Spies, Lords and Predators. 31 Child sex abuse in the UK includes children in a care-home called Kincora, located in Belfast, Northern Ireland, raped by elite government employees as well as survivors like Esther Baker raped while police officers watched and protected the abusers rather than her – the child.32 Tom Watson’s demands, along with many other activists and survivors, resulted in the creation of the Independent Child Sex Abuse Inquiry.33 Unfortunately, the Inquiry has been roadblocked and undermined at nearly every turn. Survivors have expressed frustration with how the government has handled the Inquiry as well as the failure to prosecute these crimes.34 Unlike Australia, the British effort to expose child sex abuse and government elite involved in this crime is a worst-practice example. In America, we have yet to create a national investigative inquiry, which is desperately needed; however, many individuals are organizing, raising awareness and demanding accountability. People like Jerome Elam, CEO of the Trafficking in America Taskforce, Marci Hamilton, a legal scholar working to end the statute of limitations (SOL) for child sex abuse and James Marsh of Marsh Law Firm, a lawyer leading the fight for compensation for children depicted in child pornography. Long ago, Judith Reisman exposed Alfred Kinsey’s crimes against children and currently documents how Kinsey’s rape of infants and toddlers is being cited in law journals and court judgment, to this day, validating child rape. Mary Mazzio’s documentary, I Am Jane Doe, tells the story of brave mothers and child survivors who have been trying to shut down Backpage. Nikki DuBose, survivor and author, is active in leading the fight for children, as is Shaun Dougherty, a farm-to-table restaurateur and adult survivor.35 John DeCamp and Nick Bryant exposed a child sex ring in Nebraska often called the Franklin Scandal.36 Conchita Sarnoff, the journalist whose reporting made Jeffrey Epstein a well-known pedophile, refused a five million dollar bribe to stop publication of her book Trafficking. 37 Comedian Barry Crimmins testified before Congress, July 24, 1995, about pedophiles organizing online in an era when most police stations did not even have computers.38 The documentary film, Call Me Lucky, details his life and fight to stop pedophiles.39 If only we all had listened to Barry Crimmins, and acted, we might have prevented the epidemic now", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:22:2649d6abbbed", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 202, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "journalist whose reporting made Jeffrey Epstein a well-known pedophile, refused a five million dollar bribe to stop publication of her book Trafficking. 37 Comedian Barry Crimmins testified before Congress, July 24, 1995, about pedophiles organizing online in an era when most police stations did not even have computers.38 The documentary film, Call Me Lucky, details his life and fight to stop pedophiles.39 If only we all had listened to Barry Crimmins, and acted, we might have prevented the epidemic now destroying so many children in America.40 In terms of good cops, like Detective Peter Fox in Australia, at the top of the list in America is Sheriff Grady Judd of Polk County, Florida; a living legend for his dedication to putting child rapists behind bars. Sheriff Judd leads one of the 61 Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Taskforces, located across America.41 Under his leadership Polk County’s ICAC has made hundreds more arrests than any other ICAC. For example, while Hawaii made 86 arrests from 2009-2014, Polk County completed 2,448 arrests.42 If only Sheriff Judd and his team oversaw all of America’s ICACs. There are many more people in America, too many to list here, dedicating their lives to ending child sex abuse and impunity for the crime. However, no matter how many citizens join this battle, without government representatives willing to make this a top priority, individuals will struggle to achieve policy changes needed to halt the epidemic. Government agencies must allocate budgets, priority directives and staff to tackle the explosion of child pornography. The problem is that when pedophiles occupy government positions they will roadblock efforts to end impunity and protect children. People fighting this crime can attest how frequently a politician, judge, prosecutor, cop or child-protection employee halted efforts of those seeking to protect children and hold abusers responsible. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes – who will guard the guards themselves? This is explored in Chapter Five, Six and Seven. In addition to citizen activism, the break-up of pedophile rings by law enforcement and prosecutors is occurring, with growing frequency, around the world. In Canada, Australia, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, Wales, Jersey Islands, UK, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands there have been major police actions and prosecutions.43 While it is beyond my scope to detail these operations, it is important to note that elite pedophiles rings, the world over, appear to be structured in similar manners. Judges, prosecutors, police, clergy, journalists and politicians are often involved and the most vulnerable children targeted. Frequently, the children are in government care, such as Kincora in Northern Ireland, Casa Pia in Portugal, orphanages in Russia, or foster children in America.44 Staff in child protection agencies, globally, appear to be key players in securing supply-lines of children for pedophile rings.45 While this book is about child pornography in America, the crime rape is shared around the world.

By its very nature, child pornography is almost always an international crime. Citizen activists, researchers, law enforcement and prosecutors dedicated to ending this crime must learn to think and act like pedophiles in terms of strategy. Pedophiles protect each other. They provide advice on how to obtain and abuse children. They educate each other on how to avoid arrest and prosecution. Those fighting this crime, must do the same. We must protect each other and provide advice on how to protect our children. We must educate each other on how to end this epidemic. We must organize internationally. If we hope to halt this epidemic, we must beat pedophiles at their own game. To do that, we must think, act and network locally and globally against this crime that is destroying so many children. 1.

By 2016, DOJ acknowledged it is “routine for child pornography investigations to include files depicting the sexual exploitation of infants and toddlers.”1 This includes newborns – “children as young as days old.”2 One pedophile father, for example, posted to a child pornography trading site a sonogram of an unborn child and a text message “I have a new baby about to be added to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:27:ee4b252ee693", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 207, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "Department of Justice (DOJ) warned America that infants and toddlers were being raped in increasing numbers.

Any pedophile can get his/her hands on a teenager. Accessing an infant or toddler to rape is more difficult. Infants cannot walk out of the house. They are not available after school or at swim practice. Toddler and infants are not independent of their caregivers. To traffic an infant or toddler the caregiver must be involved. Caregivers involved in infant and toddler rape often appear to be fathers. As mentioned in Chapter One, child exploitation rings led by fathers have In 2014, USA Today reported on the rise of “homemade” child pornography, also cited in Europol’s reports.5 Kevin Johnson, the USA Today reporter, described “unwitting children appear holding homemade placards bearing the pseudonyms of the macabre films’ makers … children, some pleading for help, being sexually abused in torturous ways by parents, relatives or others. Among the worst: infants used as toys for the videographers’ and viewers’ sexual gratification.”6 While there is an increased awareness of teenage sex trafficking, there is almost no public discussion of the surging market in infant and toddler rape. Most Americans likely have no idea how extensive infant and toddler trafficking has become. Infants and toddlers are targeted by pedophiles for an important strategic reason; children under fouryears-old cannot be witnesses in court. No witness – no crime. Pedophiles like to rape pre-verbal children because these children cannot explain what happened to them, let alone defend their rights in a court of law. Therefore, they make ide- r al targets. As Canadian journalist Julian Sher describes, as early as 2006, there was a notable increase in pedophiles “deliberately going after pre-verbal infants because they are the perfect targets-vic-tims who literally can’t speak up.” On one a pedophile chat, a father who was raping his four-year-old daughter switched to raping his 18-month-old daughter, saying “I’ve got to start early, even though she’s young … before my daughter starts talking.” Moshe Gerstein, a 35-year-old lawyer, died in Mexico - cause of death reported as “not clear.” He had fled, while on bail. Gerstein had over 5,000 images of babies and toddlers being “brutally raped and sexually abused.” He was arrested as part of an investigation of a Manhattan pedophile ring that included “stockpiled images of the brutal rapes and sexual assaults of tens of thousands of real children.” Gerstein ttended Yale", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:28:5f2ed4857ddf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 208, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 29, "text": "though she’s young … before my daughter starts talking.” Moshe Gerstein, a 35-year-old lawyer, died in Mexico - cause of death reported as “not clear.” He had fled, while on bail.

Australian Federal Police cited, in June 2017, a trend of “images of children, some just toddlers, being tortured” as pedophiles compete to produce the “next level of violence” in pedophile networks.8 Images of children being raped have taken on their own value and become a “currency.” Europol reports the value is in the “novelty of the image.” Images and videos have become “bargaining chips.” From an investigative perspective, “new material means ongoing abuse and unidentified victims.”9 Pedophiles produce and trade in the latest abuse of children. New abuse. New children. As young as possible. They will pay top dollar for “privileged access to previously unseen material.”10 The “hallmarks” of child pornography are the “extremely young nature of the victims and growing masses of material” that pedophiles produce, collect and distribute.11 Newborns, infants and toddlers. How many infants and toddlers are raped in America to produce child pornography? How are pedophiles gaining regular and easy access to infants and toddlers to rape? How many of these children have been placed in the custody of their father in family court proceedings? How many were raped in day cares or by baby-sitters, unbeknownst to their parents? Of the thousands of U.S. federal prosecution records available on PACER, how many include infant/toddler rape? We do not know the answer to these questions because, as discussed, the data has not been gathered. It is evident, however, from arrest records, that infants and toddlers are being trafficked at alarming levels. While there is no research focused exclusively on the scope, frequency and supply-sources of infant/toddler rape, references can be found in some reports. For example, as early as 2009, the UN reported more than 80 percent of child pornography featured children under twelve-years-old with 20 percent “babies and children aged under 3-years-old”12 Since 2009, the crime has exploded with younger children and more brutal abuse. The European Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) reported that from 2010 to 2012, arrests showed a 70 percent increase of “female victims aged under ten.”13 How much was of infants and toddlers? We do not know. abuse; objects thrust into the cavities of young children; anal, vagina, and mouth.14 While pedophiles previously slowly groomed children, “the restrained influencing of a child over several months", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:29:c9688fe003c1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 209, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "3-years-old”12 Since 2009, the crime has exploded with younger children and more brutal abuse.

We do not know. abuse; objects thrust into the cavities of young children; anal, vagina, and mouth.14 While pedophiles previously slowly groomed children, “the restrained influencing of a child over several months has been largely replaced by rapid escalation to threats, intimidation and coercion.”15 DOJ’s former director of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS), Andrew Oosterbaan said, “What I’ve seen is an evolution in the intensity and volume of their conduct…. There is a greater demand for extreme material.… For some, Matthew Gigot, a 29-year-old Washington DC lawyer, was arrested, June 2015, on child pornography charges. Gigot texted an undercover cop a description of children he wanted to rape, “[h]ow young would you go…I’d do 5[,] [b]ut 0-12 is hot.” Zero indicating the rape of a newborn. The cop was posing as a father sharing his 12-yearold son for rape. Gigot’s user name was “pervyboy20.” He is a registered sex offender. Type “infant pornography” as key words into a Twitter search and it is clear how frequently this crime is being shared even on public social media. Be extremely careful not click on any of the links or you will be committing a crime. If you see child rape advertised, please report the account to your local Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Taskforce.17 Infant and toddler rape is also being shared on Facebook and other social media platforms such as SnapChat and Instagram. In March 2013, the rape of an infant girl was shared on Facebook over 32,000 times, with 5,000 likes in the eight hours before Facebook removed the video. This example alone demonstrates how popular infant rape has become and how freely pedophiles are trading on public social media.18 t was a bizarre few days in the American news cycle during the autumn I of 2014. John Grisham, crime-fiction writer, suddenly came out in defense of America’s illegal child rape industry.19 In an interview with The Telegraph Grisham claimed (and later retracted) that America’s prisons are “filled with guys my age. 60-year-old white men … who’ve never harmed anybody, would never touch a child.… But they got online one night, started surfing around, probably had too much to drink or whatever and pushed the wrong buttons and went too far and got into child porn or whatever.” American prisons filled with old innocent, white men, wrongly jailed in our broken criminal justice system? “Your honor I was drunk”; which Grisham seemed to argue should be a legal defense when committing a crime? What was Grisham thinking?

What was Grisham thinking? Disturbingly, Grisham is not alone in his views on who is the victim in America’s child rape trade. Days before the Grisham interview, Hollywood actor Stephen Collins also dominated headlines. Allegedly, Collins told his then pregnant wife he hoped their child would not be a boy because he feared he would not be able to “resist having oral sex with the child.”20 Oral sex with an infant? Yes. Disturbing and, as mentioned, apparently all too common. Just before the Collins story broke the New York Times published an op-ed “Pedophilia: A Disorder Not a Crime,” by Margo Kaplan, a law professor at Rutgers, who argued child rapists are not criminals but rather vulnerable, disabled people who should receive “civil rights” protection under The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.21 An infant and toddler ring was busted through identification of a stuffed bunny seen in the images. The oldest child was four-yearsold. The youngest child was nineteen days old. Images included a “naked 2-year-old boy in a roasting pan inside his oven,” a twoyear-old child bound and raped in a hotel room, and an eighteenmonth-old boy molested by his day-care provider. Perpetrators included a father of three who was a Sheraton hotel manager in Massachusetts, an emergency medical technician in Kansas, and a day-care worker in the Netherlands. Forty-three men were arrested involving over 140 children. Disability payments for someone who has performed oral sex on an infant? Impunity for someone who has live-streamed child rape? Three jaw-dropping stories. All in a row. All reported as one-off headlines. No dots connected. Connect the dots and the developing narrative is unnerving. Kaplan’s op-ed appears to be part of a well-organized strategy to create laws and norms that frame pedophiles, and not our children, as the victims. Grisham’s comments seem perfectly timed to support Kaplan’s argument; the poor pedophiles, they are the innocent victims in all this – not the children. In 2012, pedophiles in Greece were given legal disability status.22 Yes, it is true. The National Confederation of Disabled People says “pedophiles are now awarded a higher government disability pay than some people who have received organ transplants.”23 Headlines at the time read “Furor in Greece over Pedophilia as a Disability.” Unlike the outrage in Greece, there has been no furor, and almost no reporting, in America as a pro pedophile media strategy has quietly rolled out across the country. Kaplan’s op-ed is not a one-off.

Kaplan’s op-ed is not a one-off. Pedophile puff pieces have been popping up in state and local newspapers across the country with disturbing regularity.24 While the pro-pedophile articles are often prominently featured, the arrest reports of prestigious men arrested for trading in child rape, often of infants and toddlers, seem to be buried deep in the metro pages, if they hit the papers at all. • Decorated Navy Veteran, Michael Jachim, was sentenced in January 2012 to four years in prison. He had 44,000 images/videos of children being raped. Prosecutors said, “This isn’t Playboy magazine. These are infants and toddlers being brutally raped” including three- and four-year-old children “in bondage positions with their hands and feet tied” with hoods or masks covering their heads and children “screaming for their mommy as they were being sexually abused.”26 • Police Sergeant Jonathan N. Gamson of Tampa, Florida, was sentenced May 2013 to nearly five years in jail for trading in child rape. He had images of at least one “baby” and “a little girl bound and blindfolded while being sexually assaulted.” Investigators described “sadistic” and “horrific” abuse including a girl “hung by her wrists from the ceiling.”30 he American public needs to know who is trafficking in infants and toddlers and how. Since the trafficking of infants and toddlers requires the caregiver’s involvement, parents, relatives who provide care and day-care are sources of infant and toddler trafficking. As the research has established, the overwhelming majority of those involved in child rape are men and many appear to be fathers. If the mother is not involved (and some mothers are) this means infants and toddlers would be trafficked by fathers who have secured access to their children. Family courts across the country are routinely giving fathers, who are confirmed abusers and even registered sex offenders, custody of young children.31 Is this a factor in infant and toddler rape seen by investigators in online networks? For example, we have the case of Jon Riveire, former Assistant Director for Student Conduct in the Office of Student Ethics at Indiana University. Riveire was arrested, May 2015, and charged with six felony child pornography counts. He was trading in child rape, including toddlers, on university computers. He pled guilty to one count, November 2016, in exchange for having the other charges dropped and was sentenced, February 2017, to 2.5 years house-arrest with no jail time. He must register as a sex offender. Although Riveire is prohibited from contact with children under 16,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:32:06f97afef2fc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 212, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 33, "text": "Conduct in the Office of Student Ethics at Indiana University.

He must register as a sex offender. Although Riveire is prohibited from contact with children under 16, the judge made an exception for Riverie’s own children, one of whom is two-years-old, allowing Riveire to retain unsupervised access to his toddler-age children.32 This kind of judgment, routinely seen in family courts, makes no sense. Why would a judge provide unsupervised access to a two-year old child for a criminal convicted of child sex offenses? Is the judge a pedophile like the defendant? Has this been organized? in January 2014, investigators found 10,000 images/videos including infants as young as one-year-old.35 Bailey and Elizabeth Mills were sentenced, May 2015, respectively to 25 and 16 years in prison. Bailey Mills was a registered sex offender prior to his latest arrest. In March 1997, he pled guilty to raping a 4-year-old girl and was sentenced to probation and psychological treatment. If DOJ has confirmed, as of 2016, that the sexual exploitation of infants and toddlers is now “routine,” why hasn’t there been an organized investigative response to protecting these children and halting this crime? Children across the country are being placed in the custody of known abusers and registered sex offenders in family courts. There must be a comprehensive and specialized investigation by federal law enforcement to identify and halt family courts that have become secure supply-lines for child sex trafficking. Day-care children are at real risk of being abused by their caregivers, often without their parents’ knowledge. Much greater attention must be given to day-cares, including routine law enforcement investigations. Infant and toddler trafficking urgently demands in-depth investigation by journalists, academic researchers, policy institutions and specialized law enforcement units. nfants and toddlers, babies, are being raped across America in what ap-I pears to be large numbers. “Each day (we) receive imagery depicting infants being sexually abused,” says Australian Federal Police Child Exploitation Assessment Centre Commander Lesa Gale.36 The U.S. Department of Justice says infant and toddler rape is now “routine.” American laws are not failing pedophiles, as Kaplan argues. American courts are not failing to protect white men who drunkenly download child rape, as John Grisham claimed. America, as a country, is failing to protect our youngest children. Journalists are failing to report on the wider news the Collins and Grisham stories represent. America’s broken justice system is failing our children. Accurate data must be immediately gathered to understand how prevalent the rape of infants/toddlers is, who is conducting the rape and how pedophiles are accessing the children.

Accurate data must be immediately gathered to understand how prevalent the rape of infants/toddlers is, who is conducting the rape and how pedophiles are accessing the children. For example, if the data documents that fathers given custody of infants and toddlers are abusing these children, that information should have a significant impact on family court decisions. If the data informs that infants and toddlers are accessed in day-cares, this knowledge should be used to advocate for increased regulation and oversight. Until DOJ gathers and reports on the demographics of child pornography arrests, or funding is available to build a public child pornography arrest database, effective public policies urgently needed to protect our most vulnerable children will remain absent. Should an adult who ties a small child to the ceiling and rapes her receive disability pay? Should the man who trades in and masturbates to this rape avoid jail? Grisham’s comment, the Collins scandal and Kaplan’s New York Times article, along with confirmation that infant and toddler rape is now “routine,” should be America’s wake-up call. 8.

If most children are raped by their parents, usually their fathers and/or male relatives, as studies indicate, and most people caught trading in child rape are white men, this correlation makes common sense.7 If white American men are producing and trading, more than anyone else, in child pornography, the white children they have access to, their own children, grandchildren and those of relatives and friends, would comprise the bulk of the child pornography material. Yet, despite the data on the racial elements of the crime, no policy work has been crafted to address and protect children in this segment of the population. When I bring the distinctive racial component to people’s attention, I am often met with hostile resistance and called a “race-baiter” or a liar. America’s mainstream media has refused to report on racial aspects of the crime. Why? I believe our apparent collective refusal to discuss and respond to a key racial element of known child pornography data is because, in America, we have criminalized the black man and elevated the white man.

Since before we even became the United States of America the alienation of black men and adulation of white men was a core component of American patriarchal structures. One that is not easily challenged or changed. Sometimes, very infrequently, someone does ask me about the startling racial aspect of these statistics and wonders why so many white American men are involved in trading in child rape. The short answer is – I do not know. The longer response is perhaps I do know and would prefer not to think about it. The following is written in a personal essay style in an effort to reflect upon the racial element of the crime. This is an introspective response based on my experiences and thoughts and is not, necessarily, the answer to why so many white men, above all other races in America, appear to be trading in child rape. During my first year at college, I fell in love. He was a football player. I was on the field hockey team. We met during fall break in upstate necticut. I had escaped a poor, rural public high school in Maine. Our first date was a run by the lake. The white football players told him white girls were for white men. They warned him to stay away. The black women were angry with me for “taking a good black man” and gave me hard stares when I attended a Black History Month event. I was completely baffled. I was white. He was black. Who cares? Weren’t we beyond this? And why was everyone so angry? Naively, in the way only a white person can be, I thought racism was over in America. Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King had marched on Washington and ended racism in America, right? That was 1987. Over Christmas that year, I visited his family in Connecticut. I remember, so clearly, a cold New England afternoon cozy in their living room. His father turned on haunting music on the stereo. The lyrics talked about strange fruit in Southern trees. I asked what the strange fruit was. I remember a long silence. Then my boyfriend’s father gently explained who Billie Holiday was and that she was singing about the lynching of black men and boys. He told me that when the lynched men and children were still alive, white men cut off the penis and testicles and hung these from the branches of the tree. That was the strange fruit. When you do this sort of work there is certain pictures you just can’t get out of your mind.For me,one is the picture of a young girl about six or seven.She is nude，she is strapped to a chair，and the chair has fallen over，and this child is being sexually assaulted by a dog.The tears are streaming up this little girl’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:36:b532d4667b9f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 216, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 37, "text": "men cut off the penis and testicles and hung these from the branches of the tree.

To this day, I remember a wave of horror and disbelief flooding my being. I could not believe this. How could this happen in America? I had never learned about this in my high school history classes. And why? Why would they do that? My boyfriend’s father suggested I read James Baldwin’s Going to Meet the Man. Going to Meet the Man. My days are spent going through media reports and criminal complaints of child pornography arrests. It is almost all white, male faces staring back at me. Sometimes a white woman’s face surfaces, a few black men, one or two Latino men, several Arab and Asian men and, very rarely, a black woman. But, by and large, I am looking at white male mug shots and reading about horrific violence committed against children in the videos and images these white men were caught trading. Mark Ranzenberger, a journalism professor at Central Michigan University, was sentenced, January 2017, to 14 years in federal prison, for one count of child pornography possession and 14-45 years in state prison for repeatedly raping a young girl over a seven year period. At the time of his arrest, Ranzenberger had 1,000 images/videos of child sex abuse, including the rape of infants. He also had a “grooming” document instructing pedophiles how to manipulate children from birth to age 11 “to participate in sexual acts.” the lynching of a black man. This is a rite of sexual passage for the white boy to become a man. This, for the white community, was a celebrated event. The white women cooked food, put ribbons in their hair and set up a picnic. The white men felt their penises stiffen. The son of the man, who took his son to the lynching, grew up to become a police officer who achieved sexual excitement by violently beating black men and raping black women. “Sometimes, sure, like any other man, he knew that he wanted a little more spice than Grace [his wife] could give him and he would drive over yonder and pick up a black piece or arrest her, it came to the same thing” says the white deputy sheriff in Going to Meet the Man.

James Baldwin describes how the white man teaches the next white, male generation that sexual arousal is the result of brutal violence committed against vulnerable people. Child pornography is the recorded evidence of brutal violence committed against vulnerable people. Is there a link? It seems to me there may be. It is the act of committing the violence, and watching this violence be committed, that provides the pedophile with sexual stimulation and an erection used to rape the child. As Baldwin wrote, the white man “felt himself violently stiffen” when he thought about or committed acts of violence against vulnerable black men, women and children. The white deputy sheriff in Going to Meet the Man can only achieve an erection, when attempting sex with his wife, by thinking about the violence he has committed against vulnerable people in the African-American community. Child pornography, like racism, is about sexual violence committed, overwhelmingly by white men, against a vulnerable population. As I write this book, I often think back to 1987 and reflect on the ed-ucation I received that winter afternoon in Connecticut, exposed to of bearing witness through words and songs and the power of love to educate about and expose injustice. I would be a very different, and much worse, person today if not for the education I received from a football player I met one fall day in upstate New York and happened to ask if he wanted to join me for a run. 1.

Along with providing investigative and protective services for those victims of these horrific crimes, Anti-Predator Project is also dedicated to educating the community about the reality of human trafficking in the United States.

We offer our services free of charge to victims and relatives of victims. 40.The link between organized crime and human trafficking is clearly established and both are often involved in supplying children for sexual exploitation.Any of the facilitators outlined above can be afiliated or controlled by such criminal networks.Additionally, criminal networks have a particular interest in the production and sale of child abuse material,which is increasingly lucrative.Moreover,organized crime groups have used child sexual abuse material to extort money and steal identities. n May 2016, the Pentagon’s Defense Security Service Director, Daniel Payne told reporters the “amount of child porn” on government computers is just “unbelievable.” I contacted Payne’s office seeking clarification and was told, “Director Payne was speaking from his 34 years of experience in the field of counterintelligence and security, and involvement in the Inspector General community. His remarks were not Agency specific; rather, he was speaking in terms of the government as a whole.”2 The quantity of child pornography, a crime dominated by organized crime, on government computers as a whole, is “unbelievable” and this did not even make headline news. Most Americans are unaware that the Defense Security Service Director made this remarkable statement because journalists have, largely, failed to report on the serious national security issue of government employees involved in the child-rape trade. To my knowledge, The Christian Science Monitor was the only major media outlet to cover Payne’s statement: While the notion of government employees and contractors with high levels of security clearance looking at child pornography was disturbing on its own, internal records retrieved through the Freedom of Information Act revealed the problem is not limited to military and intelligence agencies. In the past three years, agencies ranging from the Postal Service to the Federal Highway Administration substantiated about 40 allegations that employees or contractors opened child pornography or provocative images of minors using government resources. The number of confirmed cases may be higher now since many federal organizations, such as the National Security Agency (NSA), did not respond to requests for records about similar investigations.”3 While complete data is not available, it is evident that disturbing numbers", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:39:fe90058181d7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 219, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 40, "text": "and intelligence agencies.

The number of confirmed cases may be higher now since many federal organizations, such as the National Security Agency (NSA), did not respond to requests for records about similar investigations.”3 While complete data is not available, it is evident that disturbing numbers of government employees, often in leadership positions, have been caught trading in child rape at the Pentagon, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Justice (DOJ), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Department of Transportation (DOT), Transportation Security Agency (TSA), Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), among other federal agencies and at local and state-level government offices from Maine to California.4 The alarming number of government employees arrested on child pornography charges renders this a national security issue because these employees have opened U.S. government networks to organized crime and have also made themselves vulnerable to blackmail by hostile governments seeking to exploit America’s weaknesses. The absence of accurate data on how many federal government employees have been arrested for trading in child rape is due to the failure of the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations to require their executive branch agencies maintain “official numbers related to employees who access child pornography on federal government computers.”5 The Trump administration has also not yet mandated that this data be gathered and made public. Likewise, at the state level, governors are not requiring their agencies to collect and report on employees arrested on child pornography charges. Criminal behavior, particularly at the top of an organization, establishes permissible conduct for the entire workplace. This culture permeates the government – compromising national security on many levels, from classified information to the safety and well-being of law-abiding government employees and U.S. citizens. For example, an Army prosecutor and judge advocate like Daniel Wollverton, sentenced for infant sodomy and 30,000 child rape images, would have been unlikely to hold his own colleagues accountable for sexual assault against other military staff.6 David O’Brien, a scientist responsible for monitoring global nuclear activity, was sentenced to federal prison for trading in child rape including from Russian sources on government computers.7 He certain- Former Undersecretary of the Navy, James Daniel Howard, arrested on child pornography possession and reproduction in 2013.

When those involved in child pornography are top government employees, responsible for America’s national security, it is easy to understand why this is a serious problem. Given the number of known arrests, it certainly appears pedophiles may be connected through out our military, law enforcement, and civilian governments agencies; protecting and helping each other avoid prosecution and access children for rape and torture.

The David O’Brien’s Criminal Complaint $ { } { } 2 0 1 1$ , journalist Bryan Bender, with the Boston Globe, reported up to I 5,200 Pentagon employees with top security clearances were engaged in child pornography on Pentagon computers.10 Many were using their government email accounts and paying with credit cards. The brazenness with which America’s most elite military men committed this crime indicates a culture that tolerates, perhaps even encourages, child pornography. What’s worse is there were almost no prosecutions. The Pentagon closed the investigation, claiming it wasn’t “a priority.”11 Senator Charles Grassley fought a losing battle to expose the Pentagon’s refusal to examine 1,700 of the 5,200 reports. Denial. Nothing to see here. Move along please. And everyone did. In July 2012, Bloomberg News reported the U.S. Missile Defense Agency issued a memo reminding staff not to download pornography at work.12 “Specifically,” the memo reads, “there have been instances of employees and contractors accessing websites, or transmitting messages, containing pornographic or sexually explicit images.… These actions are not only unprofessional, they reflect time taken away from desig- nated duties, are in clear violation of federal and DOD and regulations, consume network resources and can compromise the security of the network.”13 When America’s most elite security professionals responsible for our missile defense system need to be told not to access pornography (perhaps child pornography, the memo did not specify) on government networks, America has a serious problem. Lt. Col. Zatyko, former Department of Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL) Director, told journalists, in 2012, regarding child pornography investigations, “we always have cases in the queue… and more work than we can handle.”14 Merritt Baer, owner of a cyber-security firm and former clerk with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, reported, in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:41:d5d57745fa80", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 221, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 42, "text": "need to be told not to access pornography (perhaps child pornography, the memo did not specify) on government networks, America has a serious problem.

Baer estimated two-thirds of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces docket were child pornography cases.15 While complete data on how many military employees have been prosecuted for trading in child rape has not been gathered, the information that is available is shocking. n 2016, the Los Angeles Times, called child abuse in the military a I “little-noticed cascade” and reported in many cases “military officials knew or suspected that child abuse or neglect was occurring – but failed to intervene or to alert the Family Advocacy Program or state child welfare agencies.”16 Defense Department officials say child pornography arrests and convictions are not “tracked” and so it is “difficult to determine how widespread the problem might be.”17 Although the Department of Defense (DOD) issues an annual report on sexual assaults on adults in the military, this report fails to include child sexual assaults and child pornography convictions.18 A 2015, Associated Press (AP) investigation “found the single largest category of inmates in military prisons to be child sex offenders.”19 In 2013, the Navy pledged greater transparency regarding sexual assaults, including against children, and now provides public monthly courts-martial information available on the Navy.mil website.20 As of April 2017, there were ten Navy military court cases involving child pornography and child rape since the start of the year. In the Army, in March 2017, six Army staff were involved in court-martial proceedings on child pornography charges and eleven on child sex abuse charges.21 As of June 2017, 23 Marines were in court-martial proceedings for child sexual assault and/ or child-pornography related charges.22 As of April 2017, Stars and Stripes had 200 articles related to child pornography arrests in the military. 30,000 Army children were abused with 1,400 cases of sexual assault and 118 child murders.24 From 2011-2012 the Marine Corps reported 1,591 confirmed cases of child abuse. The Navy reported 3,336 cases of reported child abuse from 2009 to 2012.25 Child abuse reports increased 25 percent in the Air Force from 2008-2012. In a one-year period, 2011- 2012, in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps there were 12,881 cases of child abuse, 753 of which were sexual assaults with 67 children killed.

In 2016, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii, when Talia’s Law was passed, claimed there were 29,000 cases of Gregory Kyle Seerden, a 31-year-old Navy SEAL, was arrested on child pornography charges in April 2017. At the time of his arrest his cell phone contained a video of him molesting a 5-year-old girl who was asleep, an infant being raped by a dog and children in bondage. Seerden’s trade in child rape was discovered during an investigation into his rape of an unconscious adult woman. In 2016, after the Associated Press (AP) filed numerous freedom of information act (FOIA) requests, partial information was released by the military. AP suggested the data provided seemed low and said the “numbers fall well-short of offering a full picture.”27 Compared with military data from earlier years, cited above, the data the military provided to AP does appear to be incomplete. In addition, child pornography, specifically, was not reported. Although child sexual assault and child pornography production are often synonymous, this is not always reflected in the investigations, convictions or data. The military reported to AP there were 1,584 cases of reported child sexual assault from 2010-2014. Most often the sexual assault was of girls by male relatives in positions of military leadership; corporals, sergeants and staff sergeants.28 AP’s findings are consistent with research, cited in previous chapters, about who trades in child rape and how they access the children; men, most often fathers, in positions of power sexually abusing their own children and/or children of family friends.29 Like Marine Corporeal Aaron Masa, profiled in the AP article, who groomed a fellow Marine and, unbeknownst to the Marine father, used his friendship with the family to gain access to the father’s 3-year-old stepdaughter and infant daughter to produce child pornography.30 The Policy Lab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia has documented that an estimated one in five cases of Army children diagnosed by doctors as assault victims are never reported to the military officals.31 Marisa Taylor, a journalist with McClatchy, confirmed that even when military staff admit to molesting children and using child pornography they are not always reported. She cites a 2010 case of an Air Force lieutenant colonel who “confessed to downloading child pornography on his Pentagon computer and to touching a child in a sexual way” during a polygraph interview for a position with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the government agency responsible for overseeing spy satellites.32 The NRO never reported the lieutenant colonel to the police or the Air Force.33 On Medium, I", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:43:727c069e20d7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 223, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 44, "text": "to molesting children and using child pornography they are not always reported.

As with my other research, I used simple Twitter and Google searches to locate mainstream media reports of military staff arrested on child pornography charges. This is by no means a comprehensive account. The data does provide a sense of the scale of the trade in child rape within our military; one that represents a serious security issue not only for military children but for all Americans. Comprehensive data collection on this subject is urgently needed. • Lt. Col. Steven Jon Frederiksen, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) employee, was sentenced, 8 November 2016, to 20 years in prison with 20 years of supervised release for producing child pornography. He pled guilty to one count of producing child pornography and one count of attempted coercion and enticement of a minor. Frederiksen targeted and coerced, at least four girls age 14–17 years old, to produce videos/images while he was at work and from his government computer. He was also trading in the rape of prepubescent children from his government computer. Frederiksen is a West Point graduate. He joined the Army in 1995 and was a Boy Scout and church youth leader.34 • Col. Robert Joel Rice, an Army War College war game developer, was charged, April 2013, with 130 child pornography counts. After many delays, Rice was sentenced, 28 December 2016, to 12 years in federal prison followed by 10 years of supervised released concurrent with a four-year prison sentence from a military court-martial in October 2016. The Army War College continued to employ Rice, while he was free on bail, and allowed him supervised access to Army computers pending sentencing. At the time of his arrest, Rice had more than 30,000 images/videos of child sex abuse. His wife had discovered these and notified police.35 • Robert Cuff, Navy Command Master Chief of Joint Task Force North at Biggs Army Airfield, pled guilty and received a life-sentence in July 2012 for child pornography charges. Cuff had been a Dreamboard member; an online group engaged in the violent sex abuse of children under twelve years old – otherwise known as pre-teen hard core (PTHC).

The military refused to confirm if Rabes had used military computers. He had more than 30,000 child sex-abuse videos/images. Rabes’ former wife had operated a day-care facility from their residence in Colorado Springs. Unknown to his wife, Rabes had been sexually abusing children, as young as four-years-old, at the day-care and filming and distributing that abuse.37 • David Riley, a 37-year-old Air Force Major stationed at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, was charged on child pornography counts after he sent “extremely graphic” child sex abuse images to an undercover Washington D.C. Metro police officer. Riley said he was “looking for other pervs in the area” and that he had sexually abused the six-year-old daughter of his former girlfriend. Riley, a married father of a sixyear-old girl, said he never abuses his own daughter. The undercover officer sent Riley a picture of a child and claimed it was his Air Force Staff Sergeant, 29-year- old Daniel Freiwald, married father of two children formerly with the 83rd Fighter Weapons Squadron, was sentenced to eight years for receiving, distributing and possessing videos/images of child rape, including infants and toddlers, on his computer at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. He later died, reported as suicide, in prison. • Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy, 70-year-old retired Navy Captain Wade Sanders, pled guilty to child pornography possession. He had been awarded the Silver Star, the nation’s third-highest valor award. The Navy revoked this medal after Sander’s child sex abuse conviction. Sanders introduced candidate John Kerry at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. He was sentenced to 37 months in prison.39 Men arrested for trading in child rape are often in significant positions in our national security infrastructure. The AP’s investigation conon child sex abuse charges.40 The arrests I have gathered so far are only a few out of hundreds. As I reviewed arrest records, I kept thinking, “surely this arrest is as shocking as it gets.” Inevitably, the next case was more concerning.

In May 2013, David O’Brien was arrested and charged with ten counts of child pornography possession and distribution and sentenced, October 2014, to five years in federal prison. O’Brien had a large childpornography collection at home and on his Air Force computer. He was trading in pre-teen hard core (PTHC) – the brutal rape and torture of very young children, often infants and toddlers. He was also exchanging Russian-sourced material. O’Brien had taken pictures of his own young granddaughter and placed images of her head over images of children being raped. He also transposed photos of Air Force employees and child-sex abuse images. Detection System was likely exposed to Russian organized crime. National security journalists never reported on O’Brien’s arrest. Why not? O’Brien’s crimes against children are also crimes against all Americans. If you share my discomfort about O’Brien’s conduct, contact the Air Force and share your concerns. The military has the technical capacity to block child pornography. Blocking programs are an easy technical fix. Iceland, for example, has been considering a nation-wide block on adult and child pornography.41 The United Kingdom has also been discussing a country-wide block on child pornography and mandating that Internet service providers create an optin/opt-out function to access adult pornography.42 In the U.S. some state legislatures are considering the Human Trafficking and Child Exploitation Prevention Act which would require Internet-accessible electronics to include a filter for adult and child pornography. People wishing to access adult pornography could pay a $20 tax to unlock the filter.43 Some states have passed Internet filtering laws regulating public schools and libraries, requiring filtering software.44 The military can prevent access to child pornography on government computers. This is a choice. Is the military choosing to allow child rape images and videos on government computer networks over America’s national security? The military, like other government agencies, is not gathering and making public comprehensive data on child pornography arrests. They should be required to do so. The Department of Defense (DOD)’s annual report on sexual assault must include child sexual assault and child pornography charges. Child sex abuse allegations are probable cause for child pornography investigations and vice versa.

Robust and comprehensive child protection procedures must become the norm in all military investigations. Child pornography must be blocked from all military computers and regular random searches of military electronics, including personal electronic devises for those with top security clearance, must be a top priority. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, a leading advocate for ending adult sexual assault in the military, said the AP’s investigation into child sexual abuse in the military was alarming.45 The AP reported, in 2016, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Barbara Boxer of California and Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, contacted military leadership to express concerns about the alarming amount of child sex abuse within the military.46 If you wish to help protect children of 11.In addition，I observed that many of the Shared Files have file names that by their title indicate an apparent connection to child pornography，including，among others, “(（(kingpass))） ioy touch pussy webcam 3.avi”；“boy gay sexo infantil porno (37) (2).jpg”；“pthc- capb (little boy slowly fucks little girl).mpg”; $\\ \" \\ b { 1 1 }$ years old masha masturbate.avi“;”bibcam webcam ultimate 12 best boy suck & fuck(2).avi“; 𝔫₁₃ ’and 12 year old brothers enjoy playing and sucking off each others dick.mpg”； $\" \\pm 7$ yo boy fuck 7 yo girl kdv.avi“；and”homemade (pthc)father with daughter 13y anal (inzest).wmv.\" When a report is made to law enforcement about child pornography ously; that police will act to protect the child and apprehend the perpetrator. But what happens when the officer receiving the report is engaged in the trade of child rape him/herself? While there are many dedicated law enforcement officers (LEOs) for whom I have tremendous respect, especially those investigating child pornography, the arrests of law enforcement engaged in this crime are alarming and appear to be widespread.47 These arrests suggest a serious problem of pedophiles in positions of power within too many local and state police agencies. How many state and local enforcement officers have been arrested on child pornography related charges? No one knows – because law enforcement has not been collecting the data. According to the Cato Institute’s National Police Misconduct Reporting Project (NPMRP), DOJ has failed to release data on a “wide range of misdeeds, crimes, and other misconduct that occur in law enforcement agencies.”48 Cato’s NPMRP provides a 2010 report by David Packman documenting 618 cases of sexual misconduct by law enforcement with over half of those", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:47:2875699eddd9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 227, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 48, "text": "local enforcement officers have been arrested on child pornography related charges?

Several states, Louisiana, Maryland and North Carolina, refused to provide AP with any information at all. While there is a National Decertification Index (NDI) listing officers who have lost certification, this is voluntary, and many agencies simply choose not to share information. In addition, the NDI database does not provide information on offense type. In November 2014, I placed on Medium “Police Trading in Child Rape & Torture” profiling 70 local and state police officers arrested on child pornography charges. My survey was out of date almost as soon as I hit “publish.” A year later I posted “When Law Enforcement is the Perpetrator,” examining only November 2015, when more than two local or state officers per week were in the news. In April 2017, I profiled 103 state and local LEOs in “Law Enforcement Arrested for Trading in Child Rape.”54 I used simple Google and Twitter searches to locate media reports of arrests. • Officer Michael Harding, of Port St. Lucie, Florida, was arrested September 2015, on child pornography charges. He was caught in a chatroom called #toddlerfuck. Harding was trading in child rape while on duty and possessed hundreds of videos/images including “6 yo boy sucks” and “7 yo girl fingered deep in both holes.” He was Officer of the Year in 2011.55 • Chief Robert Geist, the “number one possessor and distributor of child porn” in Pennsylvania, caught sending images/videos including “6Yo babyj—Bedtime rape.” Geist received no jail time.56 • Chris Bowersox, a 38-year-old Bakersfield, California police officer, was sentenced to four years in jail.

He was discovered by federal investigators discussing raping and killing young boys. In one chat session another pedophile wrote, “Every time I talk someone into rape, I always get a bit sad when they’re not into this.” Bowersox responded, “Oh, I’m … into it, big time.” In another chat, Bowersox discussed how to locate a child to rape, torture and kill. One pedophile wrote “I know it can’t happen here, it’s got to be somewhere else with a bought kid or something. We’d definitely get caught if we did it here.” Bowersox replied, “Cambodia … Thailand … Mexico … deep deep Mexico.” Images of local boys were found on Bowersox’s computer.57 • Maine State Police Chief Andrew Demers, charged with child sex-abuse of his four-year-old granddaughter. Demers was sentenced to five years, one of which was suspended. He served 26 years with the Maine State Police and was chief from 1987 to 1993. In 2003, Demers, the most decorated officer in state police history, was named a “Legendary Trooper.”58 • Chief Brian Fanelli, of Mount Pleasant, New York, arrested in January 2014, pled guilty to child pornography charges in July 2015. Fanelli had images/videos of children as young as seven. Other videos included 10 and 12-year-old girls engaged in sex acts and a video called “10 y touch pussy webcam.” He was sentenced, January 2016, to 18 months in prison followed by five years of probation.59 • Gilberto Valle, a 30-year-old New York City police officer whose online name was Girlmeat Hunter was convicted, March 2013, of conspiracy to kidnap and illegal access of a federal government database. Valle engaged in online arrangements with a man who offered his three-year-old stepdaughter as a sex slave and his two nieces, age seven and nine, for rape. Valle also discussed plans to murder his wife, saying he would tie up her feet, slit her throat and watch the blood rush from her body. Valle’s wife installed spyware on their home computer and discovered his online activity. She gave the computer to the FBI and fled the state with their one-yearold baby.60 Valle’s computer was “loaded with crime-scene pictures of dead and mutilated women, twisted images of women being tortured and sexually assaulted.” He illegally accessed the encrypted National Crime Information Database to research kidnapping targets and had amassed over 100 potential victims including names, photos, birth dates and bra sizes.

Valle claimed, in chat sessions, that he was “drafting and revising an operation plan to abduct and cook an identified woman.” He had a file called “Abducting and Cooking: A Blueprint” and had downloaded chloroform recipes to subdue his victims. A “client” asked Valle to kidnap and deliver a woman to be raped and murdered. Valle agreed to do so for $5, 000 and said, “Just so that you know, she may be knocked out when I get her to you. I don’t know how long the solvent I am using will last but I have to knock her out to get her out of her apartment safely.” When the “client” tried to lower the price Valle said “I really need the money.” The “client” wrote “Just make sure she doesn’t die before I get her.”61 Despite all this, Valle walked free. Judge Paul Gardephe overturned a 2013 conviction, gave Valle a misdemeanor and released him on time-served, twenty-one months, and one year supervised release. Valle said he plans to become a criminal defense attorney and pursue custody rights of his 3-year-old daughter. He also hopes to return to the New York Police Department.62 Far too many in law enforcement appear to be engaging in this crime with what appears to be increased frequency at leadership levels. No be engaged in the trade in child rape. Not one. Deeply concerning is the brutal rape and violence of infants and toddlers, that so many police have been caught producing and trading. Police involved in child pornography present a serious problem for the security of America’s children and for all Americans. How can any parent have faith that their families and children will be protected by local and state law enforcement, knowing how many police are participating in the crime? Mention federal law enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), the Authority (TSA) might come to mind. There are 73 federal law enforcement agencies, from the United States Mint Police to U.S. Postal Inspectors, employing, according to the most recent U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) data, some 120,000 full-time law enforcement officers (LEOs) Like all other government agencies, there is no comprehensive data available on how many federal LEOs have been arrested on child pornography charges.

While the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) documents assaults committed against federal LEOs, it fails to track and report on crimes which federal LEOs themselves commit. If you believe the U.S. government should make public crimes committed by federal law enforcement, including child pornography, please contact DOJ’s BJS and ask them to report on crimes committed by federal law enforcement, including child pornography-related arrests and prosecutions. Aliya Sternstein, a journalist with The Christian Science Monitor, attempted to gather child pornography related arrests of federal government employees, including federal law enforcement. She filed freedom of information requests and reported that “many federal organizations, such as the National Security Agency (NSA), did not respond to requests for records.” The U.S. Postal System Inspector General (IG) did provide information reporting between 2014 and 2016, “the USPS inspector general closed 34 investigations into that category of misconduct” of U.S. postal system employees.64 It is worth noting, the U.S. Postal System (USPS) is one of the best federal law enforcement agencies investigating child pornography crimes. USPS agents, like Brian Bone, are well-known and respected for tackling some of the most complex cases such as Project Spade.65 USPS should receive much greater support for the work they do dismantling pedophile networks. Perhaps the most comprehensive report available on sexual misconduct by federal LEOs is the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General’s 2015 report, “The Handling of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct by the Department’s Law Enforcement Components.”66 This report detailed cases, from 2009-2012, among federal law enforcement agencies under DOJ’s supervision; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Marshals Service (USMS).67 The Office of the Inspector General (OIG)’s report begins with a rather remarkable disclaimer explaining they were unable to obtain complete information because the FBI and DEA resisted providing the data. The OIG’s ability to conduct this review was significantly impacted and delayed by the repeated difficulties we had in obtaining relevant information from both the FBI and DEA…. Initially, the FBI and DEA refused to provide the OIG with unredacted information that was responsive to our requests… despite the fact that the OIG is authorized under the Inspector General Act to receive such information. After months of protracted discussions with management at both agencies, the DEA and FBI provided the information without extensive redactions; but we found that the information was still incomplete.

After months of protracted discussions with management at both agencies, the DEA and FBI provided the information without extensive redactions; but we found that the information was still incomplete. Ultimately, based on a review of information in the OIG Investigations Division databases, we determined that a material number of allegations from both DEA and FBI were not included in the original responses to our request for the information. We were also concerned by an apparent decision by DEA to withhold information regarding a particular open misconduct case. The OIG was not given access to this case file information until several months after our request, and only after the misconduct case was closed. Once we became aware of the information, we interviewed DEA employees who said that they were given the impression that they were not to discuss this case with the OIG while the case remained open. The OIG was entitled to receive all such information from the outset, and the failure to provide it unnecessarily delayed our work. Therefore, we cannot be completely confident that the FBI and DEA provided us with all information relevant to this review. As a result, our report reflects the findings and conclusions we reached based on the information made available to us.68 Eventually, the OIG documented 621 cases of sexual misconduct and harassment among four federal law enforcement agencies. Over half, 343 cases, were in the FBI. The FBI also had the majority, 18, reported child pornography/child sex abuse cases. ATF reported two child pornography/child sex abuse cases, the DEA reported five cases and the U.S. Marshals provided two reports. The OIG noted that none of the agencies have systems in place to monitor employee’s computers. Therefore, the reported cases likely represent a small percentage of overall engagement in the crime. Many, if not most, pedophiles are apprehended because of a mistake they make rather than routine monitoring and oversight. Only the FBI, of the four agencies, monitors text messages but claims it is “hampered in its ability to archive all text messages … due to technological limitations.” The FBI also “disabled the ability to send images on employee Blackberry devices.”69 It is concerning that federal law enforcement agencies are not only failing to maintain accurate records of employee arrests but are also refusing to share information with their own Office of Inspector General (OIG). When federal law enforcement agencies refuse to comply with legal requests from the OIG, it is nearly impossible for an unfunded researcher, like myself, to obtain comprehensive statistics. In order to acquire data on child pornography arrests for all 73 federal agencies, I would need to obtain Inspector General reports for every agency over a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:52:b6d0841382cb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 232, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "not only failing to maintain accurate records of employee arrests but are also refusing to share information with their own Office of Inspector General (OIG).

In order to acquire data on child pornography arrests for all 73 federal agencies, I would need to obtain Inspector General reports for every agency over a ten-year period, file multiple freedom of information act requests and purchase and analyze over 20,000 federal prosecution records. This kind of research is certainly possible with funding. Unable to conduct the kind of comprehensive research this subject demands, I focused on the more powerful and well-known federal law enforcement agencies, like the FBI and Homeland Security. I did some limited searches of the many smaller law enforcement agencies and sometimes accessed Inspector General (IG) reports.70 Given that federal LEOs have refused to comply with DOJ’s Inspector General and Homeland Security’s former Inspector General, Charles Edwards, was forced to resign when he came under investigation for covering up and white-washing reports, even the accuracy of IG reports are suspect.71 A limited list of federal LEOs arrested on child pornography charges is located on my Medium profile. • Brian Haller, a 40-year-old cyber-security expert contractor with the FBI, was arrested, April 2015, on child pornography charges. He was sentenced April 8, 2016, to two days and one night in jail followed by ten years of supervised release. Haller was caught in the FBI’s bust of a child rape website called Playpen. At the time of his arrest he had over 600 files of child rape and abuse. His online name was “jb” short for “jailbait” and his collection included a 40-minute video showing the sexual exploitation of an 11-year-old girl. Haller directed a FBI/private-sector cyber-security group in Seattle, Washington and had access to a secure FBI online platform and email system.72 • Donald Sachtleben, a 54-year-old former FBI Agent was arrested May 2012, and charged on child pornography charges. He pled guilty to distribution and possession and was sentenced November 14, 2013, to eight years in prison. He was also sentenced to unrelated charges of disclosing and possessing classified information. Sachtleben was Director of Training at the Center for Improvised Explosives at Oklahoma State University and was with the FBI from 1983 to 2008 as a bomb technician and counter-terrorism investigator. Sachtleben’s email was pedodave69@yahoo.com. He wrote to other pedophiles, “Saw your profile on (a file sharing network). Hope you like these and can send me some of ours (sic).

He pled guilty to possession and was sentenced, September 2013, to more than three years in prison. Dietterle was caught when he sent child sex abuse images/videos to an undercover Metro D.C. Detective. The detective was posing as a man sexually abusing his three-year-old nephew and 12-year-old daughter. Dietterle described the rape of the children as “So hot man … how’d it start?” and discussed meeting the detective with the intention of sexually abusing the three-year-old boy.75 • Darren Argento, a 47-year-old, DEA Agent, was arrested, August 2010, for child pornography possession and distribution. He was sentenced August 17, 2011, to seven months in jail followed by five months of supervised release. At the time of his arrest, Argento had over 73,000 images and over 723 videos of child rape. He was caught when he brought his personal laptop to the DEA office and asked an IT employee to help back up his files. Argento is listed as a registered sex offender.76 • James Patrick Burke, a 39-year-old DEA Agent, was arrested August 2015, on child pornography charges. He pled guilty, June 2, 2016, and was sentenced, April 6, 2017, to 7 years in jail followed by 15 years of supervised release. At the time of his arrest, Burke had over 2,760 images/videos of the rape and torture of children, including infants and toddlers and children being raped when bound and gagged.

McKee is a registered sex offender. There has been a fair amount of media attention devoted to arrests of about employee misconduct.79 No one knows how many Homeland Security employees have been arrested on child pornography charges because Homeland is refusing to provide public information about these crimes. If you wish to take action and help obtain the data, please contact the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs and express your concerns. The highest-ranking Homeland employee to be charged on child pornography-related crimes is former Deputy Press Secretary Brian Doyle. Doyle was sending child sex abuse images/videos to an undercover officer in Polk County, Florida. “Doyle couldn’t have been more brazen, giving out his title, calling from his DHS office, even sending a photo showing his Department of Homeland Security identity card along with his genitals.”80 Sheriff Grady Judd, one of America’s leading LEOs, said of Doyle’s actions, “It doesn’t come any more hard-core. He graphically explained to a 14-year old girl what he would like to do to her and what he would like her to do to him.” Doyle was charged with sixteen counts of transmission of harmful material to a minor and seven counts of using a computer to seduce a child and sentenced to five years in jail.81 He is now a registered sex offender. In January 2017, the New York Times reported that Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) investigators, under Homeland Security, have “repeatedly warned top managers that unaddressed allegations of corruption among contractors could put the immigration system at risk” citing nearly 70 cases, including distribution of child pornography on government computers, that have not been investigated. It is unclear how many of these cases involved child pornography. Nearly half of CIS employees, about 10,000, are contract staff subject to almost no oversight. The New York Times said Homeland did not respond to questions about why misconduct investigations of CIS staff have been prevented.82 Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s report for 2013, reports a “CIS employee pled guilty to possession of child pornography, and was sentenced to 37 months incarceration and 120 months of supervised release.” No further details were provided. Pro Publica reported, February 2016, on misconduct among federal Air Marshals, under Homeland’s supervision. The government responded, after seven years, to journalist Michael Grabell’s freedom of information request. From 2002 to 2012, almost 150 Air Marshals were arrested for criminal behavior, 250 Air Marshals were terminated for misconduct", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:55:63735bd4e1bd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 235, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 56, "text": "report for 2013, reports a “CIS employee pled guilty to possession of child pornography, and was sentenced to 37 months incarceration and 120 months of supervised release.” No further details were provided.

Child pornography and child sex abuse are not listed in separate categories, but appear to be under the general heading of criminal conduct/criminal arrests. In addition, employee names were not provided. Thus, making it nearly impossible to determine how many Air Marshals have been caught engaging in child pornography-related crimes. The Center for Investigative Reporting’s journalist, Andrew Becker, reported that prospective Homeland employees sometimes confess during polygraph interviews. These confessions were not always reported, investigated or prosecuted.84 For example, 22-year old Cody Slaughter told a Customs and Border Protection examiner that he had molested his best friend’s two-year-old sister and engaged in bestiality with his horse, a dog and a pig. Although the polygrapher reported these crimes, local prosecutors refused to prosecute Slaughter.85 Another example is Joseph Montross, a 28-year-old combat-tested Marine with a security clearance, who confessed he sexually abused children to produce child pornography. Investigators found more than 9,000 images/videos of child sex abuse. Montross was arrested and sentenced to jail. As with my other research, I used simple Google and Twitter searches to locate media reports of Homeland employees arrested on child pornography related charges. A more comprehensive list is on my Medium profile. Examples of federal law enforcement, under Homeland’s supervision, arrested for child pornography related offenses include: • Nicholas Bolden, a 40-year-old Homeland Security Customs and Border Patrol Agent, was arrested, April 2013, on child pornography charges. He pled guilty April 30, 2013, and was sentenced July 31, 2013, to six and half years in federal prison followed by 24 years of supervised release. Bolden was accessing Russian child rape and torture websites from his government computer. A CD containing child pornography was also found in his office desk. • Gilbert Lam, a 38-year-old Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection Agent who worked at San Francisco airport, was arrested and charged March 2013, on child pornography charges. He was found guilty in December 18, 2014 and sentenced to just over a year in jail. Investigators said Lam’s electronic resources were “elaborate” and included “a whole closet … independent server, several computers, several hard drives…” Lam was trading in a known series call the Vicky Series. He appealed the court order that he pay $3, 000 in restitution to the child victim and lost his appeal. 1 The", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:56:85c0b55d8544", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 236, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 57, "text": "was arrested and charged March 2013, on child pornography charges.

He was found guilty, January 24, 2013, and sentenced April 2013, to ten years in jail. Hardrick was trading in pre-teen hard core (PTHC) the brutal torture and rape of very young children, including infants and toddlers. Hardrick appealed his sentence and lost his appeal. He must register as a sex offender. • Anthony Mangione, 50-year-old Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for South Florida, was arrested on “extreme child abuse” charges in September 2011. He was sentenced in November 2012 to nearly six years in prison. Mangione is a 1982 graduate of the University of Maine Orono (UMO) where former Senior Child Protection Services (CPS) Cynthia Wellman claimed CPS was operating a child sex ring on campus. Originally from Rhode Island, Mangione arrived in Orono in August 1978.86 • Thomas Gordon, a 46-year-old TSA agent in Philadelphia, was sentenced for possession and distribution of child pornography. He had over 600 images and videos of child sex abuse, including children as young as six years old, which were described as “horrific.” He had as many as six fake Facebook accounts he was using to distribute child sex abuse.87 File name: !!New!!

Craft was trading in pre-teen hard core (PTHC). Descriptions of some of the images/videos he was trading in appear in his court documents and are noted here. Upon his arrest, he had more than 480 images and 111 videos of children being sexually exploited, including images and videos depicting sadistic or masochistic conduct. Craft must register as a sex offender. • Lee Robert Moore, a 37-year-old Secret Service Agent, stationed at The White House, was arrested November 9, 2015, for soliciting sex with a child while he was on duty. He had sent pictures of his penis to an undercover police officer in Delaware. Moore was indicted in June 2016 in Florida on charges of child pornography receipt and attempting to entice a minor. He pled guilty in March 2017 to both the Delaware and Florida charges. Moore was caught attempting to sexually abuse a 14-year-old girl, who was, in reality, an undercover investigator in Delaware. The undercover investigator communicated with Moore for about two months, during that time Moore’s second child was born. Moore was arrested when he made arrangements to meet the 14-year-old “girl.” Moore also had contact with about ten real children. In text messages he said he was “a cop,’’ a “federal officer” and said “Like the Rolling Stones sang, ‘every cop is a criminal.’” Moore has been in custody since his arrest. Homeland Security admitted to Christian Science Monitor journalist Aliya Sternstein that their firewalls lack the capacity to recognize, not investigate the behavior of individual employees.”90 In contrast, The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Commerce Department have security systems that alert officials when child sex abuse is shared on their networks. If the FTC and the Department of Commerce do this, why isn’t this mandatory for Homeland Security as well as all federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies?91 Given the numbers of arrests of state and local law enforcement combined with Director of the Pentagon’s Defense Security Service statement that the “amount of child porn” on government computers is just “unbelievable,” it is reasonable to assume if", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:58:5f84379dba4c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 238, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 59, "text": "systems that alert officials when child sex abuse is shared on their networks.

Federal law enforcement officers are powerful. The scope of their ability to arrest and investigate is substantial. Their ability to protect themselves and hide their own crimes, and those of others, is considerable. As with local and state law enforcement, a system of consistent oversight and electronic monitoring must be developed. Every federal law enforcement officer should be required, as part of their hiring package, to sign a code of conduct that includes permission for random searches of their work and personal electronics and IP networks. On a rotating basis one federal law enforcement agency, perhaps the U.S. Postal System, should oversee random monitoring of all other agencies. Arrest and prosecution data must be gathered and made public. No federal law enforcement officer should ever be engaged in the trade in child rape and certainly not on government computers. Pedophiles should not be able to gain access to and enter federal law enforcement agencies. American children should not be raped and their rape images traded by men and women who have sworn an oath of office to protect and serve America. Our children’s safety and our national security depends upon effective oversight of federal law enforcement agencies’ electronic networks. We can and must do better. The text conversation continued for a period of time and arrangements to meet and have sexual intercourse developed.Mr. Rosen was very hesitant to meet until he had proof that he was texting with a real live fourteen year old. Substantial’efforts were made to provide Mr. Rosen with the proof he was requesting. When one such requested proof was sent to Mr.Rosen,he stated “Good.Now let’s get naked lol.”Ata later time,Rosen stated the following,“Maybe P’luse it when I’m behind you, wrap it around your neck and hold on to it..You want to learn how to I’ll teach you” When Senator Lamar Alexander’s Chief of Staff, Ryan Loskarn, was vided context to the story. The media reported Loskarn’s arrest, and subsequent suicide pending trial, as if it were a one-off event. As if no other high-level government employees were being arrested on child pornography charges. In 2015, when the State Department’s Director of Counter-terrorism, Daniel Rosen, was arrested on charges of computer solicitation of sex/sodomy for a child under 14, two journalists attempted to provide context.

Paul Farrell, with Heavy, and Shane Harris, with The Daily Beast, respectively wrote, “the Second Child Sex Scandal to Hit D.C. in 12 Months” and “3rd U.S. Official Hit With Child Sex and Porn Charges.” Both were far off the mark. A simple Twitter search reveals far more than two or three government staff arrested for trading in child rape.92 In addition to government employees in our national security agencies, military and local, state and federal law enforcement, there are an estimated two million federal civilian government employees and five million people employed in state governments. Some fourteen million people are employed by local governments.93 Most state and local employees are employed in education, with 48% at the state level and 55.4% at the local.94 All totaled, there are an estimated 21 million people employed in federal, state and local government. How many have been arrested on child pornography related charges? No one knows. A national child pornography-arrest database would provide the answer. In the next chapters I discuss government employees who are prosecutors and educators. In this section, I review a small sample of civilian government employees arrested on child pornography related charges. The Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Children’s Museum, the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department along with many others, have all had employees arrested on child pornography charges, often involving work computers.95 Yet, to date, very little action has been taken to prevent government employees from trafficking in children – which is what child pornography is – on government computers. In 2014, Congressman Mark Meadows from North Carolina put forward the Eliminating Pornography from Agencies Act HR 901. Meadows re-introduced this again in January of 2017 as HR 680 – Eliminating Pornography from Agencies Act.96 This bill, if passed into law, would stop federal employees from accessing, watching or sharing pornography on government-issued computers and devices. There has been an ongoing battle waged by technology and telecom firms, along with privacy experts, who do not want this legislation passed.

Congress must pass comprehensive legislation, complete with robust oversight, reporting and monitoring mechanisms, rather than worthless policy riders. If you think HR 680, or an improved version, should be put before the full House for a vote, contact your own U.S. Representative and ask them to sign and support HR 680. Contact Congressman Trey Gowdy, Chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and share your thoughts about HR680.99 Shouldn’t even member of Congress sign this proposed legislation? At the state level, Maine’s Governor, Paul LePage issued one of the first of its kind Executive Orders in 2015, prohibiting Maine state employees from accessing pornographic or sexually explicit material on state computers or devices even when they are off duty on personal time.100 Every governor should pass similar executive orders. Mayors should do the same at city levels, inclusive of robust monitoring and oversight. Also, as previously mentioned, some state legislatures are considering the Human Trafficking and Child Exploitation Prevention Act which would require blocking adult and child pornography.101 The list of civilian government employees arrested on child pornography charges is long. Very long. As with my other research, I’ve used simple Google and Twitter searches. A longer list of government employees arrested for trading in child rape is on my Medium profile. This is only a small sample of arrests. The amount of civilian government employees, at all levels, that appear to be engaged in this crime is distressing. • Timothy DeFoggi, 56-year-old Acting Director of Cyber Security for the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), was sentenced, January 2015, to 25 years in federal prison for participating in a child pornography ring that “shocked veteran investigators.” DeFoggi was a registered user of an online child rape and torture trading site and expressed an interest in the violent rape and murder of children.

Stephen Mantha’s Criminal Complaint • Stephen Mantha, a 62-year-old electronic technician with the U.S. Postal Service, was arrested and charged September 22, 2016, with possession of child pornography and accessing with intent to view child pornography. Mantha was using his government computer to trade in brutal abuse and rape of young children, including children as young as three, the anal rape of children as young as five. He also accessed Russian child pornography trading sites. On October 18, 2016, he was arrested again when investigators located a video of Mantha sexually assaulting a young boy. The USPS continued to employ Mantha until October 2016, when he was allowed to retire. Mantha was under house arrest but, after his second arrest, he was taken into custody pending sentencing. As of July 2017, sentencing had not yet been set.103 • Michael Beeman, a 62-year-old regional public relations officer with the Army Corps of Engineers in Winchester, Virginia, was arrested January 20, 2014, and pled guilty in October 2015, to four counts of child pornography possession and one count of child pornography transportation. On April 14, 2016, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Investigators seized over 250 electronic devices with thousands of images of child pornography from Beeman’s residence. Beeman had been producing child pornography by filming the rape of boys as young as eight since the 1980s, including the rape of a boy at Patrick Air Force Base where Beeman previously worked. He gained access to his victims by offering his services as a baby-sitter on the military base and developing a “father-like relationship” with the boys he targeted. He had been a government employee for over 40 years.104 • Gons Nachman, a 42-year-old former U.S. diplomat, who “admitted taping his sexual encounters with teenage girls while stationed in Brazil and the Congo” was sentenced, August 2008, to 20 years in prison.

Nachman also pled guilty to child pornography possession. One of his videos was titled “Congo 2004 Sexual Adventures.” His law degree is from the University of Pennsylvania, where he was president of the Naturist Student Association and “led demonstrations involving public nudity in 1995.”105 • James Spargo, a 66-year-old employee with the Department of Agriculture in Florida, pled no contest to 20 felony child pornography counts and was sentenced, February 2015, to 10 years in prison. Spargo was arrested when investigators found child sex abuse images/videos on his government computer. Most of the children in the images/videos were infants and toddlers. “The activity we uncovered here was just horrible,” said Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services spokesperson Erin Gillespie. “It was horrifying, it was disgusting, and we gathered all the evidence we could to make sure that this arrest was going to happen.106 • William Shaffer, a Child Protection Services (CPS) staffer was arrested, July 2013, after he purchased nearly $7, 000 of child rape and torture videos/images. According to Shaffer’s criminal complaint “a 1987 police report alleged Shaffer sexually molested a boy between the ages of 8 and 9. The police report alleged the incident happened while Shafer was a Child Protective Services employee.” Investigators also seized “sexual stories” from Shaffer’s home. “One of them describes a seventh-grade boy being abducted, molested and sodomized.”107 • Robert Singer, 49-year-old father of two and Chief Operating Officer for Washington D.C.’s National Children’s Museum, was arrested November 6, 2007, and charged on five child pornography distribution counts. He pled guilty and was sentenced July 16, 2009, to five years in prison. Singer was caught sending child sex abuse images of children as young as five, including from his work computer, to an undercover New York Police Detective who was posing as a 12-year-old girl and her 33-year-old mother. Singer was pretending to be a 15-year-old boy. He was using the online handle badboy2.108 • Stanley Dorozynski, a 53-year-old Child Protective Services (CPS) employee, was arrested December 21, 2010, and charged with two counts, one each, of possessing and receiving child pornography. Upon his arrest, Dorozynski possessed more than 2,400 child sex abuse images/videos including the abuse of children as young as four. Investigators also recovered 11 zip discs of child porn in a locked trunk, among other CDs. Dorozynski had been trading in child rape and torture since 1990.

Dorozynski pled guilty July 27, 2012, and was sentenced to six years in federal prison. His girlfriend found the child sex abuse images/videos and notified law enforcement. He had been a police officer in Utica, New York, before he went to work for Health and Human Services.109 • Jasper Neil Blair, a 27-year-old civil engineer with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, was arrested for child pornography possession and pled guilty May 31, 2012, “to knowingly possessing an image of a six-year-old girl being sexually abused,” and was sentenced October 4, 2012, to two-and-half years in federal prison. Blair was using his government computer to trade in child rape.110 The Director of the Pentagon’s Defense Security Service, Daniel Payne, verified the “amount of child porn” on government computers at all levels, has a considerable child pornography problem; one that is a serious threat to our personal and national security. Pedophiles have infiltrated government service and cultivated positions of power to protect their crimes and access children. Children are not being protected. Pedophiles are. Too many pedophiles are government employees. This kind of criminal behavior makes employees prime targets for organized criminal networks and foreign espionage operations. A U.S. government employee, trading in child rape, particularly with Russian sources, makes him/herself vulnerable to blackmail maneuvers to leak secure information and other acts designed to undermine the U.S. government.111 This vulnerability to blackmail as well as the opening of government computer networks compromises many aspects of the national security apparatus and all of our personal day-to-day security. In a democratic system, as America is meant to be, oversight and accountability is built into our structure of governance. There is supposed to be legislative, executive and judicial separation of powers and rule of law. The trade in child rape appears to have broken down institutionalized checks and balances. Pedophiles can, and do, easily provide cover to each other from various powerful positions they hold inside and outside of government. Pedophiles are extensive networkers. Networking is one of their defining behaviors. This is not a crime done alone, with no one watching. Pedophiles want the world to watch them rape children. They obsessively video themselves violently abusing children and broadcast these crimes on the Internet. They brag about the crimes Jonathan Adleta was sentenced to two life terms for the sex abuse of his own infant children along with his wife, Sarah Adleta, who was sentenced to 54 years.

They brag about the crimes Jonathan Adleta was sentenced to two life terms for the sex abuse of his own infant children along with his wife, Sarah Adleta, who was sentenced to 54 years. Adleta had made “daddy-daughter sex” part of a pre-nuptial agreement. When they divorced she continued to rape her children on Skype and he distributed this on the Internet. He also raped his girlfriend’s Samantha Bryant’s four-year-old daughter. Bryant participated in and filmed the abuse. Adleta had served two tours with the Marine Corps in Afghanistan. The fact that this is occurring in what appears to be epidemic-scale numbers should outrage and frighten us. Funded research is needed to adequately document the scope of this crime by U.S. government employees so that effective public policy can be created to address this serious national security issue. As journalist Aliya Sternstein, of The Christian Science Monitor, said, “pornographic images of children on government computers present a profound national security risk that if left unresolved could endanger American lives at home and abroad.”112 This is America’s wake-up call. The child rape industry is no longer a Russian, Asian, or Eastern European problem. The illegal trade in child rape is an American problem. Far too many local, state and federal government employees in sensitive positions of trust within our communities and national security structures are involved. Too often these criminals are exposing our most sensitive government computer networks to organized crime as they trade in child rape while at work. This is an acute security problem. The media isn’t reporting on it. Public policy institutes are not focusing on it. Academic researchers are ignoring it. 4.

So many U.S. government employees, often at senior levels, caught trading in Russian sourced child pornography on U.S. government computers ought to raise alarms, particularly given the common knowledge that the line between Russian government agencies and Russian organized crime to non-existent. It is beyond the scope of this book to explore Russia’s new cyber-warfare but it appears child pornography may be a tool underdevelopment in Russia’s arsenal. For more details on Russia’s cyber-ware fare see also: Andy Greenberg, “How An Entire Nation Became Russia’s Test Lab for Cyberwar,” Wired, June 20, 2017, accessed July 15, 2017, https://www.wired. com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine udges and prosecutors are also, of course, government employees; ones with significant power. They can provide justice and uphold the rule of law or cause significant harm to innocent lives through abuse of their position. While prosecutors and judges are supposed to be held accountable, too often oversight is weak or non-existent. More than a few judges and prosecutors have been caught trading in child rape. This creates a fundamental problem for child survivors and those who advocate for them. Pedophiles are deviants prepared to fight for their continued access to children, child rape images/videos and impunity for their crimes. When pedophiles are employed in powerful governmental positions as judges or prosecutors the perversion of justice is substantial. As mentioned in Chapter One, the crime of trading in child rape in America occurs within the context of a broken, sexist and racist justice system dominated by white men.2 This is relevant to the crime because child pornography appears to be overwhelmingly committed by white men. The U.S. Sentencing Commission has documented more than 85 percent of child pornography convictions have been of white men. Since pedophiles are highly networked and help protect each other a criminal justice system dominated and controlled by white men is relevant to a discussion of child pornography prosecution and sentencing.

Although there are federally mandated minimum sentencing guidelines, judges are routinely ignoring these; judges like Jack Weinstein in Brooklyn, New York, who sentenced a father, identified only by his initials R.V., to five days in jail in 2016.5 R.V. had been trading in the rape of children as young as three-years-old. Weinstein issued a 98-page decision denouncing child pornography mandatory minimum sentencing and refusing to comply. He told the New York Times that he “doesn’t believe in ‘destroying lives unnecessarily’ over a crime that harms nobody.”6 Pietro Polizzi, owner of Tony’s Pizzeria, was another pedophile Weinstein attempted to protect. Upon his arrest Polizzi possessed more than 5,000 images of child rape including the rape of toddlers. He was convicted on 23 counts and eventually sentenced to five years in federal prison. Polizzi said “I don’t see Judge Weinstein as a judge… I see him as my father. He helps people. He doesn’t destroy lives the way the prosecutor has. He’s the one who is going to set me free from the court.”7 A pedophile convicted on 23 counts of trading in child rape, including of toddlers, sees a federal judge as his “father” who will set him “free?” As discussed throughout this book, pedophiles network. They know each other. They protect each other. A judge trading in child rape himself is unlikely to sentence another pedophile to jail. A judge networked with other pedophiles is likely to engage in case-rigging and ensure friends who need protection come before his court. Judges also use their position to traffic children – as is happening in family and juvenile courts across the country. Family and juvenile courts expose vulnerable children. A judge occupies the ideal observation point to identify children that can easily be trafficked. home,pursuant to Boeckmann’s desires.The“work”usually consisted of picking up cans either alongside city roads in Wynne,or actually picking up cans at Boeckmann’s residence,wherein Beockmann would photograph the buttocks of the men as they were bending to retrieve the garbage.Multiple male litigants have been photographed by Boeckmann during these “community service”type sentences.

Boeckmann paid attorneys to help him channel vulnerable boys and men into his court. The defendants would then be sentenced to “community service” at Boeckmann’s home while he photographed their body parts and demanded sex. Arkansas’ Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission said that Boeckmann gave “preferential court treatment to ‘young Caucasian male litigants’ that he had sexual relations with.”9 The Kids for Cash scandal in Pennsylvania was not explicitly for trafficking children into sex abuse (although children may have been sexually abused in juvenile detention); however, it is another example of judges trafficking children for money.10 Judges Mark Ciavarella and Michael Conahan organized a racketeering scheme with the builder/owner of for-profit juvenile detention centers. The judges made sure the centers were full and the builder/owner paid the judges. The more children sentenced to juvenile detention, the more money the judges were paid, totaling some $2.6 million before they were caught. Judicial oversight and monitoring in Pennsylvania failed to investigate complaints filed against the judges. The local legal community of lawyers and prosecutors were aware of the trafficking but also failed to alert authorities. Eventually, the FBI and IRS opened investigations resulting in prosecution and sentencing of the judges.11 Pennsylvania judges have also been in the news for trading in graphic adult pornography, encouraging violence against women and exhibiting disturbing racist attitudes. As I have argued, the domination of white, racist, sexist men over our legal system presents a real barrier to efforts to halt America’s child rape epidemic. Pennsylvania’s former Attorney General (AG) Kathleen Kane exposed these attitudes and behaviors that seem rampant in our legal system. As a former child sex abuse prosecutor, Kane ran for the office of Attorney General with the intention of cleaning up the justice system and holding those who harm children to account.

These individuals included current and former OAG agents,a Supreme Court Justice,a Senior Deputy Attorney General in the OAG, high-ranking officials of Commonwealth executive branch agencies,a judicial employee,city When Kane became Pennsylvania’s AG she immediately threatened for tips on Catholic priests who sexual abused children. Calls to the hotline resulted in 250 cases. Kane established a state-wide grand jury to investigate and prosecute pedophiles protected by the Catholic Church. Then she appointed a former federal prosecutor to investigate how the previous governor had interacted with the Penn State child sex abuse investigation involving Jerry Sandusky and former Penn State President Graham Spanier among others. Sandusky and Spanier were convicted in 2012 and 2017 respectively. Sandusky is serving 30-60 years in prison for sexually abusing at least ten boys. Spanier was sentenced, in June 2017, to two months in jail and two months of house arrest on child endangerment charges. Prosecutors said Spanier showed a “stunning lack of remorse” for the victims.12 Kathleen Kane used her position as AG to investigate if attempts had been made to protect Pennsylvania’s powerful white men, rather than children. Kane’s investigation into the Penn State scandal yielded tens of thousands of emails sent among judges, prosecutors, law enforcement and other government employees exposing a dangerous racist and sexist culture. The emails included “loads of pornography littered the exchanges between government officials.… Office-secretary porn. Sarah Palin-photoshopped porn. Hardcore, objects-stuck-in-a-woman’s-every-orifice porn… Fat jokes. Gay jokes. Racist jokes. Domestic-violence jokes. The bulk of which were sent on state computers, on state time, from one state employee to another.”13 The emails were “a spiderweb, stretching out in every possible direction, connecting small-town attorneys to big-name prosecutors to State Supreme Court Justices.”14 Thirteen judges or senior government officials were described as ‘offenders’ with judges, overwhelmingly, being the worst offenders. These thousands of emails evidence a culture of racism and extreme misogyny among “a who’s who of Pennsylvania elite.” One local paper reported, “you may have an easier time figuring out who in the criminal justice community didn’t receive the emails” rather than who did.15 Almost exclusively, white, male judges, prosecutors, law enforcement and senior government employees were trading, at work, images such as: “Blonde Banana Split” with women inserting bananas into orifices; a woman performing oral sex on a white man with the words “making your", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:73:2a8cfcd8bf7e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 253, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 74, "text": "of racism and extreme misogyny among “a who’s who of Pennsylvania elite.” One local paper reported, “you may have an easier time figuring out who in the criminal justice community didn’t receive the emails” rather than who did.15 Almost exclusively, white, male judges, prosecutors, law enforcement and senior government employees were trading, at work, images such as: “Blonde Banana Split” with women inserting bananas into orifices; a woman performing oral sex on a white man with the words “making your boss happy is your only job;” a white man carrying a bucket of fried chicken fending off two African American men with the caption “BRAVERY At Its Finest.”16 Bruce Ledewitz, Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and Law Professor at Duquesne University, said “When you see these emails… it’s just a swamp of misogyny, racism, homophobia and white privilege. It taints everybody, especially in the judicial branch.… You get the impression that every white male office holder in the state is a creep.”17 Kathleen Kane hired a law firm to conduct a full analysis of the emails and release a public report.18 Long before the report was released, Kane held press conferences and released the emails in small batches including more than 1,500 emails sent by a Supreme Court judge. The white men in power hit back hard. Kane was arrested. Her law license was revoked by the very men she was exposing. Eventually she was sentenced in October 2016, to 10-23 months in jail followed by eight years of probation for her “political ego,” convicted on two felony counts of perjury and seven charges of lying and abusing the power of her office. Although two Supreme Court Judges lost their positions, none of the men involved in undermining America’s justice system by displaying blatantly threatening behavior towards women and minorities on government computers were criminally charged. Kane referenced those emails again on Thursday, claiming she delivered this week more than 1,500 emails from a Supreme Court justice to the state Ethics Commission, the Judicial Conduct Board and the Disciplinary Board. “Those emails contained both sent and received emails from a present Supreme Court justice. They contained racial, misogynistic pornography,” Kane claimed without naming the justice. “There’s other emails regarding 30 percent of women are killed or murdered by their husbands or boyfriends and the punchline is ‘well 30 percent of them should have just shut the expletive up.’ “I’m not the woman to shut up. It is my job as attorney general to make sure that this commonwealth is run properly and the people of this commonwealth are protected. The images themselves aren’t the only story.

Her story became a cautionary tale, with white male judges and prosecutors sending a public warning to anyone who might attempt to hold them accountable. She was made an example of what could be done to those who dare to expose corrupt judges and prosecutors. Through it all Kane retained her faith in the rule of law and determination to accomplish what she was elected to do: hold people to account even if they were judges, prosecutors and police. When she was arrested she said: You can arrest me two times, you can arrest me 10 times. I’m sure this isn’t the end of the game, but I will not stop until the truth comes out, and I will not stop until the system operates the way it’s supposed to be.… And what does this mean to the public? … That means that your system, your criminal justice system that you think you have and you think you deserve is not working properly.20 The pattern of behavior Kane exposed of judges and prosecutors re-inforcing and making acceptable violence against women is similar to how pedophiles encourage each other and normalize a cultural of violence against children. This kind of conduct occurring in judges’ chambers and prosecutors’ offices is not limited to Pennsylvania. It is occurring across the country. Judges arrested on child pornography-related charges is, I fear, only the smallest hint of a much larger problem in the judiciary. With arrested judges, I have included cases that attest to overall sexual deviancy, misogynistic and racist behavior that appears to be widespread. It is critical that the American public know how many and which judges have been arrested for trading in child rape. Currently, the Department of Justice is failing to provide America with this information. A longer list of judges is available on my Medium profile. Similar to the demographics of other child pornography arrests, the arrests of judges are almost exclusively of white men. • Steven Vincent Smith, 52-year-old lawyer and substitute judge in Alabama, was arrested March 18, 2016, on four child pornography charges.

In March 2016, Maggio was sentenced, in a separate case, to ten years in prison for accepting a payment for a judgment.26 • Donald Thompson, a 54-year-old Judge in Oklahoma, was convicted and sentenced in August 2006, to four felony counts of indecent exposure in his own courtroom. Thompson was masturbating and using a “penis pump” while presiding over trials. He was seen numerous times by various witnesses. One witness said the judge did this almost daily during a murder trial. An investigation revealed semen on the judge’s chair, robe and carpet as well as a “penis pump” hidden beneath the bench. In 2011, the Oklahoma Supreme Court upheld the decision by the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System Board of Trustees that Thompson was not eligible for his $7, 789 monthly state retirement pay because he had violated his oath of office. Thompson’s pension had been suspended when he was sentenced. Thompson was again arrested in March 2011, for stalking his former girlfriend. While Thompson was not investigated for child pornography, there was certainly probable cause to do so. Thompson is a registered sex offender.27 ProsecutorsThe failure in America to better tackle the crime of trading in child rape is due, in part, to corrupt prosecutors. A prosecutor, perhaps more than any other government employee, can arrange considerable protection for a pedophile. Even if many victims come forward, a prosecutor can choose not to bring charges. This was described, most vividly, in the documentary film The Keepers. In the middle of Baltimore’s network of pedophile priests and police there was a prosecutor who simply refused to prosecute. Law enforcement often express frustration, as depicted in The Keepers, about cases they had spent considerable time and resources on only to be blocked by a prosecutor.28 This is not uncommon. How is this possible? Prosecutorial discretion – the two dirtiest words in the American legal system. In 2014, the New York Times editorial board called prosecutorial misconduct “rampant.”29 Prosecutors are not legally obliged to prosecute crimes. Prosecutors can choose which crimes they prosecute. Stunning, isn’t it? The poor get prosecuted and the rich play golf, drink, sail and party with their favorite local or federal prosecutor, who simply declines to prosecute his/her friend’s crimes.30 In terms of child pornography, this means wealthy business men, priests, lawyers, politicians, judges, lawyers", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:77:6a60a19bbb6d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 257, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 78, "text": "dirtiest words in the American legal system.

Prosecutorial discretion too often provides a green light for powerful pedophiles in America to engage in the child-rape trade. More than a few prosecutors, themselves, have been caught trading in child rapes sometimes on their work computers. For example, at the Department of Justice (DOJ), the agency responsible for protecting America’s children, an Assistant Attorney General (AAG) under former Attorney General Eric Holder was caught trading in child pornography at work. Holder refused to prosecute his own AAG and protected this criminal to the extent that his name was never made public.31 By many accounts, the Department of Justice was transformed, under Eric Holder’s reign, into a revolving door for criminal defense lawyers.32 Defense attorneys, like Holder and his Criminal Division Chief, Lanny Breuer, leave their private practice of protecting the wealthy and do a stint at the Department of Justice (DOJ) where they protect the wealthy from prosecution. Then, after refusing to prosecute the affluent, defense attorneys return to private practice with a new and improved client list of grateful criminals. It is a cozy little arrangement and one that is perverting our justice system in dangerous ways. For example, Breuer, when head of DOJ’s criminal division, is infamous for telling PBS Frontline it was his job to protect criminal bankers from prosecution.33 Breuer, back at the Washington DC law firm of Covington & Burling, along with Holder, now advertises he can help clients with “cybercrime incidents;” a euphemism for child pornography charges. There is a great deal of well-researched material on the corruption of prosecutors, including Matt Taibbi’s The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap and Jesse Eisinger’s The Chickenshit Club: Why the Justice Department Fails to Prosecute Executives. 34 What has not yet been considered is how the perversion of America’s prosecutors relates to child pornography. For example, there is a need to explore how prosecutors handle arrests of fellow lawyers, prosecutors and judges on child pornography charges versus the prosecution of non-lawyers. Many lawyers interact in tight professional and social circles of judges and prosecutors they know from law school or previous private or public practice. A law degree can provide considerable protection for a pedophile. Are pedophiles with a law degree receiving preferential treatment in our justice system? • Patrick Michael Moran, a 39-year-old assistant attorney general (AAG) assigned to the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:78:8b8ec0be1aec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 258, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 79, "text": "explore how prosecutors handle arrests of fellow lawyers, prosecutors and judges on child pornography charges versus the prosecution of non-lawyers.

He pled guilty in April 2017, and was sentenced in May 2017, to ten years in jail with nine of those years suspended followed by five years of supervised release. He must register as a sex offender. Moran was free on $150, 000 bail pending sentencing. He was trading in child rape that included children as young as three-year- old.35 • James Cameron, 51-year-old assistant attorney general (AAG) in Maine, was arrested and indicted on sixteen child pornography charges in 2009. He was sentenced in 2014, to nearly 16 years in jail followed by six years of supervised release.36 Cameron distributed hundreds of child pornography images and videos, including children as young as four, and used “an ever-changing array of account names … frequently posed as a teenage girl.” He also traded in images “depicting patently sadistic conduct.”37 In 2016, he appealed his sentence and lost.38 Cameron had been an assistant attorney general for 18 years and served as Maine’s top drug prosecutor. • Steve Giardini, a 50-year-old assistant district attorney in Mobile County, Alabama, who prosecuted sex crimes, was arrested in August 2010, and charged with enticement and solicitation with the intent to produce child pornography. Refusing a plea deal, his case went to trial and ended in a mistrial. The Attorney General re-submitted the case and a judge, in December 2012, refused to allow the charges to go to trial, claiming there was no “victim.”39 Giardini had been attempting to have sex with a fifteen-year-old, over a fourmonth period, who was in reality an undercover FBI agent. Giardini asked the “girl” to take off her clothes and masturbate.40 He had at least twenty different screen names and false personae which he used to solicit sex and/or nude images from children and, upon his arrest, had hundreds of child sex abuse images/videos. Giardini worked as an assistant DA for 20 years prosecuting sex crime for the Child Advocacy Center and was in charge of handling allegations of sex abuse by the Catholic Church. • George Richard Fox, a 68-year-old prosecutor and part-time municipal judge in St. Louis, Missouri, was arrested, August 2009, on child pornography charges.

Fox had been trading in the rape of infants and toddlers for at least a year and told investigators child pornography did not harm children. He was allowed to resign, rather than being terminated, from his position as a government prosecutor. Fox was disbarred and is a registered sex offender.41 As regarding Count I,the Defendant engaged in oral sex with [NAME REDACTED] (hereinafter the BOY) during a time frame that the BOY was 5 to 7 years of age.The BOY would have been age 5 to 7 during June 1,2011,to January 29,2014． The Defendant had sexual encounters with the BOY for approximately 2 years,and the Defendant indicates the last encounter was in 2013.The sexual encounters included the Defendant performing oral sex upon the BOY,as well as the BOY performing oral sex upon the Defendant. The • Christopher Jansen, a 35-year-old former Walworth County, South Dakota State’s Attorney was arrested in July 2014, on child pornography related charges. He pled guilty in November 2015, to federal charges and was sentenced in federal court in March 2016, to 40 years in jail and sentenced in state court, September 2015, to 50 years in jail. Starting when he was Walworth County State’s Attorney and continuing in his capacity as a family law lawyer, when he left the State’s Attorney office, Jansen sexually abused a five-year-old child of a client he was representing in a family law matter. Jansen spent overnights with the child and his family and sexually abused the boy, over a two-year period, producing and distributing child pornography of the abuse. Jansen used a picture of the boy as an avatar on a child pornography website. In addition to this abuse, Jansen sexually abused two other of his client’s minor children. He had been trading in child rape since college. Jansen was disbarred and must register as a sex offender.42 Lawyers do not necessarily lose their license after child pornography arrests and convictions. For a professional license to be removed a must vote to remove the license. In 2014, the California Overseers of the Bar issued a decision stating that lawyers convicted on child pornography charges will automatically be disbarred. To my knowledge, California is the first state to make this an automatic process. This policy improvement resulted when Gary Douglass Grant, a former Army lawyer, attempted to retain his law license after his child pornography conviction. A judge requested Grant be disbarred but the board of appeals recommended only a two-year suspension.43 The California Supreme", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:80:99b23eefb021", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 260, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 81, "text": "license.

This policy improvement resulted when Gary Douglass Grant, a former Army lawyer, attempted to retain his law license after his child pornography conviction. A judge requested Grant be disbarred but the board of appeals recommended only a two-year suspension.43 The California Supreme Court then ruled, from that point forward, all lawyers convicted of child pornography “charges will automatically be disbarred and prohibited from practicing law in the state…. (because) possessing or sharing sexual images of children necessarily constitutes an act of moral turpitude that makes an attorney unfit for the legal profession.”44 Every state should follow California’s lead and make child pornography convictions cause for automatic disbarment. Perhaps more than any other profession, pedophiles who are lawyers are in the best position to protect themselves and the crimes they commit against children. Many private practice lawyers know colleagues serving as prosecutors or judges. Lawyers cycle in and out of private practice and public service, using time in public service to enrich their private practice. There is no comprehensive data on how many lawyers have been arrested on child pornography related-charges and if arrested lawyers are receiving preferential treatment. If judges and prosecutors are protecting their colleagues, this would be important to the public interest and represents another example of why a child pornography database is needed. • Aaron Biber, a 48-year lawyer and treasurer of the Minnesota State Bar Association, was arrested, December 2009, on child pornography related charges. He pled guilty and was sentenced, October 2010, to 18 years in jail. Biber had groomed, since the child was 11, and raped his 15-year-old son’s friend. Biber sent the child “explicit text messages and pornography” asked the child to “perform sexual acts” and anally raped the child.45 In May 2011, Biber was ordered to pay $15 million, into a trust for the child victim, in punitive damages for assault, battery and emotional distress of the child.46 • Samuel Logan, 46-year-old lawyer in Kansas, was arrested and charged, July 2010, on child pornography charges. He pled guilty May 2011, and was sentenced in September 2011, to ten years in prison. Logan had been a partner at Foulston Siefkin; one of Kansas’ most prestigious law firms. He distributed images/videos of “himself masturbating” in his law office to an undercover agent posing as a fourteen-year-old girl. Logan sent thirty-two images, two of which were child pornography, to the undercover investigator.47 He was arrested when he arrived at the local mall, thinking he was meeting a 14-year-old girl for sex.

Samuel Logan has been disbarred.48 • Joseph Patrick Redd, a 32-year-old lawyer in Baltimore, Maryland, was arrested in 2009, and pled guilty in May 2011, to one count of child pornography possession. He was sentenced September 2011 to two years in jail followed by ten years of supervised release. The local newspaper described anger in the community that Redd was allowed to remain free and with his infant child, pending sentencing, “the delay allowed a suspected child sex offender to remain in a community full of children for more than two years before authorities filed criminal charges… (the neighbors) had seen the man push his baby carriage along the sidewalk and wave.”49 At the time of his arrest, Redd had hundreds of child rape images/videos in his possession. He was a married malpractice attorney and his wife was pregnant at the time of his arrest. Redd was disbarred by consent by the Maryland Attorney Grievance Commission prior to his guilty plea. Redd is a registered sex offender.50 • Leo Flynn, a 62-year-old criminal defense lawyer in South Dakota, was arrested, 2009, on child pornography charges. He was charged with two counts of distribution and one count each of receipt, possession and access with intent to view child pornography. In December 2010, a jury failed to convict Flynn on any charges. Flynn pled not guilty, claiming he had to trade in child rape, weekly, as research to help defend his clients and that trading in child rape was part of his “official duties.” So many of his client-base are sex offenders, Flynn earned the nickname “perv attorney.” In May 2017 Flynn was in the news again as the attorney for Sioux Falls Fire Chief Jim Sideras, who was arrested for trading in pre-teen hard core, the brutal rape and torture of very small children including infants.51 • Christopher G. Young, a 53-year-old prominent lawyer and lobbyist in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was arrested on child pornography charges. He was indicted, 12 May 2016, on two counts. His federal trial is currently scheduled for October 2017. Young had been trading in child rape and bestiality of children under twelveyears-old and donkeys.52 • Joshua Jesse Robert Gessler, a 41-year-old lawyer with Arnold and Porter, one of Washington DC’s most prestigious law firms, and an adjunct professor at George Mason University, was arrested twice in August and September 2010, on child pornography charges.

He was indicted on ten child pornography counts. He pled guilty and was sentenced in May 2011, to three months in jail followed by two years of supervised release. Gessler had been preying upon and paying a 15-year-old run-away girl for sex. He also recorded and distributed the child sex abuse he produced of these encounters.53 Gessler lost his Virginia and Pennsylvania law licenses. He is a registered sex offender.54 As JD Journal, a popular legal magazine, writes, “sometimes it’s fellow lawyers that harbor a dark secret or defend pedophile behavior.”55 Out tors represent, perhaps, the most dangerous to the fabric of our democracy and rule of law. Are there more arrests of government-employed pedophiles among judges and prosecutors than among law enforcement and military? We do not know because there is no database. Are prosecutors and judges giving preferential treatment on child pornography sentencing to their legal colleagues? Again, absent the data, we do not know. The American public has a right to know how many lawyers, judges and prosecutors have been arrested for this crime. The data must be gathered. Of course, the criminals caught represent only a fraction of the population engaged in the crime. As with other professional categories, enhanced oversight is needed of all judges and prosecutors’ workplace electronic devices and networks. Robust monitoring of the electronic networks of all DA and AG offices should be instituted. Because judges and prosecutors wield great, and too often unchecked, power in the communities in which they serve, such monitoring cannot be left in the hands of local law enforcement, given the conflicts of interest and the difficulty local level law enforcement often have investigating judges and prosecutors. A federal law enforcement agency, perhaps the U.S. Postal inspectors, could be mandated to provide routine monitoring of prosecution and judicial offices across the country. 1.

Most state and local level government employees, 48% and 55% respectively, work in the public education sector.1 How many government employees in our public schools and universities have been arrested on child pornography related charges? No one knows because our government is not maintaining a public record. Who holds government employees accountable, particularly when to have, citizens, journalists and intellectual leaders are supposed to hold government to account. Institutes of higher education were conceived to mentor the next generation of leaders and create knowledge on issues of importance to society. Intellectuals, primarily academics with tenured positions, are intended to be our nation’s brain-trust; conducting difficult and controversial research that enables future generations to enjoy a better quality of life. As described throughout the book, our government is failing to gather data on this epidemic. Academic research centers, public policy institutes and investigative journalism programs are also failing to document America’s trade in child rape. Detailed data is needed to implement public policies that will halt the crime. In the absence of good governance, America’s intellectual leadership should be invested in making our democracy work to protect our most vulnerable citizens: our children. Yet, higher education institutions, where knowledge on critical social issues is generated, have been almost totally silent. Higher education may be failing on this issue due to the number of professors and staff themselves engaged in this crime. No one knows how many in higher education are participating in America’s child pornography epidemic. Based on my research, it appears extensive. From University of Virginia’s assistant dean, Michael Morris downloading the anal rape of infants, to Kirk Nesset, Allegheny College professor with over 500,000 videos/images including folders called “kidsfuck,” far too many in higher education, both public and private, seem to be in involved. Every time an image or video of a child being raped is shared, that child is trafficked again. This kind of child trafficking is occurring on college and university campuses across America. When pedophiles are in significant positions of power, as they appear to be in higher education, the ability to build a knowledge-base on the crime is hampered. If a university president claims to have a child pornography collection in his office that he masturbates to, would this president support efforts by his faculty to document the scope and damage of the crime? If a university dean is trading in a 6-year-old child sexually abused while held at knife point, would this dean support professors,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:86:ce8eed49e486", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 266, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "significant positions of power, as they appear to be in higher education, the ability to build a knowledge-base on the crime is hampered.

If a university dean is trading in a 6-year-old child sexually abused while held at knife point, would this dean support professors, under his supervision, to build a database on this crime? In both cases, not likely. Those engaged in the crime, most often white male campus leaders, are often in positions of power that allow them to create barriers and chilling environments for other academics who may attempt to document America’s trade in child rape. Over the past few years I have been monitoring reports of professors and staff, in the public and private sector, arrested on child pornography related charges. My research posted on Medium profiles nearly 100 cases and is far from comprehensive. Pedophiles often tell investigators that they have been trading in child rape and molesting children for years. Those who are arrested are frequently caught by chance rather than systematic monitoring of institutional networks. If higher education pro-actively scrutinized their electronic networks, many more arrests would occur. As with other professional categories the pattern appears to be consistent in the education sector – white men in leadership positions often trading in infant and toddler rape. Christopher DeZutter’s Criminal Complaint • Christopher DeZutter, a chemistry professor at the University of Minnesota, was arrested in September 2016, for the second time on four new counts of child pornography possession. He was sentenced February 2016, to four years in jail. DeZutter was first arrested in February 2015, and charged with ten possession and one distribution child pornography counts. Despite the volume and type of child rape and torture, including infant rape, DeZutter was trading in, he was sentenced September 2015, to only 4 months in jail with five years of probation. He was free, for the first conviction, on conditional release, without monetary surety, until his sentencing.2 • Mark Ranzenberger, a 61-year-old professor of journalism at Central Michigan University (CMU), was arrested and charged May 2016, and pled guilty September 2016, to one federal count of child pornography possession and four (of which three were dropped in a plea deal) state counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for repeatedly raping a girl younger than 13 over a 7-year period. On January 19, 2017, Ranzenberger was sentenced in federal court to 14 years in prison followed by 5 years of supervised release. On January 26, 2017, he was sentenced to 14 to 45 years in prison in Michigan’s Isabella County Court to be served concurrently with his federal sentencing.

On January 26, 2017, he was sentenced to 14 to 45 years in prison in Michigan’s Isabella County Court to be served concurrently with his federal sentencing. Ranzenberger was caught when he mistakenly showed child pornography to his students. A student reported the crime, triggering university police to open an investigation. At the time of his arrest, Ranzenberger was in possession of over 1,000 images/videos of child sex abuse, including the rape of infants. He also had a “grooming” document instructing pedophiles how to manipulate children from birth to age 11 “to participate in sexual acts.” The girl whom Ranzenberger raped for years, testified at his sentencing calling him a “psychopath, monster.” She said “He’s smooth, charming, and manipulative.… He was able to hide the monster he was in every word he spoke. His coworkers and family didn’t know he was a child molester.” The victim described Ranzenberger as “a slug of man” and “a pathological liar.”3 • Justin Carroll, 67-year-old Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and interim athletic director at Washington University, was indicted January 30, 2017, on one federal charge of access with intent to view child pornography. Carroll had been using university computers to trade in child rape with the handle “MOperv.” His twitter account was @WashUDeanoFun. Carroll was trading in the rape and torture of boys between three and six. He had videos of children as young as three years old forced to handle adult erect penises and subjected to anal rape. One video was called “boybending,” a how-to guide for child sex abuse and grooming, “the art of remotely directing a boy on webcam, through typing text and displaying videos, to achieve a desired pose or behavior.” Carroll submitted his resignation after his arrest. He had been at the university for 36 years.4 • Michael Morris, a 50-year-old Assistant Dean at University of Virginia (UVA) and father of two teenage daughters, was arrested and charged November 2013. Morris was an “ultimate” member of Gigatribe a peer-to-peer (P2P) program he used to trade preteen hard core (PTHC), the brutal torture of young children. His online name was “funshooter2006.” At the time of his arrest he had over 4,000 images/videos of child sex abuse including of toddlers. Morris pled guilty in April 2014, and was sentenced in July 2014, to 8.8 years in federal jail and 20 years of supervised release.

In the few months he was under investigation, Morris accessed over 192 times child rape videos/images from home and office computers. UVA suspended Morris pending investigation and he was later allowed to resign.5 Unfortunately, educators engaged in the trade in child rape are not limited to higher education. Among public and private primary and secondary many arrests and prosecutions have occurred because the U.S. government is failing to maintain a database. Dr. Charol Shakeshaft, the leading expert on sex abuse by educators, estimated in 2006, “the physical sexual abuse of students in schools is likely more than 100 times the abuse by priests.”6 A report by the Association of University Women, in 2000, estimated one in ten children are sexually abused by teachers and/or staff.7 The Department of Education reported, in 2002, that six to ten percent of all public school students have been sexually abused by a teacher or staff.8 A 2004 report, “Educator Sexual Misconduct: A Synthesis of Existing Literature,” details a staggering number of teachers arrested for child sex abuse. In 2014 the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report detailing how public schools are failing to protect children from sex abuse by staff and teachers.9 In 2016, The Boston Globe’s Spotlight team released, “Private Schools, Painful Secrets,” detailing sex abuse in New England’s private schools.10 In 2016, USA Today released a year-long investigation into child sex abuse and child pornography among teachers. Journalists obtained and analyzed “millions of teachers’ records from all 50 states, pored over documents in state buildings, schoolhouses and police stations.”11 In total USA Today compiled 10 million individual records. The resulting series of publications, including, “Teachers who sexually abuse students still find classroom jobs,” details how teachers are often “let go from one school, with school administrators failing to report that teacher to law enforcement, and the teacher is employed around children, elsewhere, going on to harm more children and continue committing more crimes.”12 Similar to an attitude pervasive in higher education there is a widespread practice in primary and secondary schools that “the institution” should be protected not the children. Predators are provided “a graceful exit” and passed along to “become someone else’s problem.” flaunting red flag behavior are not reported to police; their computers and electronic devices are not searched for child pornography. Although child sex abuse and the production of child pornography are almost always synonymous, teachers caught sexually abusing children are not routinely investigated for child", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:89:a8a2e3897b70", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 269, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 90, "text": "higher education there is a widespread practice in primary and secondary schools that “the institution” should be protected not the children.

Although child sex abuse and the production of child pornography are almost always synonymous, teachers caught sexually abusing children are not routinely investigated for child pornography. This hampers investigations and prosecutions, as critical electronic evidence of the child sex abuse is absent. USA Today’s investigation also describes how the federal ban, passed in December 2015, on secrecy deals, called “passing the trash,” is routinely ignored. In secrecy deals sexual crimes and inappropriate behavior are hidden, teachers are given “hush money” and asked to quietly leave and find work in another school. In the rare cases when teachers are re- ported, and their teaching credentials revoked, many are still re-employed elsewhere. Similar to the national law enforcement decertification database, the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification is voluntary and does not include information on why the teacher was decertified. In one case, a school in Louisiana hired a registered sex offender. The students discovered this through a simple online search. Consistent with the pattern of pedophile arrests in America, many primary and secondary educators arrested are white men in leadership positions; principals, vice principals, school board members and union representatives. Type into a Google or Twitter search “principal” or “school board” and “child pornography” and see how many have been arrested. Both the number of arrests in policy-making positions as well as the type of child rape, very often infant and toddler, demands attention. A longer list of primary and secondary school educators arrested on child pornography related charges is located on my Medium account. • Donald Clippinger, a Vice Principal at Fienberg-Fisher K-8 Center in Miami, Florida, was arrested January 31, 2017. He pled guilty and was sentenced in July 2017, to nearly five years in jail followed by 25 years of supervised release. Clippinger was trading in pre-teen hard core (PTHC) the brutal rape and torture of very small children. Some of his files were called “diaz 2010-pthc baby raaamat $1 0 . \\mathrm { m p 4 } , \\stackrel { \\ r { v } } { }$ indicating baby-rape. His online name was “666prv.” Prv is short for pervert, a term pedophiles, apparently proudly, call themselves. In pedophile chats he also called himself a “pedo,” short for pedophile. Clippinger live-streamed video of himself masturbating to child rape. He had been trading in child rape for at least four years and was employed at Miami-Dade County Public Schools for 23 years.13 • James Uphoff, a 76-year-old Ohio Education Association Union President and Oakwood, Ohio School Board President, was", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:90:749aa37a25ec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 270, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 91, "text": "indicating baby-rape.

In October 2013, Uphoff pled guilty and was sentenced in September 2014, to 1.2 years in federal prison. He had been trading in child sex abuse for at least a decade. While on bail Uphoff was caught, again, with child pornography. No additional charges were brought. During his first arrest investigators found hundreds of images and videos including children in bondage. Uphoff was caught when he left child pornography on a university printer/copier which was discovered and reported to university police. This triggered a search of Uphoff ’s university computer. Uphoff had cultivated a reputation as a leading expert on early childhood education. He was a retired early childhood education professor from Wright State University and also volunteered for the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) of Montgomery County Juvenile Court.14 • Timothy Dorway, a 44-year-old Principal at Chanhassen High School in Chanhassen, Minnesota, was arrested in December 2016, on 17 child pornography charges. Dorway had been trading in child rape from his work computer. He told investigators his “primary interest” is the sexual abuse of children aged 11-13 years old. He had been trading in child rape for at least the past decade. The school district terminated Dorway after his arrest.15 • Ricky Delano Sheppard, a 59-year-old Principal at Spessard Holland Elementary School in Florida, was arrested in June 2016. He pled guilty in August 2016, and was sentenced in December 2016, to 6.5 years in jail followed by ten years of supervised release. Investigators found more than a thousand images/video of child rape, including children being bound, in Sheppard’s possession. Sheppard had been given a reprimand in 1999, when he was a teacher at Gemini Elementary School for “inappropriate professional behavior and poor judgment’’ related to his conduct with a 6-year-old boy in his classroom. He had been giving “excessive gifts” to the child and discussed “taking students home” with him. Sheppard was employed with Brevard Public Schools since 1981. He is now a registered sex offender.16 • Phillip Heiney, a 67-year-old President of the Dunellen Board of Education in Middlesex County, New Jersey, was arrested in August 2016.

Goodlett has been free, pending sentencing, on a $25, 000 unsecured bond for the federal charges and $75, 000 bond for the state charges. He is scheduled to enter a guilty plea in the federal charges and the State charges are set for trial on October 23, 2017. Goodlett would confiscate students’ cell phones with the intention of obtaining nude photographs that he traded online. One 15-year-old student’s nude photographs were on her cellphone which Goodlett confiscated. He uploaded these images to a Russia-based child pornography website.

Goodlett is a married father of three children.18 • Warren Nelson Anderson, a 55-year-old principal at Sterling Education School’s Pembina Campus (managed by the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church) in St. Vincent, Minnesota, was arrested in March 2017, and charged on ten child pornography related counts. At the time of his arrest he had over 3,000 images/videos of children as young as five being abused. He told investigators he had been trading in child rape for ten years. Anderson had previously worked at international schools in Albania and Pakistan and was a Boy Scout leader for 23 years. In 1987, he received a Congressional Award Gold Medal for his work with youth. Anderson is under electronic surveillance pending his next court date set for August 28, 2017.19 • Michael Scott Hatfield, a 58-year-old middle school teacher at American Preparatory Academy in West Valley City, Utah, was arrested in April 2017, on seven felony counts of sexual exploitation of a minor and three misdemeanor counts of accessing pornographic material on school property.

Pedophiles are able to rape children for decades because many in the community protect the pedophile and not the children. Of all the complex issues related to child-trafficking rings and criminal conspiracies, Spotlight highlighted one of the most important. Pedophiles target vulnerable children. Vulnerable children make the perfect victim; offering easy access over many years and, often, total impunity. Pedophiles know few adults will choose to protect a child if that entails challenging a powerful predator. Pedophiles know that most people are cowards. They count on it. The Catholic priests in Boston, as the film depicts, went after poor children, children who had lost their parents, children struggling with identity issues; children vulnerable in all the ways humans can be vulnerable. This is standard operating procedure for pedophiles. Child rapists are always on the hunt for defenseless children; pre-verbal children like newborns, infants and toddlers, foster children trapped in a broken system, sick children in cancer-wards, minority children, single-parent children in after-school programs and special-needs children. Those least able to protect themselves are the highest risk for rape. Pedophiles wait, watch and prey on the most vulnerable. Always. Special-needs children, in particular, are easy and ideal prey for pedophiles. Why? Because special-needs children make terrible witnesses. A Down’s Syndrome child is unlikely to be a witness that prosecutors consider “credible.” No credible witness, no crime. No crime, no prosecution. When I started researching child pornography arrests I was horrified to see report after report of special education teachers and care-providers. Because the Department of Justice is not maintaining comprehensive statistics on child pornography arrests, no one knows how many special education teachers and caregivers have been arrested. There appear to be many. Pedophiles are documented, as of 2016, to be strategically targeting special-needs children. The UN reported a key development in child sex trafficking networks is an increasing trend of adopting of “children with special needs” with the intention of trafficking these children. The UN reports “illicit practices in this context mostly concern cases of intercountry adoptions in which States prioritize the adoption of children because they do not have appropriate childcare policies. Moreover, there have been cases of false documentation being used to classify children as Peter Flynn, a 61-year-old special", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:93:a3726e1347c4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 273, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 94, "text": "special-needs children.

He pled guilty and was sentenced in November 2015, to nearly four years in prison. Flynn had some 30,000 child rape images/ videos including bondage and violence against young children. He had worked at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School since 1978. A longer list of special education teachers arrested for this crime is located on my Medium profile. As with other professional categories profiled in this book, almost all of the special education teachers arrested have been white men. These arrests do not represent one-off cases of individual special education teachers. This crime is not about “sexual attraction” to certain children. As discussed, throughout this book, pedophiles are highly networked and strategize about child rape in teams online. They cultivate positions of power and access to children. They share the children they have access to. Special-needs children are being tactically pursued by pedophiles. 13．While continuing his forensic examination, CFA Chace found a short essay on McGlothlin's laptop computer in which McGlothlin graphically relives the sexual abuse of the infant depicted in the video described above.McGlothin finishes the essay by expressng his desire to escalate the sexual abuse of the infant, observing,“[s]he is using more words so my window is closing fast.” James McGlothlin’s Criminal Complain • James McGlothlin, a 39-year-old physical education instructional assistant for disabled children with the Oregon City School District in Portland, Oregon, was arrested on February 19, 2016. As of July 2017, his trial was set for September 12, 2017. McGlothlin was trading images of child rape including infants and had raped a disable child in his care during swimming lessons. He made plans to baby-sit children with the intention of drugging and raping them and had photos of children who were relatives or children of friends, children’s underwear and “sexually explicit videos of a baby girl and a man believed to be McGlothlin.” He admitted he had already raped a friend’s two-year-old daughter while baby-sitting the child. McGlothin was married and lived with his wife and their two-year-old son.23 • Bruce Omlor, a 49-year-old special education teacher with Riverside Elementary School in Toledo, Ohio, was indicted in December 2012, on one count each of child pornography receipt, distribution, and possession.

Yoder was part of a “significant ring of human traffickers and child pornographers” targeting young boys. Prosecutors said Yoder “provided a ‘safe haven’ for pedophiles.” A registered foster parent, with two adopted sons, Yoder used his sons as bait to lure other children including at least one special-needs child. Yoder posted more than 10,000 times on a “boy lover” website where he was a member. He was held in lieu of $1 million bail. From jail Yoder attempted to have a witness murdered for $8, 000 . Prior to his arrest, Child Protective Services (CPS) had received a tip that Yoder was raping children and had child pornography. CPS took no action. Yoder previously worked as a special education assistant in Fairfax County, Virginia from 2005 to 2007.25 • Timothy Cheatwood, a 44-year-old, foster care worker in Oklahoma who cared for Christian special-needs children in Health and Human Services custody, was arrested in September 2015, on two counts of aggravated possession of child pornography, manufacturing child pornography, distributing child pornography and violating Oklahoma’s Computer Crimes Act. Cheatwood’s sentencing is currently scheduled for September 18, 2017. At least one local child victim was identified. One of the files in Cheatwood’s possession was titled “7yo Blond Boy Play With Dady (with sound).” Cheatwood worked for the Bair Foundation, an organization contracted by Health and Human Services.

Michaud had been using a site called Playpen and trading in video/images of “child rape and some images that showed infants being raped.” At his indictment hearing in January 2016, Michaud entered a not guilty plea and in March 2017, federal prosecutors were forced to drop charges after a judge ordered federal investigators must disclose the “network in- Michaud’s case represents the importance of FBI investigators taking over websites, like Playpen, and gathering all the IP addresses of those trading in child rape. Judges across the country affirmed the federal search warrant was valid and sentenced many caught in Playpen. In May 2017, the creator and administrator of Playpen, Steven Chase, a 58-year-old man in Naples, Florida, was sentence to 30 years in prison followed by a lifetime of supervised release. The FBI’s critical work obtaining all the IP addresses using Playpen, rather than only arresting the site owner, resulted, so far, in the arrests of 350 pedophiles in America and 548 international arrests.28 If similar investigations were conducted on every child pornography website hosted in the US, we could shut down America’s trade in child rape. That a judge protected Michaud, claiming the warrant was not valid, means a dangerous child predator has been set free. As described in Chapter Six of this book on the legal profession, too many judges are protecting pedophiles and, it appears, participating in the crime itself. The Michaud case is an example where law enforcement worked long, difficult hours to investigate and arrest a child predator only to have a judge provide impunity. Michaud is now free to become a special education teacher in another state. Perhaps, he will be arrested again, as so many pedophiles are, and will finally be held to justice for the crimes he has committed against children.

Preschools and day cares are magnets for pedophiles. In some cases, day cares are established as a mechanism for unfettered access to children with the intention of producing and distributing child pornography. Infant and toddler rape is considered high-value in online pedophile networks. As discussed in previous chapters, children under four-yearsold are targets because they do not make credible witnesses. Children under two-years-old are considered pre-verbal and, often, cannot explain what has happened to them. Day care and pre-school children are at real risk of being abused by teachers and caregivers, often without the parents ever knowing. $12, 000 ), was arrested July 24, 2012 for “one of the largest” child pornography collections in America. Moe pled guilty May 30, 2013, and was sentenced, September 2013, to eight years in prison. Investigators estimated he possessed six terabytes of child sex abuse files and had been trading in child rape for at least a decade. Just one, of more than 500CDs , included 4,100 videos/images of child sex abuse including pre-teen hard core; the torture of small children. At the time of his arrest, he had some 800,000 images and 13,000 videos of child sex abuse. In 2001, parents reported their 3-year-old daughter, enrolled at the preschool, said that Moe had touched her vagina. No action was taken against Moe by the school, child protection or law enforcement. Moe had been a respected teacher at Paddington for 18 years.29 • Carl McBride, a 48-year-old man who lived at a home-based day care, Little Tykes Day Care, in Claymont, Delaware was arrested on November 5, 2013, on child pornography charges. He pled guilty in September 2015, and was sentenced to ten years in jail followed by ten years of supervised release. McBride was distributing pre-teen hard core, child porn from the day care. Investigators “seized a laptop computer found next to a diaper-changing table in a room used for daycare services” and found “hundreds of images and movies of child pornography depicting prepubescent females engaged in sex acts.

Unbeknownst to his ex-wife, Rabes was sexually abusing children, as young as 4-years-old, at the day care and filming and distributing the abuse. In September 2007, Rabes was also sentenced to an additional 34 years in state prison on related charges. Upon his arrest, Rabes had more than 30,000 child sex abuse images and/or videos. The military refused to confirm if Rabes had used military computers.

He pled guilty on January 28, 2013, and was sentenced May 24, 2013, to 14 years in jail. His arrest was part of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s Project Spade. Manring produced child pornography from 1996 to 1999, by sexually abusing the children in his care as a pre-school teacher at Remei Hoikuen School in Japan. Manring was caught when he returned from Japan with at least eight DVDs documenting the rape and sexual abuse of the pre-school children. In America Manring taught music lessons in his home and at local music stores and organized “a rock band geared toward offering extra encouragement to special-needs children.”32 Both the volume and type of crime should raise alarm bells across edu-Education communities, institutes and associations are not taking necessary preventative measures to stop child sex trafficking among their ranks. Instead, institutions with an arrest typically attempt to minimize media exposure rather than focus on protecting children and holding perpetrator accountable. This short-sighted response of “protect the institution” is collective denial that enables protection of criminals and not children – much like the ill-advised strategy the Catholic Church has adopted. Denial and inaction by America’s educators to prevent this crime in our schools is turning educational institutions into organizations harboring criminals of the worst kind; those who prey on children.

Shouldn’t we insist our schools become verified child-pornography-free institutions? Education organizations, from day cares to universities, could and should require all employees sign Codes of Conduct including consent agreements for monitoring work-based networks and electronics. As a matter of standard practice, child pornography blocking and reporting software should be installed. Law enforcement, like the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Forces, should be invited to search institutional networks, on a regular and random basis, for child pornography. Educational institutions could work with organizations like the Anti-Predator Project, Christopher Hadnagy of Social-Engineer.com, the Child Rescue Coalition or NetClean to certify their networks are child-pornography-free. Pedophiles seek out professions that place them in positions of authority and trust over children. They cultivate leadership positions within institutions that allow them to perpetrate their crime and silence those who attempt to expose the crime and protect children. No pedophile should ever be employed at any institution of education and care for our children, let alone as a government employee at public schools. It is time parents, educational institutions and care-providers started taking pro-active measures to protect our children, particularly our most vulnerable. 1.

It is my hope a donor and an institution may provide support to make a national child pornography arrest database possible. I struggle to forget what I now know. But there is no erase function to knowledge of this crime. Once you know, you cannot “unknow.” I wish I could. I wish I knew nothing about how many seemingly “respectable” men are raping infants and toddlers and trading in this with enthusiasm, calling it “hot” and expressing pleasure and excitement at what can only be described as revolting evil. I cannot imagine how difficult it must be for investigators and prosecutors to view the videos and images and bear witness to the brutal torture and rape of so many children. Then, I think of the children. I cannot image how children are surviving the horror being inflicted upon them. I realize that so many children do not survive. Interacting with this crime is incredibly destructive. The trauma from exposure to the malevolence is tremendous. There is no way to fight this crime, and defend our children, without it taking an indelible toll on the psyche and personal lives of those who dare to confront it. Most people are not prepared to battle this inexplicable evil. The few who are, cannot do it for long. Dedicated law enforcement officers and prosecutors, responsible for putting those who trade in child rape behind bars, often leave child exploitation units, requesting transfers to crimes psychologically easier to tackle, explaining they need to protect themselves and their own families. Investigators and prosecutors battling this crime need our support and gratitude. Without them there would be no arrests, no prosecutions and total impunity for pedophiles. I would have preferred not to have known about this crime, but I was not given that choice. Like many mothers I was totally unaware of this epidemic and how many fathers are engaged in it until it touched my family. This research is dedicated to survivors of sexual abuse, America’s children and the adults who love and protect them. I’ve written this book so children, and those who protect them, are verified.

End the silence that is destroying a generation of American children. n the past decade, or so, since broadband Internet, public Wi-Fi and I inexpensive smart-phones with cameras and video recorders all became widely available in America, the trade in child rape exploded. We were not prepared. Law enforcement and prosecutors were, for the most part, blind-sided. This epidemic exploded into an American criminal justice system that is broken, racist, sexist and favors the wealthy while preying on the poor. Since most pedophiles arrested in America appear to be white men in leadership positions, the weaknesses in our criminal justice system favor the pedophiles. While there are many noble prosecutors and investigators who have dedicated their lives to justice, they are extremely overworked and critically under-resourced. Pedophiles have better technical skills, more advanced electronic equipment and more expensive software. At every point, from the way our criminal justice system is organized, to the flaws in it, to the lack of substantial financial resources and staff to tackle this crime, pedophiles are in a vastly superior position to those seeking to protect our children. The offense also defies the way our legal system is organized. Because child pornography explodes all over the world the instant the rape of a child is posted online, the criminality does not occur in a single physical location. The idea of boundaries, based on lines on a map, makes no sense when the server distributing child rape may be based in Australia – and thousands of IP addresses all over America are trading through that location. Unfortunately, law enforcement and prosecutors are still bound by traditional geo-political jurisdictions, although this is starting to change. To halt the global epidemic, child pornography cases demand creative investigative and legal solutions. For example, if the political will were generated, child pornography kingpins could be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. The jurisdiction is the Internet. We must police and prosecute the Internet as if it were its own physical location. Canadian investigators are doing some of the most innovative investigations by “going after companies that host the online files and profit from the data sharing.”2 In other words, Canadians are shutting down the servers hosting child rape. Journalist Bruce Campion-Smith details this new practice and quotes Deputy Commissioner Scott Tod, who says, “rather than the peer-to-peer, one-to-one, we now want to look at … how do corporations actually", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:102:ce9049a6a735", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 282, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 103, "text": "and prosecute the Internet as if it were its own physical location.

Martino is graduate of Columbia and Princeton Universities; his medical residency was completed at Brown University. Haven’t American investigators, like the Canadians, been shutting down the servers? Surprisingly, no. As detailed in Chapter One, half of the world’s servers hosting child pornography were, until 2016, located in the United States. Why are these servers allowed to proliferate? Why hasn’t U.S. law enforcement shut them down? Rather than cutting off the trade in child rape at the source, standard operating procedure in American investigations has been trolling online venues, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, posing as a pedophile and catching criminals one by one. Imagine throwing your hand into an Alaskan spring salmon run, mid-stream, and pulling out whatever you catch. Not a very effective strategy. So dense is the trade in child rape, the flow so rapid and the volume so large, pedophiles know chances of being caught are small so long as law enforcement continues this hand-fished method. America must change procedures. Our top priority should be shutting down servers that host, store and distribute child rape. The owners and all the users, every single IP address, must be prosecuted. The trade in child rape must be cut off at the source. Additionally, child pornography investigations must become more focused on known supply-side sources to which pedophiles flock. Wherever there are children, particularly vulnerable children, pedophiles are in business. For example, the amount of arrests related to day cares, preschools, baby-sitters and special education teachers is significant enough for investigators to obtain search warrants to randomly search institutionally affiliated IP addresses. State licensing agencies should require a Code of Conduct and consent for random electronic searches as a component of granting a license to day cares and to all teachers. Likewise, all government employees, particularly those working in child protection units, should sign a Code of Conduct agree- Charles Church, a 41-year-old Marine veteran and Richmond, Virginia Police Officer who once received commendation", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:103:07b7091e683f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 283, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 104, "text": "education teachers is significant enough for investigators to obtain search warrants to randomly search institutionally affiliated IP addresses.

The young girl, “just tall enough to peer over the witness box,” testified. She was raped and sodomized. Church’s DNA was found in her Barbie underwear. Church told the girl if she told anyone “one of them would die.” Pedophiles who have infiltrated our government agencies know there is almost no institutional oversight. They are aware they can abuse their positions of power to commit this crime with little chance of getting caught. Pedophiles understand how, across the board, systems of monitoring and accountability in America are flimsy or non-existent from schools, to police departments to our most elite federal law enforcement agencies. Pedophiles realize a little bit of cash or the threat of a lawsuit can easily make people look the other way. Few have the courage to challenge those who trade in child rape, in part because most people find the crime so repulsive they either do not believe “that nice man” would “ever hurt a child” or they fear harm done to themselves or their children if they oppose the pedophile in public and demand justice. Who do you call for help when you discover your police chief is trading in child rape? How do you leave your child at school after learning a popular kindergarten teacher has been raping children for decades and been quietly protected and passed along from one school to the next? What security do you have when you learn the FBI agent based in your town was raping a ten-year-old girl for years and will only spend six months in the county jail? How does the average citizen even begin to challenge a pedophile who happens to be a judge, prosecutor or police chief? Especially when so many of these pedophiles in powerful positions protect each other. The answer is greater public awareness. Strength in numbers. Decent adults who care about protecting children vastly outnumber those who harm children. But we have become the silent majority. We must gather and make the data public. We must study, investigate and prosecute the crime. We must support and fund those willing to face this crime and dedicate their lives to researching, investigating and prosecuting individuals who trade in child rape. reater public awareness depends on comprehensive reporting.

In the Gintroduction to this book, I explained how a grassroots movement, using the hashtag #PedoGate on Twitter, took my research viral. This happened, in part, because various media personalities were claiming people trying to expose America’s child rape epidemic were producing “fake” news. To be dismissed with such callousness by journalists who are supposed to be asking the tough questions and exposing the corruption, felt like betrayal and made people angry. When activists discovered my research, they shared it widely saying things like, “this is not ‘fake.’ This is real. Look at all these arrests.” My research validated America’s child rape crisis, often committed by government employees, is real. It is not ‘fake’ news, as some journalists have claimed. Journalists are meant to expose government employees who use the system to benefit themselves and fail to act in the public service. This kind of reporting provides awareness and leverage to citizens and intellectual leaders to advocate and demand accountability. These past years, as the trade in child rape exploded, journalism, as a profession, has been in a free-fall. Media outlets are struggling to survive. There is a sense of frustration, expressed by the American public, with mainstream media. More people are engaging in “citizen-journalism” believing professional journalism is worthless. Those who earn their living as journalists, by and large, are rejecting the idea that they have failed the public. Yet, circulation numbers and profit-loss tell a different story. At a time when journalists are searching for ways to have a meaningful and relevant impact on people’s lives, the child pornography epidemic has been largely ignored. There are a few journalists doing valuable reporting on this crime. Their work has been featured throughout this book. Steve Reilly and his team at USA Today have done ground-breaking reporting on child sex abuse in public schools. Richard Lardner and Eileen Sullivan of the Associated Press (AP) have done incredible reporting on child sex abuse within the military.4 Likewise, Matt Sedensky and Nomaan Merchant, also with AP, published comprehensive reporting on sexual misconduct by law enforcement.5 Levi Pulkkinen, with the Seattle PI, in Washington state, has been covering this crime in-depth for years now. His work is outstanding.6 Lex Talamo, a young journalist with the Shreveport Times in Louisiana, just published an excellent series called The Sinister Web, examining various elements of the crime.7 Aliya Sternstein, of The Christian Science Monitor, conducted an important investigation into child pornography", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:105:c6f289c2026b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 285, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 106, "text": "Likewise, Matt Sedensky and Nomaan Merchant, also with AP, published comprehensive reporting on sexual misconduct by law enforcement.5 Levi Pulkkinen, with the Seattle PI, in Washington state, has been covering this crime in-depth for years now.

We need more journalists better engaged, conducting more in-depth reporting of this epidemic. Crime-beat reporters in our communities should obtain and report on information in the criminal complaints when describing child pornography arrests. Reporting a man had 30,000 images and videos of child sex abuse is meaningless. Only pedophiles, and those investigating them, have any idea what that means. In contrast, reporting the university dean was masturbating to a child held in a dog cage being raped at knife point, or an Army prosecutor was raping infants who were bound and gagged, provides an understanding the American public needs to comprehend about what is happening to our children. For example, consider Andrew Cheever’s arrest. Journalists reported that a 33-year-old TSA agent in Boston was arrested on September 1, 2011, on child pornography charges and sentenced, in 2012, to nearly three-and-half-a-years in prison. Media reports said Cheever had more than 2,000 images/videos of child sex abuse. There were no links to his criminal complaint and no descriptions of what “child pornography” Cheever was trading. A section from Cheever’s criminal complaint is included above. “Premature Sexual 2yo pedo 1yo 3yo 4yo.” Yo is short for year. 1, 2, 3 and 4 refers to the ages of the children being raped in the video. “Premature sexual,” refers to infant and toddler rape. The video describes a man saying, “good baby” as he rapes an infant crying in pain. We need journalists to accurately report on this crime. The public needs to be aware of precisely what pedophiles are doing to our children. As detailed in Chapter Three, on infant and toddler rape, the public must understand how many men, and some women, are being arrested for trading in the rape of very small children. Journalists are, largely, failing to report the details and the context of America’s trade in child rape. We depend upon journalists to provide accurate reporting of issues that affect our towns, communities and country. Without wide-spread public understanding of the videos and images pedophiles are producing and sharing, America has little hope of winning this war being waged against our children. At the moment, pedophiles are far more informed about this crime than the public. This must change.

At the moment, pedophiles are far more informed about this crime than the public. This must change. Contact your local journalists. Ask them to report on the criminal complaints. Ask them to post links to the court documents in their stories so the public may learn exactly what the man in the local community “no one could ever believe would hurt a child” was doing; the kinds of crimes he was committing against our children all too often on government computers. Ask journalists in your town to fully report on all child pornography arrests so Americans can begin to understand, and fight against, what pedophiles are doing to our children and our country. Before this crime destroyed my life and the lives of those I love, I never thought I would struggle to recognize evil. The problem, I’ve since learned, is that evil does not present itself as vile but rather as “the nice guy, who adores children.” I never thought it would be difficult to differentiate good from evil. Pedophiles caused me, and I suspect many others, to lose that certainty. The security that middle and upper-middle class white Americans believe, as if it were our birth-right, that our world is okay. Our children are safe. We are good people. If we wish each other “to have a nice day” it will really be a nice day. Bad things don’t happen to good people and other such naïve myths the white, privileged American psyche has been built upon. The American epidemic of trading in child rape, blows all these false narratives apart. This book is about unmasking the evil. Showing that nice, white professor who married the poor single mother with two small children, is actually malevolence embodied as he rapes his own six-year-old step-daughter, unbeknownst to her mother – his wife, and shares this rape online to gain increased status among pedophiles. This is what evil looks like. The pedophile grooms the parents first, even his own wife or adult children, to gain access to the child or grandchild. Grooming is about gaining trust so children are left with the pedophile. Acting evil does not obtain children. Acting like the kindest man dedicated to children obtains unfettered access to childr Earl Bradley a pediatrician in Pennsylvania and Delaware who “specialized in welfare patient,” was allowed to become one of the “nation’s most prolific” child rapist.

His rapes were so violent he sometimes “had to resuscitate” the children. Bradley was finally arrested in 2009 and sentenced, in 2011, to life in prison. Ask yourself, are you being groomed? Question, most particularly, male relatives or friends who exhibit concerning behavior in the form of extreme and inappropriate generosity towards your children. Any man who wants to spend an inordinate amount of time with your children should be watched closely. The material reviewed in this book provides an introduction to a critically needed, and largely absent, American research agenda. So much has not been included. The medical and mental health profession, the sports world, non-profit charities, international humanitarian sector, corporate America, religious communities, among others, have not been touched upon. In these sectors there have also been many arrests. I focused my research primarily on government employees because these pedophiles are in the most powerful position to undermine our national and personal security and our democracy and rule of law. They are also in the best position to commit and cover up their crimes. In the areas I examined, military, law enforcement, the legal profession and educators, I have only been able to provide a dip-analysis much like law enforcement are forced to perform on the overwhelming data. I am a data-nerd. I would like to be able to say that I have reviewed every arrest record from the past ten years and provide detailed statistics about all these arrests. I would like to be able to conduct a series of analyses on all the data of all the child pornography arrests in America. Unfortunately, without the funding to build a comprehensive child pornography arrest database, I have only been able to provide an overview lacking in the kind of extensive quantitative data that is needed. What is important about the qualitative data I have gathered and reviewed, is that it is consistent with the few other studies on child pornography trends. White men in leadership positions, often fathers, frequently involved in infant and toddler rape – this appears to be the average pedophile profile. I have attempted to demonstrate that is there is a child pornography epidemic in America and an urgent need to document this crime through credible social science research conducted by academics with institutional support and funding so that a national", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt:108:f26f5c0c9078", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 288, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1634241592", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241595_SITB_cleaned", "chunk_index": 109, "text": "gathered and reviewed, is that it is consistent with the few other studies on child pornography trends.

The data must be gathered and made public so that we can create better laws and public policy to halt this crime. We must mandate that oversight and accountability, including random electronic monitoring, be built into employment sectors where people have access to children. In order to obtain that mandate, we need to document, for example, how many special educations teachers have been arrested allowing the argument to be made, with David Turkos, a 44-yearold police officer in Dupont, Pennsylvania, pled guilty, July 2017, to raping two boys, aged 4 and 6, over a seven-year period. Turkos zip-tied the children to a railing as he raped them, pointed his gun at the children, sometimes while on duty, and said he would harm their pets and their mother if they told anyone what he was doing to them. We need the data so we can demand that the White House hold their executive branch employees accountable. Not one government employee, ever, should be trading in child rape from government computers. We have the technical ability to prevent this. Now we need the political will. The political will depends on evidence-based data demonstrating that this is, undisputedly, a critical national security issue. Data that explains why action must be taken now, at the very highest levels of our government, to address this issue and stop pedophiles from infiltrating our government. Right now, pedophiles are winning. They know our system of governance is weak and they are exploiting all of America’s vulnerabilities in order to facilitate their crimes. This comes at the cost of tremendous pain and destruction of thousands of America’s children and their families as well as our national and community-level security. If all of this sounds depressing, it is. But there is hope. One area of optimism is the Internet – the same vehicle that has allowed child pornography to expand beyond anything conceivable pre-Internet. It is also the tool anti-child abuse activists are using to demand an end to the cover-up of the crime. Twitter, for example, is filled with anti-child abuse activists: dedicated people in Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Canada and across America. Just as pedophiles network and information-share, so does the growing, global community of anti-child abuse activists.

This community knows and supports each other, shares news articles, court transcripts, strategies for holding pedophiles accountable and moral outrage for the global child pornography crisis. That’s the good news. If you find all the research in this book difficult to believe, I don’t blame you. I was in shock and denial for a long time. Read the articles I reference. Don’t believe me. Check it out for yourself. Start to see the scope of the crisis. Notice how many times another trusted member in your community is arrested. Connect the dots. Start to see the pattern. Do a search for child pornography arrests. Observe how many arrests Meinrad Kopp, a 55-yearold tourist from Germany, was arrested July 16, 2017, when he traveled to Orlando, Florida to have sex with a 13-year-old child – in reality an undercover detective posing as a father offering his daughter for sex. Kopp told the “father” he wanted “to treat the girl like a dog, humiliate her and cause her pain.” He bragged of raping other children, including an 11-year-old girl he said he “beat with the help of her father.” Kopp said beating children is “fun, fantastic” and “better than sex.” Get online. Get involved. Organize and hold public meetings in your community. Demand servers distributing child pornography be shut down. Contact your local court house. Get the criminal complaints of the child pornography arrests in your community. Learn what these pedophiles are doing. Contact local journalists and ask them to report on the information in the criminal complaints. Ask your local media to cover anti-child sex abuse meetings that you organize and host. Contact the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Taskforce and ask them to provide a presentation of their work. Ask how you can support their work. 2.

He said, “I’m not a detective. My name is Jack Ruby …” I told him I need a telephone. He walks over and interrupts Henry Wade, the district attorney and says, “There’s a reporter here from New York and he needs a telephone and wants to do an interview with you.” Wade says take him to my office.20 Journalists in the early 1960s were accustomed to getting their information from official sources, and they reported, rather than challenged, the Dallas D.A.’s statements. Decades later, Bill Moyers, then one of President Johnson’s top advisors, told the Village Voice that “when it came to this [reporting on the assassination], the working press was a lobster in a trap.… Back then what government said was the news … the official view of reality was the agenda for the Washington press corps…21 Moyers was right, but this alone cannot account for lack of investigative coverage of the early contradictions within the official reports. As the FBI and Dallas Police reports coalesced, mass media reporting rapidly shifted to support the guilt of a lone gunman. At first there was considerable contention over the murder weapon and its caliber. Initially the AP identified it as a .30-.30 rifle, but this soon changed to a .25 caliber, and then by 11/23 to a .50 caliber Enfield. UPI referred to it as a “German-made” rifle, “a 7.65 Mauser” and noted that the police reported that no fingerprints were found on the rifle. The ABC affiliate in Dallas, Station WFAA-TV, initially reported it was a “high powered Army or Japanese rifle of .25 calibers fired from the second floor window.” Later in the afternoon the rifle was referred to as “An Argentine-made Mauser.” According to WFAA-TV’s Bob Clark, 1:00 am, 11/23/63 the murder weapon was an “Argentine rifle” Further, “the word was either there were no prints on the gun, or they (Dallas police) would not care to comment.” NBC initially reported the rifle as a British .305. The N.Y. World-Telegram & Sun reported the rifle as a German Mauser 7.65 as did a UPI dispatch. As late as 11/24 The N.Y. Post was still referring to the rifle as a 7.65 Mauser. On the day of the assassination, reporter/intelligence asset Priscilla Johnson portrayed Oswald as “That Stuff of Which Fanatics are Made,” bolstering the lone nut thesis (phase 2) in the Boston Globe.

On the day of the assassination, reporter/intelligence asset Priscilla Johnson portrayed Oswald as “That Stuff of Which Fanatics are Made,” bolstering the lone nut thesis (phase 2) in the Boston Globe. Similar articles by Johnson later appeared in the Dallas Morning News and L.A. Times (11/24/63), the Philadelphia Bulletin as well as in Time, Life, the New York Times, the Christian Science Monitor, and later in Harper’s (4/64). These articles were widely quoted in other journals. Nothing suggests that the Boston Globe, the Philadelphia Bulletin, the Christian Science Monitor, and Harper’s were anything more than unwitting accomplices. As a “prospective agent” or a “source” the CIA set up a ^(α)201 file” on Priscilla Johnson in the 1950s, where she was listed as a “witting collaborator.” After the assassination, reporter/intelligence asset Priscilla Johnson (now Priscilla McMillan) wrote a number of articles about her alleged “interviews” with Oswald in Moscow in 1959. FBI document #105-82555 shows that Johnson was working for the State Department at the U.S. Embassy and her contact with Oswald was official business.22 She was a friend and neighbor of CIA officer Cord Meyer. At the Embassy she worked with CIA asset Richard Snyder and wrote for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA), a CIA and British intelligence asset which was set up by former Office of Strategic Service (OSS) operative Ernest Cuneo. The CIA Soviet Branch Chief, Donald Jameson noted in a memo (12/11/62) “… I think that Miss Johnson can be encouraged to write pretty much the articles we want.”23 Johnson’s House Select Committee on Assassination (HSCA) Executive Session interview, 4/20/78 , still has 40 pages withdrawn by the CIA.24 Later, in the afternoon, 11/23/63, Assistant District Attorney Bill Alexander had informed the press that he was “prepared to charge Oswald with murdering the president as part of an international Communist conspiracy.” NBC News at 5 aired the video portion of Oswald’s interview with WDSU-TV in New Orleans August 21, 1963, where Oswald stated “I would definitely say that I am a Marxist.” He then spoke about the goals of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. The Coordinator for the interview was CIA asset Ed Butler. These connections will be explored later. Dallas officials, under intense pressure to appear competent, shipped off evidence to the FBI on the night of 11/22, and were told by the FBI that the evidence pointed to Oswald. They jumped to conclusions about Oswald and were later criticized for this by the Warren Commission and ACLU.

They jumped to conclusions about Oswald and were later criticized for this by the Warren Commission and ACLU. Later that night Dallas D.A Henry Wade went to Chief Jesse Curry in order to deal with press rumors but Curry refused to give him the police case. Wade nonetheless recounted to reporters what he remembered. The Warren Report would assert that Wade’s lack of thorough knowledge of the case “provided much of the basis for the myths and rumors that came into being after the president’s death.” We may come to view this assessment as scapegoating. Chief Curry after the first day emphasized the open nature of the investigation on the question of accomplices. However, when Dallas D.A. Henry Wade, a former FBI agent and a staunch, longtime supporter of LBJ, held a press conference at 12:30 am on 11/23 he categorically stated, “There is no one else but him [Oswald]. Later when asked if they were looking for other suspects, Wade responded, “We’re always looking for suspects but we have none at the present.” He later noted, contrary to many mass media reports, that Oswald was not a “nut.”25 Jack Ruby returned to the Dallas Police Station with corned beef sandwiches for his police friends and stayed there after midnight, when Oswald was brought briefly into a mob of reporters. A few minutes later when D.A. Henry Wade mistakenly told the press that Oswald belonged to the Free Cuba Committee, Ruby unexpectedly pointed out that the D.A. had meant the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, a pro-Castro group. The Free Cuba Committee was an anti-Castro Group.26 Stop for a minute, how did Ruby know the difference or anything about Oswald’s background? Ruby was somehow conveniently positioned to significantly influence mass media reports that reached large portions of the nation with a “phase 1” version. Although the Dallas authorities rushed to the conclusion that Oswald was guilty, by 11/24 they moved tentatively and unevenly from their early judgment of Oswald acting alone, to openness on the question of accomplices. Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry and District Attorney Henry Wade did most of the talking to the press the first few days, while Captain Will Fritz, who directed the investigation, made fewer statements. Curry’s statements on 11/22 noted that they probably had “sufficient evidence” to convict Oswald; however, he also stated “there are many things we have to work on.” By 11/23 Curry sounded slightly less certain. He stated that he thought they had the “right man” but that “we don’t have proof positive.” When asked about the possibility of accomplices, Curry replied, “We don’t believe so at this time.” He was wrong on all", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:2:860f15b8a284", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 296, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "Fritz, who directed the investigation, made fewer statements.

He stated that he thought they had the “right man” but that “we don’t have proof positive.” When asked about the possibility of accomplices, Curry replied, “We don’t believe so at this time.” He was wrong on all counts. Hoover indicated to Johnson that the evidence against Oswald “was not very strong,” and that “the case as it stands now is not strong enough to get a conviction.” And this is when Hoover tells LBJ that the pictures of Oswald supposedly visiting the Cuban and Russian Embassies in Mexico City are not pictures of Oswald. Further, the audio tapes of Oswald supposedly calling those embassies is not Oswald’s voice. There was exhaustion on the faces of reporters Saturday as the stress took its toll. Chief Curry was moving toward a 4 : 00 pM transfer of Oswald, although Captain Fritz wanted more time for questioning. According to reporter Seth Kantor only a few trusted people around the police station knew of the proposed transfer, yet somehow Jack Ruby did. Ruby offered a “scoop” about Oswald’s transfer to reporter Wesley Wise, a sports reporter from KRLD radio and TV Dallas, who was pressed into news responsibilities. Ruby then called KLIF radio, Gordon McLendon’s station, on a private phone line to DJ Ken Dowe. “I understand they are moving over to the county jail. Would you like me to cover it, because I am a pretty good friend of Henry Wade’s and I believe I can get some news stories?” Although the transfer was postponed, Ruby continued to court the press. In November 1965, Gordon McLendon was approved as a CIA asset. His ties to the intelligence community will be explored later. Later that day Ruby poked around the WBAP in Fort Worth TV van where Frederic Rheinstein, an NBC producer-director, was working. At one point Ruby brushed aside the curtain in the van to view activities up in the third floor corridor on a closed-circuit monitor. Rheinstein was annoyed and got a good look at Ruby, who later that day was seen on the monitor visiting Wade’s third floor office, an office which was barred to reporters by the police.

Still later, Ruby told a cameraman and a stage manager at WBAP that he knew Wade personally and could furnish NBC information. The lone nut thesis was already strongly endorsed by most mainstream media outlets. The New York Herald Tribune 11/23/63, run by millionaire publisher and editor-in-chief Jock Whitney acting as a copy reader, ran an editorial that claimed that all assassins in America were loners. “Shame of a Nation – History of Assassinations” asserted: Historically, assassination has been a weapon in the struggle for political power in countries around the world, but attempts on American presidents have not followed this pattern. In a book on Presidential assassinations, The Assassins Robert J. Donovan, former Washington bureau chief of the New York Herald Tribune and then of the L.A. Times, similarly asserted: They involved neither organized attempts to shift political power from one group to another, nor to perpetuate a particular man or party in office, nor to alter the policy of government, nor to resolve ideological disputes. With one exception (Truman) no terrorist or secret society planned these assaults on our presidents or was in any way involved. A pillar of the Establishment, Jock was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and was friends with the Rockefellers as well as CIA officer Frank Wisner. According to Fortune (10/64), Whitney “is willing to use the power of the Tribune to push energetically the editorial views he holds in local and national politics.” A friendly biography of Whitney, Jock: the Life and Times of John Hay Whitney, stated “on November 22, President Kennedy was killed; Whitney … was pressed into emergency service that tumultuous night as a copy reader.” Was the very wealthy owner really “pressed” into emergency service as a “copy reader”? Americans take consolation from the fact that the assassins of their presidents have, in nearly every case, been crazed individuals, representing nothing but their own imaginings. There is, however, a climate that encourages the growth of homicidal fantasies.… The heat of normal politics has its reflex on the lunatic fringe. And the ‘hate sheets,’ rumor mongering, the unbalanced charges of the lunatic fringe affects the real lunatics, the killers. Dr. Malcolm Perry, 34, attendant surgeon at Parkland Hospital who attended the President, said he saw two wounds – one below the Adams’s apple, the other at the back of the head. He said he did not know if two bullets were involved. It is possible he said that the neck wound was the entrance and the other the exit of the missile. Later the Warren Commission would ironically utilize the misrepresentation of Perry’s remarks as accurate reporting. Perry, under Secret Service pressure, changed his position on the nature of the neck wound from one of entrance – to being uncertain.

(Warren Report) It seems apt to note that Secret Service Chief James Rowley claimed that he could not locate a tape or transcript of the medical press conference where Dr. Perry spoke, yet Joe Long, Dallas KLIF news director, told Marvin Garson (editor of the alternative S.F. Express Times) that the Secret Service confiscated the original recordings.27 An AP article briefly raised vital, but unfollowed, leads from a doctor at Parkland Hospital. “Asked if the wounds could have been made by two bullets, he said he did not know, but that a bullet had entered the front of his head…” The N.Y. World-Telegram & Sun reporter Ed Wallace observed, 11/23, that “He used a strange gun; there is no evidence he had done any practicing; he was an unstable figure on a mission that would shake the nerves… of a much cooler man.” The L.A. Times had already ruled out a conspiracy by running Robert Donovan’s piece on the front page, “Sniper’s Bullet Kills President in Dallas” In the “EXTRA” edition, later on 11/23/63, Donovan led his story “A 24-year-old ex-Marine and admitted pro-Communist fanatic was charged by police late Friday night with the murder of President Kennedy,” while the headline blared “Assassin Named.” Donovan somehow claimed that “the President (was shot) facing the warehouse. In all probability he was hit just once, though doctors don’t discount the possibility that two bullets struck him.” This would mean that the President turned completely around to face the TSBD and then was shot, since the shots came from the front. “It appeared that a bullet hit him below the Adam’s apple and was deflected up through the brain and then passed out through the back of his head.” The L.A. Times also ran a picture of the 6th floor of the TSBD already labeled “Assassin’s Nook.” A possible Cuban communist role in the assassination was bolstered by the AP report carried in the Washington Post 11/23/63, “Castro foe details infiltration effort.” Carlos Bringuier, “reporting” as a New Orleans delegate for the Cuban Student Directorate (DRE) asserted that Oswald tried to infiltrate his organization and that “at first he thought Oswald was FBI or CIA.” Bringuier described Oswald as “a very, very cold blooded one.” Today we know DRE was a CIA-funded organization run by George Joannides, chief of the CIA’s anti-Castro “psychological warfare” operations in Miami. DRE activists called the New York Times and other news organizations recounting Oswald’s pro-Castro attitudes.

DRE activists called the New York Times and other news organizations recounting Oswald’s pro-Castro attitudes. The “Extra” edition of the Washington Post, based on reports from Merriman Smith, stated, “A Dallas reporter said he saw a rifle being withdrawn from a window on the fifth or sixth floor of an office building shortly after the gunfire.” The article reported that the Dallas Sheriff ’s Department found a German Mauser 7.65 in the TSBD; however, the Mauser would be re-identified as a Mannlicher-Carcano in a few days. By 11/23 the Dallas Morning News seemingly received noteworthy editorial guidance. Reporter Mary Woodward, an eyewitness in Dealey Plaza, wrote her account in the November 23rd morning edition. “There was a horrible ear shattering noise, coming from behind us and a little to the right… which would have been in the direction of the grassy knoll, and the railroad overpass.” Woodward speculated to fellow reporter Connie Kritzberg that this account was omitted from subsequent coverage because “civic leaders are responsible people, whether it be the mayor or managing editor of the paper, almost felt it a responsibility to kind of not ‘rock the boat,’ perhaps.” Dallas Mayor Earle Cabell, (whose brother CIA Deputy Director General Charles Cabell had been fired by President Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs), was quoted in two articles later that day. He had somehow already determined that it was “the irrational act of a single man,” and that “it could only be the act of a deranged mind,” although this contradicted the assessment of Oswald by the Dallas Police Chief. The New York Times and the Washington Post, 11/23/63, reported the nature of the wounds similarly. They left no doubt as to the origin of the shots. “The bullets have come from a 45 degree angle from the 6th floor of the building.” No source, however, was credited for this assertion. Curiously, Senator Yarborough was purported to have said that three shots came from the rear – though this contradicts all of Yarborough’s subsequent written and verbal statements. The New York Times headlines, 11/23/63, also already declared a lone assassin “Kennedy is Killed by Sniper As He Rides in Car in Dallas: Johnson Sworn In On Plane,” “Evidence Against Oswald Described as Conclusive,” “Marxism Called Oswald’s Religion,” “Fatal Shot Struck Base of Skull Causing Immediate Unconsciousness.” The sub-heading for Tom Wicker’s front page story, “President is Struck Down by a Rifle Shot from Building on Motorcade Route,” also definitively asserted a lone assassin. Tom Wicker began his story, “an assassin …", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:6:5fe849483282", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 300, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "Times headlines, 11/23/63, also already declared a lone assassin “Kennedy is Killed by Sniper As He Rides in Car in Dallas: Johnson Sworn In On Plane,” “Evidence Against Oswald Described as Conclusive,” “Marxism Called Oswald’s Religion,” “Fatal Shot Struck Base of Skull Causing Immediate Unconsciousness.” The sub-heading for Tom Wicker’s front page story, “President is Struck Down by a Rifle Shot from Building on Motorcade Route,” also definitively asserted a lone assassin. Tom Wicker began his story, “an assassin … fired from a building just off the motorcade route.” He opaquely wrote that Parkland Memorial Hospital doctors, Malcolm Perry and Kemp Clark, described the president’s wounds: “Mr. Kennedy was hit by a bullet to the throat.… This wound had the appearance of a bullet entry. Mr. Kennedy also had a massive gaping wound on the right side of his head.” While a wound on the right side of the head could be consistent with shots from behind, Dr. Perry clearly pointed to the right temple area as the place where the President was hit. Since Wicker was at the press briefing immediately following the assassination either he got confused or ignored it. Few mass media accounts attempted to reconcile a wound in the president’s throat and one in his right temple with shots from the Texas School Book Depository. Wicker’s boss, James Reston, in his story “Why America Weeps,” had already not only determined a lone gunman, but also divined that the cause of the assassination was “some strain of madness and violence” which plagued the country. Notably though, those in the Dallas Police close to the investigation repeatedly stated that Oswald seemed sane. Reston was soon promoted to associate editor in 1964. The AP report, in the Charleston News and Courier 11/23 asserted that “2 shots hit (the) President” from a ^(𝔞)45^(∘) angle.” They reported that three shots were fired from the Texas School Book Depository, while those in Dealey Plaza who rushed the grassy park [area] were confused and “terrified … and dived forward for protection fearing more shots.” The AP quoted Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz as charging Oswald with the murder, and the gun found was listed as “an old 30-caliber Enfield.” The Chicago Tribune headline read “Assassin Kills Kennedy,” and they characterized the difficulty of the marksmanship in their sub-headline as “Easy Shot.” The Chicago Tribune Press Service report mistakenly alleged that Treasury agents in the Secret Service bodyguard fired submachine guns at the (TSBD) building. They characterized the wounds to the President with “The surgeons would not state positively that the President was shot once or twice.” Oswald “having left the book depository building entered an automobile and drove three quarters of a mile into the Oak Cliff residential area of Dallas…” This was an uncorroborated report about a suspect, and Oswald supposedly did not drive.

Physician Howard Rusk’s New York Times piece did not attempt to reconcile the report by Parkland Surgeon Malcolm Perry, who located the entrance to the head wound in the right temple, nor did he attempt to address the throat wound, which had also been discussed at the press conference the day before in Dallas. The New York Times reporter Richard J.H. Johnston in “Movie Amateur Filmed Attack” noted that, “Life editors bought the Zapruder film but they were unable to give precise details as to what the film showed.” This was the apparent rationale used by those news organizations that saw and bid for the film, yet elected to avoid reporting any observation about it. The Houston Post headline, 11/23/63, “How Oswald Spilled out U.S. Hate, Love of Reds,” featured UPI reporter Aline Mosby’s 1959 interview with Oswald in Moscow. The other major front-page headline, “New Oswald Evidence” by UPI reporter John Young, highlighted Marina Oswald’s supposed statement that Oswald had a rifle of the type used in the assassination. Young wrote that a German Mauser 7.65 was found on the sixth floor. This contradiction regarding the rifle remained unexplained. The day after the assassination the Washington Post and the Miami Herald ran stories which portrayed Oswald as a pro-Castro operative. The source of the stories was Jose Antonio Lanusa an anti-Castro DRE operative. This press release claimed that DRE operative Carlos Bringuier’s account of Oswald’s’ visit to his New Orleans clothing store, was where supposedly Oswald tried to infiltrate his anti-Castro group. Lanusa cleared the story after approval from his CIA controller George Joannides. The Miami Herald titled their story “Oswald tried to Spy on Anti-Castro Exile Group;” the Washington Post titled theirs “Castro Foe Details Infiltration Effort.” Ironically, the first conspiracy theories printed were paid for by CIA psychological warfare specialist George Joannides.28 CIA asset John Martino told Miami Newsday reporter John Cummings that he spread false stories implicating Oswald in the assassination of President Kennedy.29 Confusion regarding forensic evidence also emerged from FBI editing. Dallas Times Herald reporter Connie Kritzberg noted early evidence of FBI “editing regarding the location of the wounds.” Reports on the location of the wounds in the Dallas Times Herald 11/22 and 11/23, indicated Dr. Kemp Clark and Dr. Malcolm Perry thought that at least one of the wounds was one of entrance.

Kritzberg recalled in her book, Secrets from the Sixth Floor Window, that an editor added a sentence to her first story on the assassination: “A doctor admitted that it was possible there was only one wound.” When Kritzberg questioned the editor as to where the sentence had come from, he “matter of fact[ly]” said “The FBI.” Kritzberg asked what physician made the statement. And why was the FBI at the newspaper so soon? The rest of her story remained as she had written it.30 Wounds in the lower front portion of the neck and the right rear side of the head ended the life of President John F. Kennedy say doctors at Parkland Hospital. Whether there were one or two wounds was not decided. The front neck hole was described as an entrance wound. The wound at the back of the head was either an exit or tangential entrance wound. A doctor admitted that it was possible there was only one wound. Dr. Kemp Clark, 38, Chief of Neurosurgery and Dr. Malcolm Perry, 34, described the President’s wounds.… Dr. Clark said the President’s principle wound was on the right rear of his head.… Dr. Perry was busy with the wound in the President’s neck. “It was at midline in the lower portion of his neck in front.” Asked if it was just below the Adam’s apple, he said, “Yes below the Adam’s Apple.” “There were two wounds. I do not know if they were directly related or not,. It was an entrance wound in the neck.” The neurosurgeon described the back of the head wound as “A large gaping wound with considerable loss of tissue.” Dr. Perry added, “It is conceivable it was one wound, but there is no way for me to tell. It did however appear to be the entrance wound at the front of the throat…” There were at least eight or ten physicians in attendance at the time the President succumbed… An AP article of 11/23/63 , without byline, quoted Homicide Captain Will Fritz: “We are convinced beyond any doubt that Oswald is our man.… Without going into the evidence I can tell you this – this case is a cinch. This man killed the president.” He added, “we are going to work on this until we have a perfect case.” D.A. Henry Wade stated that he was “confident of getting the death penalty for Oswald.” According to the N.Y. Times, 11/23, the Dallas police gave the Secret Service agents “a list of known", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:9:6b10c44b42e7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 303, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "“We are convinced beyond any doubt that Oswald is our man.… Without going into the evidence I can tell you this – this case is a cinch.

Henry Wade stated that he was “confident of getting the death penalty for Oswald.” According to the N.Y. Times, 11/23, the Dallas police gave the Secret Service agents “a list of known agitators who might cause trouble” and “buildings along the route were checked.” However, The N.Y. Post, 11/25, contended that, “there is still no indication of what, if any, advance security arrangements were made about the textbook warehouse.” Police Chief Jesse Curry’s original statement regarding the FBI in a late morning interview on 11/24 had changed markedly by that afternoon. At first Curry noted that the FBI knew of Oswald’s presence in Dallas and that, speaking for his department, “we were not informed of this man.” Later in the afternoon, a visibly shaken Curry repeated several times that the FBI was “under no obligation” to give them any information whatsoever, but that they have “always cooperated 100% with us.” Hoover told Johnson’s aide to tell Curry to “shut up” regarding the press. Johnson’s aide Cliff Carter called Curry and Dallas D.A. Wade and directed them to avoid any discussion of conspiracy.31 The wire services chose not to pursue this or other significant discrepancies. The AP story by Arthur Everett on 11/24 seems to be sensitive to the position of a lone assassin. No questions were raised regarding any of the contradictory evidence, such as the change in rifle description or location of where the shots were fired, and the location of the wounds, this connection to the FBI or any other contradictions. Dallas Captain Will Fritz and District Attorney Henry Wade already seemed certain that Oswald was the lone assassin. Captain Fritz claimed: We don’t know of anyone else who was involved in it, and as far as we are concerned the case is closed. There is no question in my mind that Oswald was the man who shot President Kennedy.… I don’t want to get into the basis. I don’t want to get into the evidence. I just want to tell you that we are convinced beyond any doubt that he did the killing. The AP, 11/24, ran a radio “debate” from New Orleans between Oswald and Ed Butler of the Information Council of the America’s (INCA) in 1963 sent to them by INCA. Years later researchers would determine that Butler was a CIA asset along with DRE’s Carlos Bringuier; Oswald left the impression that he was a clever communist sympathizer who had defected to the Soviet Union. Oswald claimed his support for Cuba with FPCC as well as affirming his Marxist rather than communist perspectives.

Oswald claimed his support for Cuba with FPCC as well as affirming his Marxist rather than communist perspectives. A close reading shows an otherwise poised Oswald curiously stumbling only on his response regarding his status while in the Soviet Union. …I worked in Russia er, it was under the protection, er, of the, er, that is to say I was not under the protection of the American government but as I was at all times, er, considered an American citizen. I did not lose my American citizenship … at no time did I renounce my citizenship … or at no time was I out of contact with the American embassy… Fingerprints of intelligence seem clear in the event leading to the “debate,” at the “debate,” as well as distributing the tape of the “debate.” Ed Butler, in testimony to Senator Eastland’s Senate Internal Security Committee, at an unusual Sunday meeting, painted Oswald as a “rational, wholly indoctrinated procommunist” and placed the “blame for Oswald’s actions on the authors or disseminators of that material [FPCC leaflets.] Ironically the FPCC leaflets were stamped 544 Camp St. New Orleans, which was the corner of the building which was also the location of Guy Banister’s office (though Banister used a different street address). Banister, ostensibly a New Orleans private eye, was formerly FBI SAIC in Chicago, and had earlier worked with the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). In the unedited “debate” Butler and INCA appear to have created a legend of Oswald as being part of a communist plot. Curry: This is the man we are sure, that murdered the patrolman and murdered … and assassinated the president. But to say that there was no other person who had any knowledge of what this man might do, I wouldn’t make that statement, because there is a possibility of other people who might have known this man’s thoughts and what he might could do, or what he might do. Years later, in Curry’s book, JFK Assassination File, he criticized the media for distorting eyewitness testimony about who was in the Book Depository window at the time of the shooting. He argued that the Dallas police immediately began to look for accomplices and continued to do so, while the press focused on Oswald alone.32 In the turmoil of that weekend, Curry may not have noticed the seemingly more conclusive statements made by Captain Fritz and District Attorney Wade, which contributed to mass media generalizations about Oswald as the lone assassin.

To establish credibility there was a decision by the Dallas city manager and the police chief to let the press into the police station. To confirm their competence and control, they wanted the world to see that they had the accused assassin. Reporters now formed a “mob” in the Dallas Police Station. Adding to the confusion, the commitment to television coverage caused TV cameras to be placed in the police station hallways. Television reporters, for the first time, took over coverage of a major event, causing print reporters to search for angles.33 The UPI story of 11/24 by Michael Rabun quoted D.A. Wade, “As far as we are concerned the case is closed … the case was a ‘cinch’.” The case of Oswald as the lone assassin was developed by reporting new evidence from an unmentioned source. A map of Dealey Plaza with lines from the TSBD was purported to have been found in Oswald’s room according to the Dallas Morning News, which oddly quoted an unmentioned source. Finally, the New York Daily News, (11/24/63), voiced some journalistic doubts about the Dallas Police rendition by implying that a shot came from the front of the presidential limousine. They reported that the two motorcycle officers trailing the presidential limousine to the left rear were splattered with blood and brain matter. Motorcycle officer Bobby Hargis was struck so hard by a piece of skull bone that he said, “I thought at first I might have been hit.” Later that Sunday, two days after the assassination, Jack Ruby, after somehow slipping into the Dallas Police and Courts building, bolted forward from the journalists with whom he was clustered and shot Oswald in front of rolling TV cameras. This was the first time in the history of television that a homicide was carried live nationally. Reporter Ike Pappas moved forward while Oswald was being transferred to ask “Do you have anything to say in your defense?” Just as he said defense he felt the explosion of the gun – and reported “Oswald has been shot.” The story ran live on NBC; CBS recorded the event on a local camera, while the ABC cameraman had already moved to the county jail. Reporter Seth Kantor asserted that Ruby entered the Dallas police basement by ostensibly helping two cameramen from WBAP Channel 5 TV Fort Worth, John Tankersly and Dave Timmons, maneuver a large camera set on a dolly.

Two Dallas policemen admitted to seeing a man with a dark suit (like the one Ruby wore that day) bent low and assisting the struggling cameramen. The Warren Report later claimed that by viewing a reel of videotape, they thought that only two men pushed the camera. In 1977 Kantor and friends from KRDL reviewed reel 13 and could not determine how many people were pushing that camera because a number of detectives were blocking the view.34 Meanwhile, extensive photo essays and video footage paying homage to the fallen President, along with the pictures of Ruby shooting Oswald commanded the public’s attention. Coverage of the funeral Monday was viewed by 93% of household with televisions. Media coverage offered consolation and a mood of continuity rather than upheaval. The New York Times declared that television coverage as a “chapter of honor.” Broadcasting Magazine saw the coverage as “mature, dignified, expert and professional.” Since no trial now was possible, an elite consensus emerged; one which J. Edgar Hoover and Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach claimed was necessary. By 4 : 00 pM the same day, Hoover’s views could already be seen in a memo to LBJ aide Walter Jenkins, which formed the basis of a memo from Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach to LBJ aide Speculation about Oswald’s motivation ought to be cut off, and we should have some basis for rebutting thought that this was a Communists conspiracy or (as the Iron Curtain press is saying) a right wing conspiracy to blame it on the communists. Unfortunately the facts on Oswald seem too pat – too obvious. (Marxist, Cuba, Russian wife, etc.) the Dallas police put out statements on the Communist conspiracy theory, and it was they who were in charge when he was shot and thus silenced. The matter has been handled thus far with neither dignity nor conviction. Facts have been mixed with rumor and speculation. We can scarcely let the world see us totally in the image of the Dallas police when the President is murdered… CBS producer Peter Noyes recalls a conversation he once had with … a former member of the NBC television camera team that had covered the murders of the President and Oswald.

Sometime toward the middle of the week of November 25, as interest in Ferrie was reaching a crescendo in New Orleans and Dallas, the NBC man had a discussion about Ferrie’s links to Oswald and Marcello with a group of FBI agents and newsmen that he remembered everyone found provocative. However, the FBI soon put a damper on his interest in the subject. For immediately after the discussion broke up, one of the agents took him aside and told him that he should never discuss what they had just been talking about with anyone, “for the good of the country.” 35 President Kennedy died because of one man’s violent hate, victim of the complete renunciation of law and order. His martyrdom will be cruelly diminished if his death does not inspire in all Americans a greater sense of common purpose and a stronger belief in the democratic process and in justice.… Nor can we permit blame for the assassination to be extended from one man to whole segments of American life. This may well have been a time when the “Standby Voluntary Censorship Code” was implemented. This national security propaganda mechanism will be described more later, but essentially it consisted of a few top journalists, PR experts, businessmen, government employees and college presidents, who could have been dispatched to monitor key communications – ranging from phone calls to mass media reports. Dan Rather, the CBS southern bureau chief in 1963, who was reporting from Dallas on President Kennedy’s November trip, claims to have been the first reporter to contact Abraham Zapruder, who had filmed the assassination with his 8mm camera. According to David Belin, Counsel to the Warren Commission and Executive Director of the 1975 Rockefeller Commission, Rather “took the film and was able to have the processing expedited.”36 A day later, Rather, who was apparently the only journalist who reported his viewing of the Zapruder film prior to 1973, curiously reported on 11/25/63 that Kennedy’s head “snapped forward with considerable violence” upon receiving the fatal shot. Rather’s version for the CBS Evening News thus supported the Katzenbach and Hoover memos, as well as the subsequent Warren Commission findings of Oswald firing alone and from behind. Time-Life Inc. West Coast editor Richard Stolley, on a tip from intern Patsy Swank, flew back to Dallas and purchased the picture and film rights to use the Zapruder’s film for $150, 000 . Representatives from AP, UPI and several national magazines also viewed the film, some with an intention to buy, but they were vastly outbid.

Representatives from AP, UPI and several national magazines also viewed the film, some with an intention to buy, but they were vastly outbid. The purchase agreement stated that Time-Life would agree to “…present the film to the public in a manner consistent with good taste and dignity…” They then suppressed it for over a decade; however, by 1969 bootleg copies were distributed by Penn Jones, publisher of the Midlothian Mirror. 37 Several things remain unclear. How was Rather able to find Zapruder so quickly? How did the film get to the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) controlled National Photo Interpretation Center, possibly as soon as the night of November 22nd? What happened to the Zapruder film frames which are missing on the FBI and Zapruder copies but remain in the Secret Service copies? According to Rather: We started a search for anybody and everybody who might have been there carrying an $\\scriptstyle 8 \\mathrm { m m }$ camera.… And slowly we picked up a trail. Someone had seen a man standing at a certain spot. Someone else thought he was in the retail clothing business. We ran our leads through the FBI and the Dallas police. Finally we had a name: Abraham Zapruder.38 Since Zapruder has stated that he traveled directly to his office after the assassination, it seems possible that someone followed him. Rather was promoted to the CBS White House correspondent in less than a year. Years later (1976), in his book The Camera Never Blinks, Rather maintained that he had made an “honest mistake” regarding the motion of the President’s head.39 The Warren Commission argued that the film went from Zapruder to Kodak in Dallas; then back to Jamison Film Co. in Dallas, where three prints were made; then back to Zapruder; and then to a vault at Time-Life, Inc. in New York. Through the Freedom of Information Act, author Paul Hoch found CIA item 450, a document indicating that the 8mm Zapruder film was at the National Photo Interpretation Center, one of the most sophisticated labs in the world. Years later, Doug Horne, who served on the Assassination Records and Review Board (ARRB), explored the chain of custody and alterations to the Z-film. The NPIC was run by Arthur Lundahl who had been recruited into the CIA in 1953. Lundahl’s chief Information Officer, Dino Brugioni, recalls that when the Zapruder film was brought over by two Secret Service agents late Saturday evening “we went white glove” on the analysis.

Brugioni’s NPIC team was watched by the two Secret Service agents and “What grabbed us all were his [ JFK] brains and part of his skull flying through the air.”40 Sunday night, 11/23/63, after Brugioni and his team finished their analysis; a lone Secret Service agent came to NPIC with a different version of the Zapruder film. He identified himself as “Bill Smith” and was met by NPIC deputy director Captain Pierre Sands, USN. NPIC employees Ben Hunter and Homer McMahon were sworn to secrecy as they examined a 16 mm film version, which had been altered at the CIA/military state of the art facility, referred to as the Hawkeye Works lab, run by Eastman Kodak in Rochester, NY. Hawkeye Works was used to examine U-2 film footage as well as satellite spy footage. Dino Brugioni is convinced that there are two versions of the Zapruder film and that what he saw on Saturday night was not the same as the version NPIC worked on Sunday night. Oswald told the Embassy (Soviet) that he planned to tell Soviet officials everything he learned while he was a radar operator during his three years enlistment in the Marines. Embassy officials said Russia never granted Oswald’s request for citizenship. In February 1962 he apparently had a change of heart … and since he had not been granted Soviet citizenship, it was decided to give him a passport to the United States … and $435 to defray costs. Meanwhile, on Monday J. Edgar Hoover was directed by President Johnson to communicate a general agreement on investigation strategies to the Washington Post, on 11/25/63 , because the paper intended to run an editorial calling for a Presidential Commission. An FBI memo showed that Assistant Attorney General Katzenbach called Washington Post editor, Russell Wiggins, and told him that “the Department of Justice seriously hoped that the Washington Post would not encourage any special means” by which the facts should be made available to the public. The memo also noted that an FBI agent had a similar conversation with Al Friendly, the Washington Post’s managing editor. The editorial never appeared. The rush to judgment to convict Oswald in the public mind was accelerated by some mass media outlets after Oswald was shot. The New York Times 11/25/63 headlines declared: “President’s Assassin Shot to Death” – not the “Alleged Assassin,” as they later admitted would have been more accurate.

Other stories that day strongly supported a lone nut thesis: “Doctors Question Oswald’s Sanity” and “Lone Assassin the Rule in the U.S.” Life profiled the “Assassin: The Man Held – And Killed for Murder.” Time’s story was entitled “The Man Who Killed Kennedy.” The Fort Worth Star-Telegram morning headline “JFK Assassin Slain,” though, was revised by the afternoon to “Suspect Oswald Slain in Dallas.” In recapping the case against Oswald the New York Times reported: Gordon Shanklin, FBI agent in charge at Dallas said today that … a paraffin test used to determine whether a person has fired a weapon recently was administered to Oswald shortly after he was apprehended Friday, one hour after the assassination. It showed that particles of gunpowder from a weapon probably a rifle, remained on Oswald’s cheek and hands. This report is misleading in two respects. First, the paraffin test does not test for gunpowder, but rather for nitrates, which are found in gunpowder. This test can never substantiate that someone fired a weapon, because nitrates are found in other substances such as cigarettes, lighted matches, soap, newspaper ink, or toothpaste. Police departments have since abandoned the paraffin test since it was not reliable. The second problem was that nitrates were not found on Oswald’s right cheek, according to the Warren Commission. Since Oswald was right-handed, nitrate deposits would have been found there. The paraffin test did not establish Oswald’s innocence, but the Dallas Police and reporters could have reported that it was consistent with Oswald’s innocence. The FBI, through Shanklin, overrode the original report from Dallas Police that the paraffin tests on Oswald’s cheek were negative. One source of Kihss’ information for another story, “Oswald told an untrue story of his Soviet stay, says man who aided him on return” was Spas Raikin of the philanthropic Traveler’s Aid Society. The Warren Commission did not divulge Raikin’s other affiliation but we now know that Raikin was then a member of the CIA-funded American Friends of Anti-Bolshevik Bloc Nations and that he had met numerous times with the CIA before and after 1963. Since Kihss later boldly wrote articles critical of the Warren Report, in this instance apparently he reported unwittingly. Jack Ruby’s motives also were clear for the Times as seen in their headline “Kennedy Admirer Fired One Bullet.” Thus, while on 11/24, while the Dallas officials, particularly Chief Curry, were more open to the possibility of Oswald accomplices than on 11/22, the day after Oswald’s murder, the Times was closing down the discussion.

Unlike the New York Times, the Washington Post indirectly raised some questions regarding the lone gunman thesis in a piece, “Other Countries Hear Quickly about Shooting.” Tass (the Soviet Union’s news service): 1) noted that Jack Ruby was well known by the Dallas police; 2) wondered why an assassin would have a picture taken of himself with a murder weapon and give it to his wife; 3) questioned why Oswald’s wife and mother were reportedly completely isolated by the FBI; and 4) speculated that “the murderers of John F. Kennedy are trying to cover up their traces.” Reports in newspapers from Rome to Johannesburg to Cuba to Vietnam raised questions about Ruby’s motives as something besides impulsive patriotism, but not in the American mass media. The Post was less curious about their own reporting. They ran a story based on dispatches “Palm Print Links Oswald to Rifle” and quoted Dallas D.A. Henry Wade “As far as Oswald is concerned the case is closed.” No questions were raised about why no palm prints had been detected on the rifle for the last two days by the Dallas Police before handing it over to the FBI. The Washington Post quoted a statement Ruby made to an unnamed policeman, “I did it to spare Mrs. Kennedy the agony of going to Dallas.” Ruby was portrayed as an emotional, patriotic, fair, honest, congenial, nightclub owner, and even as a “king except when someone crosses him.” Dallas Morning News nightclub columnist Toni Zoppi claimed: “Dallas doesn’t have a syndicate.” Ruby’s ties to organized crime went unreported. Years later the HSCA determined that Zoppi worked with the syndicate in Las Vegas. …Idiots we have always amongst us, and if they have coloration at all it is more likely to be the black might of the individual than the political shades of red or white. His [Kennedy’s] sense of history would have told him that all such murders were the work of individual hysteria, just as was the murder of the assassin, not the working of the historical process.…So, we believe, he would not have made the occasion of his own tragic death the opportunity for a new witch-hunt of either the left or the right without ascertaining the facts.… All the more shame on those who were so ready to attribute his assassination to some organized diabolical plot of the so-called radical right.

Other stories in the New York Times reinforced the idea that conspiracies were not common in American politics – “Doctors Question Oswald’s Sanity” and “Lone Assassin the Rule in the U.S.: Plotting More Prevalent Abroad” (11/25/63). Assassins “Charles J. Guiteau, Leon Czolosz, John Schrank, Giuseppe Zangara were all men who acted alone.” John Wilkes Booth’s cohorts were conveniently forgotten. The N.Y. World-Telegram & Sun , 11/25, carried a Scripps-Howard story “FBI Disputes DA on a Rifle Palm Print” which stated that… there is a behind the scenes rift today between the FBI and the Dallas DA Henry Wade… Wade said Oswald’s palm print was found on the metal of the rifle which killed the President. Federal authorities have confided that no reliable print was found on the murder weapon when it was flown to Washington for the laboratory study.” Scripps-Howard columnist, Richard Starnes (11/26) posed a poignant admonition. “Our credentials as a civilized people stand suspect before the world, of course, but the real depth of the disaster that has befallen us cannot yet be measured. In its 188th year, the republic has fallen upon unspeakably evil days and great mischief is abroad in the land, it remains to be seen whether more convulsions will rock us.” The N.Y. Herald Tribune shifted to some skepticism by 11/26. “Just two hours before Jack Ruby gunned Lee Harvey Oswald to death in a basement garage in Dallas Police Headquarters, the FBI warned both the police and the sheriff in Dallas of an anonymous threat to the life of the man charged with the assassination of President Kennedy.… We don’t know what happened after that.” The N.Y. Herald Tribune questioned Oswald’s passport process, “the passport was issued one day later. It still isn’t clear how it was processed so rapidly.” Further, while Americans were not required to check in with American immigration officials when crossing the border to Mexico, “Immigration has a folder on Oswald’s trip.” Finally, by November 27 a print journalist, John Herbers of the New York Times, commented on the Zapruder film. He creatively reconciled the frontal wounds with the supposed position of the assassin in the TSBD by suggesting that the gunman could have fired as the presidential limousine was approaching the TSBD on Houston Street, then could have swung the rifle almost 180^(∘) and fired twice more.

This account not only ignores all of the accounts from the eyewitnesses in Dealey Plaza, but also fails to note the obvious backward motion of the president’s head after he was shot on Elm Street. Herbers neglected to cite any source for this interpretation. The Times then recounted tests, which had been conducted by “a firearms expert from the National Rifle Association.” The expert used a “Model 1938 6.4 mm bolt-action rifle.” His target had been 50 feet away. He was able to get off three shots in 11 seconds and they struck within a one-inch circle. On a second try, the expert was able to get off three shots in eight seconds with comparable accuracy. Therefore, the “expert” reasoned that a well-practiced person could have done as well or better during the assassination. The story did not address: hitting a moving target; accuracy at about 90 yards; the quality of the Mannlicher-Carcano; the scope being poor and misaligned; or Oswald’s lack of riflery skills. In Herbers’ other story that day he avowed, “Three shots are known to be fired. Two hit the President. One did not emerge [according to Dr. Clark].” Yet, this account does not square with a New York Times report two days earlier wherein Fred Powledge noted, “A bullet that Secret Servicemen removed from a stretcher at Parkland Hospital after the shooting, and two bullet fragments removed from the presidential automobile matched bullets fired from the rifle by FBI agents.” Thus we now have a stretcher bullet, the fragmented bullet, and the bullet that remained in the president. Also unmentioned was a report from other newspapers that one bullet missed the President and hit the sidewalk past the motorcade with a chip hitting bystander James Tague. These conflicting reports were not reconciled. The powerful pundit Walter Lippmann imaginatively pronounced on 11/27/63 that “Oswald was an extremist, outsider … addicted to the fascination of violence in his futile and lonely and brooding existence. The salient fact about him was his alienation from humanity … there is no limit to his hatred … and America should follow the mayor of Dallas in prayerful reflection.” Four days later President Johnson called him and Lippmann observed, “I’m very satisfied with you.” Johnson then proceeded to invite himself over for a drink. Lippmann condoned “managed news” as inevitable, the cardinal sin was not to do it but rather to admit doing it.

Lippmann condoned “managed news” as inevitable, the cardinal sin was not to do it but rather to admit doing it. Noted reporter Heywood Bruhn once wrote that Lippmann “espouses the comforting idea that we are safe in the arms of J. P. Morgan.” The Washington Post on 11/27/63, raised concerns in a piece “Dozens of Questions Remain Unanswered.” “Could Oswald have done the shooting? Does Oswald’s map exist? Did the Dallas police do their part in protecting the President? What did Oswald actually do in Mexico City? Was there a connection between Oswald and Ruby? How did Ruby get into the Dallas police garage? What are Ruby’s ties to the underworld? Until these questions are answered the mystery may grow.” The N.Y. Herald Tribune, 11/27, questioned Oswald’s whereabouts during the assassination by interviewing the head of the TSBD, Ray S. Truly. “I rushed into the building with a policeman. He thought the shooting came from the roof and we ran up the stairway. On the second floor he stuck his head into a snack bar we have and saw Oswald sitting at one of the tables.” One of the leading alternative weeklys, The Nation, on 11/28/63 editorialized about the need to resist speculation, regardless of the “obvious discrepancies and inconsistencies,” until the report is released. The public was admonished to stay “alert and skeptical” since the Warren Commission “is heavily weighted in favor of the ‘official’ or Establishment view.” Life, then the most popular magazine in America, was even more influential than TV or radio news. After purchasing the Zapruder film, they selectively edited and creatively described it before asserting the case against the “strange” and “fanatic” Oswald (11/29/63). Life chose to print only 31 frames. The frame when the president was struck in the head (Z-313) was not shown. The only description of injuries was of a “clutching towards his throat” – no mention was even made of the shot to the head. Jackie Kennedy, who crawled on the trunk of the limousine to retrieve a portion of the president’s head, which she held in her hands at Parkland Hospital, was instead described as “in a pathetic search for help” – presumably to pull aboard a leaping Secret Service man. This was the largest picture in the whole unnumbered sequence, covering 4/5 of a page. If Jackie Kennedy was described as reaching for a portion of the president’s brain, it would have indicated that a shot most likely came from the front of the limousine. Life claimed that the assassin’s shots came solely from the sixth floor of the TSBD, in their story “Death", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:21:74bc8a86b9ee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 315, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "“in a pathetic search for help” – presumably to pull aboard a leaping Secret Service man.

Life claimed that the assassin’s shots came solely from the sixth floor of the TSBD, in their story “Death found him from this window.” Another piece “Assassin: The Man Held – And Killed – for Murder” by Thomas Thompson portrays a “strange” misfit, which is as perplexing regarding its sources as its content. Thompson reportedly determined where Oswald lived by “deftly extracting it from a chatty sheriff.” He learned from Oswald’s landlady that he frequently phoned the town of Irving. Thompson then ostensibly spoke with a sheriff ’s dispatcher and learned “that feds had been nosing around town earlier in connection with the assassination – looking for some women a few streets south.” By knocking on doors he was able to find the Paine household where Marguerite and Marina Oswald were located. He was the only reporter to interview these people before the Secret Service interview began, but his intuition and instinct quickly evaporated. Thompson portrayed Oswald as a confused, withdrawn loser, despite the pleas of his wife and mother that he was decent and innocent. The other main source Thompson used was Priscilla Johnson, although he may have been unaware that she was a “witting asset” for the CIA. Johnson’s article had already appeared in numerous newspapers, and she again portrayed Oswald as a confused ideologue, “maybe … a fanatic.” …Connecting Oswald with the mail order purchase of a rifle like the one that fired the fatal bullet, placing him on the scene of the shooting with a long parcel the size and shape of a rifle, comparing his palm marks with one found on the murder weapon, finding traces of burned powder on his hands. Then the police turned up the most damning evidence of all. It was a snapshot of Oswald showing him holding a rifle that apparently was identical with the one that killed the president… Throughout the summer of 1963, Life laboriously worked on a critical story concerning LBJ’s corrupt relationship with his top aide Bobby Baker. Much of the material was coming from RFK.

Wagenvoord remembered taking out a short 16mm film taken by a New Orleans television news cameraman of Oswald passing out pro-Castro flyers on Canal St. in New Orleans. An hour later Ruby shot Oswald. In the week after the assassination the European press was more skeptical and analytical than the American press. In France, Paris-Jour ran an article “Oswald cannot have acted alone” (11/27). Paris Press asserted that a Dallas patrolman J.D. Tippit was shot to allow a getaway.” Liberation wrote, “There is no doubt that President Kennedy fell into a trap…. The Dallas police, protectors of gangsters like Ruby … created a defendant then allowed one of their stool pigeons to kill him.” The conservative Le Monde declared 11/25 its “serious doubts” about the role of the Dallas police. In Great Britain, the conservative London Daily Telegraph reported “world opinion as much as American is not fully satisfied about this terrible affair. This has resulted in an elephantine attempt on the part of local authorities concerned to cover it up for one another.” (11/26) The London Daily Mail (11/27) said that “facts can be produced that a far right wing plot against the president caused his death.’ In Germany the Hamburger Echo (11/26) declared that Oswald’s murder raised suspicions that “would make the assassination a gang plot.” The Frankfurter Abendpost viewed Dallas Police captain Will Fritz’s declaration that the case was closed as “pitiful.” The Berliner Morgenpost of West Berlin, 11/26, speculated that “it is possible that Ruby silenced Oswald to cover the men behind the plot.” Pravda, 11/24, asserted that the murder of the President and the arrest of Oswald were being deliberately used to “stir up anti-Soviet and anti-Cuban hysteria. “ Izvestia asked “Were there two men linked in a plot? And were not people from the Dallas police linked in one plot?” Trybuna Judu in Poland charged that the arrest of Oswald and his identification as a Communist was similar to the conviction of Vander Lubbe on charges of starting the Reichstag fire in Berlin in 1933. (11/26) Some Arab papers noted that Jack Ruby was Jewish and they hinted that Zionism was involved.42 Suspicions of a plot against President Kennedy echoed in India as well.

The Patriot from New Delhi said, “it looks as though Oswald was only an agent … the ease with which a night club owner with a criminal record could get access to a prisoner in police custody and shoot him suggests collusion.… The effort of the Dallas authorities … was to insinuate that Oswald was connected with Communism and the Soviet Union. This, taken together with the Dallas police chief ’s haste in declaring that “the case has been closed” with the killing of Oswald, points to the existence of influences bent on changing Mr. Kennedy’s policies at all costs. Back in the U.S., N.Y. Journal-American investigative reporter and columnist Dorothy Kilgallen raised a loud call of caution in her column. “The Oswald File must not close.” If Johnson “could walk invisibly on the streets of the nation and listen to ordinary people talking, he would realize that he must be sure that the mystery of Lee Harvey Oswald is solved and laid before the nation down to the smallest shred of evidence. Well I’d like to know how, in a big, smart town like Dallas, a man like Jack Ruby – owner of a strip tease honkey tonk – can stroll in and out of police headquarters as if it was a health club at a time when a small army of law enforcers’ is keeping a ‘tight security guard’ on Oswald. Security! What a word for it.” The New York Journal-American and the N.Y. Herald Tribune also raised questions about the FBI. On 11/29, John Harris in a Hearst Headline Service report to the N.Y. Journal-American reported, “The FBI interviewed Lee Harvey Oswald, accused slayer of President John F. Kennedy, as late as September of this year … in the nearby community of Irving. The other two sessions were in Fort Worth in 1962 after Oswald’s return from defection to the Soviet Union, and in New Orleans last summer.… The FBI denied comment on these reports.” David Wise, Washington Bureau Chief of the N.Y. Herald Tribune confirmed this in his 12/3 piece. The L.A. Times, 11/30/63 ran a UPI photo essay, “Final Seconds of the Assassination Detailed in Photos” which, courtesy of Life magazine showed only six frames of the Zapruder film.

The L.A. Times, 11/30/63 ran a UPI photo essay, “Final Seconds of the Assassination Detailed in Photos” which, courtesy of Life magazine showed only six frames of the Zapruder film. The grainy reprints neither showed nor described the president’s head snapping backward. The one enlarged photo showed Jacqueline Kennedy scrambling on the trunk of the limousine to retrieve portions of the president’s brain (as she later recalled), yet this was described as Time-Life had described it, as a “scramble for help” to “help a Secret Service man into the car.” While UPI did not own or have access to the Zapruder film, they had seen it prior to Time-Life purchasing it. Thus they had some idea of the editing and inaccurate descriptions which were used. Whether the L.A. Times knew of the editing by UPI and Time-Life remains unclear. The strangest circumstance of the shooting, in this reporter’s opinion, is the position of the throat wound, thought to have been caused by the first of two shots that struck Mr. Kennedy. Surgeons who attended him at Parkland Hospital described it as an entrance wound.… The question that suggests itself is: How could the President have been shot in the front from the back? Dr. Perry described the bullet hole as an entrance wound. Dr. McClelland told the Post-Dispatch: “It certainly did look like an entrance wound.” He explained that a bullet from a low velocity rifle like the one thought to have been used characteristically makes a small entrance wound, sets up shock waves inside the body and tears a big opening when it passes out the other side. Dr. McClelland conceded that it was possible that the throat wound marked the exit of a bullet fired into the back of the President’s neck … “but we are familiar with wounds” he said “we see them every day – sometimes several a day. This did appear to be an entrance wound.” Legal authorities were among the first to criticize the treatment of Oswald by the Dallas police and the media. The New York Times ran a statement from the S.F. Bar Association 11/28/63, “We believe that television, radio and the press must bear a portion of the responsibility which falls primarily on law enforcement officials. Both press media and law enforcement officials must seek to protect the rights of accused persons against the damage to them, and consequently to our system of justice.” The New York Times expanded that concern 12/1/63 by printing a critical letter issued by seven law professors at Harvard Law School.

U.S. News & World Report, 12/2/63, faithfully followed the official story. Their lengthy articles on the new president’s background and ideas dwarfed the terse and sketchy overview of “The Capture of a Killer.” Their commentary by David Lawrence sympathized with the Secret Service and the problems of protection from the “insane impulse” of a “despicable individual.” It has been stated that it was an impossibility for the Secret Service to check the occupancy of every building along the route. While that is true, it is also true that warehouse type buildings, such as that in which the assassin hid, should be searched, and the extra time spent by Secret Service men at the Fort Worth Press Club could have been spent in so doing. The next day the UPI wire carried a story leaked by the FBI with the following lead: “An exhaustive FBI report now nearly ready for the White House will indicate that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone and unaided assassin of President Kennedy, Government sources said today.” According to Assistant FBI Director William Sullivan, Hoover himself ordered the report leaked to the press, in an attempt to “blunt the drive for an independent investigation of the assassination.”43 Independent journalist Fred Cook, who wrote for a number of journals including The Nation, learned in early December 1963 that a number of veteran newsmen were concerned about the lightning fast wrap-up of the case. One of Cook’s contacts said that a CBS news executive was frustrated because a research team in Dallas had uncovered leads, which appeared to require further investigation, but had encountered network indifference. Cook’s efforts to report on the Mannlicher-Carcano and its ammunition as well as the origins of the almost instantaneous and precise Dallas news reports of Oswald were discouraged by the editor of The Nation, Carey McWilliams. McWilliams respected Warren Commission senior counsel Joseph Ball, whom he had known in law school, as well as counsel Norman Redlich who had been active in civil rights cases, as had Chief Justice Earl Warren. McWilliams expressed faith in a Commission headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, “Nothing is going to be covered up.

Let’s wait until the Commission has time to make its investigation and file its report.” For historical precedent, during the trial after President Lincoln’s assassination the military tribunal afforded defendants some rights that Oswald was denied. The national press was allowed to attend the proceedings, and additionally a defense by counsel was permitted. The Warren Commission heard its testimony in closed hearings, while a compliant press raised no objection. As the above account of crisis coverage depicts, the mainstream and alternative media were heavily influenced by the historical context of a Cold War consensus. Initially political reporters found themselves covering a series of complicated homicides and relied heavily on establishment sources. Amid the collective trauma some reporters aggressively questioned Oswald about his cries of innocence; however, statements from Dallas law enforcement officials soon prevailed. The press assignment of reporting the President’s trip to Dallas was called “Covering the Body,” and it quickly necessitated behavior beyond the bounds of journalistic standards. The immediate penetration of some elements of the mass media by CIA assets, FBI “editing” and State Department pressure contributed to the quickly coalesced consensus of Oswald as a lone nut assassin. Perhaps collective trauma also pressed some reporters toward a psychological regression – leading to further deference to government authorities. The suppression and disinformation regarding the Zapruder film by Time-Life contributed significantly to framing the early reporting. In addition, mass media reliance on the wire services as well as government sources was the norm. Most of the powerful mass media organizations promoted the lone-nut scenario before Oswald was shot, including the New York Times, the New York Herald Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, the Dallas Morning News, AP, UPI, CBS and Time-Life. After Ruby killed Oswald, the mass media came under increased government pressure, particularly after the memos from Hoover and Katzenbach that “the public must be convinced that Oswald was the assassin and that he did not have confederates.” Critic Mark Lane spoke with some executives at the Associated Press convention in 1966 who claimed that they “were powerless to act since the government had only wanted one side presented.” The handful of mainstream reporters and editors who raised critical question’s however, remained marginalized. Some reporters have told me that they had heard that the prevailing attitude of the mainstream media was “Let’s get this behind us – let’s not look like a banana republic.” Probably Tom Wicker and most other reporters did not pursue the contradictory evidence for reasons he confessed in a Harper’s magazine interview years later.

Reporters who challenged the official story regarding matters of importance to powerful people: “lost access, [endured] complaints to editors and publishers, social penalties, leaks to competitors, a variety of responses no one wants.” Walter Karp of Harper’s conceded, “It is bitter irony of source journalism that the most esteemed reporters are precisely the most servile. For it is by making themselves useful to the powerful that they gain access to the “best” sources.” Remnants of the McCarthy era intimidation of the mass media still resonated with most of the mainstream mass media. The “Cold War Consensus” that American divisions on national security matters aided our enemies, again confronted a potential threat, but media-elite perception that patriotism was needed to keep the peace and calm in the country prevailed. This self-censorship strengthened the mass media support for the secretive Warren Commission process, which was shielded from the press. Leaks from the FBI Report were reported as facts, which acclimated the public to the lone nut thesis. It seems fair to suggest that the “Standby Voluntary Censorship Code” could have been placed into effect during this national emergency. The alternative media were weak and divided in late 1963. After initial caution, however, the New Republic, the independent socialist journal The National Guardian, New Times, and Saga did print critical coverage. The tiny, pro-Soviet New Times blamed reactionary rightist elements in the U.S. whose goal was to deepen the Cold War; however, only a handful of critical articles explored contradictions between the evidence and government assertions. The Nation remained more cautious, generally supportive of the official process, as well as of the integrity of Chief Justice Earl Warren. The frightening foreign policy implications, combined with a weak progressive movement, vivid recent memories of McCarthyism, limited resources, and a lack of access to evidence contributed to this caution. Just five years earlier, The Nation had printed an article by Fred Cook critical of the FBI. The FBI memos referred to the article as a “smear campaign” and characterized Cook as a Communist. FBI agents interrogated Cook’s friends and neighbors. J. Edgar Hoover was then “untouchable” by Congress. Years later, “William Sullivan, head of the FBI’s Domestic Intelligence Division, admitted to congressional investigators that those who presented findings contrary to Hoover’s prejudices could find themselves transferred or fired.”44 The mainstream media generally followed the traditional national security consensus and waited for the Warren Report.

If only the Internet was around in 1963, the critics could have already had some traction. Let’s briefly explore some aspects of the mass media’s participation in developing a Cold War Consensus. n the turmoil following the assassination, the press were misled by a number of government agencies as well as subjected to pressure by the President, the FBI Director, the State Department, the CIA, the Assistant Attorney General, and some Dallas authorities. These influences virtually constituted a coordinated policy of voluntary prior restraint based on national security needs. This restraint was followed by almost all the major mass media outlets for well over a year. Journalists confronted the usual challenges of limited time and money. More fundamentally they confronted professional risks in developing a vital, complicated, and controversial story within a traditional context of elite-media-government cooperation on national security issues. The news media of the 1950s and 1960s had close links to both the CIA and the Ivy League alumni who ran it. They frequently had gone to the same prep schools and colleges, joined the same country clubs, attended the same dinner parties, and shared the Cold War Consensus about the role of the CIA. Most in the field of journalism appear to have long accepted the sentiment Richard Helms (later the Director of the CIA) shared in a 1971 speech to newspaper editors that “the nation must, to a degree, take it on faith that we … are honorable men devoted to her service.”1 All major industrial powers tightly controlled their mass media on national security matters throughout the early 20th century. American correspondents reporting on World War I were far more successful in covering and publishing events than their British or French counterparts, until America entered the war. American foreign correspondents were then given officer rank, housed with officers, had their access to battlefields restricted, were required to swear an oath to “convey the truth,” and refrain from any writing which would aid the enemy; and then their stories had to pass through military censors. 2 During WWI, mass media leaders coordinated and supervised numerous psychological warfare operations with government agencies through the U.S. Committee on Public Information, directed by George Creel. To its practitioners this was a necessary progressive management of public opinion, or as Walter Lippmann called it, “The manufacture of consent.” By 1919, the muckraking journals had been either driven out of business or bought out", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:29:01b0d0f92392", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 323, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "writing which would aid the enemy; and then their stories had to pass through military censors. 2 During WWI, mass media leaders coordinated and supervised numerous psychological warfare operations with government agencies through the U.S. Committee on Public Information, directed by George Creel. To its practitioners this was a necessary progressive management of public opinion, or as Walter Lippmann called it, “The manufacture of consent.” By 1919, the muckraking journals had been either driven out of business or bought out by corporations. The U.S. Government utilized some of the new strategies in exacerbating the “Red Scares” of the 1920’s, contributing to national and journalistic confusion. A competing journalistic notion, advocated by John Dewey, viewed public information as necessary to strengthen the democracy, although it failed to resonate as widely as popular columnist Lippmann’s ideas. This cooperation intensified during World War II, when national security concerns again often justified hiding the truth. Formal and informal elite-mass media-national security connections strengthened this cooperation, which evolved into a Cold War Consensus. The norm then for the press and the public was to trust government sources. In May 1940 Winston Churchill quickly moved to protect his vulnerable country by setting up the British Security Coordination, an intelligence and propaganda service, to persuade the American public to overcome its widespread isolationism and enter the war against the Nazis and Fascists. Canadian industrialist William Stephenson coordinated the connections which were quickly embraced by FDR. Roosevelt assigned William Donovan to spearhead the U.S. actions, which soon coalesced a wide range of reporters and publishers in propaganda efforts. The major organizations, “Fight for Freedom’” led by Ernest Cuneo, and the “Council for Democracy” led by C.D. Jackson (Time-Life) had members including: Allen Dulles, Walter Winchell, Walter Lippmann, Ed Murrow, Eric Severeid, Helen Kirkpatrick, Elmer Davis (CBS), Geoffrey Parsons (N.Y. Herald Tribune) Herbert Agar (Louisville Courier-Journal), Arthur Sulzberger (N.Y. Post), Barry Bingham (Louisville Courier-Journal), Paul Patterson (Baltimore Sun), Dorothy Schiff ( New York Post) Ralph Ingersoll (Picture Magazine). At the outset of WWII there were two schools of thought regarding news and national security. The Office of War Information, headed by the noted journalist Elmer Davis, thought that America would do best in the long run by reporting the truth. Another school of thought, instituted at the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), directed by Bill Donovan, believed that propaganda (“patriotic reporting”) would maintain morale and better win the war. The OSS perspective prevailed. In 1940, President Roosevelt sent his trusted friend, corporate lawyer Bill Donovan, to assess the war in Europe. Donovan proposed the creation of the OSS, to gather intelligence as well as to create propaganda to counter the “insidious” Nazi strategy of “psychological attacks on the moral and spirited defenses of a nation.” The majority of “Wild Bill” Donovan’s assets at the OSS were journalists. Psychological warfare included “propaganda, sabotage, guerilla activities, bribing, blackmail, assassination…”3 During World", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:30:13d33369f44d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 324, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "The OSS perspective prevailed.

Psychological warfare included “propaganda, sabotage, guerilla activities, bribing, blackmail, assassination…”3 During World War ll Supreme Commander General Dwight Eisenhower told a meeting of newspaper editors, “Public opinion wins wars … I have always considered as quasi staff officers, correspondents accredited to my headquarters.” When CBS President Bill Paley began working at the Office of War information (OWI) along with C.D. Jackson, an executive at Time-Life, he was given the rank of colonel. Paley’s first major assignment was to establish a radio network in Italy through Armed Forces Radio “to lure Italian listeners with entertainment programs interspersed with propaganda – just the sort of arrangement CBS had used for its South American network.” Paley’s value was enhanced by his ability to work with both “black” and “white” (truthful) propaganda. 4 Jackson became the deputy chief of the Psychological Warfare Branch in North Africa by the spring of 1963, under General Robert A. McClure. The “psy-ops” included public relations, censorships, behavior modification, false identity, deep deception, fictional event staging, false defectors and legends.5 Coverage of the impact of nuclear attacks on Japanese civilians was suppressed in part by the military briefings. According to New York Times reporter William Laurence, thirty journalists were given a propaganda-laden military junket which would dispute Japanese assertions that “radiation was responsible for deaths even after the attacks.”6 After the war McClure wrote to Jackson about his power as military director of the Psychological Warfare Division: “We now control 37 newspapers, 6 radio stations, 314 theaters, 642 movies, 101 magazines, 237 book publishers, 7,384 book dealers and printers, conduct 15 public opinion surveys a month, publish a newspaper with 15 million circulation, run the Associated Press of Germany and operate 20 library centers…7 During most of the Cold War, journalists faithfully deferred to the dictates of national security. The real and perceived threat due to the Soviet expansion into Eastern Europe after WWII caused both the State and Defense Departments to pressure Congress for the National Security Act of 1947, which established the CIA. A major function of the agency was to counter the appeal of communism, and Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty were quickly planned as part of this psychological warfare. The OPC, led by Frank Wisner, became the fastest growing section of the CIA. Its budget swelled from $4.7 million in 1949 to $82 million in 1952. The CIA paid for this propaganda by skimming from the Marshall Plan funds.

The CIA paid for this propaganda by skimming from the Marshall Plan funds. One CIA agent, Gilbert Greenway recalled, “We couldn’t spend it all…”8 The CIA propaganda efforts in the 1948 Italian election led to an expansion of psychological warfare in National Security Council directive 10/2. Essentially this approved covert actions against foreign countries “which are so planned and executed that any U.S. Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons, and that if uncovered the U.S Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.” By 1949, CIA-financed radio propaganda was quietly set in motion to complement the State Department program, Voice of America. Many of the psychological warfare operations remained unknown to most of Congress. Fewer than 20 members of Congress knew of the overarching Free Europe Committee, which coordinated Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. Some representatives of America’s most powerful media leaders were involved in the committee, including Henry Luce of Time-Life-Fortune and DeWitt Wallace, founder of Reader’s Digest; however, the press never revealed any government involvement. These efforts were significantly strengthened in April 1950 by National Security Council directive #68 , which called for “hard-hitting psychological warfare.”It argued that America needed a “long distance CBS to compete on equal terms against a local NBC.”9 At the spring 1950 meeting of the State Department foreign policy investment banker Robert Lovett, advocated that “we have a much vaster propaganda machine to tell our story at home and abroad.” RFE was publicly described in 1951 as “a citizen’s adventure in the field of psychological warfare… its mission is to keep hope alive among our friends behind the Iron Curtain and to sow dissension among our enemies.… We are unhampered by the niceties of intercourse. We enter the fight with bare fists.”10 Numerous media experts were recruited to sit on the American Committee for Liberation including: C.D. Jackson of Fortune Magazine (Time-Life) to be the first RFE president; reporters Eugene Lyons (Reader’s Digest) and William Chamberlain, correspondents in the Soviet Union along with publisher William White. Allen Grover, vice-president of Time, Inc., was appointed as the vice president.

When the CIA cover was blown in the early 1970’s, the stations were merged, and Sig Mickelson, former CBS news service president and vice president of Time-Life, was appointed as the new chief. In response to a loose propaganda network called the International Organization of Journalists, which had been taken over by Communists by 1950, the CIA developed “Operation Mockingbird,” conceived by Frank Wisner, (the covert operations director of the CIA, and a major organizer of Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe,) his assistant Richard Helms, and Phil Graham, publisher and then part owner of the Washington Post. This program formalized the recruitment of journalists. By the early 1950s, Mockingbird was operational; each journalist had a code name, a field supervisor and a field office.11 Phil Graham would recommend reporters for jobs with other newspapers especially those with overseas bureaus, and Wisner reciprocated by paying for Post reporters’ trips. After 1951, the CIA, following the policies of its Eberstadt task force, set in motion by then High Commissioner of Germany, John McCloy, published about twenty “generally highbrow” magazines in Europe. They included the Encounter in London, Socialist Commentary and Der Monat in Germany, Preves in France, Forum in Vienna, Tempo Presente in Rome, Hiwar in Lebanon, Candernos in Latin America, and Chinese Quarterly in China among others.12 Der Monat was strongly supported by John Mc-Cloy because of its left-of-center intellectual stance. Journalists. The ANG attempted to influence trade unionism and “professional journalism” in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America through technical assistance and educational and training seminars.13 The Eisenhower Administration embraced psychological warfare more fully than the Truman Administration and it attained the status of a scientific doctrine. The efforts of Henry Kissinger in the 1950s at the Psychological Strategy Board expanded psywar targets to include indigenous populations and to focus on youth. At home the CIA worked with The New Leader, The Reporter, and Time, accessing a range of political perspectives. The New Leader, led by anti-Stalinist social democrat Al Levitas, was given financial support and consulted frequently with George Kennan, Allen Dulles and C.D. Jackson. The Reporter, launched in 1949 by liberal anticommunist Max Ascoli, worked with Nelson Rockefeller, John Hay Whitney and C.D. Jackson. Two former OSS members, Philip Horton and Douglas Carter, served on the CIA magazine staff and maintained their intelligence contacts with Allen Dulles (Director of Central Intelligence) and James Angleton, (CIA Director of Counter Intelligence.)

United Press reporter Robert Miller noted in 1952 that: We are not giving them the true facts about Korea, we haven’t been for the last sixteen months and there will be little improvement in the war coverage unless radical changes are made in the military censorship… There are certain facts and stories from Korea that editors and publishers have printed which were pure fabrications. You didn’t know that when you printed them. Many of us who sent the stories knew they were false, but we had to write them because they were official releases from responsible military headquarters, and were released for publication even though the people responsible knew they were untrue. General Douglas MacArthur responded to critical reports of the war by expelling reporters or pressuring news organizations to recall correspondents who offended him. The top brass of CBS killed a report by Edward R. Murrow challenging the military’s assessment of the war. Bill Paley warned correspondents to be careful of what they said in these difficult times. Paley’s directive clarified that CBS had diversified and was responsible to shareholders and vulnerable to politicians. (P103-4) In 1953 Eisenhower’s Cold War Psychological Operation’s Chief; C. D. Jackson worked with the State Dept., the NSC, the CIA and the White House. By March 1953 Jackson became the White Houses’ ad hoc director of national psychological warfare, which put him in the small group of Eisenhower’s advisors John and Allen Dulles. Correspondents assigned to the U.N. Command were not permitted to speak with U.N. negotiators; they were briefed, several hours after each session by a U.S. Army officer who had not even been at the talks. They were refused permission to inspect documents presented at the discussions and were dependent entirely on U.S. armed forces public relations officers in Korea and at Supreme headquarters in Tokyo…15 When the truce talks opened in July, North Korea proposed a cease-fire at the 38th Parallel; however, the U.S. proposed a line 32 miles north of the 38th Parallel, which would have meant surrender by the North Koreans and Chinese of the impregnably fortified mountains under their control. The U.N. Chief, U.S. Admiral Turner Joy, told the Western press that the North Koreans had refused to discuss a cease-fire at the 38th Parallel.

This disinformation was printed in American newspapers for weeks before the fact emerged that it was the U.S. which was refusing to discuss the 38th Parallel.16 The informal journalistic notions of patriotism can be seen in the statements of Newsweek’s foreign editor, Harry Kern, as well as syndicated columnist and CIA asset Joseph Alsop. Kern noted, “…What we knew we told them (CIA) and the State Department… We thought it was admirable at the time.” Alsop traveled to the Philippines when asked to by the CIA. “I’m proud they asked me and proud to have done it… The notion that a newspaperman doesn’t have a duty to his country is perfect balls.”17 There is no such thing, at this date in history, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dare to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print … any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. It is now clear that we are facing an implacable enemy whose avowed objective is world domination by whatever means and whatever cost. There are no rules in such a game. Hitherto acceptable norms of human conduct do not apply. If the United States is to survive, longstanding American concepts of “fair play” must be reconsidered. We must develop espionage and counterespionage services and must learn to subvert, sabotage, and destroy our enemies by cleverer, more sophisticated and more effective methods than used against us. It may become necessary that the American people be made acquainted with, understand, and support this fundamentally repugnant philosophy. During this time even CIA covert operations to overthrow elected foreign presidents, such as agrarian reformer Jacob Arbenz in Guatemala, could be shielded from American reporters. CIA Director Allen Dulles claimed to Arthur Hays Sulzberger that New York Times reporter Sydney Grusom was unable to be “objective.” So Grusom was kept in Mexico City during the CIA-directed coup d’état.18 Radio Free Europe actually contributed to the failed Hungarian revolt of students and workers in 1956 by hinting that there would be U.S. aid.

During WWII Cuneo was a liaison between FDR, William “Bill” Donovan, Chief of the OSS, and William Stephenson, the representative of British Intelligence in the U.S. Victor Lasky, a public relations executive for Radio Liberty (one of the CIA’s largest propaganda operations) had his conservative column run by NANA from 1962-1980. In the 1964 Chilean election, the CIA spent more per vote than was spent by the Johnson and Goldwater presidential campaigns combined. 20 They extensively used the press, radio, films, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, direct mailings, and wall paintings. “Disinformation” and “black propaganda” material which purported to originate from another source, such as the Chilean Communist Party, were used as well.21 Globally, at its peak in 1967, the CIA communications empire embraced more than 800 news and public information organizations and individuals. It was known inside the CIA as “Wisner’s Wurlitzer.” Frank Wisner, also a member of the elite and powerful Council on Foreign Relations, liked to think that he could orchestrate any political tune anywhere.22 At the height of the Cold War “the CIA made 70 to 80 insertions into various media outlets each day … flowing secretly from Agency headquarters into hundreds of different channels around the globe.”23 More information regarding this relationship was sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee in 1976, but the investigation was restricted by then CIA Director George H.W. Bush.24 The number of U.S. reporters working in some relationship with the CIA has been estimated at more than 400, based on information from Senate Intelligence Committee staffers. Even according to the New York Times, “the CIA has at times owned or subsidized more than 50 newspapers, news services, radio stations, periodicals, and other communications entities, sometimes in the country, but mostly overseas.… At least 22 American news organizations had employed, though sometimes only on a casual basis, American journalists who were also working for the CIA.”25 The organizations included ABC, CBS, Time, Life, Newsweek, the New York Times, Associated Press and United Press International, the Scripps-Howard chain of newspapers, the Hearst newspaper chain, the Christian Science Monitor, the Wall Street Journal, the Louisville Courier-Journal, Forbes, a publisher of travel guides, College Press Service, Business International, the McLendon Broadcasting Organization, and the Copley News Services, among others.

When former CIA Director William Colby was asked if he ever told journalists what to write, he answered, “Oh sure, all of the time.”26 In 1975 the Senate Intelligence committee found that the CIA owned “more than 200 wire services, newspapers, magazines, and book publishing complexes” and subsidized many more. The CIA covertly commissioned more than 1200 books, many of which were reviewed by CIA agents in various U.S. media, including (the New York Times).27 Colby was hated by many CIA officers for his revelations. A few years later he was found floating in the Potomac River, the victim of an alleged boating accident. A partial list of foreign beneficiaries of CIA funding, in addition to the aforementioned European magazines, includes: Africa Forum, Africa Report, Berliner Verein, Center of Studies and Documentation (Mexico), Foreign News Service, Inc., Interamerican Federation of Newspapermen’s Organizations, International Federation of Free Journalists, International Journalists, International Student Conference, Public Services International and the World Confederation of Organizations of Teaching Professors as well as hundreds of foreign journalists. Conduits for CIA funding to American and foreign organizations included corporate and elite philanthropic foundations such as: the Borden Trust; Dodge Foundation, Edsel Foundation, Monroe Fund, Charitable Trust, and the Tower Fund just to name a few.28 Some of these journalists’ relationships with the Agency were taut; some were explicit. There was cooperation, accommodation, and overlap. Journalists provided a full range of clandestine services— from simple intelligence gathering to serving as go-between with spies in Communist countries. Reporters shared their notebooks with the CIA. Editors shared their staffs. Some of the journalists were Pulitzer prize winners, distinguished reporters who considered themselves ambassadors-without-portfolio for their country. Most were less exalted: foreign correspondents who found that their association with the Agency helped their work; stringers and freelancers who were as interested in the derrying-do of the spy business as in filing articles; and the smallest category, full-time CIA employee’s masquerading as journalists abroad. In many instances, CIA documents show journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the managements of America’s leading news organizations. The peculiar nature of the job of the foreign correspondent is ideal for such work; he was accorded unusual access by his host country, and permitted to travel in areas often off-limits to other Americans, spends much of his time cultivating sources in governments, academics institutions, the military establishment and scientific communities.

Within the CIA, journalist operatives were accorded elite status, a consequence of the common experience journalists shared with high level CIA officials. Many had gone to the same schools as their CIA handlers, moved in the same circles … and were part of the same “old boy” network that constituted something of establishment elite in the media, politics and academia of postwar America. 29 Simply stated, we know that in the past the CIA has had contractual relationships, paid and unpaid, with individual journalists in both American and foreign news organizations.… In some cases, officials of these organizations were witting of these relationships; in others not.… Some of the journalists did positive intelligence gathering for the CIA; others merely exchanged information or offered information on their own.… Some journalists went further; they published stories both true and false for the CIA or they helped recruit agents. Sometimes the journalists weren’t really journalists at all, but rather CIA agents under cover.… No doubt the motives behind the relationships were varied. There are a number of questions, which arise from what they know of these CIA-press relations. They reach the very heart of a free press, its impartiality, and credibility, and they raise the possibility that Americans at home can be victims of disinformation sown by their own government.30 The Church Committee report explored the impact of “blowback” or “black propaganda fallout” – lies which are unwittingly picked up by the American press. They admonished: “Because the source of black propaganda is so fully concealed, the CIA recognizes that it risks seriously misleading U.S. policymaking.”31 The scope of the approved operations for the Forty Committee covert actions for media and propaganda operations was larger", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:38:417cfcccdf84", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 332, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "possibility that Americans at home can be victims of disinformation sown by their own government.30 The Church Committee report explored the impact of “blowback” or “black propaganda fallout” – lies which are unwittingly picked up by the American press.

The 1978 annual budget for CIA propaganda was $250–265 million – larger than the combined budgets of Reuters, AP and UPI.32 In 1983 former CIA executive Tom Braden revealed on CNN’s Cross Fire that the CIA funded the Communist Worker newspaper in the 1950’s. Braden maintained that “The CIA licked Joseph Stalin’s last great offensive in Western Europe, and it did it by helping liberals, intellectuals and socialists, which is to say conservatives, because socialism in France and Belgium is nothing but a sort of moderate Republicanism.”33 The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover also developed strong relationships with the media, most notably Time, Life, Fortune, Newsweek, Business Week, Reader’s Digest, U.S. News & World Report and Look. The sources regularly forwarded notes from editorial conferences about forthcoming or proposed articles. Hoover was close friends with Reader’s Digest’s publisher and editor, DeWitt Wallace and Fulton Ousler, as well as the Cowles brothers who published Look. Reader’s Digest ran more than a dozen of Hoover’s ghost-written articles, the U.S. News & World Report printed twenty-five.34 The best example of this alliance of Wall Street and left-wing publication was the New Republic, a magazine founded by Willard Straight using Payne Whitney money. The original purpose for establishing the paper was to provide an outlet for the progressive left and to guide it quietly in an Anglophile direction.… The first editor of the New Republic, the well-known “liberal” Herbert Croly, was aware of the situation.… Croly’s biography of Straight, published in 1914, makes perfectly clear that Straight was in no sense a liberal or progressive, but was, indeed, a typical international banker, and that the New Republic was simply a medium for certain designs of such international bankers, notably to blunt the isolationism and anti-British sentiments so prevalent among American progressives… In the 1930s major stockholders controlling Newsweek included Paul Mellon (Mellon Bank), the Harrimans, and the Whitneys. The Whitneys were related through marriage to the Harrimans and the Vanderbilts as well as to William Paley of CBS. The Whitneys were also close to Nelson Rockefeller, Joseph Alsop, and high-level CIA officers Frank Wisner, William H. Jackson, and Allen Dulles.

Jock Whitney’s grandfather had served under President Grover Cleveland as Secretary of War and Jock served in World War II coordinating propaganda in Latin America with Nelson Rockefeller in the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. Whitney also worked for a stint with corporate lawyer William “Wild Bill” Donovan, the Director of the OSS. By 1956 Whitney was the Chairman of Freeport Sulphur as well as Chairman of the United Republican Finance Committee. High-level CIA officer Tracy Barnes was the son of Jock Whitney’s’ second cousin, and they became friends while attending the Army Air Corps intelligence school in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.35 Jock Whitney’s close friend and business associate Walter Thayer was a director of the Morgan affiliated Bankers Trust Fund and had spent four years in William Donovan’s law firm. In 1961, Thayer was president of the New York Herald Tribune when Jock Whitney was its editor-in-chief and publisher, a far cry from the independent Tribune founded by Horace Greeley. The Whitney trust was financed in part with money from the Granary Fund, a CIA conduit. Jock Whitney along with Richard Mellon Scaife cooperated with a range of CIA media sources. In 1958 they helped fund a CIA front company which dispersed six articles weekly from the Forum World Features in 50 countries to 120 foreign and 30 domestic clients; including the Washington Post. Jock Whitney was also closely associated with Katherine Graham of the Washington Post, and Graham held a 45% share of the New York Herald Tribune stock, with an option for 5% more upon Whitney’s death. In 1948 and 1949, CIA director Allen Dulles assisted his friends, John Hayes and Phil Graham, in their purchase of WTOP-CBS radio from another friend, Colonel William Paley, previously a prominent staffer at the Army’s Psychological Warfare Division. CBS and the Washington Post then began to share news staffs. Phil Graham’s experience with army intelligence created an affinity with CIA men and he staffed the Post with men who had intelligence backgrounds. This included Alfred Friendly and Russell Wiggins from Army Intelligence, Alan Barth from the Office of War Information, and John Hayes from the Armed Forces Network of the OSS. Graham also arranged in 1951 for Post reporter Ben Bradlee to be hired as a press attaché in the American Embassy in Paris, where for a year Bradlee worked on the staff of the Office of U.S. Information and Educational Exchange (USIE), the parent of Voice of America and U.S. Information Agency (USIA).

In 1953 Bradlee was under orders from the “head of the CIA in Paris” to write an “Operations Memorandum,” which asserted that Julius and Ethyl Rosenberg deserved the death sentence for their alleged sharing of nuclear secrets with the Soviet Union. This story was disseminated to forty different countries.36 These elite connections could also be seen in the informal lengthy brunches, or “salons,” at the home of Phil and Katherine Graham, owners of the Washington Post, and later Newsweek, which were attended by the press, top foreign policy officials, the intelligence community, and politicians. Phil built on the connections of his father-in-law, Eugene Graham, who had chaired the Federal Reserve Band as well as the World Bank. One party held in 1960 for the powerful nationally syndicated columnist and CIA asset Joseph Alsop, a cousin of FDR, featured a guest list which included former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, Allen Dulles, Desmond FitzGerald, Tracy Barnes and Alsop’s lifelong friend Richard Bissell of the CIA; diplomats Chip Bowen and David Bruce; Justice Felix Frankfurter; and reporters Arthur Krock, Walter Lippmann, Cy Sulzberger and candidate John Kennedy among others. Joe Alsop’s brother, Stewart, his journalistic partner for years, had been in the OSS, and was an old friend of Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner. The Alsops also hosted legendary dinner parties with similar guest lists, which have been called “the Georgetown set.”37 By 1960 the increasingly powerful Phil Graham was strongly backing Lyndon Johnson for the presidency, until the first day of the Democratic Convention. After reassessing Kennedy’s power, Graham and his close friend Joe Alsop worked to reconcile the often-antagonistic Kennedy with Johnson and helped broker the vice-presidential position for Johnson. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was also a significant force promoting Johnson, though his cooperation with Graham and Alsop is unclear. When Phil Graham bought Newsweek in 1961 from the Astor Foundation, Gates White McGarrah, president of the Bank for International Settlements in the 1930s, was on its board. McGarrah’s grandson, Richard McGarrah Helms (the former Director of the CIA), was Ben Bradlee’s childhood friend. Bradlee was a Newsweek editor in 1963, a close friend of President Kennedy, brother-in-law to CIA covert operations chief Cord Meyer, and former senior editor of the Washington Post.

He was a close friend of Allen Dulles (Director of the CIA and later Warren Commission member) and had practiced law at Cravath, Swaine and Moore with another Warren Commission member, John McCloy, also both members of the Council on Foreign Relations.38 Katherine Graham was also close to Henry Luce’s wife, Clare Booth Luce and viewed her as a role model. Similar elite-corporate-government-media connections can be seen with the Luce media empire of Time, Life, and Fortune, which had been financed with the Morgan and Rockefeller banking conglomerates from its outset in the 1920s. In the 1930’s Time Inc. was owned by an “inner circle of American finance and its policies reflected its ownership.” Henry Luce, or Harry as his friends called him, was the major force behind Republican Wendell Willkie’s presidential campaign. Luce’s crusade-like anti-communism included notions of free trade and anti-isolationism that were expounded by Willkie. In the 1930s he supported the military expansion of Hitler and Mussolini through the Rhineland, Ethiopia, and Spain. In the early 1940s Luce advocated an “American Century” consisting of free enterprise, free trade, vigilant anti-communism, all bolstered by a strong military. Time, the most influential U.S. periodical in 1963, promoted Luce’s agenda: “I don’t pretend that this is an objective magazine. It’s an editorial magazine from the first page to the last and whatever comes out has to reflect my view.…” Luce wrote that it is “the crowds [that] will destroy civilization” and implored the press “to assist people in governing themselves.”He closely controlled a process of group writing in Time which “blended (the news) with opinion and editorializing so that the reader got not mere news but a proper understanding of it.”39 As a Skull & Bones member at Yale, Luce had long been friends with Winston Churchill, John D. Rockefeller III, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and John and Allen Dulles. He had readily allowed members of his staff to work for the CIA, and Dulles regularly hosted dinners for Time foreign correspondents. Time’s senior vice-president, C. D. Jackson, had worked closely with President Eisenhower, Allen Dulles, and John McCloy on a number of psychological warfare projects, and had married into the Astor family. Luce’s sister was married to Time director Maurice Moore, a man who had worked with Warren Commissioner John McCloy at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine and Moore.40 Six of Time’s fourteen directors were members of the Council on Foreign Relations, as was C. D. Jackson.

Time collaboration with the CIA was so extensive that it “was difficult to tell precisely where the Luce Empire’s overseas intelligence network ended and the CIA’s began.”You don’t need to manipulate Time magazine because there are CIA people at the management level.\" (William Bader CIA officer). The Luces were so frustrated with JFK’s foreign policy after the Cuban Missile Crisis that a White House luncheon was arranged to mend fences. The Luces pressed Kennedy hard about the need to go to war with Cuba, “for American prestige and survival.” Kennedy suggested that Henry Luce was a “warmonger,” and the Luces left before dessert.41 Another dimension of the elite media government connections is seen in the rise of political pundits. Walter Lippmann was the most influential of the early nationally syndicated columnists. Soon after he started with the New Republic he was invited to President Woodrow Wilson’s summer home in New Jersey to clarify the U.S. foray into Mexico. The Harvard-educated journalist lamented the dangers of a populace becoming “inevitable victims of agitation and propaganda” and through his books and columns he envisioned himself performing an essential service “to find out what is going on under the surface … and what it could mean…” Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr suggested that later in Lippmann’s career he condoned “managed news” as inevitable and saw the solution for the ills of democracy lying in more executive power by an elitist government. Lippmann benefited from the patronage of the powerful, such that columnist Michael Kinsley referred to him as “the American sycophancy.” Lippmann’s friend, NYT editor James Reston, saw him “more attached to politicians than any other columnist, a man who loved going to embassies, (a standard diplomatic cover for intelligence agents) philosophizing after dinner and he liked to be asked to the White House. It’s true that people talk about money as corruptive, but the social life is much more so than money.” Similar mass media-government-elite connections existed outside of the so-called Eastern Establishment. The Copley News Service was inspired by a meeting between the late James S. Copley, publisher and sole owner of Copley Press, and President Eisenhower to supplement the CIA. Captain E.

Robert Anderson, who headed the Copley Press San Diego operations, drew on his background in Naval Intelligence and coordinated intelligence gathering. Copley’s father, Colonel Ira Copley, had hired OSS officer Robert Richards to run their Washington Office before the end of WWII. General Victor Krulak, onetime head of liaison between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the intelligence services, succeeded Anderson as editorial director of Copley Press in 1968. From well-placed CIA sources, reporter Joe Trento has determined that no fewer than twenty-three Copley News Service employees had worked for the CIA simultaneously.42 CNS’s first Latin American editor was CIA man, David Hellyer, who held the position until he returned to the CIA in 1960. James Copley also cooperated closely with the FBI, particularly by 1964, when the former FBI director of the San Diego office, Frank Price, became his “security consultant.” According to photographers and reporters at Copley Press, Price and Krulak ran a system of intelligence gathering for the FBI. Further, the FBI used the Copley Press to release “raw” and unverified data about individuals of whom it didn’t approve. Sociologist Herbert Gans observed that during the 1960s both CIA and FBI agents obtained press passes from local news organizations, presumably with executive compliance, to spy on anti-war protesters. This was confirmed by Senate Intelligence Committee hearings in the mid-1970s. Local television stations often voluntarily supplied outtakes of films made at anti-war demonstrations to help the CIA, FBI or local police “red squads” identify individual demonstrators.43 Whereas a number of intelligence officers started their careers with the press, quite a few CIA officers made the reverse trip to the mass media. Richard Helms, Henry Pleasants, Wallace Deuel, Jake Goodwin and Angus Thuermer moved from the mass media to intelligence services. Those relocating from Langley to the mass media include: Tom Braden, international organizations director for the CIA 1950-1954, moved to writing nationally syndicated columns; Bonner Day worked for the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, then moved to U.S. News & World Report; Pentagon correspondent Robert Myers shifted from the CIA Asia desk to publish The New Republic; George Packard, CIA Far East, moved to Newsweek, then to executive editor of the Philadelphia Bulletin; Bruce von Voorst, former CIA Africa, became a Newsweek diplomatic correspondent; Philip Geyelin cycled from the Wall St. Journal to the CIA and then returned to the Wall St. Journal, and in 1967 became the editorial page editor of the Washington Post. 44 The relationship between the New York Times and the CIA was considered the most valuable among newspaper assets, according to CIA", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:44:4346313a3ef6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 338, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 45, "text": "George Packard, CIA Far East, moved to Newsweek, then to executive editor of the Philadelphia Bulletin; Bruce von Voorst, former CIA Africa, became a Newsweek diplomatic correspondent; Philip Geyelin cycled from the Wall St. Journal to the CIA and then returned to the Wall St. Journal, and in 1967 became the editorial page editor of the Washington Post. 44 The relationship between the New York Times and the CIA was considered the most valuable among newspaper assets, according to CIA officials. A few executives, such as Arthur Hayes Sulzberger of the New York Times and his son Cy, signed a secrecy oath. From 1950-1966 some CIA employees were provided cover with approval from Sulzberger, who socialized with former Director of the CIA, Allen Dulles, as well as subsequent Directors of Central Intelligence John McCone and Richard Helms. They were Yale and Harvard and Princeton … they were lawyers, and bankers and businessmen and journalists. They were General Alder and Allen Dulles; Ben Welles and Walter Sullivan and James Angleton; they were John Oakes and his brother … they were Kim Roosevelt, the CIA men who pulled off the Mossedegh coup [Iran-1953] and Pope Brewer and Kenneth Love; they were James Reston and his deputy in the Washington bureau … Wallace Carroll and Carroll’s intimate friend, Richard Helms, with whom he worked in prewar UPI days in Europe; they were all the correspondents who had been wined and dined and flattered by Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner and Des FitzGerald … and Tracy Barnes – Reston, Daniel, Frankel, Drew Middleton and myself; they were Cy Sulzberger and Frank Wisner and Bob Joyner and Allen Dulles and Colby’s and station chiefs all over the world.… They knew each other, they stayed at each other’s houses, and they drank together and dined together … and knew each other’s secrets…45 In 1966, when Secretary of State Dean Rusk protested to the New York Times that an upcoming news series on the CIA was not in the national interest, the Times responded by sending the completed series to John McCone, a former director of the CIA, for editing. Turner Catledge, the managing editor, wrote a memo to Times publisher “Punch” Sulzberger: “I don’t know of any other series in my time which has been prepared with greater care and with such remarkable attention to the views of the agency involved as this one.”46 Reporter Carl Bernstein wrote that, “CBS was unquestionably the CIA’s most valuable broadcasting asset.” CBS president Colonel William Paley and Allen Dulles had a social as well as a working relationship, which some authors argue set the standard for future cooperation between the CIA and the major broadcast companies.

William Paley had also become an integral part of foreign policy planning on the Council on Foreign Relations even before he was tapped in 1951 by President Truman to chair a presidential commission on raw materials. The Paley Commission, which consisted of numerous corporate leaders, clarified foreign policy options.49 CBS executive Frank Stanton had also long worked with the CIA on psychological warfare with Radio Free Europe, Free Europe Fund and the National Committee for a Free Europe.50 Stanton, a longtime friend and advisor of Lyndon Johnson, later became a trustee for the Rockefeller Foundation and for a decade a chairman of the RAND Corporation, a “think tank” funded almost entirely with Air Force money. Stanton also served as the Chairman of the United States Advisory Commission on Information, which assessed the operations of the United States Information Agency, (USIA), and the propaganda arm of the American government overseas. Over the years CBS provided cover for CIA employees and annually from 1950 through 1960, CBS correspondents joined the CIA hierarchy for a private New Year’s Day dinner at the exclusive Alibi Club, paid for by Dulles.51 The other members of the study team were Zbigniew Brzezinski, then a professor of political science at MIT; and John Hayes, then vice-president of the Washington Post Company for radio-TV. The principle government officials associated with the project was Cord Meyer of the CIA; McGeorge Bundy, then special assistant to the president for national security; Leonard Marks, the director of USIA; and Bill Moyers, the special assistant to President Lyndon Johnson. In May of 1977 the President of CBS News, Richard Salant, confirmed that CBS had connections with the CIA that had been formed back in the 1950s. CBS Chairman William Paley and Sig Mickelson, Paley’s predecessor, had forged these ties. Salant stated that any CBS foreign correspondent returning to the U.S. after assignment was traditionally “debriefed” by CIA Director Allen Dulles. CIA operatives were allowed to screen CBS news film, and to eavesdrop on conversations between CBS news officials in New York and the field. Paley also permitted his own Paley Foundation to funnel money to CIA-sponsored projects abroad.52 In February 1976, prior to the formation of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), CIA Director George H.W. Bush called a meeting with Paley and Salant to gain support for the CIA’s policy of “burying the past.” One of the CBS executives told Bush, “we protect ours, you protect yours” when dealing with CIA contacts within the CBS news organization, as well as with stringers working for other national publications.53 Other facets of CBS policy demonstrated", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:46:d671e132576b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 340, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 47, "text": "CIA-sponsored projects abroad.52 In February 1976, prior to the formation of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), CIA Director George H.W.

Reports and editorials criticizing the Truman Doctrine, the Korean War and the early McCarthy era were aggressively discouraged. The former president of CBS News, Fred Friendly, has written about the pressure he received from Frank Stanton regarding dove positions on the Vietnam War, “… his [Stanton’s] concern was that too much ‘dovehawk’ talk unsteadied the hand of the Commander-In-Chief.” Friendly admitted that “… in my almost two years as head of CBS news I tempered my news judgment and tailored my conscience more than once.”54 All CBS employees signed loyalty oaths and all news guests were checked in advance for their political background. CBS also shared information with NBC for cross-checking, according to Frank Stanton.55 In testimony before the Pike Committee former CBS and ABC foreign correspondent Sam Jaffe revealed that he had been an FBI agent. He asserted that leading anchorman Walter Cronkite (CBS) and John Chancellor (NBC) had worked for the CIA when they were foreign correspondents in Moscow, though Cronkite and Chancellor denied this.56 NBC was owned by RCA in 1963 when the RCA Chairman of the Board was “General” David Sarnoff. During WWII Sarnoff worked in the Signal Corps and restored the destroyed Radio France, which was renamed Radio Free Europe. RFE become a major project of Allen Dulles. RCA became the technological base of the National Security Agency (NSA), and Sarnoff helped staff the NSA in the 1950’s. Sarnoff ’s son Robert worked in broadcasting for the OSS. David Sarnoff was also a member of the Citizen’s Committee on Communications for International Cooperation and a former president as well as a permanent director of the Armed Forces Communication and Electronics Association (AFCEA). Sarnoff claimed that AFCEA “serves the industry military team.”In an address to the organization Sarnoff observed, “AFCEA has fashioned a community of interest so closely interwoven that whatever affects the progress of one partner is reflected in the progress of the other.” Among the directors of AFCEA were: Lt. General Gordon Blake, formerly Director of the National Security Agency; James McNitt, President of IT&T; Lowell Wingert, VP of AT&T; Lt. General Harold Grant, USAF, Director of Telecommunications Policy in the Department of Defense; and Lt. General R. P.

Just the year before ABC was bought by Cap Cities, a conglomerate with strong ties to the American intelligence community. William Casey, the recently resigned Director of the CIA, was a founder and former director of Cap Cities. Thomas Murphy, the executive at Cap Cities, also had voting control of Resorts Intertel, the largest private security and spy organization in America. (Networks of Power: Corporate TV’s Threat to Democracy by Dennis Mazzocco, Boston: South End Press 1994, page 4). Ruby. After Yale, McLendon served as an intelligence officer in ONI before making his fortune in radio. In 1967, McLendon worked with CIA officer David Phillips, an expert in psychological warfare, to develop a CBS series on the exploits of the CIA. He invested with oil baron Clint Murchison, one of LBJ’s major supporters, and he was friendly with Bobby Baker, LBJ’s aide; yet most notably McLendon was the first person Jack Ruby asked to see in prison. However, many of McLendon’s records remain classified. 58 DCI William Colby began his remarks to the American Society of Newspaper Publishers in 1975, “The press and the CIA have much in common. After all, aren’t we all in the information business?” Colby pleaded that the CIA needed a good deal less public attention as well as the keeping of “good secrets.” The FBI attempted to influence public opinion by supplying information or articles to “confidential sources” in the news media. The FBI’s Crime Records Division was responsible for covert liaison with the media to advance two main domestic intelligence objectives: 1) providing derogatory information to the media intended to generally discredit the activities or ideas of targeted groups or individuals; and 2) disseminating unfavorable articles, news releases and background information in order to disrupt particular activities. Typically a local FBI agent would provide information to a “friendly news source” on the condition “that the bureau’s interest … be kept in the strictest confidence.”Thomas E. Bishop a former director of the Crime Records Division testified that he kept a list of the bureau’s “press friends” in his desk… After a public meeting in New York City, where the “handling of the ( JFK assassination) investigation was criticized” the FBI prepared a news item for placement “with a cooperative media source to discredit the meeting on the grounds that “a reliable FBI source” had reported a “convicted perjurer and identified espionage agent was present in the audience…” 60 Code of Wartime Practices to guide", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:48:48630c35eedf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 342, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 49, "text": "Division testified that he kept a list of the bureau’s “press friends” in his desk… After a public meeting in New York City, where the “handling of the ( JFK assassination) investigation was criticized” the FBI prepared a news item for placement “with a cooperative media source to discredit the meeting on the grounds that “a reliable FBI source” had reported a “convicted perjurer and identified espionage agent was present in the audience…” 60 Code of Wartime Practices to guide editors, headed this wartime operation. It was not required that news copy be submitted to the director of censorship prior to publication but generally editors and broadcasters complied with the code. After WWII, Price’s deputy, Theodore Koop, the Director of CBS News in Washington, served as standby director of censorship. Two-dozen persons, including a few active and former newsmen, served on this rarely activated committee. Major revisions in the Censorship Code occurred from 1958 to 1963 so that, if activated by a President, the government would ask AP and UPI to move the code on their wires and would leave it in the hands of the news media “within forty-five to sixty minutes.” The government has set up a “Standby Voluntary Censorship Code” and has planned all the bureaucratic trappings necessary to enforce the code. The plan would “become effective either in wartime or some undefined national emergency.” The plans are ready to be applied in “all kinds of less than war situations.” …Only 5 of the 26 board members are working newsmen, “the rest are public relations men; businessman; government employees; college professors or listed merely as retired. In the event of a crisis, members of the standby censorship office would be dispatched throughout the country to monitor and censor all channels of communication, from private letters to telephone calls to public television and radio broadcasts. The genteel collegiality of media elites and the top people in national security remained steadfast during the Cold War, strengthening a consensus of policy. According to award winning journalist David Halberstam, an unspoken assumption was that debate would help the enemy. The great heads of the media were anxious to be good loyal citizens, and working reporters themselves had almost without question accepted the word of the White House on foreign policy. The height of this credulousness had come during the Kennedy years. Kennedy had shrewdly made the most verbal and articulate members of his administration available to the press, their information made more pure and less political by the fact that many of them came from academe or seemed to come from academe.62 Cold War cooperation was extensive during the Bay of Pigs operation.

Before the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961 reporters and editors at both the New York Times and Washington Post knew of the invasion and wanted to print stories and editorials critical of it. The hierarchy at the Washington Post, including Phil Graham, Fred Friendly, Chalmers Roberts, and Al Wiggens found no fault with the CIA operation and hoped it would succeed. Critical articles and editorials were crushed. According to Halberstam “… the Post at the time of the Bay of Pigs, did not criticize the most important issue of that disaster, the fact that the machinery (of government) was out of control; … the editors of the Post were simply too close to that machinery.”63 The New York Times was also planning to run a story prior to the invasion, by reporter Tad Szulc. But when word leaked out, President Kennedy called Times Washington Bureau Chief, James “Scotty” Reston to kill the story. A heated debate among Times editors and publisher Orvil Dryfoos ensued which led to a gutting of the story. Miami newspapers were submitting copy to the CIA for “clearance” and the Miami Herald admitted withholding a story on the Guatemalan airlift for two months until the news appeared elsewhere. The Miami News published a cover story denying the projected invasion of Cuba, contradicting its own earlier predictions – though certain that this story was untrue. Copley News Service, and particularly William Gandoni, later the Latin American editor, knew of the invasion in late 1960 and both suppressed the news and wrote stories downplaying the invasion possibility. It also appears that the Associated Press and United Press International suppressed the story as well. The Nation editor Jesse Gordon dispatched material to AP and UPI three times revealing the Guatemalan training, yet it failed to reach the Latin American desks of those particular wire services.64 As with all presidents, Kennedy tried surreptitiously to manage aspects of the news. Close friend Washington Post Editor, Ben Bradlee would serve as a confidant as well as a source of information. Kennedy the witty raconteur would critique news coverage, and suggest leads, topics, and perspectives, the epitome of a respectful and friendly government-media symbiosis.65 In Vietnam from 1961-1964 the U.S. reporters in Saigon knew how poorly the war was going yet visiting journalists with strong military and CIA connections, like Joe Alsop and Marguerite Higgins, traveled there to strengthen existing policy rather than to report facts. Halberstam recalled a time when Alsop lectured a group of resident reporters about the poor progress of the war: Alsop said, “Who cares about that? That had nothing to do with it.

Halberstam recalled a time when Alsop lectured a group of resident reporters about the poor progress of the war: Alsop said, “Who cares about that? That had nothing to do with it. You are naive to report so pessimistically. It was unpatriotic on the part of the local men, and it would, of course, cost them their careers. You’ll be like the fools that lost their jobs in China…” Alsop proceeded to write many columns saying that their negative reporting was undermining the war effort. Newsweek Bureau Chief in Saigon, Everett Martin noted that Alsop had open use of a military jet and that “he doesn’t get briefed by the Colonels, he briefs them.” Alsop printed stories for the CIA whether they were true or not. He never denied his ties to the CIA, stating “I’m proud they asked me and proud to have done it.” Later, Alsop would be one of the early voices pressuring President Johnson to create what became the Warren Commission.67 Time magazine was notably aggressive in creating a successful war effort in Vietnam. Veteran reporters Charles Mohr and Mert Perry had their extensive analysis of an American failed policy immediately rewritten into an optimistic assessment. U.S. reporters in Vietnam were characterized as forming a “club” which focused on negative stories.68 Veteran reporter Arthur Krock who had worked with JFK on his college thesis, wrote in the New York Times, 2/25/63 that “news management not only exists, but in the form of direct and deliberate action has been enforced more cynically and boldly than by any previous administration in a period when the U.S. was not at war.” The Kennedy White House, unaccustomed to dissenting reporters, began a publicity campaign to sell Saigon through Washington-based reporters to the American people. President Johnson, who liked to do his own briefings for reporters headed to Vietnam, continued these efforts. Johnson once admonished, “Don’t be like those boys Halberstam and Sheehan.… They’re traitors to their country.”69 Sometimes, however, elements of the elite-media-CIA network had other connections and independent agendas. Apparently without the knowledge of the State Department or the President, in September of 1963, an anti-Castro raid alternately known as the “Bayo-Pawley mission”; “Operation Red Cross”; and in the CIA as “Operation Tilt,” was coordinated among elements of the CIA, mafia and Time-Life.

The plan was to bring the Soviet colonels to the U.S., but rather than turn them over to the government, a press conference would be held. This would serve to embarrass President Kennedy and pressure him to get tough in Cuba.70 The mission also included John Martino, an associate of Mafioso Santos Trafficante, who later claimed to be a CIA contract agent; Loran Hall, also an associate of Trafficante and California Chairman for James Milteer’s racist Constitution Party; Eddie Bayo; Rolando Martinez, an activist Cuban exile and contract CIA employee (who would later be convicted in the Watergate burglary); William “Rip” Robertson, a CIA veteran who may or may not have still been with the CIA, and a close friend of John Roselli; former Life photographer Terrance Spencer; and Richard Billings, editor of Life magazine, later a reporter of the JFK assassination and chosen to be the editorial editor for the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). William Pawley, who in pre-Castro Cuba owned the Havana bus system as well as sugar mills, was a close friend of Richard Nixon, Henry Luce, and Allen Dulles.71 He had used his business cover to cooperate on clandestine operations with the CIA including the Guatemalan coup as well as lobbying President Eisenhower to approve the Bay of Pigs plan. Back in 1954, Pawley had served on the Eisenhower Doolittle Commission, which cleared the CIA director to fight the Cold War without rules. A member of the old boys CIA network, the dapper tycoon provided his yacht the Flying Tiger II, and coordinated security for the mission. Others involved in the planning included Gerry Patrick Hemming, Frank Sturgis (born Frank Fiorino) both military assets, and the powerful Senator James O. Eastland. Much later the House Select Committee on Assassinations learned that Julian Sourwine, counsel to the Senate Internal Security Committee, “was involved in financing the operation” and that it “saw evidence that the CIA knew of Sourwine’s involvement.”72 Life Managing Editor George P. Hunt contributed $15, 000 . According to former Life staff writer Miguel Acoca, “A deal was made between Life and the CIA, that for providing the operational funds, Life would receive an exclusive if the operation was successful.

If it were not, Life agreed not to publish anything concerning the operation.”73 If the plot/operation succeeded, Kennedy’s credibility would be weakened, and it would strengthen the case for an invasion of Cuba. The reasons for this failed mission remain a mystery. Approved by every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Operation Northwoods called for terrorism against Americans to be blamed on Cubans including: innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington D.C, Miami and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phony evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro, thus giving General Lemnitzer and his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and international backing to launch their war.74 This extensive elite-CIA-mass media cooperation has many unexplored dimensions since the government and the mass media avoid discussing these relationships. The Senate Intelligence Committee examined CIA-mass-media connections in 1977, in what is referred to as the Congressional Bader Report, yet it remains classified. Imagine this massive network set in motion domestically to protect misperceptions of national security, after President Kennedy was assassinated, which was concocted by a dissident elite-CIA faction. Or worse, imagine that this massive network was engaged to create misperceptions of national security, concocted by a dissident elite-CIA faction, after the assassination. he Soviet Union, Cuba, American intelligence agencies, and even President Johnson were possible suspects in the assassination of President Kennedy. Transcripts of President Lyndon Johnson’s phone calls made immediately after the assassination of JFK reveal his aggressive courtship of the mass media, which may have exceeded that of his predecessors. Johnson quickly understood he would have to contend with competing and murky investigations with ominous implications. Almost immediately after he assumed the presidency, the CIA sent Johnson unclear and misleading information regarding Oswald. The source of the information on Oswald’s actions in Mexico City was the CIA. According to historian Michael Bechloss, CIA Director John Mc-Cone briefed Johnson on the morning of 11/23/63 , regarding foreign connections to Lee Harvey Oswald. This version of events supposedly suggested to LBJ that Kennedy might have been murdered by an international conspiracy. Hoover: No, that’s one angle that’s very confusing for this reason.

We have up here the tape and photograph of the man who was at the Soviet Embassy, using Oswald’s name. That picture and tape do not correspond to this man’s voice or appearance. In other words, it appears that there is a second person that was at the Soviet Embassy. The CIA had claimed that the surveillance tapes of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico were routinely destroyed prior to the assassination, leaving only transcripts as evidence. Documents released in the 1990s, however, corroborate Hoover’s statement. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (1977-1979) staff report on Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, “The Lopez Report,” revealed an FBI memo from Alan Belmont to Clyde Tolson 11/23/63: The CIA advised that on October 1, 1963 an extremely sensitive source [wire tap] had reported that an individual identified himself as Lee Oswald, who contacted the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring as to any messages. Special Agents of this Bureau who have conversed with Oswald in Dallas, Texas, have observed photographs of the individual referred to above and have listened to his voice. These Special Agents are of the opinion that the above referred- to- individual was not Lee Harvey Oswald. On one of these “Oswald” tapes the caller identifies himself as “Lee Harvey Oswald” and then refers to a previous meeting with a man named Kostikov. Varerij Kostikov was a known KGB agent supposedly working in the Soviet Embassy, and a member of KGB’s “Department 13,” which dealt with sabotage and assassinations. Hoover was aware of the CIA double dealing on Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, and he continued to talk to Johnson. When researcher Rex Bradford bought a copy of this tape of LBJ talking to Hoover from the LBJ library in 2000 he found that the next critical fourteen minutes were silent – yet the tape, both before and after, sounded clear! Curiously, just the transcript of the fourteen minutes remains. Whatever Hoover and Johnson actually thought may have been lost to history (though as with the eighteen-minute gap on the Nixon Watergate tapes, an audio engineer might be able to determine when and how the erasure occurred). They surely surmised that the CIA rather than the Cubans or Soviets was concealing evidence or setting up Oswald. Either way, this information would not see the light of day. A thorough investigation could reveal CIA complicity, or incredible incompetence.

Based on early FBI reports it strains credibility that Oswald was part of a communist plot … a scenario which could have led to public sentiment for retaliation – war with Cuba and probably escalating to war with the Soviet Union. Johnson also became concerned that the Dallas prosecutors were threatening to charge Oswald with killing Kennedy as part of “an international Communist conspiracy,” so he directed his aides to cajole the Dallas D.A. Henry Wade to support a Texas Court of Inquiry. On Monday, November 25^(th) , an hour before President Kennedy’s funeral ceremonies, Johnson called J. Edgar Hoover. LBJ: Apparently some lawyer in Justice is lobbying the Washington Post because that’s where the suggestion came from for this presidential commission, which we think would be very bad and put it right in the White House … the Post is calling up saying they are going to run an editorial if we don’t do things. Now we’re going to do two things I wanted you to know about it. One – we believe that the way to handle this, as we said yesterday – your suggestion – that we put every facility at your command making a full report to the Attorney General and then make it available to the country in any form that seem desirable. Second – it’s a state matter too and the State Attorney General is young and able and prudent and very cooperative with you. J. Alsop: Let me make one suggestion because I think this bridges the gap which I believe and Dean Acheson [Secretary of State under Truman and the architect of the U.S. East Asian policy] believes still exists … and [Al] Friendly [Washington Post managing editor] is going to come out tomorrow morning with a big thing about a blue ribbon commission which he thought of independently … I suggest that you announce that as you do not want the Attorney General to have the painful responsibility of reporting on his own brother’s assassination, that you have authorized the three jurists and I would suggest the Texas jurists and two non-Texas jurists to review all of the evidence by the FBI and produce a report to the nation for the nation … you’ve been simply marvelous in the most painful circumstances, but I do feel that there is that much of gap, and I’m sure that if Moyers [Bill Moyers, White House press adviser] calls Friendly, you have a terrific support from the Washington Post and from the whole of the rest of the press instantly… J.

Alsop: No you won’t … no you won’t … just use the procedures you’ve got and add to those procedures a statement saying that “when the FBI has completed its work, when it has completed its work…you have asked two or three, including I would include the best judge on the Texas bench … American jurists beyond, or individuals, Dean Acheson, for example, two or three individuals beyond any possible suspicion as to their independence and impartiality, to draw up a written report giving to the public everything of the FBI that is relevant and then you will have this written report … which is not Texas which tells the whole story which is based on FBI evidence … it doesn’t need to use the things that the FBI says can’t be used. Alsop: If you make this decision and have Moyers call Friendly or Kay [Graham] instead of being … well you know … this is what we ought to do … this is what ought to be done and then [rather than] what you do being denounced as inadequate, they’ll be put so hard and will do you a tremendous piece and I’m sure you’ll have the strongest possible support… FBI Director Hoover was then instructed by Johnson to communicate a general agreement on investigation strategies to the Washington Post that day. An FBI memo shows that Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach called Washington Post editor Russell Wiggins and told him that “the Department of Justice seriously hoped that the Washington Post would not encourage any special means by which the facts should be made available to the public.” The memo also notes that an FBI agent had a similar conversation with Al Friendly, the Washington Post’s managing editor. The editorial never appeared. Johnson accepted this “advice” and soon jested that the “Kay Graham” commission had been formed. The FBI actually was the sole source of information for the commission. Thus Alsop, along with the hawkish Dean Acheson, gave legal as well as P.R. “advice.” LBJ’s intimate relationship with CBS, NBC, the L.A. Times and U.S. News & World Report was seen in short calls made on November 27th.

A conversation with powerful Senator James Eastland, 11/28, reveals Johnson’s political skills to consolidate the investigation under his control as well as his fears. Senator Eastland, Chairman of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, shared a national security mindset and perhaps even had prior knowledge about Oswald from the Louisiana Un-American Activities Committee. Senator Eastland: Well … we plan to hold hearings and just make a record of what the proof is … that is all. Show that this man was the assassin. To begin with we’ve had a great number of Senators that have come to me to us to request to … beginning with Morse… that it be done…now if you want it dropped … we’ll drop it… LBJ: …if we could have two Congressman and two Senators … and maybe a justice of the Supreme Court to take the FBI report and review it and write a report … and do anything they felt needed to be done … this is a very explosive thing and it could be a very dangerous thing for the country … and a little publicity could just fan the flames… LBJ: …it concerns Hoover and the Secretary of State and some others. We’re trying to avoid all the House Committee, Hale Boggs and a bunch has got things started over there and Jim Eastland and Ev Dirksen and a bunch has got them started in the Senate … and Bobby Kennedy has his ideas … Hoover has got his report and they want Dewey in … so I’ve about concluded that I can get people pretty well together and I talked to the leadership on trying to have the three branches … have two Congressman and two Senators … and maybe two or three outsiders and maybe somebody from the Court … or at least some person of a judicial background … that are absolutely top flight folks … on about a 7 men board", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:57:f0444bfe16e1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 351, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 58, "text": "Hoover has got his report and they want Dewey in … so I’ve about concluded that I can get people pretty well together and I talked to the leadership on trying to have the three branches … have two Congressman and two Senators … and maybe two or three outsiders and maybe somebody from the Court … or at least some person of a judicial background … that are absolutely top flight folks … on about a 7 men board to evaluate Hoover’s report and it would be largely done by staff … but they can work on it … and I want to get your reaction to it.

Greek philosopher Plato admonished Greek leaders that a “Noble Lie” was necessary from mythmakers to maintain elite power for societal security. Lyndon Johnson was similarly inclined. Former President Harry Truman would later assess the difference between real truth and political truth; “Political truth can be the biggest damnedest lie ever, but if motivated toward a pragmatic goal, preferably for reasons of national security, and stated with total belief and fervor, it becomes true.” What President Johnson believed when he spoke to senators, congressmen, Earl Warren and the mass media, remains uncertain? If he did believe most of it, then the CIA manipulated the new president, and provided a national security rationale to facilitate a cover-up. Johnson was possibly protecting himself as well, and knew the value of a compelling cover story. L scenario. Then following the rapid release of the five volume FBI Report on the assassination, most of the mainstream media ap-peared content to wait for the Warren Commission findings rather than while the New York Times and the Associated Press steadily printed FBI leaks. A few mainstream journalists raised critical questions, notably Lonnie Hudkins of the Houston Post, Eric Norden a freelance reporter, and Dorothy Kilgallen of the New York Journal-American. Some media outlets and press organizations criticized the press for failing to protect Oswald’s legal rights, while most commended the crisis coverage as comprehensive. The alternative media, though faint, was finding a critical voice. Now that Time-Life had time to analyze the Zapruder film, let’s review their interpretation in their 12/6/63 Life issue.

The alternative media, though faint, was finding a critical voice. Now that Time-Life had time to analyze the Zapruder film, let’s review their interpretation in their 12/6/63 Life issue. In “End of Nagging Rumors: The Six Critical Seconds,” reporter Paul Mandel simply stated that Oswald shot President Kennedy in the throat, from the rear, and that Oswald’s rifle could fire three shots fast enough. In describing the Zapruder film, Mandel asserted that the first shot hit the President in the throat; 4.1 seconds later, a shot hit Governor Connally; and 2.7 seconds after that the final bullet struck the President’s head. This description placed the first shot to hit Kennedy at a point just under one second before he temporarily disappeared from the film as a road sign came between Zapruder and the limousine. The film, however, actually showed the President smiling and waving to the crowd before he disappeared behind the sign. Similarly, the film contradicts Mandel’s description of when Connally was hit. Nearly two seconds before Mandel claimed Connally was hit, Connally’s shoulder collapses, his hair flies up and his face contorts in pain – leaving no doubt when he was shot. Public airing of the Zapruder film could have allowed the country to witness the assassination, yet Life magazine not only withheld the film, it consistently misreported what the film showed. Mandel asserted that the Zapruder film “shows the President turning his body far around to the right as he waves to someone in the crowd. His throat is exposed to the sniper’s nest just before he clutches it.” A simple viewing of the Zapruder film reveals this statement to be a fabrication. The rest of the one-page piece read like a synopsis of the soon to be released FBI report. This suggests that Mandel was assured that the Zapruder film would stay suppressed. Time, 12/6/63, printed just four frames of the Zapruder film, which purportedly show Jackie Kennedy crawling on the trunk to help a Secret Agent aboard. Although Time asserted that the film “made what happened horrifyingly clear,” they chose to describe a three-shot scenario, with “the third shot, all too literally, exploding in Kennedy’s head.” No mention was made regarding 1) Jackie Kennedy picking up part of the president’s brain on the trunk; or 2) the president’s head snapping backward violently. Again, no mention of Dallas citizens and police running bravely toward the grassy knoll after the shots were fired. Oswald they referred to as “The Man Who Killed Kennedy,” and as a hateful Marxist nut that frequently beat his wife. The evidence was viewed as “overwhelming.” Astoundingly they also claimed that a “lonely", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:61:1f10fa7dd9b0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 355, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 62, "text": "head.” No mention was made regarding 1) Jackie Kennedy picking up part of the president’s brain on the trunk; or 2) the president’s head snapping backward violently.

Oswald they referred to as “The Man Who Killed Kennedy,” and as a hateful Marxist nut that frequently beat his wife. The evidence was viewed as “overwhelming.” Astoundingly they also claimed that a “lonely psychopath” killed President Lincoln, apparently to strengthen the impression of Oswald as a lone nut. Jack Ruby was described as an emotional, anti-communist patriot, “a real guy,” “Sparky” to his friends, and as a man who acted alone. Time-Life, Inc. also denied access to the Zapruder film for use in either a motion picture or a TV documentary. Life even failed to grant one of its consultants, author Josiah Thompson, the reproduction rights to the film’s frames for a book. When Thompson’s publisher offered Life all of the profits from the book in exchange for publication rights to the frames, Life still balked. When the book was published in 1966 with sketches replacing the missing frames, Life sued to stop the sale of the book. They lost and from these sketches America first saw President Kennedy’s head snap backward, not forward, after being hit. It seems possible that his past service in national intelligence affected the journalistic judgment of Time’s Senior Vice-President C. D. Jackson. He was General Eisenhower’s expert on psychological warfare when he was CBS president Colonel William Paley’s boss at the Office of War Information during WWII. By 1953, Jackson was appointed chief of the Psychological Strategy Board, a White House agency to promote covert operations. He subsequently directed Radio Free Europe and later served as a CIA analyst. Recall that prior to the position at Life, Jackson headed the board of directors of the National Committee for a Free Europe (NCFE) along with Henry Luce of Time-Life, Eugene Lyons of Reader’s Digest, Allen Dulles of the CIA and former OSS chief William Donovan. (The OSS, Office of Strategic Services, was the precursor to the CIA.) The NCFE channeled CIA funds to neo-Nazi émigré groups intent on “liberating” Eastern Europe. While a Time executive, Jackson coauthored a CIA-sponsored study to reorganize American intelligence services. 12/6/63, that FBI agents wondered “How the President could have received a bullet in the front of the throat from a rifle in the Texas School Book Depository building, after his car had passed the building? … One explanation from a competent source was that the President had turned to his right to wave, and was struck at that moment.” Eleven days after the assassination the FBI leaked an overview of its assassination report to the Dallas Times Herald.

The overview was run with its conclusion unquestioned. Meanwhile, Washington sources said the extensive FBI report, just being completed, would depict Oswald as a lone and unaided assassin. Since Oswald had met regularly with FBI agent Hosty in Dallas, FBI agents Quigley and de Brueys in New Orleans, and had worked with “retired” FBI man Guy Banister in New Orleans, how could these assertions crop up? This appears to be another “phase one” story to justify the “phase two” – Oswald the lone nut, version. Earlier, in 1963 Guy Richards used his FBI connections and arranged a meeting with John Malone and reporter Michael Eddowes to be briefed for a story on JFK’s affair with London call girl, Mariella Novotny. This story, which referred to “one of the biggest names in American politics,” appeared just after Kennedy’s peace speech at American University, and caused Robert Kennedy to threaten the New York Journal-American with an anti-trust suit if it did not drop the matter.2 Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Joseph Goulden, 12/8/63, revealed in his story that Oswald had at one time been contacted by the FBI to become an informant. Goulden said he obtained this from a law enforcement officer in Dallas whom he declined to identify. Goulden was an old friend of Lonnie Hudkins, who would soon develop the story of FBI connections to Oswald. On December 9, 1963, J. Edgar Hoover gave President Johnson a confidential 5-volume summary of the FBI report which concluded that Oswald was a lone assassin, that Jack Ruby acted alone, and that there was no conspiracy. FBI Assistant Director Cartha “Deke” DeLoach leaked the report to the Washington Star and the Chicago Tribune. The wire services then picked up the story from the Star. Earl Warren confided to Senator Russell, “I tell you frankly; I just don’t find anything in the [FBI Summary] report that had not been leaked to the press.” Wall Street Journal editor, Vermont Royster, absolved the nation of guilt by emphasizing negligence as the cause in his editorial (12/9/63). Any public indictment of American society or the people of Dallas were described as vicious. The word negligence was used seven times: “…some of this negligence could be laid to all of us … But this is something different than indictment … the tragic acts of madmen [should not] cast a shadow on the whole of America.” A December 11, 1963 teletype from the FBI office in New York to J.

Edgar Hoover indicated that NBC had given the FBI assurances that it would “televise only those items which are in consonance with the bureau report [on the assassination].” This eight-page message details the nature of NBC’s research. “NBC has movie film taken at some one hundred and fifty feet showing a Dallas Police Department officer rushing into the Book Depository building while most of the police and Secret Service were rushing up an incline towards the railroad trestle in front of the motorcade.” Hoover also released information to “very friendly” journalists such as Jeremiah O’Leary, and others, such as Drew Pearson. Pearson had worked closely with CIA-directed Radio Free Europe which led to the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA) in the 1950s, and work as a contact agent for the CIA in the 1960s. The Dallas Morning News (12/13) was unconvinced. Without naming witness James Tague, they asked “Did a bullet from Lee Harvey Oswald’s rifle clip the curb on Main Street near the triple underpass?” “These are the bedrock facts about the Kennedy assassination and its aftermath that the FBI, after the most exhaustive investigation of its type in history, feels it has nailed down beyond doubt.” The story proceeded to psychologize about Oswald’s motive, and then defended the weary and often overworked Secret Service. Newsweek, 12/16/63, ran a headline to its article, “Portrait of a Psychopath” about Oswald. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 12/18/63, revealed that [the Secret Service] obtained a reversal of their original view that the bullet in the neck entered from the front. The investigators did so by showing the surgeons a document described as an autopsy report from the U.S. Naval Hospital in Bethesda. We now know that Secret Service agents Elmer Moore and Roger Warren pressured Dr. Malcolm Perry for hours the evening of the assassination to stop describing Kennedy’s throat wound as one of entrance. Moore told grad student James Gochenaur in 1970 that he “leaned on Dr. Perry.”3 Former Chief Operating Room nurse at Parkland Hospital, Audrey Bell, told ARRB member Doug Horne that “Dr. Perry was in a state of torment on November 23, 1963, after being pressured all night long to change his mind.” In December 1963, FBI agents attempted to dissuade Saga, a men’s magazine, from printing a critique of FBI security measures related to the assassination authored by ex-FBI agent William Turner.

After quitting the FBI, Turner had blown the whistle on FBI practices – thus spurring the FBI to closely track his actions. Turner’s revelation was that the Dallas FBI was not only meeting with Oswald but did not inform the Dallas Police or the Secret Service through the usual procedure of a “risk list.” FOIA releases determined that FBI supervisor William Clark, who tracked Turner, had been notified from a source in the publishing industry about the upcoming Saga article. Attempts to thwart the critical story had started too late. Editor Al Silverman resisted the efforts of two FBI agents to withhold the piece and he boldly printed “The FBI Could Have Saved President Kennedy’s Life” in March 1964. Hoover’s “good friends” at the Chicago Tribune, Herb Lyons and Ed Sullivan, quickly denounced the article.4 FBI files show “corrective” interviews with the employers and backers of journalists who had touched upon Oswald’s relationship with the FBI. Drew Pearson, for example, reported that the FBI had interviewed Oswald six days before the assassination, yet failed to notify the Secret Service about him. Assistant FBI Director Cartha DeLoach interviewed one of the chief stockholders of Pearson’s distribution syndicate and “furnished him sufficient information to refute all of Pearson’s facts,” and arranged for a stockholder to report back on his corrections of Pearson.5 By the end of 1963 the Associated Press released their version of the assassination, The Torch is Passed, an undocumented account attributed to over 100 AP reporters. This brief account faithfully echoed the 5-volume FBI report. No questions were raised as to Oswald’s guilt, his ties to intelligence agencies, or for that matter, his ties to anyone. The threeshot scenario was not questioned, and they failed to even account for the bullet wound in President Kennedy’s neck, just as the FBI reports had done. Recall that an AP representative had seen the Zapruder film prior to Time-Life purchasing it. No questions were raised regarding the paraffin test or the reports of a German Mauser rifle found by Dallas police. No questions were raised regarding Oswald’s past – he was simply viewed as “a confused Marxist.” No questions were raised regarding his trip to Mexico City and his “visits” to the Cuban and Russian embassies there. The evidence against him [Oswald] was impressive: ballistics tests proved that the rifle bearing Oswald’s prints was the murder weapon; an order, in Oswald’s handwriting, showed he had purchased the rifle from a mail order house;", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:65:965c2e0afa27", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 359, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 66, "text": "a German Mauser rifle found by Dallas police.

Somehow based on a New York City school psychiatrist’s report “Oswald was a potentially dangerous schizophrenic.” “Oswald traveled to Moscow in 1959, and tried to renounce his American citizenship. He returned to America with the help of – and a loan from – the U.S. Government in 1962, bringing a Russian wife. He preached Marxism.” The UPI raised no questions on any of these seeming contradictions regarding Oswald’s life – or Jack Ruby’s. Ruby was reported as a “one man vigilante,” who put great emphasis on “class” and who “admired” the police. Regarding motive, UPI simply reported “his sister told reporters that his motive for killing Oswald must have been his intense admiration for Kennedy.”8 Thus the major news services seemed content to consolidate the government position on the assassination. Generally the mass media trade publications proudly praised the American mass media coverage of the assassination. In its 1963 report the Associated Press declared that it had “thrown more resources into covering the assassination than any single news event in its history.” An editorial in Editor and Publisher effusively proclaimed that the assassination story was “the most amazing performance by newspapers, radio and television that the world has ever witnessed.” Broadcasting magazine similarly deemed self-congratulations to be apt regarding the coverage of the assassination.9 While the American press reacted with excessive caution and what appears to have been a widespread voluntary prior restraint, the leading French press was highly critical of a U.S. government cover-up. Influential conservative journalist Raymond Cartier, writing in Paris Match, a journal similar to Life, observed in December 1963: The leading French conservative newspaper Le Figaro charged the U.S. investigators with “contradictions, obscurities, intentional omissions, and deliberate lies.” Le Monde argued that the contradictions were the result of inadequate security precautions or “they considered it advisable to choose a ‘suspect’ in advance, who could be charged with full responsibility … while at the same time shielding the real criminal.” One month after the assassination the Washington Post briefly raised a red flag by running an editorial from former President Harry Truman warning a still stunned nation about CIA excesses. “[The CIA] has become an operational and at times policy-making arm of the Government.… There is something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting a shadow over", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:66:b1f5c724cb8e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 360, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "in advance, who could be charged with full responsibility … while at the same time shielding the real criminal.” One month after the assassination the Washington Post briefly raised a red flag by running an editorial from former President Harry Truman warning a still stunned nation about CIA excesses. “[The CIA] has become an operational and at times policy-making arm of the Government.… There is something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting a shadow over our historic position and I feel that we need to correct it.” This editorial only appeared in the morning edition and was not picked up by other media outlets. Truman’s admonition along with that of conservative reporter, Arthur Krock, on the front page of the New York Times, back on 10/03/63, clearly called for exploring the role of the CIA in the event of a cover-up. Yet, these explicit warnings failed to motivate the media to examine CIA involvement. Truman reiterated his concerns to Look’s managing editor, 6/10/64 . The experiences of an early critic, former New York State Senator Mark Lane, suggest that the chilling impact of the McCarthy hearings on the news media remained a vivid memory even after a decade. Some newsmen, such as staunch anti-communist James Wechsler, editor of the then-liberal New York Post, had been vigorously grilled for their past associations as well as criticisms of Senator Joe McCarthy’s methods. Lane, a criminal attorney, had contacts in both alternative and mainstream media, and tried to publish gratis a critical review of the public statements from Dallas D.A. Henry Wade. He first called his friend Carey McWilliams, editor of The Nation, but McWilliams told him “don’t bring it over … I am sorry but we have decided not to touch that subject.” Look, Life, Saturday Evening Post, The New Republic, Progressive and Fact also turned down Lane. Lane’s friend, James Wechsler, still an editor of the New York Post, was unable to find anyone to publish it and turned him down as well. Lane was turned down by seventeen media outlets, and was reluctant to run it in a leftist journal whose circulation would not be as broad as necessary. The only journal which did publish the article was The National Guardian, an independent left publication, edited by James Aronson. The National Guardian sent advanced proofs to UPI, but UPI stated that, “They wouldn’t touch it.” Aronson called his old employer, the New York Times, and was told “they would not do it.” The 12/19/63 issue of The National Guardian sold out quickly, as did the additional 50,000 reprints. A number of publications in other countries, however, printed Lane’s critique, including Paese Sera and Oggi in Italy, Liberation in Paris, as well as newspapers in Japan and Mexico. “That which intervenes between the zealous investigator and the jury is due process of law, developed at great", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:67:63514ec29218", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 361, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 68, "text": "Aronson called his old employer, the New York Times, and was told “they would not do it.” The 12/19/63 issue of The National Guardian sold out quickly, as did the additional 50,000 reprints.

It is the right to have facts … cross-examination … perhaps above all the right to counsel of one’s own choice, so that all the other rights may be protected… … Our national conscience must reject the massive media conviction of Oswald – presumed to be innocent – and begin to examine and analyze the evidence … Our national renaissance must begin with a respect for law and disdain for the hysteria that has thus far made fair consideration of this case impossible. The Nation, too has been curious about the obvious discrepancies, inconsistencies, gaps and unexplained aspects of the three murders [Kennedy, Tippit, and Oswald], but has resisted the temptation to enter [the process of speculation … until an ‘official’ version of the facts is available. The public is entitled to nothing less [than all the known facts]… For our part, we intend to make an independent assessment of whatever ‘official’ report is eventually released. The New Republic, a leading alternative magazine, 12/21/63, ran a critical piece by Stoughton Lynd and Jack Mimms, “Seeds of Doubt,” which raised contradictions in the FBI report as well as mass media accounts. They questioned the number and location of the shots, the weapon, the palm print on the Mannlicher-Carcano, and the Tippit murder. They reported “police officers were examining the area at the side of the street where the president was hit, and a police inspector told me they had just found another bullet in the grass.” [Photographs show an FBI agent bending to pick up the bullet – which does not become part of the official record] Like Mark Lane, but more measured in tone, they examined the inconsistencies in the mass media coverage and, in particular the New York Times.11 Reporter Richard Dudman, of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and The New Republic clarified Parkland doctor Robert McClelland’s statement that the throat wound was one of entrance. Dudman noted the hole in the windshield of the presidential limousine, and that a police inspector told him of a bullet found in the grass. Dudman was critical of the lack of security on the triple overpass, noting that the Secret Service orders were to keep the overpass clear. Dudman has declined to discuss the assassination with anyone for years. Neither the mainstream media, the press services, nor the alternative press apparently pursued these leads.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:68:1249eae8ed50", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 362, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 69, "text": "wound was one of entrance.

Dudman has declined to discuss the assassination with anyone for years. Neither the mainstream media, the press services, nor the alternative press apparently pursued these leads. On January 1, 1964, Houston Post reporter Lonnie Hudkins, (an alleged CIA asset), probed Oswald’s ties to FBI Agent Hosty, “Oswald Rumored as Informant for U.S.” Hudkins alleged sources were Assistant District Attorney Bill Alexander, who listened to the grilling of Oswald, along with Dallas Sheriff Chief of Command Division Allan Sweatt – the alleged source of Hudkins’ information. Hudkins wrote that “Oswald had Hosty’s home phone, office number, and car license number.” He also noted that Oswald’s mother had been quoted in the Philadelphia Inquirer as stating that a government agent had approached her son. W.R. Hobby, the Executive Vice President and the Executive Editor of the Houston Post, was a member of the Hobby Foundation, a CIA front. The FBI, Secret Service, and Warren Commission counsels quickly denied any connection to Oswald. Whether the CIA was scapegoating the FBI remains unclear. Norman Podhoretz of Commentary, then a center-left journal, raised concerns about the processes and power of the Warren Commission as well as power and public opinion (1/64). He asked if the FBI would act as the commission’s staff. Are no public hearings to be held? Will no effort be made to evaluate the job that was done by the Secret Service, the Dallas police, and the FBI itself ? Is the possibility of a treasonous political conspiracy to be ruled out? He opined, “Not the least fantastic aspect of this whole fantastic nightmare is the ease with which respectable opinion in America has arrived at the conclusion that such a possibility is absurd; The possibility can by no means be dismissed that important men in Washington do know the identity of the conspirators, or at least some of them, and that these conspirators are so powerful that prudence dictates that they not be identified in public.… Let us make the ‘fantastic‘ assumption that President Lyndon Johnson and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy know or believe that the murder was planned by a group of high ranking officers who would stop at nothing to end American – Soviet negotiations. However strong their desire to avenge John F.

Freelance reporter Eric Norden’s critical overview coupled media coverage with careful skepticism in his article “The Death of a President.” He contrasted the early reports from the N.Y. World-Telegram & Sun and the N.Y. Post that described a 7.65 German Mauser, with the later N.Y. Post reports of a Mannlicher-Carcano. Norden shared the sarcasm regarding the Mannlicher-Carcano from the Italian newspaper Carrier Lombardo, “if more than one shot was fired there must have been a second attacker,” as well as the skepticism of The Paris Jour that a non-automatic rifle was fired. Norden noted Oswald’s marksmanship, his location directly after the shooting, the specifics of the Tippit murder, Oswald’s background, his trip to Mexico, the mistakes of the Secret Service, the action of the Dallas Police, Ruby’s connections, the disputed palm print on the rifle, as well as the doubts and critiques of the foreign press from France, England, Germany, Austria, Soviet Union, India and Poland.” Realism instructs us to expect little from the special commission created by President Johnson to investigate the death of his predecessor … no member of the commission has any competence as an investigator, nor does any have access to a disinterested staff. The commission will be almost wholly dependent upon the facts made available to it by the Secret Service, the FBI, and the Dallas Police Department … it is manifestly naïve to expect these cops to bear witness against themselves, or indeed, each other. With the presence on the panel of Allen Dulles, erstwhile headmaster at the CIA, will Oswald’s sojourn in the Soviet Union ever be known…? Norden warned “if the death of the President was a well-organized conspiracy to change the military and political direction of the United States, dark days are ahead of our country.… Americans can best avenge the slaying of John F. Kennedy by searching out those behind the murder … and by making sure that the policies and vision the president’s enemies sought to destroy do not go to the grave with him.”12 In January, nationally syndicated columnist Walter Winchell attacked critic Mark Lane in his column as an “agitator.” and the National Guardian as a “virtual propaganda arm of the Soviet Union.” Ironically, Winchell had cooperated with the CIA’s Operation Mockingbird, a media-CIA propaganda program. The Nation, 1/27/64 , pursued the FBI connection in an article they had previously rejected, “Oswald and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:70:9cd0556352bb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 364, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 71, "text": "sure that the policies and vision the president’s enemies sought to destroy do not go to the grave with him.”12 In January, nationally syndicated columnist Walter Winchell attacked critic Mark Lane in his column as an “agitator.” and the National Guardian as a “virtual propaganda arm of the Soviet Union.” Ironically, Winchell had cooperated with the CIA’s Operation Mockingbird, a media-CIA propaganda program. The Nation, 1/27/64 , pursued the FBI connection in an article they had previously rejected, “Oswald and the FBI” by Harold Feldman, (collaborating with Vince Salandria) and also in an editorial “The Tasks of the Warren Commission.” The article raised possible connections between Oswald and the FBI and CIA, yet the accompanying editorial focused only on the FBI connections. By neglecting the CIA connections The Nation was more easily able to avoid explaining the appointment of former CIA Director Allen Dulles to the Warren Commission. The Nation declared that there was “ample assurance that the Commission will ably discharge the extraordinary responsibilities which it has assumed.” The Nation’s editors did, however, declare that “The American public was gradually coming to the conclusion that the CIA was a self-perpetuating, ever-growing, tax-eating organization of spies, schemers, and bunglers, with a few murderers thrown in.” Early use, analysis, and handling of vital video footage raised more questions about the UPI, as well as the FBI. Abraham Zapruder was not the only amateur photographer well situated to film the assassination. Orville Nix and Mary Muchmore also used 8mm movie cameras from the opposite side of Elm Street. Nix filmed what many researchers believe to be a second gunman on the grassy knoll. He told his friends what he had seen, including his friend in the Secret Service, Forrest Sorrels.13 The FBI then obtained the film from the developing lab, screened it, and returned it to Nix in January 1964. The film was now badly scratched, and the FBI claimed that it was of no further use to the investigation. Nix then sold the film to UPI for $5, 000 . Some stills from the Nix film appeared in the UPI book Four Days, and some of the footage was used in David Wolper’s documentary movie of the same title. Nix used one of the cheapest brands of film, and the developing lab had either underexposed it or underdeveloped it. Although much could still be seen, UPI did not attempt to enlarge and analyze the film until private researchers Jones Harris and Bernie Hoffman began investigating in early 1965 along with UPI news film editor Maurice Schonfeld.14 A more thorough analysis revealed a moving shadow on the grassy knoll while the presidential limousine was in front of it.

Based on a letter from the CIA-funded Cuban Student Directorate, (DRE), 1/29/64, AP, UPI, and the Miami News publicized Jack Ruby’s visits to Cuba. This, belatedly, again pointed the finger at Cuba. Perhaps this was coordinated with a story 1/30/64 , in the Memphis Press-Scimitar. “Oswald was paid Gunner for Castro.” The source John Martino, (Bayo-Pawley raid) claimed that the assassination was prompted by Kennedy’s plan “to get rid of Castro.” Martino described portions of the top secret interagency invasion plans for Cuba, which slowed after the assassination. Before his death in 1975 he confessed to Miami Newsday reporter John Cummins, that he had disseminated false stories implicating Oswald in the assassination.15 On February 21, 1964, Life printed on its front page the now infamous photo of Oswald holding a rifle and two radical newspapers. The caption proclaimed Oswald’s guilt. “Lee Oswald and the weapons he used to kill President Kennedy and Officer Tippit.” While this picture helped convict Oswald in the minds of the American public, its origins remain unclear. Life neglected to mention that this photograph was not listed on the report of the Dallas police which itemized all of Oswald’s possessions, or that when Oswald was shown the picture by the Dallas police, he repeatedly claimed that it was a forgery. The chin in the Life picture is square, whereas Oswald’s chin was somewhat pointed. Oswald’s assertion finds support in a number of other quarters. For example, FBI agent Lynn Shaneyfelt, a photography expert, was unable to state whether the rifle in the photo was the alleged murder weapon. The body and head shadows in the photo do not point in the same direction, which led many forensic photographic experts in the U.S., England and Canada to conclude that the picture was a forgery. Superintendent Malcolm Thompson of England, head of Police Forensic Science Laboratory Identification Bureau of Scotland Yard declared that the photos were fakes. The Warren Commission later asserted that the FBI could duplicate the shadows in the picture, yet the FBI picture has the head blacked out.16 Two years later, in 1966, the London Times conducted an inquiry into the shadow disparity and concluded that the pictures were fakes. Years later, the BBC shared that assessment with the House Select Committee on Assassinations. In addition to internal inconsistencies with Life’s Oswald picture, there were conspicuous differences amongst the prints of the picture that appeared in various publications. The New York Times published an AP version of the picture with no telescopic sight on the rifle. Life ran a picture with a prominent telegraphic sight.

Newsweek published a picture which differed from the ones shown in Life and the New York Times, as well as one from the Detroit Free Press – from which Newsweek had obtained it.17 Mark Lane called this to the attention of the Warren Commission, which submitted the charge to the FBI photographic expert, who confirmed that this was so. The Warren Commission then wrote the New York Times, Newsweek and Life to clarify the various aspects of retouching.18 The Times was unable to trace the origins of the picture and was unable to state what changes had been made before they got the photo. The Warren Commission concluded that the picture had been altered by the various publications Life, Newsweek and the New York Times. Those publications then notified the Commission that they had retouched this picture. In doing so, they admitted that they had altered details of the configuration of the rifle.19 One of the best-kept secrets of the Jack Ruby trial is the extent to which the Federal Government is cooperating with the defense… An arrangement that was made last month between the defense counsel and the FBI has a fascinating “Kicker.” It provides Ruby’s side with reams of helpful information that they would never have been able to get without the G-Men – on the condition that they do not ask for anything at all about Ruby’s alleged victim, Lee Harvey Oswald.… At many trials, the defense or the state takes pains to introduce evidence tending to show the state of mind of the victim prior to the crime. This is not merely permissible under the law, it is frequently vital to the truth.… Why not in Oswald’s case? Why is Oswald being kept in the shadows, as dim a figure as they can make of him, while the defense tries to rescue his alleged killer with the help of information from the FBI? Who is Oswald anyway?20 Kilgallen also reported that Dallas police patrolman Weitzman and another policeman found “a 7.65 Mauser” on the sixth floor of the TSBD, not a Mannlicher-Carcano. Kilgallen was the only reporter to interview Jack Ruby beyond the earshot of Dallas Police.

Although the rest of the media protested, this episode was not printed until after Kilgallen’s death, when Penn Jones, Jr. noted it in his tiny newspaper, the Midlothian Mirror. By 2/24/64 Kilgallen posited: Among those who know the seamier side of Dallas show business the betting is 10 to 1 that District Attorney Hank Wade will produce witnesses who will testify that Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey Oswald were acquainted. Ruby had said repeatedly that he didn’t know the alleged assassin of President Kennedy-but then Ruby’s plea is temporary insanity and there are a great many things he doesn’t remember, and isn’t about to. The Northern Virginia Sun, 2/28/64 , ran a remarkable revelation – “Oswald had meetings with the CIA representative in the U.S. in Moscow.” How their reporters Robert Allen and Paul Scott got the State Department Cable #23411/2/59 remains unclear. This story, like most from small newspapers, never moved from the margins to larger outlets. Meanwhile at a broadcast media conference sponsored by the Radio-Television News Directors Association and Time-Life Broadcast, the Zapruder film was shown to 235 news directors, cameramen, writers, and editors from 35 states and Canada. According to a brief, cryptic article in the trade journal Variety, on 3/4/64 , the conference focused on news film standards. When news directors from three Dallas TV stations were asked if they would have aired the film if they had had access to it at the time, all said that they would, with certain audience pre-warning. When asked if they would have pooled it, all three decisively rejected the idea. Conference notes could clarify broadcast media perspectives regarding the subsequent minimal coverage regarding the Zapruder film and its implications. It remains perplexing to reconcile support for airing the Z-film with the lack of coverage regarding the footage and its implications. In March 1964, Commentary ran a rambling yet revealing report by Leo Sauvage, “The Oswald Affair.” As the New York correspondent for Le Figaro, Paris’ leading morning newspaper, he asserted that Oswald was innocent, regardless of the “press and media conviction” in both Dallas and Washington. Sauvage questioned Oswald’s location at the time of the shots; the quality of the Mannlicher-Carcano, the lack of fingerprints on the alleged rifle; the time necessary to fire the shots, Oswald’s marksmanship, the number of bullets found, whether Oswald’s rife was ordered fully equipped as Captain Fritz stated; who killed Officer Tippit, the changing story of Oswald’s map, the location of the wounds to the president, how many shots were fired and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:74:46ad2aa743ae", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 368, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 75, "text": "and media conviction” in both Dallas and Washington.

Wade’s contradictory statements. He posited, “Is the possibility of political conspiracy to be ruled out? Not the least fanatic aspect of this whole fantastic nightmare is the ease with which respectable opinion in America has arrived at the conclusion that such a possibility is absurd; in most other countries, what is regarded as absurd is the idea that the assassination could have been anything but a political murder.” Raymond Cartier observed in Paris-Match that “Europeans are convinced the Dallas drama hides a mystery, which if uncovered, would dishonor the United States and shake it to its foundation.” Robert Kennedy, weary with depression, was surreptitiously exploring the assassination with his closest aides, while publicly backing the Warren Commission and the FBI investigation. The Attorney General was surrounded by political enemies and knew he would need the power of the White House to unearth what he knew was a conspiracy to assassinate his beloved brother. “If the American public knew the truth about Dallas, there would be blood in the streets,” he told a family friend. He figured that factions of the CIA-backed anti-Castro Cubans, which he was supposed to oversee, were involved. The day of the assassination RFK called Harry Ruiz-Williams, his closest contact in the Cuban-exile community and said, “One of your guys did it.”22 According to JFK’s trusted friend, anti-Castro Cuban exile Angelo Murgado, when Oswald’s suspicious activities in New Orleans in August 1963 were reported to Bobby, he told them it was OK to ignore Oswald, since he seemed to be under the direction of the FBI. Blacklisted American journalist Thomas Buchanan, writing for the French weekly L’Express, asserted that a right-wing faction including LBJ and Texas “oil interests,” assassinated President Kennedy. He charged that Oswald was a low-level CIA agent who knew Ruby, and the motive was to disrupt momentum for détente. This series caught the eye of JFK’s best friend in the media, Ben Bradlee, who urged Bobby to meet with Buchanan. Bobby instead directed him to Ted, who connected him with Nicholas Katzenbach, the trusted Assistant Attorney General. Katzenbach fobbed him off to a commission staffer who buried Buchanan’s research in the massive file.23 Freelance journalist, Joachim Joesten, like other early critical authors, was forced to get his book Oswald: Assassin or Fall Guy? published outside of the country.

Joesten viewed Oswald as connected to the CIA and FBI, Texas oilmen, and the Dallas Police Department, and believed that two shooters were involved. The Warren Commission requested his manuscript, but since it was at the publisher, Joesten granted a four-hour interview with an “embassy man” at the American Consulate in Hamburg. By early 1964, a few American periodicals criticized the press for failing to protect Oswald’s rights. Most notable were: Editor and Publisher in “Accused or Assassin,” Saturday Review in “When the Press Shapes the News”; Columbia Journalism Review in “Judgment by Television,” and Current with a section entitled “Trial by Mass Media.” These articles prompted an industry-wide review of journalistic practices at an October 1964 forum where notions of journalistic self-restraint prevailed.24 Just as the Warren Commission started its field investigation, the AP benefited from early “leaks.” The L.A. Times, 3/25/64 , ran an AP story “Man Tells of Seeing Killer Fire at Kennedy,” just seven days into the field investigation. The story quoted active Warren Commission member Allen Dulles about the person who claimed to have seen the shot fired, “Is one case enough to identify the person [firing].” They used portions of The New York Times 3/30/64 carried an AP story reporting that the Warren Commission had “found no evidence that the crime was anything but the irrational act of an individual, according to knowledgeable sources.” This leaked “Report” occurred only twelve days after the field investigation had begun.25 Meanwhile, a few media outlets and organizations briefly explored early media efforts. Reader’s Digest, whose president Eugene Lyons had worked with the CIA‘s Radio Free Europe during the Cold War, trumpeted the broadcasting efforts to report on the assassination in their April 1964 issue. They proclaimed them, “an unprecedented achievement of voice and video.… Forgetting costs and rivalries, the broadcasters cooperated to keep the world completely and continuously informed.” An ebullient FCC Chairman E. William Henry avowed: “In meeting this tremendous challenge the broadcasting industry earned the heartfelt gratitude of people everywhere for the manner in which it fulfilled its vital public trust. In the hour of tragedy, broadcasting achieved greatness.”26 The American Society of Newspaper Editors, however, belatedly critiqued journalistic practices at their April 1964 meeting. Some members argued that the reporting was “sloppy,” “bad,” “sensational” and “a planned distortion of facts.”27 The Saturday Review, 1/64, foreshadowed concerns regarding the role of reporters, which were later noted in the Warren Report.

Herbert Brucker, the chair of the American Society of Newspaper Editors admitted in “When the Press Shapes the News” that “pressure from the press … had set the stage for [Oswald’s killing, with] little doubt that television and the press must bear a share of the blame.” He saw Oswald’s murder as “related to police capitulation in the glare of the publicity… to suit the convenience of the news media… [The problem grew] principally out of something new in journalism … the intrusion of the reporter himself in the news.”28 The U.S. News & World Report, 4/6/64, also briefly discussed, “Did Press Pressure Kill Oswald” in a commentary by Larry Grove of the Dallas Morning News. Dallas was already being reported as a right-wing, mean-spirited city, so a lack of media access to Oswald could aggravate that impression. The Dallas police, and in particular Chief Curry and Captain Will Fritz were portrayed as competent and accommodating. Reporter Hugh Aynesworth (an FBI asset) observed, “There is no doubt in my mind that a larger number of newsmen working the story hindered police.” There were instances of radio newsmen barging into offices, grabbing police telephones and relating their stories … Jim Ewell of the Dallas Morning News was “certain that the insistence of the press, notably television, people forced the police department to call moves it would not normally have made.” Ewell suggested that the Dallas Police needed a liaison man “to brief the reporters and prevent them from running all over the place.” A mysterious and significant aspect of the events following the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas has never been explored publicly, although it must have occurred to crack reporters covering the case as well as authorities … why did Lee Harvey Oswald, presumably fleeing from the police after the assassination approach Patrolman Tippitt’s car – in broad daylight with witnesses standing by – and shoot the policeman three times, although he did not say a word to Oswald.… A whodunit fan would infer that the policeman knew something about Oswald that was so dangerous that [he] had to be silenced at any cost… A May 1964 letter from then Assistant Managing Editor of the New York Times, Clifton Daniel, to J.

L’Express French weekly ran more pieces by American journalist Thomas Buchanan arguing that President Kennedy was killed by a rightwing plot. Meanwhile, Washington Post columnist Chalmers Roberts reminded his readers that Buchanan had been fired in 1948 as a Washington Star reporter, after confessing a brief membership in the Communist Party. “On the face of it, it is absurd to call Buchanan, an admitted former Sometimes photographic evidence cannot be easily interpreted. James Altgens, an Associated Press photographer, snapped a picture of the presidential limousine from about thirty feet away, just as he heard a shot. Oswald, or someone closely resembling Oswald, Billy Lovelady, was in the background, standing on the steps of the Book Depository Building. The San Francisco Chronicle (12/3/63) published the photograph together with one of Oswald taken after the arrest and asked if Oswald was the man in the doorway of the Book Depository. This lead did not resonate with the AP nor much of the media. By May 24, 1964, the New York Herald Tribune followed the lead and asked why Altgens “was never questioned by the FBI or the Warren Commission.” The next day a columnist for the Chicago American posed the same question. When the Herald Tribune requested a photograph of Lovelady, the FBI falsely told them that it had turned over to the Warren Commission everything it had on the assassination and that it could not furnish a picture of Lovelady at this time. The San Francisco Chronicle asked the Associated Press for a picture of Lovelady, but the AP was unable to comply. None existed or none could be taken. Private photographer Bill Beckman attempted to take Lovelady’s picture – but he was taken into custody, questioned by the Dallas police, and advised to leave Dallas, according to the Herald Tribune. The Commission identified the man in the photograph as Billy Lovelady. That day the American newspaper of record, the New York Times, however, was taking another approach.

A vigorous evaluation of the Commission’s findings would have jeopardized this unique relationship between the Times and the Warren Commission. Fully four months before the Warren Report was officially released, the New York Times on 6/1/64 ran a supportive preview on the front page. Its author, Anthony Lewis, years later lamented his article “Panel to Reject Theories of Plot in Kennedy’s Death.” “Maybe with all that has happened, Vietnam and Watergate, today’s reporters would have come to it with some resistance. There was at the time a predisposition for the society as a whole to believe.”31 The Dallas Times Herald ran a story by Jim Lehrer, on 6/6/64_(;) , clarifying the evidence about motorcade witness James Tague, without naming him. Tague, who preferred anonymity, recounted his experience of being wounded by a shot in Dealey Plaza with the sheriffs and police. “The FBI talked to me for about fifteen minutes and seemed mainly concerned about whether I knew Jack Ruby.” What made him finally decide to talk about it again was the revelation that the Warren Commission had come around to the belief that only two of the three bullets actually hit President Kennedy and Governor Connally.32 The determined critic Mark Lane was able to reach the public through lectures as well as some radio talk shows, but television proved resistant. Some radio shows pursued the case, including Barry Gray, Murray Burnett, and The Randy Show (WOR) in New York, as well as Jerry Williams in Chicago. WOR, however, subsequently banned Lane for life. The David Susskind Show on WPIX-TV initially showed interest, and then concluded that there were too many “political shows that week.” ABC-TV was starting an evening entertainment and interview program with Les Crane, who wanted to host a discussion of the assassination with Lane and Ruby lawyer Melvin Belli. Crane and his producer supported the concept but the ABC brass vetoed Lane’s appearance. Crane’s producer incredibly stated, “They say you have the facts and the affidavits and that would just confuse the audience.” So, the first network broadcast presenting both sides actually pitted Ruby’s lawyer Melvin Belli against Oswald’s mother.33 Time, 6/12/64, confronted the growing chorus of conspiracy rumors in Europe and to a lesser extent at home, with an article “J.F.K.: The Murder and the Myths,” which castigated “rightists” as well as “leftists.” Thomas Buchanan, who wrote the first book critical of the official findings, was again delegitimized because he had allegedly been “fired by the Washington Star in 1948 after he admitted membership in the Communist", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:79:2152a5172467", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 373, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 80, "text": "presenting both sides actually pitted Ruby’s lawyer Melvin Belli against Oswald’s mother.33 Time, 6/12/64, confronted the growing chorus of conspiracy rumors in Europe and to a lesser extent at home, with an article “J.F.K.: The Murder and the Myths,” which castigated “rightists” as well as “leftists.” Thomas Buchanan, who wrote the first book critical of the official findings, was again delegitimized because he had allegedly been “fired by the Washington Star in 1948 after he admitted membership in the Communist party.” The New Republic responded critically to previews of the Warren Report in a piece by Murray Kempton, 6/14/64, “Oswald – May We Have Some Facts Please?” Since the Chief Counsel Lee Rankin told Kempton that the Commission still had a long list of unheard witnesses, as well as 12,000 pages of testimony to examine – the “vulgar and aggressive” dismissal of critics [by a spokesman for the commission] “…is the voice of a court which has not yet finished hearing the case.” The pattern has been to say “what the evidence shows without ever showing the evidence.” Kempton declared that the Warren Commission was “primarily – to reassure and unite America and to reassure and quiet down Europe … salesmanship is a prime function of the patriot.” Years later, former ABC news president Reuven Frank wryly noted: “News is information that somebody, somewhere, wants to suppress … everything else is just advertising.” Recall that members of NBC News who covered the events in Dallas told former CBS producer Peter Noyes they were “convinced their superiors wanted certain evidence suppressed at the request of someone in Washington D.C.” One former member of an NBC camera team, Gene Barnes, who had been in Dallas, told Noyes that “An FBI agent said that I should never discuss what we discovered [about the assassination] for the good of the country.” Noyes speculated that Barnes’ testimony in Volume XXIV of the Warren Report regarding Oswald’s reported attempt to purchase a car on 11/9/63 at the Downtown Lincoln-Mercury in Dallas – may constitute the “discovery.” The Warren Commission neglected to print that the NBC newsman had learned that Oswald, or a look-alike, test-drove the car over the motorcade route of 11/22/63. Subsequently, the auto salesman and his associates were unclear as to whether the man identifying himself as “Lee Oswald” was in fact Lee Harvey Oswald.34 Dorothy Kilgallen returned to reporting the assassination after a fivemonth break.

Her commentary observed that Ruby, the self-proclaimed lover of Kennedy “did not bother to watch the Presidential motorcade.” She openly pondered why the Chief Justice refused to allow Ruby to testify in Washington. “Thousands of New Yorkers were shocked at the hopelessly inept questioning of Ruby by Chief Justice Warren, by Warren’s almost deliberate failure to follow up the leads Ruby was feeding him.”35 Undaunted, Kilgallen then exposed a secret document from the Dallas police in her column, 8/23/64. It was a private log, revealing that Chief Curry, who traveled in the presidential motorcade, initially ordered an officer to “the triple overpass towards which the presidential car was moving at about 8 miles an hour when the fatal shots were fired.” Curry’s comments for television, though, attributed gunfire to someone in the TSBD. Kilgallen befriended Mark Lane, and soon he too was giving her leads. Lane was also researching areas for presentation to the Warren Commission, particularly the alleged meeting in Ruby’s Club eight days before the assassination, which included Ruby, Officer J.D. Tippit and Kennedy critic Bernard Weissman. Kilgallen re-examined the Ruby testimony and noted that Chief Justice Warren had included “a rich oil man” in this group. By September 3rd, in a front-page article in The Journal American, Kilgallen revealed that the mention of the “rich oil man” by Chief Justice Warren would indicate that the commission was informed of the meeting by a source other than Mr. Lane, and that this second source provided the name of a fourth party – the oil man.36 Life July 10, 1964 somehow obtained and printed Oswald’s “Historic Diary” of his experiences in the Soviet Union. The subtitle reiterates Life’s assertions prior to the release of the Warren Report, “Here published in full for the first time as he wrote and spelled it, is the assassin’s diary inside Russia.” The article, without by-line, never questioned the authenticity of the diary. Nonetheless, an unidentified prescient “expert who was unaware of whom the author was” divined that it showed “intelligence and cunning… [That] he can exert power over others, even annihilate them.” The final picture in the story, “Wife and Child,” has a caption, which again underscored the drumbeat of Life’s assassination conclusions.

[Marina Oswald was] “En route to the U.S. 18 months before her husband assassinated President Kennedy…” Day after day we were treated to stories that contained only a smidgeon of new information in their leads-stories that went on to point out that the FBI report, whose details nobody was permitted to know, concluded definitely that Oswald was the killer; that he acted alone; that there was no conspiracy. By the time the public is permitted to get a peep at the FBI details that justify this conclusion, the conclusion will have been so drummed into us, so thoroughly accepted that it will take a bold man indeed … who questioned the details.38 Joachim Jostens’ book, Oswald: Assassin or Fall Guy, was essentially ignored by the media but was caustically reviewed by Hugh Aynesworth in the August edition of Editor and Publisher. “Joesten, an ex-German who became a U.S. citizen in 1948 … states that Oswald was an agent of both the FBI and the CIA.… It’s the same old tripe with some new flavoring.” Aynesworth claimed that “Lane is the troublemaker who spent two days in Dallas in January on his investigation and now pretends to be an expert on all aspects of the tragedy.” The next month in the alternative journal New Times Victor Perlo praised the book as well as the courage and skill of publisher-editor Carl Manzani. Mark Lane’s nightly lectures “Who Killed Kennedy” at the Jan Hus Theater on the upper east side of New York finally got coverage in the New York World-Telegram, “Oswald is Innocent Nightly on 74th St.” They asserted. “A dragon-slayer in horn-rimmed glasses … Lane is pulverizing the arguments of the Dallas police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service and the Warren Commission.… It doesn’t matter to Lane that they can supply evidence that Oswald was the killer. They have their truth and he has his.” Philosopher Bertrand Russell penned a prophetic op-ed. “16 Questions on the Assassination” in The Minority of One, 9/6/64.

U.S. Embassies have long ago reported to Washington worldwide disbelief in the official charges against Oswald, but this has scarcely been reflected by the American press. No U.S. television program or mass circulation newspaper has challenged the permanent basis of the allegations.… It is a task which is left to the American people.39 Considerable portions of the press had now seen the Zapruder film and had read critiques of the previews of the Warren Report. Confidence in the Warren Commission, along with perceptions of patriotism, profound caution in contradicting the government on national security matters, especially since no national leader openly opposed the Commission, all contributed to self-censorship of the mainstream media. Selected Commission “leaks,” a historical choreography of Oswald, and government non-cooperation regarding contradictory evidence on a complex case, contributed to promoting the Commission’s findings at the height of the Cold War. Dorothy Kilgallen’s columns courageously countered their pressures. Yet in a far more trusting nation than today, concerned with nuclear war, civil rights, and elections, most of the mass media reverentially waited for the Warren Commission findings. The irony of Allen Dulles, the former Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) fired by President Kennedy, now informally leading the inquiry into the assassination went unmentioned in the mainstream media. Just a handful of investigative reporters succeeded in getting their assassination stories printed; so these scattered reports failed to resonate widely. Meanwhile, Time-Life, UPI, AP, the TV networks, The L.A. Times and the New York Times actively promoted the subsequent Warren Commission conclusion of Oswald as a “lone nut.” Just five years earlier, Edward R.

Murrow admonished the Radio-Television News Directors Association in 1958. The alternative press remained marginalized. While The New Republic and The Minority of One, Commentary, New Times and The New Leader, ran documented critiques of the FBI Report and the Warren Commission processes, The Nation cautiously ran one critical piece and then waited for the official conclusions. Our democracy was on trial. How did the Warren Commission confront the crisis? Former President Truman admonished, “Political truth can be thebiggest damnedest lie ever, but if motivated toward a pragmaticpolitical goal … and stated with total belief and fervor, it becomes true.” But what if the political truth provides only temporary protection and produces a legacy of lost legitimacy? This brief overview of the Warren Commission can refresh recollections. President Johnson was confronted with allaying the fears of Americans, avoiding competing investigations in Congress and Texas, finessing the emerging connections between the alleged assassin and the Soviet Union, Cuba and the U.S. intelligence agencies, and slowing possible public sentiment for military retaliation. This political maneuvering needed to be accomplished before the next national election. One week after the assassination Johnson signed Executive Order 11130 establishing the Warren Commission. Johnson chose mainly Southern conservatives and trusted establishment figures, most with extensive experience with the intelligence community. They included Congressman Hale Boggs of Louisiana, Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky, Congressman Gerald Ford of Michigan, according to Newsweek, “the CIA’s best friend in Congress,” Senator Richard Russell of Georgia, darling of the conservatives, the senior Senator responsible for oversight of the CIA and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCloy, former World Bank president, preeminent Rockefeller attorney and foreign policy advisor to many presidents, Allen Dulles, former corporate attorney and past chair of the Council on Foreign Relations, Director of the CIA from 1953- 1961, and the first head of the CIA ever fired by a president, and Chief Justice Earl Warren, darling of the liberals, who very reluctantly joined only after Johnson convinced him that it was a matter of grave national security. Ford handled all matters dealing with the FBI and Dulles handled all matters dealing with the CIA.1 Dulles was the only member without a day job, and along with John McCloy they became the most active members of the Warren Commissioners.

None of these men were strong supporters of President Kennedy, and none of them had experience as criminal investigators or as criminal jurists. The FBI had already framed the context for the case and they were running the fieldwork for a commission which acted more like a board of directors. President Johnson had assured Senator Russell that the investigation would “not take much time.” Commissioner attendance at meetings was erratic; one member attended five meetings, another only sixteen. All seven commissioners never actually sat together for one full commission hearing. The majority of members missed most of the 51 hearings of testimony the Commission held. More than 80 percent of the listed Warren Commission witnesses never even saw a Warren Commissioner; instead staff members questioned witnesses. Essential leads and evidence were repeatedly not probed. The majority of the Commission did not look at the autopsy pictures or the autopsy x-rays. They never questioned President Johnson, who was technically a prime suspect. Army intelligence files were not subpoenaed by the Warren Commission and were supposedly routinely destroyed in 1973. Initially the Commission thought that they would simply review the FBI Report. At first there was no method for even examining witnesses, and Senator Russell and Justice Warren did not even want to call witnesses. Dulles already sought to frame the investigation by distributing copies of The Assassins by Robert Donovan to members of the Warren Commission and it lawyers. Donovan argued that the seven previous assassination attempts on American presidents came from the actions of lone nuts. Since the Lincoln assassination was seen as dominated by the spirit of Booth, Donovan and Dulles somehow maintained that it was not a conspiracy. None of the members wanted or expected a lengthy investigation, until the Warren Commission meeting, 12/16/63, when they started to discuss the FBI Report. On New Year’s Day 1964 the Houston Post ran a story by reporter Alonzo Hudkins, “Oswald Rumored as Informant for U.S.” Two weeks earlier Hudkins told Secret Service agent Lane Bertram that the Chief of the Dallas Sheriffs Criminal Division, Allan Sweatt had information that Oswald was an FBI informant.2 The rumor of Oswald’s ties to the FBI was brought to the Commission by Wagoner Carr, the Attorney General of Texas, and Henry Wade, the D.A. of Dallas.

The remarkable choice of Dulles as a member of the Warren Commission seems no accident, considering the connections of intelligence agencies to the assassination, Kennedy’s threatening new directions for the CIA, as well as Kennedy’s firing of Dulles after the Bay of Pigs. Other people who were fired from the CIA after the Bay of Pigs, were Deputy Director General Charles Cabell, whose brother was the Mayor of Dallas in 1963, and the Director of Planning Richard Bissel, who was in charge of “Executive Action,” an assassination squad. I had a long talk this morning (12/12/63) with Congressman Jerry Ford.… He asked that I come up and see him.… Ford indicated he would keep me thoroughly advised as to the activities of the Commission. He stated this would have to be on a confidential basis; however, he thought it should be done. He also asked if he could call me from time to time and straighten out questions in his mind concerning our investigation. I told him by all means he should do this. He reiterated that our relationship would, of course, remain confidential. 4 The FBI had a number of motives for complicity in the cover-up. FBI meetings with Oswald and Ruby would have made the FBI appear to be a co-conspirator. Hoover’s animosity for the Kennedys has been well substantiated, as well as his close cooperation with his long-time friend and neighbor Lyndon Johnson. His carefully nurtured reputation and the reputation of the FBI were at risk. Hoover’s virulent anti-communist policies led him to fear Kennedy’s new directions in foreign policy. Hoover, who referred to himself as “Seat of Government,” refused to cooperate fully with the crackdown on organized crime under the Kennedys, because he had long maintained that organized crime did not exist. Yet Hoover spent some of his vacations at the Del Mar racetrack and the Del Charro motel, known hangouts for powerful mafia leaders, which were owned by Texas oilmen Sid Richardson and Clint Murchison, close friends of Hoover and LBJ. Hoover was a heavy racetrack gambler at a time when racetrack gambling was controlled by organized crime. Allegedly organized crime would give him racing tips. Further, Hoover’s very close and possibly romantic relationship with his longtime assistant, Clyde Tolson was well known by Mafia leaders; thus, Hoover was possibly vulnerable to blackmail.6 At 69, Hoover was nearing the mandatory retirement age of 70; and if Kennedy was to be re-elected in 1964, which seemed likely, then Hoover", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:86:fa4f41ae62bb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 380, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "Hoover and LBJ.

Further, Hoover’s very close and possibly romantic relationship with his longtime assistant, Clyde Tolson was well known by Mafia leaders; thus, Hoover was possibly vulnerable to blackmail.6 At 69, Hoover was nearing the mandatory retirement age of 70; and if Kennedy was to be re-elected in 1964, which seemed likely, then Hoover could be forced into retirement. According to former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who served in the Justice Department under both Kennedy and Johnson, “it was pretty clear that Kennedy would not have extended Hoover.” This change was problematic since Hoover had a file full of evidence confirming JFK’s extramarital affairs. Retirement would not be a concern, however, under his close friend Lyndon Johnson. The relationship between the Warren Commission and the FBI is revealing. Earl Warren originally wanted his old friend, Warren Olney III, to be the Chief Counsel of the committee. Olney had served as head of the FBI Criminal Division from 1953 to 1957, then as assistant U. S. Attorney General. In that capacity he was asked by the CIA to hold back on prosecuting a New York company that was a CIA front that had been caught smuggling arms into pre-revolutionary Cuba. Olney refused the request and pursued the charges. However, the experienced and independent Olney, an outspoken critic of Director Hoover and knowledgeable about the internal workings of the Bureau, was rejected after Hoover and Dulles, Ford, McCloy and Boggs voiced fierce opposition to his appointment. Warren Commissioner John J. McCloy had ties to intelligence agencies as well, and his strong support for the single bullet theory and the Report’s conclusions may not be coincidental. According to Harvard historian Alan Brinkley, “McCloy has been actively involved in more areas of national policy, in more critical decisions, than perhaps any political figure of his generation.” He has advised nine presidents and has been referred to by numerous authors as “the chairman of the American establishment.”7 His varied assignments have included: War Department Liaison to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where among other decisions he decided not to bomb the Nazi concentration camps; ignored FBI investigators and pushed for Japanese Internment, World Bank president in 1948; American High Commissioner to Germany from 1949-1952, where he commuted most of the sentences handed down at Nuremberg to Nazi war criminals; as well as a participant in the major foreign and military planning commissions, NSC-68 (1950) and the Gaither Report (1957), both of which promoted increased military spending which was justified as containment militarism and military Keynesianism. In 1952 McCloy left Germany to become President of Chase Manhattan Bank, and served on the board of directors of a number of blue-chip corporations and as legal counsel to the Seven Sisters of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:87:0c1501f14776", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 381, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 88, "text": "the sentences handed down at Nuremberg to Nazi war criminals; as well as a participant in the major foreign and military planning commissions, NSC-68 (1950) and the Gaither Report (1957), both of which promoted increased military spending which was justified as containment militarism and military Keynesianism. In 1952 McCloy left Germany to become President of Chase Manhattan Bank, and served on the board of directors of a number of blue-chip corporations and as legal counsel to the Seven Sisters of American Oil. By 1953 McCloy worked closely with Eisenhower on foreign policy and intelligence matters. He worked on a number of projects with his fellow Warren Commissioner Allen Dulles and with C. D. Jackson, the new chief of the Psychological Strategy Board and later the editor of Life Magazine On the first day of the investigation, McCloy was concerned that the Warren Report “lay the dust” expeditiously. He used his considerable skills in negotiation to mediate compromises regarding the single bullet theory, the possibility of a conspiracy, and the method of reviewing the autopsy. After the Warren Commission finished its work, McCloy proclaimed, “I have never seen a case that was more completely proven.” When Russell, Boggs and Cooper had “strong doubts” regarding the single bullet theory, and Russell threatened to not sign a report advocating it, McCloy prevailed with compromise language. He claimed that there was, “very persuasive evidence from the experts to indicate that the same bullet which pierced the President’s throat also caused Connally’s wounds.” The Warren Commission staff stated that there was “no conspiracy,” and Ford noted that “they found no evidence of a conspiracy.” McCloy’s language prevailed in the Final Report: “Because of the difficulty of proving a negative to a certainty the possibility of others being involved with either Oswald or Ruby cannot be rejected categorically, but if there is any such evidence it has been beyond the reach of all investigative agencies and resources of the U.S. and has not come to the attention of the Commission.”8 McCloy agreed with Warren regarding the potentially morbid nature of the autopsy photos, and proposed that they not become part of the record provided “at least one Commissioner, accompanied by a doctor, is allowed to inspect this critical evidence.” By 1967 McCloy regretfully observed on Face the Nation that, “there was one thing I would do over again. I would insist on those photographs and x-rays having been produced before us.” However, he still argued that the best evidence on the autopsy came from the sworn testimony of the Navy and Army doctors who conducted it.9 After his work with the Warren Commission, McCloy became Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations. His close friends ranged from the Rockefeller family to Texas oilman Clint Murchison, to CIA and media elites.10 Less than two years after the assassination McCloy joined with David Rockefeller, Eugene Block of the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:88:94c6e0c8af6b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 382, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 89, "text": "having been produced before us.” However, he still argued that the best evidence on the autopsy came from the sworn testimony of the Navy and Army doctors who conducted it.9 After his work with the Warren Commission, McCloy became Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Douglas Dillon to form the Committee for an Effective and Durable Peace in Asia – a group which advocated widening the war in Vietnam.11 The powerful Senator Richard Russell of Georgia was Lyndon Johnson’s close friend and mentor, and as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee he oversaw the CIA. He resisted serving on the Warren Commission but LBJ pressured him, and actually announced Russell’s appointment to the media, before Russell agreed to serve. Hoover immediately took over the investigation without jurisdiction. FBI agents questioned Oswald less than two hours after the assassination. About one hundred and fifty agents were ordered to question witnesses and develop reports. An early lead pointing to the National States Rights Party was met with “Not necessary to cover as the true suspect located” – before the Dallas authorities charged Oswald with shooting the President. By about 10 pM Friday night FBI agents had located the place where Oswald allegedly bought the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, Klein’s Sporting Goods in Chicago. When the Secret Service arrived the next day for questioning they found Klein’s senior vice president, William Waldman, had been pressured by the FBI to “not discuss this with anyone.”12 Recall that the FBI was to become the sole investigative organization for the Warren Commission. Basic evidence at the scene of the assassination was improperly investigated, covered up or ignored by factions of the Dallas police force, the FBI, the Secret Service, and the Warren Commission. Even the standard forensic paraffin test showed that Oswald did not fire a rifle that day. This was noted in the unindexed Warren Commission Hearings and Evidence in volume 22, which was released ten months after the assassination. Suspiciously, Oswald’s fingerprints were not found on the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle he was alleged to have used until three days later, after Oswald was shot. Years later it was determined that FBI agents had visited Oswald’s body at the morgue, with the alleged rifle to fingerprint him.13 The contradictory evidence regarding the murder weapon has remained unresolved through the years. According to Dallas Police Officer Seymour Weitzman and Dallas Homicide Chief Will Fritz, the rifle reportedly found initially on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository was a 7.65 Mauser, a highly accurate German-made weapon. Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig also searched the Depository and he later recalled seeing the word “Mauser” inscribed on", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:89:dbffa537ea2a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 383, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 90, "text": "Oswald’s body at the morgue, with the alleged rifle to fingerprint him.13 The contradictory evidence regarding the murder weapon has remained unresolved through the years.

Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig also searched the Depository and he later recalled seeing the word “Mauser” inscribed on the gun. Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone executed an affidavit in which he described the rifle as a Mauser. As late as November 23rd, Dallas D. A. Henry Wade told the media that the weapon found was a Mauser. In another affidavit, Weitzman noted that the Mauser had a 4/18 telescopic sight – this, too, was different from the scope on the Mannlicher-Carcano. Although Weitzman clearly described the weapon; the Warren Report stated Weitzman had “little more than a glance at the rifle.”14 No marksman from the FBI or military was able to duplicate Oswald’s alleged proficiency to either the Warren Commission or the HSCA. Other evidence surrounding the rifle was also either inconsistent or suppressed.15 The Mannlicher-Carcano was known to be an inaccurate rifle, so unreliable on repeat shots that it was nicknamed “the humane weapon” during WWII. The cheap scope was off-center, and Oswald was not a good marksman. Sergeant Nelson Delgado, Oswald’s Marine sergeant during training, confirmed Oswald’s mediocre marksmanship. In an interview with attorney Mark Lane for Emile de Antonio’s film Rush to Judgment, Delgado stated that the FBI pressured him to stay quiet about Oswald’s mediocre marksmanship. The Mannlicher-Carcano required 2.3 seconds to shoot and reload, but that did not take into account that the President was in a moving vehicle and about 88 yards away. FBI agent Robert Frazier testified to the Warren Commission that approximately one second more per shot would be needed under those conditions.16 For the Warren Commission and the HSCA, this mail-order $12.88 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle was the major link between Oswald and the assassination. The order for Alex Hidell did not have Oswald’s signature. A widespread pattern of cover-up occurred regarding significant evidence, which was given to the FBI and deliberately not pursued after the assassination. Years later, the HSCA concluded that “The FBI gradually exhausted its resources in confirming the case against Oswald as the lone assassin,” a case that FBI Director Hoover seemed determined to make, within hours of the assassination. Recall that by November 25th the FBI agreed with Acting Attorney General Nicolas Katzenbach that “the public must be convinced that Oswald was the assassin and that he did not have confederates…” On November 25th reports from U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Thomas Mann, and CIA Station Chief, “Win” Scott, claimed that Kennedy could have been the victim of a communist plot.

They thought that somehow Oswald had been paid by Cubans with possible KGB complicity. Hoover sent FBI agent Lawrence Keenan to meet with Mann and Scott to share the “facts” of the case – the lone nut case. An hour prior to the assassination, Julia Ann Mercer was driving past the grassy knoll on Elm Street, where she saw a man with a rifle case dismount a pickup and climb up the knoll. The day after the assassination she reported this to both the FBI and the Dallas Sheriff ’s office; however, she was never questioned by the Warren Commission staff.17 When Mercer saw Ruby kill Oswald on TV, she positively identified him as the driver of the pickup truck and notified the local Bureau official. The FBI altered her statement. In 1978 Garrison sent the Julia Ann Mercer statements to the HSCA, but never received a reply. The HSCA reported that the alleged statements made by Julia Ann Mercer had been sent, but the report noted, “they had been unable to locate her.” The FBI did not check out the most essential leads given them by the Dallas deputy sheriffs. The well-respected Dallas Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig reported to the FBI that he had seen a Nash Rambler station wagon carrying four men, including one who resembled Oswald, leave from in front of the Depository directly after the assassination. The FBI denied ever hearing this.18 Some of the witnesses to the assassination, contrary to the Warren Commission’s conclusions, said that they not only heard shots from the grassy knoll but that they saw smoke as well. At least fifty-one witnesses stated or testified that some of the shots came from the grassy knoll, which would be consistent with the reaction of Kennedy’s head slamming backward from the fatal shot as seen in the amateur video taken by Abraham Zapruder. The transcript from the Dallas Police Department dictabelt recording seconds after the assassination indicates that Police Chief Curry and Sheriff Bill Decker were convinced shots came from the knoll. Sheriff Decker: “Have my office move all available men out of my office into the railroad yard area to try and determine what happened there and hold everything secure until Homicide and other investigators get there.” Many of the people who were in Dealey Plaza testified that all of the shots didn’t sound the same, meaning that they came from different directions or from different rifles, or most", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:91:f75e826c61e3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 385, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 92, "text": "Curry and Sheriff Bill Decker were convinced shots came from the knoll.

After shots were fired, a Dallas traffic officer, Joe M. Smith, rushed from the intersection of Elm and Houston Streets to the area behind the knoll. He pulled a gun on a man who was there, who then showed him a Secret Service I.D. card. However, according to the Warren Commission, all of the Secret Service agents assigned to the motorcade had gone along with the motorcade to the hospital.20 When Dallas police Sergeant Harkness first arrived at the rear of the Book Depository, even before the search of the railroad yards, some of the men in the yards identified themselves to Harkness as Secret Service agents. A Dallas schoolteacher named Jean Hill had a similar experience. She witnessed a man running from the scene and chased him into the parking lot behind the fence on the knoll; he halted and identified himself as Secret Service. Despite these indications that some men falsely represented themselves as Secret Service agents, and that the Secret Service claimed that it had no agents in Dealy Plaza, the Warren Commission (and later the House Select Committee on Assassinations) dropped the matter.21 Jean Hill has resolutely maintained that the Dallas police threatened her on 11/22/63 to stay quiet about what she had seen and heard. During most of the hours between his arrest and being charged with the murder, local, state and federal officials questioned Oswald. Astonishingly, the Dallas police initially claimed that no records were kept of this interrogation, yet it is known that Oswald repeatedly denied his guilt.22 (Captain Fritz’s notes were found years later.) Warren Commission testimony twice referred to three transients taken off of the trains in an area not far from the grassy knoll immediately after the assassination. Warren Commission counsel Joseph Ball and later David Belin both avoided further questions in this area. Neither the Dallas Sheriff ’s office nor the Dallas Police Department had any record of their arrest or questioning, yet they were booked and pictures of them being escorted by the Dallas police somehow surfaced after the Warren Commission Report was published.23 James Chaney, the motorcycle policeman closest to Kennedy during the assassination, who told newsmen he saw the President “struck in the face” by the fatal shot.

Price, who had a clear view on top of the Terminal Annex building, witnessed the entire assassination, and then told of seeing a man with a rifle running behind the wooden fence on top of the grassy knoll; James Simmons, a Union Railroad employee who supported Sam Holland in his contention that shots came from behind the picket fence on the grassy knoll; Alonzo Hudkins, the Houston newspaper reporter who stated that Dallas officials told him that Oswald was an informant for the FBI; witnesses to the Tippit shooting Acquilla Clemons and Mr. and Mrs. Frank Wright; Admiral George Burkley, Kennedy’s personal physician who rode in the motorcade, was with Kennedy at Parkland Hospital, rode with Air Force One on the trip back to Washington, was present at the Bethesda autopsy, and received all of the official medical evidence, much of which is now in controversy; James Sibert and Francis O’Neill, two FBI agents who attended Kennedy’s autopsy and whose report contradicts some of the official conclusions; Mary Woodward, Maggie Brown, Aurilea Lorenzo and Ann Donaldson, who all worked for the Dallas Morning News and who reported “a horrible ear shattering noise coming from behind us and a little to the right.” This statement was in the newspaper on November 23rd, but none of these statements were mentioned or questioned by the Warren Commission; Tom G. Tilson Jr., an off-duty Dallas policeman, who saw from his car “a guy coming from the railroad tracks” after the assassination. “He came down the grassy slope on the west side of the triple underpass, on the Elm Street side. He had a car parked there, a black car. And he threw something in the back seat.… hurriedly got in the car and took off.” Tilson followed the car, got the license plate number and telephoned the police homicide bureau, but they never contacted him – neither did the Warren Commission.

Former House Speaker Tip O’Neil stated in 1992 that former Kennedy aides Kenny O’Donnell and Dave Powers told him that the FBI persuaded them not to testify that they thought shots came from the grassy knoll. They were told that there was an echo, that they were mistaken, and that the family wanted to get this behind us. So both men changed their testimony to match the FBI version. Secret Service Agent Paul Landis, who rode in the car behind President Kennedy, said that “the shot came from in front … and I looked along the right hand side of the road.” The Warren Commission did not call Landis to testify. A. C. Millican, who stood in front on the colonnade in Dealey Plaza, said “I heard two more shots come from the arcade between the bookstore and the underpass and then three more shots came from the same direction only farther back. Then everyone started running up the hill.” Millican was also not called to testify before the Warren Commission.24 Richard Randolph Carr had watched the motorcade from the Dallas County Government Center. During the assassination he observed a heavyset man wearing a tan sport jacket and glasses on the sixth floor of the TSBD. After the shooting stopped he saw two men from the vicinity of the TSBD jump into a Rambler wagon and drive north on Houston Street. He was never called to testify. Some witnesses who were questioned by the Commission, either at the hearings or by deposition, have stated to researchers that their testimony was altered. Butch Burroughs, Jean Hill, Phil Willis, Orville Nix, James Tague, and others have stated that their oral testimony was not accurately reflected in the Warren Commission Report.25 After I wrote them, you see, a couple of fellows came to see me. They walked in like they were a couple of deputy sheriffs and I was a bank robber.… As a senator I felt insulted. They went off and wrote up something and brought it back for me to sign. But I refused. I threw it into the drawer and let it stay there for weeks. And they had on there the last sentence, which said, “This is all I know about the assassination.” They wanted me to sign this thing, then say this is all I know. Of course, I would have never signed it.

So I typed one up myself and put basically what I told you about the cars all stopped. I put in there, “I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, but for the protection of future presidents, they should be trained to take off when a shot is fired.” I sent that over. That’s dated July 10, 1964.… When the volumes were finally printed and came out, I was surprised at how many people down at the White House didn’t file their affidavits until after mine, waiting to see what I was going to say before they filed theirs. I began to lose confidence then in their investigation and that’s further eroded with time.26 An internal FBI memo 11/23/63 noted that Agent-in-Charge J. Gordon Shanklin of the FBI’s Dallas field office: “Stated he did not believe that the (Zapruder) film would be of any evidentiary value; however, he had to take a look at the film to determine this factor.” Later in the memo the FBI assumed that it had sole possession of the original and that “… later a determination would be made as to whether the film would be given back to Zapruder or not.” This was speculation, since Abraham Zapruder had already sold it to Time-Life for $150, 000 .27 Another amateur photographer caught critical footage of the assassination, Charles L. Bronson, a metallurgist from Dallas. Located on Houston Street, Bronson’s photographs were “crisp and clear” (Dallas Morning News) and showed Kennedy as he was hit in the head. “The slides were clear enough to show that seconds before the assassination no one was at the sixth floor window of the TSBD. Dozens of witnesses could have been located and questioned. Dallas FBI agents Melton Newson and Emory Horton claimed that the films were not “sufficiently clear” and did not forward them to FBI Washington headquarters. 28 The pictures were unknown to the Warren Commission. Citizen researchers Harold Weisberg and Jim Lesar unearthed the pictures in 1978 using the Freedom of Information Act. Actually 21 law enforcement officers said and testified that a shot came from the grassy knoll area, although the Warren Commission found “no evidence” of a shot from the front.

Actually 21 law enforcement officers said and testified that a shot came from the grassy knoll area, although the Warren Commission found “no evidence” of a shot from the front. The Commission argued that all of the shooting took place in approximately six seconds. The alleged murder weapon was an old Mannlicher-Carcano bolt-action rifle, which could be loaded and fired once in 2.3 seconds. The 6^(th) floor of the Texas School Board Depository presents a difficult angle of engagement, partly obscured by a live oak tree. The first shot, normally the most accurate, supposedly missed. No government “reenactment” could duplicate the shooting scenario. The Zapruder film shows a timing gap of 1.6 seconds between the second and third shots. The Warren Commission acknowledged that. “The rifle couldn’t be perfectly ‘sighted in’ in order to raise the scope without installing two metal shims, (small metal plates) which were not present when the rifle arrived for testing, and were never found.” 42 Supposedly of the three bullets fired, one shot hit the curb, one shot hit the president’s head, and the other bullet supposedly damaged the president’s neck, Connally’s ribs, wrist and leg. Incredibly, after breaking both the wrist and rib bones, the bullet produced by the Commission (CE 399) supposedly emerged from Connally’s leg appearing as though it had hit nothing, showing no traces of blood or tissue. In addition to obvious leads not followed, standard procedures inexplicably broken, basic information withheld, and many agencies confirming these irregularities, the Warren Commission broke the laws of physics as well. The whole notion of a single bullet passing through Kennedy, shattering Governor Connally’s fifth rib, and emerging in “pristine form” is “semantical sophistry and intellectual gymnastics” according to Dr. Cyril Wecht, former President of the Academy of Forensic Sciences. Wecht has pointed to the condition of Mannlicher-Carcano ammunition after test firing into a goat carcass that sustained a broken rib. All of the bullets tested at the Army Ballistics Arsenal were visibly more damaged than the bullet alleged to have gone through seven layers of skin, numerous layers of tissue and then shattered multiple bones in Connally.43 The author of the “single-bullet theory” was Arlen Specter, formerly a special agent of the Office of Special Investigations for the Air Force, and later a U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania. If the bullet fragments in Governor Connally’s wrist and leg are added to the weight of the so-called “magic bullet,” the total weight is more than one bullet. Yet one bullet had to account for all of the body wounds to Kennedy and Connally. The Chairman of the U.S. Army’s Wound Ballistics Board, Dr. Joseph Dolci, stated that the Warren Commission case for this bullet was forensically not possible.

The Chairman of the U.S. Army’s Wound Ballistics Board, Dr. Joseph Dolci, stated that the Warren Commission case for this bullet was forensically not possible. Pictures of the test bullets do not appear in the twenty-six volumes of hearings and exhibits. 44 The Warren Commission never explored the possibility that some of the bullets could have been hollow-nosed ammunition, so-called exploding ammunition. Connally has testified repeatedly that he was hit by a separate shot. Even the FBI and the Secret Service argue in their reports that Kennedy and Connally were hit by separate bullets. Nellie Connally notes that her husband “reared up like a wounded animal” before she heard the shot which hit him, hardly the “delayed reaction” argued by Arlen Specter in the Warren Report. According to the Warren Commission, Connally held his Stetson hat 1.6 seconds after his wrist was shattered. Almost every critical account has pointed this out; however, the necessity of another shot has somehow eluded both the Warren Commission and the HSCA. This point is crucial, since more than one bullet would indicate there was more than one assassin. Amazingly, the alleged bullet was not even found on Connally’s stretcher. William Alexander, Dallas County Assistant D. A. in 1963, observed, “The Magic Bullet is like the Immaculate Conception. You either accept it or you don’t.” Earl Warren listened to Specter explain the trajectory of Oswald’s bullet, and walked away without say a word.45 Oswald had only four cartridges for the purported assassination rifle and FBI investigations never established a source for this limited supply of ammunition. While the Warren Commission argued that this ammunition was readily available and of high quality, the reverse was true. One unpublished memorandum was seen by researchers regarding the manufacturer, Western Cartridge, of the 6.5 caliber Mannlicher-Carcano ammunition for the Marine Corps in 1954. This ammunition does not fit and cannot be fired in any Marine Corps weapons. Was the contract for ammunition placed by the CIA for Western Cartridge under a Marine Corps cover for concealment purposes?”47 Years later the HSCA allowed two documents pertaining to the Western Cartridge Company to be locked away in the National Archives for fifty years. And why would an assassin leave three cartridges, in plain view at the scene of the crime? The cartridge case evidence was never analyzed. One of the cartridges, CE 543, contained a dent so deep it could not house a bullet. The bolt of the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle had not marked two of the cartridges, which means they had not been ejected from the rifle.

The bolt of the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle had not marked two of the cartridges, which means they had not been ejected from the rifle. CE 543 had markings on its base from the firing pin strikes that could only be present if the cartridge had been empty, according to FBI tests.48 Oswald told Dallas police that he was eating lunch on the first floor of the Texas School Book Depository at the time of the assassination. Carolyn Arnold, secretary to the vice-president of the TSBD, saw Oswald in the lunchroom on the second floor at 12:15. Oswald had no way of knowing if the motorcade was late, and if he had planned an assassination, he would have been getting into position to fire. The Warren Commission and the HSCA, however, concluded that Oswald stayed on the sixth floor. In the TSBD second floor lunch room Dallas policeman, Marion Baker, encountered Oswald less than 90 seconds after the final shot was fired. It is hardly conceivable that after shooting a President an assassin could hide the rifle, rearrange the boxes in the window, run down five flights of stairs, and be standing calmly drinking a soda when a policeman rushed into the lunch room. When independent researchers, in excellent physical condition, attempted to duplicate this sequence of actions, it took them close to four minutes. Less than 45 minutes after the assassination Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit was shot to death in the Oak Cliff area, several miles from Dealey Plaza. Tippit was hit four times. Officer Gerald Hill, who had custody of the .38 revolver supposedly found on Oswald at the time of the arrest, testified to the Warren Commission that he discovered six live rounds in the chamber and two empty cartridges at the murder scene – revolvers, however, do not discharge shells after firing. According to the police radio report, the shells found at the scene were from an automatic pistol and could not have been fired from Oswald’s .38 revolver. The FBI Crime Lab (BuLab) claimed that the cartridge cases at the scene of the Tippit shooting matched Oswald’s revolver. Warren Commission attorney Melvin Eisenberg knew that BuLab had examined only one of the four bullets recovered from Tippit’s body and that the bullet was so damaged that it could not be matched to Oswald’s revolver. The FBI did not even ask for Tippit’s autopsy report for three months after Dr. Rose released it to the Secret Service on 12/10/63.

The FBI blamed the Dallas police – yet only after Eisenberg’s request 3/64 for the BuLab report did three bullets mysteriously turn up in Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz’s file. After testing the three bullets BuLab noted that, “no conclusion could be reached as to whether or not they were fired by Oswald’s revolver. BuLab’s examination of the four empty .38 hulls from the crime scene determined, “the firing pin would not strike one or more of the cartridges with sufficient force to fire them.” (Gerald McKnight. Breach of Faith. (p.116-122). Almost every eyewitness to the shots originally stated that the man who fired the weapon did not look like Oswald; however, they changed their testimonies to the Warren Commission, stating that the killer did look like Oswald. One eyewitness to the Tippit killing who saw two men was Acquilla Clemons. She described the man who shot Tippit as heavyset, with short hair. She never changed her story, even after men came to her house and warned her, “She’d better keep her mouth shut if she didn’t want to get hurt.” Ms. Clemons was never called to testify before the Warren Commission.49 The actions of the Secret Service, a branch of the Treasury Department, before, during, and after the assassination suggest complicity as well as an early pattern of suppression of evidence. Contrary to its own manuals on “protection,” the Secret Service had (1) not provided the President with a protective bubble for the limousine; (2) had not bracketed the Presidential limousine with motorcycle cops at each fender; (3) had not secured the roofs and windows of the parade route; (4) had deleted the Dallas police squad car; (5) had declined to augment their forces either with military personnel or the Dallas sheriffs; (6) planned an unnecessary 120 degree turn; and (7) The Presidential limousine almost halted during the shooting. Although on 11/21/63 Dallas Sheriff Bill Decker had been told to use his men to augment security, the order was reversed the next day by a call from Washington. Researcher Vincent Palamara argues that ASAIC Floyd Boring, who was responsible for the trip, probably gave those unusual orders. Many agents, contrary to Secret Service regulations, were drinking heavily until 4:00 am on 11/21/63 at Pat Kirkwood’s club, with girls from Jack Ruby’s club. The Secret Service were not even positioned on the ground in Dealey Plaza, yet somehow two imposters convincingly identified themselves as Secret Service agents to three Dallas policemen, and others, after the assassination.50", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:99:e583421cf53d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 393, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 100, "text": "call from Washington.

About an hour and a half after the assassination Secret Service agents pressured Dr. Earl Rose, the Dallas County Medical Examiner, and Judge Theron Ward to release the corpse for transit to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. Dr. Rose argued that under Texas law the body of the murder victim could not be removed until an autopsy had been performed. The Secret Service agents then forced the judge and doctor against the wall at gunpoint and forcibly took Kennedy’s body from Dallas to Bethesda. Then, on orders from Lyndon Johnson, the Secret Service flew the Presidential limousine to Washington, D.C., allowed the FBI to assist in inspecting it, before it was scrubbed, washing away important traces of blood, bones and bullets. Deputy Secret Service Chief Paul Paterni, a member of the OSS during WWII and a former partner of CIA Counter Intelligence chief James Angleton, would provide the only significant hands-on input from the Chief ’s office on the day of the assassination. Paterni and Boring were involved with the limousine inspection at the White House garage, and vehicle damage was “noted” before the FBI got their hands on the limousine.52 This destruction of evidence has yet to be accounted for. When the Warren Commission investigated Lee Oswald’s office in Guy Banister’s New Orleans operation, they claimed to have found nothing remotely suspicious.53 Guy Banister, a past supervisor of the FBI office in Chicago, who supposedly ran a private detective agency in New Orleans in 1962- 3, had CIA and Mafia operatives working out of his office at 544 Camp Street (the same location as 531 Lafayette Street, Banister’s address of record). Oswald also worked out of Banister’s office, and he handed out “Fair Play for Cuba Committee” leaflets with the address 544 Camp Street. Yet the Secret Service synopsis to the Warren Commission stated, “Extensive investigation conducted thus far has failed to establish that the ‘Fair Play for Cuba Committee’ had offices at 544 Camp Street. It has likewise been impossible to find anyone who recalls ever seeing Lee Harvey Oswald at this address.”53 The front entrance of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:100:0c87275a2ad7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 394, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 101, "text": "address of record).

It has likewise been impossible to find anyone who recalls ever seeing Lee Harvey Oswald at this address.”53 The front entrance of the Secret Service’s office was located about 50 feet from 544 Camp Street. As former FBI man Bill Turner discovered for Jim Garrison, after walking those 50 feet, if the Secret Service agents had gone up the stairs, they would have found themselves on the landing outside the door of Guy Banister’s office with Banister’s name printed on the door. If they had obtained a search warrant, they would have found a stack of leftover “Fair Play for Cuba Committee” leaflets in the office.54 The investigations of the Secret Service actions in Dallas were uneven. The Assistant Special Agent in charge of White House Detail, Floyd Boring was in charge of planning the Dallas trip. However, neither the Warren Commission nor the HSCA ever questioned him. Advance agent David Grant, who was involved in the aforementioned changes on November 18, 1963, was not questioned either. In Dallas, SAC Winston Lawson, formerly of the Army Counter Intelligence Corps, took the lead in changing the motorcade route, and limiting the number of Dallas police and motorcycle escorts to protect the president. A number of agencies have seemingly tampered with evidence. The most dramatic of which is that Kennedy’s brain was “missing” from the National Archives in 1965.55 Also missing are supplemental photographs taken of the interior of the President’s chest. The CIA had destroyed its alleged tape recordings of Oswald supposedly recorded at the Cuban and Russian embassies in Mexico City in 1963.56 Witness Beverly Oliver claimed to have filmed the assassination and her movie camera was immediately taken by the FBI; it was never returned. The FBI also supposedly destroyed the transcripts of tape recordings and was never able to produce any pictures of Oswald at Cuban and Russian Embassies in Mexico City.57 In 1976, the National Archives disclosed that two letters written to Warren Commission General Counsel Rankin were missing from the National Archives collection: a “Letter of David Belin to J. Lee Rankin (chief counsel of the Warren Commission) on the interrogation of Oswald by the Dallas Police Dept,” and a “Memorandum of Griffin to Rankin in August 1964” dealing with a number of inquiries to be made of various agencies, including unidentified prints found on the book cartons in the Texas School Book Depository.

The official copy of the Dallas police dictabelt of the police radio transmissions made during the assassination, and the shots recorded on it, is missing from the National Archives. Also two sets of reports dealing with “operational security involving the transfer of Lee Harvey Oswald” were found to be missing in 1976. The FBI explanations about Jack Ruby provide useful insights into the investigation. The FBI could find “no significant links between Ruby and organized crime” for the Warren Commission, even though Ruby’s entire adult life had been linked to organized crime. A few weeks prior to the assassination, Ruby made three calls to organized crime figures and their representatives.58 One call was to Jimmy Hoffa’s personal strong-arm man, “Barney Baker,” one was to a Hoffa lieutenant, Dusty Miller, and one was to Nofio Pecora, a lieutenant of New Orleans mafiosi Carlos Marcello. Further, Ruby had a special relationship with the Dallas office of the FBI, and in 1959 he met with agent Charles Flynn nine times. At that time he also purchased a microphone-equipped wristwatch, a bugged tie clip and other intelligence paraphernalia.59 The FBI claimed that no useful information was ever obtained. Ruby repeatedly requested transfer to a safer prison, yet this was denied. When Chief Justice Earl Warren interviewed Ruby he inexplicably told him, “If you don’t think it’s wise to talk, that’s ok.” The Warren Commission conceded that Ruby was “familiar if not friendly” with gangsters but found no “grounds for believing that Ruby’s killing of Oswald was part of a conspiracy.” Burt Griffin, the Commission’s expert on Ruby, questioned aspects of this finding. “I think that we should have considerably more information about Ruby’s visit to Cuba before we arrive at such a conclusion.” (August 1964 memorandum) Ruby’s connections with organized crime were not difficult to ascertain and would have widened the investigation. By 1963, the Justice Department under Bobby Kennedy was effectively prosecuting the Mafia and had increased the Organized Crime section of the Justice Department by about 400% . Investigations of Mafia figures to be targeted for prosecution increased from 40 to 2,300. After the assassination of President Kennedy, the number of convictions dropped by 83% .60 Years later, the House Select Committee on Assassinations was able to tie Mafia kingpins Carlos Marcello and Santos Trafficante to Oswald and Ruby. Oswald had been connected in Louisiana with David Ferrie, who had worked as a pilot for Marcello (a New Orleans Mafioso who was deported by Attorney General Robert Kennedy in 1962) and anti-Castro Cubans.

Oswald had been connected in Louisiana with David Ferrie, who had worked as a pilot for Marcello (a New Orleans Mafioso who was deported by Attorney General Robert Kennedy in 1962) and anti-Castro Cubans. Oswald’s uncle was a runner for Marcello. Further, four dancers at Ruby’s club stated that they saw Oswald and Ruby together two weeks prior to the assassination. Ruby had been a runner for Al Capone in Chicago, had cooperated and worked with the Mafia in developing his strip joints in Dallas, and seemed to have visited Santos Trafficante in the Cuban prison Triscomia. Four witnesses claimed to have seen Ruby in Dealey Plaza during the time of the assassination: Julia Ann Mercer, Jean Hill, off-duty policeman Thomas Tilson, Jr., and TV cameraman Malcolm Couch. Tilson and Couch never were called to testify by the Warren Commission. In attempting to convince Jean Hill that she was mistaken, FBI Agent J. Gordon Shanklin told her that Jack Ruby had an unimpeachable witness who could place him in the Dallas Morning News at the time of the assassination. Dallas police Chief Jesse Curry chose the basement route for Oswald’s transfer to the Dallas County jail despite Ruby’s phone calls to Officer Billy Grammer warning of a plot to kill Oswald in the basement. The officer in charge of basement security was Lt. George Butler, an old friend of Ruby and a member of the KKK, who moonlighted as a security guard for oil man H.L. In Miami, on November 9, 1963, a right-wing extremist named Joseph Milteer informed a Willie Somerset, a police informant that an assassination of JFK was “in the works.” Milteer stated that Kennedy would be killed “from an office building with a high power rifle.… (Then) they will pick up somebody…within hours afterward … just to throw the public off.” He continued, “It’s in the works.… There ain’t no countdown to it.… We just got to be sitting to go.” Tapes of Milteer’s comments were turned over by the Miami Police to the Secret Service. After some inquiries the case was quickly closed. The information apparently was not relayed to the Secret Service agents in charge of the President’s Dallas trip. The day of the assassination Milteer phoned his “friend” Somerset to say that Kennedy was expected in Dallas that day and would probably never again visit Miami. After the assassination Milteer boasted that the plot he had described had succeeded. Five days later the FBI asked Milteer about these statements. He denied making any threats. As the Warren Commission was winding down, the FBI passed along its documents on Milteer.

As the Warren Commission was winding down, the FBI passed along its documents on Milteer. The matter is ignored in the Warren Report and the twenty-six volumes of published evidence. Another instance where vital information was suppressed prior to the assassination and from the Warren Commission comes from former FBI employee William S. Walter, who received warning of a possible presidential assassination attempt over the FBI Teletype in the New Orleans office on November 17, 1963. He called five agents who handled investigatory units. In 1976 Walter gave a recollection of the FBI telex to the Senate Intelligence Committee chaired by Richard Schweiker. After the Freedom of Information Act was passed, it was possible to get this telex: Shortly after Kennedy was shot, Walter asserts that he checked the file again to see if the warning was still there, but it had been removed. Months earlier, President Kennedy’s motorcade was cancelled in Chicago due to murder threats that the Secret Service were aware of. Former Chicago Secret Service agent Abraham Bolden has confirmed that “there were to be no written reports, and information was to be given to [Chicago Secret Service Chief Maurice Martineau] by him orally. After the assassination the Chicago Secret Service Chief showed them a memo from Washington “that the Secret Service was to discuss no aspect of the assassination and investigation with anyone from any other federal agency now or any time in the future.” Bolden disregarded these orders and went to Washington to talk with Warren Commission staffers about the Secret Service laxity and the assassination attempts in Chicago and Tampa. He was arrested the next day based on “information” from two mafia criminals that Bolden had previously put in jail. The FBI also ignored repeated warnings from exiled Cuban businessman and FBI informant Jose Aleman. Aleman spoke with Miami Mafioso Santos Trafficante in September 1962 when Trafficante stated: “Kennedy’s not going to make it to the election. He is going to be hit.” Aleman told investigators that he was “given the distinct impression that Hoffa (who’s Teamsters Union was a major source of Mafia loans) was principally involved in the elimination of Kennedy.” Aleman told the FBI “something was going to happen.… I was telling them to be careful.” Aleman was noticeably fearful in testifying before the HSCA in 1978, as noted by Chairman Louis Stokes. Jose Aleman died in 1983, broke and crazy. He did live in fear for his life.63 112th Military Intelligence Group contacted the FBI in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:104:e1e3e7e1101b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 398, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 105, "text": "the distinct impression that Hoffa (who’s Teamsters Union was a major source of Mafia loans) was principally involved in the elimination of Kennedy.” Aleman told the FBI “something was going to happen.… I was telling them to be careful.” Aleman was noticeably fearful in testifying before the HSCA in 1978, as noted by Chairman Louis Stokes. Jose Aleman died in 1983, broke and crazy. He did live in fear for his life.63 112th Military Intelligence Group contacted the FBI in both San Antonio and Dallas and stated that the Hidell/Oswald file was available to investigators. The FBI never picked up this file and the Warren Commission never questioned Colonel Jones. Although the Warren Commission specifically asked to see any military files on Oswald, the files were withheld from the Commission. Later, the Army claimed that the file was “destroyed routinely” in 1973, in accordance with normal file management procedures, as are thousands of intelligence files annually. The inconsistencies between the reports regarding Kennedy’s wounds at Parkland Hospital in Dallas and at Bethesda Naval Hospital are infamous. The six doctors at Parkland Hospital in Dallas observed Kennedy’s head wound to be about 35 square centimeters with the massive exit wound on the rear of the head. They established that a small wound of 3 ⋅ 5 mm , which would indicate an entrance wound, existed in the throat area. Also, a wound six inches down from the right shoulder, 53/4–6 inches down from the collar of his shirt, at the third thoracic vertebra, was confirmed on the death certificate by Dr. Burkley, the President’s doctor. Kennedy’s body was wrapped in sheets and placed in an expensive bronze ceremonial casket. Two hours later, the report of the military-controlled autopsy at Bethesda differed markedly from that of the doctors at Parkland on both the location and size of all of these wounds. Kennedy’s body somehow arrived in a slate gray body bag in a plain gray shipping casket. The head wound expanded to 130 square centimeters, with the location four inches higher and on the right side of the head. The throat wound had somehow become a three-inch gash. This confused the doctors at Parkland. Logically, if an assassin had fired from the sixth floor, a bullet couldn’t penetrate nearly six inches below the shoulder, as the death certificate, the autopsy chart, and Kennedy’s clothing indicate, and then emerge from the front of the neck. Thus, after the Warren Commission needed “evidence” to be consistent with the lone assassin theory, the back wound was relocated to the base of the neck in the final autopsy report. Parkland surgeon Charles Crenshaw, who attempted to revive Kennedy, revealed in his book JFK: Conspiracy of Silence that “I have wanted to shout to the world that the wounds to Kennedy’s head and throat were caused by bullets that struck him from the front, not the back.”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:105:b575fbe5c311", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 399, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 106, "text": "the neck.

Parkland surgeon Charles Crenshaw, who attempted to revive Kennedy, revealed in his book JFK: Conspiracy of Silence that “I have wanted to shout to the world that the wounds to Kennedy’s head and throat were caused by bullets that struck him from the front, not the back.” Crenshaw noted that he was given an edict of secrecy by Dr. Charles Baxter; the director of the emergency room at Parkland, and he feared for his job if he spoke out. Dr. McClelland stated to the Warren Commission “I was in such a position that I could clearly examine the head wound. I noted that the right posterior portion of the skull had been blasted.”64 The descriptions of the wound in the lower back of the president written in the report by FBI agents Sibert and O’Neill 11/26/63, and the FBI summary and Supplemental Reports 12/9/63 and 1/13/64, are not mentioned in the Warren Report, nor the Hearings and Exhibits. The report of a low back wound should match with the President’s shirt and coat as well as the autopsy diagram – but would not be consistent with a shot from the 6th floor of the TSBD, with a downward trajectory, exiting the neck. The autopsy pictures were not shown to the Commission. They were viewed by Chief Justice Warren, and supposedly on grounds of sensitivity, the Commission elected to have an artist draw autopsy pictures. Harold “Skip” Rydberg, the artist, and junior counsels Specter and Belin were angry that they were not allowed to view the autopsy pictures. Dulles, Ford and McCloy were the most active members of the Warren Commission, and they were the most effective in avoiding an examination of the intelligence agencies. Oswald was portrayed to the Commission as a Marxist, an organizer for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and a defector to the Soviet Union who was preparing to defect again to Cuba. On the first day of hearings Dulles promoted copies of a book The Assassins that portrayed all major American political assassinations as the work of crazed lone gunmen. The FBI knew that the CIA pictures of “Oswald” entering the Russian and Cuban Embassies in Mexico City in 1963 were clearly not pictures of Oswald. Evidence seemingly had been manipulated to make it appear that Cuba and or Russia were directing Oswald, evidence the Warren Commission chose to ignore. The President stated that rumors of the most exaggerated kind were circulating in this country and overseas. Some rumors went as far as attributing the assassination to a faction within the government wishing the Presidency assumed by Johnson.

Some rumors went as far as attributing the assassination to a faction within the government wishing the Presidency assumed by Johnson. Others if not quenched, could conceivably lead the country to a world war, which would cost forty million lives. No one could refuse to do something, which might prevent such a possibility. The President convinced him (Warren) that this was an occasion on which the actual conditions had to override general principles. Johnson and some of his advisors thought that public knowledge of the apparent Cuban and Russian involvement in the assassination could have prompted a mass response for revenge – which could have led to a world war. So, a patriotic motive was given to the Warren Commissioners to pacify the public and classify the documents. When alleged “pictures” of Oswald entering the Cuban and Russian Embassies in 1963 were sent by the CIA to the HSCA, the pictures were of a balding man about fifty pounds heavier than Oswald. CIA document 657-831 indicates that Allen Dulles privately coached CIA officers on how best to discuss whether Oswald was an agent. The day following the assassination Hoover canceled orders to Contact the FBI’s Cuban sources … he excluded all of the Bureau’s Cuban experts and supervisors from the investigation abandoning any Cuban angle.… Hoover turned the investigation over to the Bureau’s Soviet experts. Senior CIA officers, in concert with the FBI, maneuvered to keep the public in the dark about any possible connection between the agency and Oswald’s movements in Mexico City or his tagged pro-Castro activities in New Orleans. In late December Deputy Director of Plans Richard Helms removed John Whitten from the CIA’s investigation and replaced him with James Angleton, the Chief of the agency’s counter intelligence staff. According to Whitten, Angleton had “direct ties’ with Hoover. 66 Proof of Oswald’s purported weeklong visit to Mexico was still nonexistent as late as September 1964. Marina Oswald maintained that the trip never occurred and FBI searches had revealed no evidence of it. Marina had been cloistered in a motel room for months after the assassination for extensive questioning. Suddenly, days before the Warren Commission’s Final Report, “evidence” was found in the presence of “reporter” Priscilla Johnson, a witting asset of the CIA. Marina somehow supposedly found ticket stubs for a trip to Mexico City tucked in a Spanish language television schedule. Senator Russell was unconvinced. Why would Oswald bring back a Spanish language television guide if he spoke almost no Spanish? Why would Marina bring it to the motel room? Why were previous FBI searches unable to uncover this?

Nevertheless other Commissioners prevailed regarding the reliability of this evidence.67 Priscilla Johnson “had also met Lee Oswald in Moscow in 1959.” In an almost obliterated CIA document, #646-277, the reason Johnson’s name appeared in Oswald’s personal notebook was stated. Priscilla Johnson “has apparently been employed on a part-time basis within the U.S. Embassy during two periods of residence in Russia.” A “part-time basis” is often a euphemism used by the CIA in referring to its contract agents. CIA asset Richard Snyder could have used the U.S. Embassy in Moscow as a cover and sent cables to the State Department and CIA that Johnson supplied for him. The Warren Commissioners did not agree among themselves on the final conclusions, and some members openly criticized the process and conclusions years later. Senators Russell and Cooper along with Congressman Boggs disagreed with the single bullet theory, and wrote a formal dissent. Somehow this dissent was lost from the record.68 Boggs had been the most vocal critic of the Warren Commissioners and stated that he had strong doubts about the “magic bullet.” Boggs had been the recipient of damaging material on the lives of critics of the Warren Commission and the FBI investigation of the President’s death, which led him to attack the FBI. Years later, Boggs declared “Hoover lied his eyes out to the Commission on Oswald, on Ruby, and their friends … you name it.” He also accused them of “Gestapo tactics.” Boggs, who would have soon become Speaker of the House and a powerful ally in reopening the investigation, disappeared without a trace on a military junket flight in Alaska on October 16, 1972. The Warren Commission staffers did not have access to the deliberations of the executive sessions. And while the Commission lacked the authority to classify documents, it classified the transcripts of its proceedings “Secret” or “Top Secret.” In 1965 President Johnson signed an executive order which provided that all of the Warren Commission’s materials would be kept in the National Archives, but which also permitted the various government agencies, such as the CIA and FBI, to require continual classification of the documents until the year 2039. So only a fraction of the CIA records found their way to the Commission in the first place. By 1977, Oswald’s CIA 201 files alone contained 1,194 documents, but until 12,300 pages were released in 1993 only 66 were made public in their entirety.

Part of our difficulty … is that [the FBI officials] have no problem, they have decided that it is Oswald who committed the assassination, they have decided that no one else was involved … (WC Executive Session $1 / 2 7 / 6 4 $ ) in 1978 former Warren Commission assistant counsel Burt Griffin told HSCA that – ‘I felt betrayed, if feel like the CIA lied to us. (BBC Special on the Kennedy Assassination: “What Do We Know Now that We Didn’t Know Then”). Thus the Warren Commission ratified a “Noble Lie,” preferring official dignity and perceived national security, over truth. The Warren Report was more improvised public relations than a real investigation. After the Warren Report was released, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover asked for all derogatory material on Warren Commission members and staff contained in FBI files.69 Chief Justice Earl Warren was asked by a reporter 2/4/64 whether testimony taken by the Commission would be made public; He responded: “Yes, there will come a time. But it might not be in your lifetime… there may be some things that involve security. This would be preserved but not made public.” 70 This statement was seen by some of Warren’s friends as a blunder which damaged the commission’s reputation. Katherine Graham wrote Warren, “It seems to me that you are courting an undesirable and unnecessary impression by publicly discussing the investigation, however guardedly, while it is in progress.”71 Warren agreed, and lamented that “We desired no publicity whatsoever, but for a time, the pressure was almost hysterical.” Junior counsel Arlen Specter was convinced that Chief Justice Warren determined early on that Oswald acted alone. Warren’s attitude was “let’s get this goddamn thing over with … in a hurry.” 72 The Warren Report was not consistent with the 26 volumes of Hearings and Exhibits, but the biases, gaps and contradictions would only be painstakingly revealed over time. The upcoming media coverage of the Warren Report can be glimpsed when CBS taped Mark Lane’s critical lecture just prior to the release of the Report. A CBS representative called Lane to say that the lecture had been edited to “about the finest nine minutes of television viewing that I have ever seen.… It will be shown tomorrow evening, or the next evening.” It was never shown.74 The Warren Report coverage revived Mark Twain’s notion that “A lie can get halfway around the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:109:64fc9c4afec0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 403, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 110, "text": "coverage of the Warren Report can be glimpsed when CBS taped Mark Lane’s critical lecture just prior to the release of the Report.

That didn’t seem to matter as the mass media greeted the report with staunch support, while the alternative media cov erage varied widely – from support to caution to dissent. All of the major networks devoted special programs which faithfully backed the Report. CIA assets strengthened the Cold War mass media-government cooper ation during this crisis, while trusted establishment sources avoided and denigrated critics as well as contradictions in the evidence. The Warren Report reached an American public where 70% still had confidence in government. Years later, former PBS anchor Robert Mac-Neil observed that “the report fell on receptive ears and fitted a psychological and emotional matrix of a nation disposed to blame a deranged gunman rather than the wholesome society from which he came.” ( John Barbour The Garrison Tapes). The long awaited Warren Commission Report, on its exhaustive investigation … will probably be released over the weekend. The Department of State is air pouching copies of the report to ports for selective presentation to “editors,” jurists, government officials, and opinion leaders… the unwarranted interpretation that Ruby’s murder of Oswald was committed to prevent Oswald from revealing the purported conspiracy adds to the belief. Communist regimes have used both murders to denigrate American society and the release of the Report will undoubtedly be used as a new peg for the same purpose.… Covert assets should explain the tragedy wherever it is genuinely misunderstood and counter all efforts to misconstrue it intentionally.… Communists and other extremists always attempt to prove a political conspiracy behind violence. In countries accustomed to assassination by political conspiracy, American dedication to institutions of law and government with stable administration procedures can be described; and American Presidents can be shown to have been victims (with the exception of Lincoln) of single, fanatical individuals.

The New York Times lead story by Anthony Lewis of September 27, 1964 declared: “The Warren Commission analyzed every issue in exhaustive, almost archeological detail…” An editorial proclaimed “The facts, exhaustively gathered, independently checked and cogently set forth, destroy the basis for conspiracy theories that have grown weed-like in this country and abroad.” C.L. Sulzberger wrote, “It was essential in these restless days to remove unfounded suspicions that could excite latent jingo spirit. And it is necessary to reassure our allies that ours is a stable reliable democracy.” Reporter Arthur Krock, an old friend of JFK, declared the Warren Report as the “definitive history of the tragedy.” Harrison Salisbury declared in the New York Times paperback edition of the Warren Report, “the evidence of Oswald’s single handed guilt is overwhelming.” The Warren Report has given the American people, and the world, a report, which deserves acceptance as the whole truth and nothing but the truth about the assassination of President Kennedy.… No doubt rumor and speculation will continue to be disseminated among the gullible, the perversely romantic and the morbid as they have circulated for years concerning other presidential assassinations… It is impossible for rational men to believe that this commission could have been either corrupted or deceived into error… The Washington Post of 9/28/64 devoted seven pages reprinting portions of the Warren Report, along with numerous euphoric stories. One story was titled, “A masterpiece of its kind, if not elegant literature.” One article, drawn from dispatches, briefly noted disapproval of the report, but none of the critical arguments were discussed. On September 27, 1964, the very day the Warren Report was released, CBS broadcast a two-hour Warren Report “illustration,” reverentially backing it. Actually the piece was ready by July, the expected release date, but the Warren Commission lawyers needed more time. Years later, CBS Executive Producer Les Midgely attempted to clarify: In early September 1964, Mark Lane and filmmaker Emile de Antonio, a Harvard classmate of JFK, viewed CBS outtakes in the CBS film library for five hours, focusing on interviews related to the assassination. When a witness said something which contradicted the Warren Report the interview was snipped away and turned into an outtake. Lane stated, “If a witness said, for example, that he heard the shots and at the time believed that they had come from the knoll, the interview might be", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:111:94186b7b04be", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 405, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 112, "text": "1964, Mark Lane and filmmaker Emile de Antonio, a Harvard classmate of JFK, viewed CBS outtakes in the CBS film library for five hours, focusing on interviews related to the assassination.

Lane stated, “If a witness said, for example, that he heard the shots and at the time believed that they had come from the knoll, the interview might be halted and begun again. What was said in the interim is as puzzling as the Warren Commissions ‘off the record’ discussions.” The CBS program, as with the Summary of the Warren Report, proclaimed, “there is no hint” of differences of opinion.3 Lane and de Antonio immediately signed a “blue sheet contract,” essentially an official offer to buy the outtakes. According to Lane, the next morning de Antonio called the CBS library to arrange for another appointment to view footage and was told “CBS would not sell any of the footage to us; in fact, CBS was soon to destroy the film.” The librarian added, “we could, of course, view no more film … and that its decision was final and there was no appeal to it.” 4 The process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious or it would bring with it the feeling of falsity and hence of guilt.… To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that became inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just as long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies – all this is indispensably necessary.”5 The procedures used by CBS challenged the canons of journalism, censorship, and private property. How was CBS linked to the Warren Commission? Why did they proceed from a script? Why did they selectively edit to support the Warren Commission? When does the public have a right to know about critical historical moments? The Warren Report ironically criticized the Dallas police, the bar, and the media for the confusion during Oswald’s time in jail, and recommended the development of ethical standards on collecting and presenting information to the public. Washington Post managing editor Al Friendly glowingly supported early press coverage.

The Atlanta Constitution, 9/28/64, carried four New York Times reports and three AP reports, and all but one gave unqualified support to the Warren Report. One short report quoted American communists as well as Bertrand Russell as viewing the report as incredible; however, no facts or arguments were mentioned. A front-page piece by AP reporter Hugh Mulligan ran under the headline, “Report is Rebuff to Witch-Hunters.” The L.A. Times, 9/28/64, forcefully backed the findings in the Warren Report with a large headline “No Conspiracy in Kennedy Slaying,” and a number of writers summarized its findings. The headlines for Robert Donovan’s articles read “Oswald Acted Alone in Kennedy Assassination” and “Full Account of Tragedy a Masterpiece – Report Carries Stamp of Honesty and Authenticity.” The lengthy summary was printed in full with an AP byline. Vincent Burke’s piece, “Assassination Termed Act of Man ‘Alienated’ from Real World” underscored the lone-nut thesis. Remarkably, Life (10/2/64) chose to have Commissioner Gerald Ford review his own work. Perhaps as noteworthy, Life printed three different versions of this issue in the same day. At first a still frame from the Zapruder film, depicting Kennedy’s rearward motion at the moment of the head shot, was replaced with an earlier frame that gave no indication of the direction in which his head moved. The caption stated, “The assassin’s shot struck the right rear portion of the President’s skull, causing a massive wound and snapping his head to one side.” The accompanying photo (frame 323) showed the president slumped back against the seat, and leaning to the left, an instant after the fatal shot. The photo gave the impression that shots came from the front or the right. The second version of this issue replaced frame 323 with frame 313, the graphic picture of the president’s head exploding. The caption, though, remained the same. Then, a third version was developed, the resetting plates broken again at considerable expense, to create a new caption, which fit the Warren Commission findings. “The direction from which the shots came was established by this picture taken at the instant the bullet struck the rear of the President’s head, passing through, caused the front part of his skull to explode forward.” I am at a loss to explain the discrepancies between the three versions of Life, which you cite.

This omission was facilitated by the reversal of the two frames following the explosive frame 313 in the Warren Commission’s published volumes, which confused this issue by making it appear as if the head jerked forward. J. Edgar Hoover later claimed that the switch was a “printing error.” Newsweek, 10/5/64, devoted 24 pages of homage to the Warren Report. “The report was calm, measured, and overwhelming – in the weight of its evidence against Oswald, in the glint of fresh and authentic detail, and the sheer scope, intensity and thoroughness of the investigation …” The Warren Report psychologizing of Oswald began in the second paragraph. Oswald supposedly had a “deep rooted resentment to all authority” and “a hostility toward every society in which he lived” and was dogged by “isolation frustration and failure and an urge to find a place in history.” Newsweek contended that Oswald’s connections were interviewed, and both Cuba and the Soviet Union cooperated with the investigation – the information they furnished was independently checked on the spot by agents of the CIA. Newsweek’s national affairs editor, John Iselin sent Dulles a note thanking him for his judicious findings and that the magazines coverage of the report “was made easier through your kindness in giving us some idea of what to be on the watch for.”6a The Nation, 11/2/64_(⋅) , clarified their early concerns and then strongly backed the Warren Report as well. At the time the Warren Commission was appointed, the respected liberal journal took the position that “it would stoutly resist the temptation to enter the ranks of the rapidly expanding army of amateur ‘private eyes’ and miscellaneous freelance James Bonds, who were even then busy as beavers mass producing conspiracies among unnamed ‘oil millionaires’ and offering each day a new theory of President Kennedy’s assassination.” Admirably fulfilled its central objective … that is adequate to satisfy all reasonable doubts about the immediate essential facts.… If there are minor flaws … they are thrown into shadow by the conscientious and at times brilliant job that the commission has done.… Only those who for whatever reasons of personal or political myopia cannot bring themselves to face reality will continue to think that the tragedy was proximately the work of more than one man… Packwood regretted the committee leaks, the lack of simultaneous distribution of the Hearings", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:114:028ac9a06c51", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 408, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 115, "text": "to satisfy all reasonable doubts about the immediate essential facts.… If there are minor flaws … they are thrown into shadow by the conscientious and at times brilliant job that the commission has done.… Only those who for whatever reasons of personal or political myopia cannot bring themselves to face reality will continue to think that the tragedy was proximately the work of more than one man… Packwood regretted the committee leaks, the lack of simultaneous distribution of the Hearings and Exhibits, the “mischievous” Mark Lane, the gingerly treatment of Messrs. Curry and Wade, Oswald’s lack of counsel, and a perceived discouragement of dissenting opinions by Earl Warren. While noting that we have not seen the end of this affair, Packwood condescendingly concluded, Independent leftist journalist I.F. Stone also strongly backed the Warren Commission for its “first class job,” and condemned the critics in I.F. Stone’s Weekly (10/5/64). His story, “The Left and the Warren Commission” disparaged the “slanderous” style of some of the dissenters and admonished the need to [not] write and speak in just that hysterical and defamatory way from which the Left has suffered in the last quarter century. He claimed that journalists Joesten, Marzani and Buchanan had published “rubbish.” Isador Feinstein Stone had previously been the Washington editor for The Nation, and then worked for mainstream liberal dailies, P.M., the New York Star and the New York Daily Compass before launching his weekly one-man operation in 1953. (The circulation eventually reached 70,000.) His ringing praise for the Warren Report stunned many of his followers. It ran contrary to his usual working methods, as well as his perspective that “all governments lie.” When critic Raymond Marcus called Stone three years later to clarify his position Stone bellowed, “I don’t care about that asshole case!” (Marcus, Ray unpublished manuscript) I would be inclined to believe that the Federal Bureau of Investigation might have been more profitably employed in probing the facts of the case, rather than how I got them – which does seem a waste of time to me. At any rate, the whole thing smells a bit fishy. It’s a mite simple that a chap kills the President of the United States, escapes from that bother, kills a policeman, eventually is apprehended in a movie theater under circumstances that defy every law of police procedure, and subsequently is murdered under extraordinary circumstances. 7 The New Republic, 10/10/64, piece by Murray Kempton, “Warren Report Case for the Prosecution,” viewed a report “which drastically narrowed the area of doubt,” yet needed less psychologizing along with a commitment to the adversarial process. He questioned: Oswald’s marksmanship as “implausible but not impossible”; Howard Brennan’s inconsistency as a witness – positively identifying Oswald fully four weeks after the assassination; Brennan’s supposed statement to the Dallas Police, the source of the police alarm describing Oswald at 12:45.

Kempton then assessed police-media relations: The reporters should not have baited Lee Oswald; but much more fundamental the police should not have brought him out to be baited. Reporters go so far as society will let them; it was the duty of the cops to throw the reporters out. And the Commission has to be harsher on private citizens that were doing their job than on policemen who refused to do theirs.… For two days Chief Curry had been blatting to the papers any piece of evidence useful to his image. After Oswald was murdered, J. Edgar Hoover called Curry and told him to shut up. Thereafter the chief stopped talking to reporters. On Sunday night District Attorney Henry Wade came to Curry, said the world was full of rumors that Oswald died an innocent victim and he proposed to go before the press and set the record straight … Curry, with the wrath of Hoover still hot upon him, refused to give Wade any of the police case. Wade went doggedly ahead from what he remembered … and appeared on television to reassure the police that Oswald was guilty beyond any possible debate. “Unfortunately,” the Commission says, “he lacked a thorough grasp of the evidence and made a number of errors … [which provided much of the basis for myths and rumors …” The New Leader 10/12/64 revealed inconsistencies and omissions in the Warren Report’s investigation of the Tippit shooting. “The Other Witnesses” by George and Patricia Nash explored three witnesses they had found whose descriptions of the murder differed markedly from the Warren Report. Frank Wright stated that he witnessed the shooting about half a block from his apartment and his wife called for an ambulance. Wright seemed certain that a man of medium build with a long coat was close to Tippit and then ran to his grey car after Tippit fell. He was not interviewed by the Dallas police nor the Warren Commission. Another witness, Acguilla Clemons, saw two men around Tippit’s squad car but her statement was not officially taken supposedly because of health reasons. These witnesses significantly disagreed with witness Helen Markham on how soon the ambulance arrived and undermine her credibility.

Reader’s Digest, with psychological warfare expert Eugene Lyons (Radio Free Europe) as a senior editor, ran a story in September of 1964 supportive of the Warren Commission. Although they did not write on the Warren Report, in the November 1964 issue they ran a story from former Vice-President Richard Nixon. “Cuba, Castro and John F. Kennedy: Reflections on U.S. Foreign Policy” viewed Oswald as “demented … and driven … by Communism in particular … Castro was the indirect cause of the tragic snuffing out of John F. Kennedy’s life…” Nixon proclaimed that, “The last four years have seen the greatest series of foreign policy failures in any comparable period in our history.” The Legal Intelligencer, a law journal from Philadelphia, ran the riveting dissent of Vincent Salandria 11/2/64, “The Warren Report – Analysis of Shots, Trajectories and Wounds: A Lawyer’s Dissenting View.” Salandria cited the auditory, visual and olfactory stimuli indicating a shot from the front which was ignored, as well as the trajectory of the shot which hit James Tague not emanating from the TSBD. The Warren Report disregarded testimony of Secret Service Agent Glen Bennett, stationed to the right rear of the President’s follow-up car. Although the Report gave “substantial weight” to Bennett’s other observation – that the first shot missed. “Connally’s body did not react immediately after the President’s body reacted. Therefore, the same bullet that hit the President did not hit him. The Commission would have us believe that Governor Connally was wrong, his wife was wrong, the FBI’s initial findings were wrong, the Zapruder film was wrong, and that there is no law of physics called action and reaction. Governor Connally was not hit by the first bullet to hit President Kennedy.” In November, a team of NBC newsmen came to Dallas and contacted Jim Kerr of the Dallas Times Herald. Kerr contacted Dallas Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig, a witness to events in Dealey Plaza after the assassination, to set up an interview. NBC had been calling Craig since October but Craig was reluctant to talk – fearful of the reaction of his boss, Sheriff Bill Decker. The powerful chief, who ran his office like a Field Marshall, ordered Craig to “Tell them you didn’t see or hear anything.” After that, Decker assigned officers to spy on Craig. Craig followed orders, but a few years later he talked with journalist Penn Jones and worked for Jim Garrison.8 In December 1964 the New York Times and Bantam Books issued The Witnesses, which claimed to be “the highlights of the Hearings before the Warren Commission… selected and edited by the New York Times.” All", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:117:c521c3251078", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 411, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 118, "text": "his office like a Field Marshall, ordered Craig to “Tell them you didn’t see or hear anything.” After that, Decker assigned officers to spy on Craig.

Excerpts from Abraham Zapruder’s testimony do not include his statements where he considered it likely that some of the shots came from behind him on the grassy knoll. Numerous other witnesses, who reported that at least some of the shots were fired from in front, also had their testimony omitted. Excerpts from the testimony of Naval Commander J.J. Humes omitted his acknowledged burning of the first draft of the autopsy report. Excerpts from the testimony of Major Eugene D. Anderson and Sergeant James A. Zahn (who served with Lee Harvey Oswald in the Marines) suggest that the shots were not difficult and that Oswald had the capability to have fired them. However, the statement that Nelson Delgado, Oswald’s Marine Sergeant, gave to the FBI that Oswald was a poor rifleman was omitted from the Warren Report.9 Deleted from the testimony of Secret Service agents William Greer, Clint Hill and Roy Kellerman were statements which placed the wound in the back of the president approximately six inches below the shoulder, a description at significant variance with the official autopsy report. The Witnesses also excluded testimony from witness Arnold Rowland in which he told the Warren Commission that he had actually seen two men on the sixth floor of the TSBD at the time of the assassination, but that the FBI told him to “forget it,” and in which he stated his conviction that the shots had been fired from the railroad yards in front of the President. The Witnesses also omitted the testimony of: James Tague, Billy Lovelady, Roy Truly, Lee Bowers, James Underwood, Frank Reilly, S. M. Holland, special assistant to the President David Powers and others who reported seeing some shots fired from the front, as well as Jean Hill who reported seeing a man fleeing the grassy knoll area after the shooting, Wilma Tice and reporter Seth Kantor, and many others.

So The Witnesses, compiled by America’s “newspaper of record,” manufactured consent for the Warren Commission. At about this time the Associated Press published their own strongly pro-Warren Report book, The Torch is Passed. A year after the assassination, the AP ran two articles by Sid Moody, one of the major authors of the book. These pieces were as strongly pro-Warren Report as the book. The lone faint note of dissent was from Oswald’s mother who called him a “patsy.” Abraham Zapruder was interviewed for the first time but was not asked about the direction of the shots. Ruth Paine was portrayed as a warm person, “troubled” by her closeness to the Oswalds, who wondered what “demons” drove Oswald, and “laughs” at rumors of a plot. Jack Ruby was portrayed as a strange, suicidal, patriotic loner who talked more with (Dallas D.A.) Henry Wade, than to his own lawyer. Governor Connally’s feelings were probed, but not his beliefs regarding the sequence and number of shots. In his other story “Dallas’ Everyday Places … JFK’s There in Death,” Moody described Oswald’s flophouse; Marina Oswald’s new home; Ruth Paine’s feelings, patriotism and cooperation with law enforcement; and Pat Kirkwood’s joint – where the Secret Service “had stopped” before the assassination. These backgrounders offered vivid impressions, but avoided any investigation.10 Liberation, 1/65, a new left magazine published by Dave Dellinger and A.J. Muste, ran Vincent Salandria’s expanded critique “A Philadelphia Lawyer Analyzes the Shots, Trajectories and Wounds.” Salandria cited Dr. Charles R. Baxter’s testimony to the Warren Report that the President’s neck wound would be unusual and unlikely for a point of exit for a high velocity missile. Dr. Ronald Jones (at Parkland Hospital) also saw the neck wound as one of entry. Warren Commission counsel Arlen Specter had asked Jones if this neck wound could be an exit wound from a low-velocity rifle (like the Mannlicher-Carcano) and Jones agreed. This though did not fit with the other high velocity wounds to the President and Connally. Salandria examined the testimony of Special Agent Roy Kellerman, who was at the autopsy in Bethesda, to clarify the finding of Col. P. Finck “…we were standing right alongside of him, he is probing inside the shoulder with his instrument and I said, ‘Colonel where did it [the bullet] go.’ He said, There are no lanes for an outlet of this entry in this man’s shoulder.”11 Such a finding would make the back wound a separate hit.

Frazier, the holes in the President’s coat and jacket were 5%^(′′) and 5%^(′′) below the collar, Commander Humes attempted to reconcile these evidentiary differences by suggesting that the President was waving which “would further accentuate the elevation of the coat and the shirt.” However, Exhibit 396 shows President Kennedy gesturing to the crowd waving no higher than his forehead. Dr. Humes conceded that the drawings were not “absolutely true to scale.” Salandria noted that “no criminal court in the land would have admitted those drawings as evidence without having first required the production of autopsy x-rays with the colored and the black and white pictures of the body.” Salandria outlined the criticisms to the single-bullet theory by quoting Connally’s testimony, his wife’s, noting the lack of any eyewitness testimony, the Zapruder film, and the ballistics evidence of Dr. Robert Shaw (Connally’s doctor) that more than 3 grains of metal were in the Governor’s body – more than were lost from CE 399. He noted witnesses stating they thought the head shot to the President came from the front – a right temporal wound, including Dr. McClelland at Parkland Hospital and Father Oscar Huber, Secret Service Agents and Dr. Marion Jenkins. Numerous witnesses at Parkland Hospital testified to seeing not a small entry wound in the back of the head but rather a gaping wound – contrary to the reports from the Bethesda doctors. Life’s relationship with the CIA seemingly led them to run a cover picture of a North Vietnamese stamp that showed the Vietnamese shooting down American planes (2/26/65). These gruesome stamps showed that the Vietnamese were glorifying the killing of Americans. We later learned that the North Vietnamese had no such stamps – they were actually CIA forgeries. The Atlantic Monthly, March 1965, ran a hyperbolic defense of the Warren Report in Lord Patrick Devlin’s “Death of a President: The Established Facts.” Previously a Justice to the British High Court, Devlin concluded that the Warren Report painstakingly proved the case against Oswald; however, the actions of the Dallas authorities created suspicions. “Everything big and little that was said and done in this great tragedy is here set down.” Devlin’s discussion of witness Howard Brennan glossed over the inconsistencies in his testimony and an inattention to what was printed in the Warren Report. This abuse of his discretion led to a derisive challenge to critics, “if they can suggest one [theory] that is even faintly credible, they will deserve more public attention then", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:120:f93f06fe0c7b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 414, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 121, "text": "however, the actions of the Dallas authorities created suspicions. “Everything big and little that was said and done in this great tragedy is here set down.” Devlin’s discussion of witness Howard Brennan glossed over the inconsistencies in his testimony and an inattention to what was printed in the Warren Report.

Kennedy.” McDonald viewed the Report as an imaginary American “anti-Iliad,” rather than a murder investigation. Esquire’s bold journalism also piqued the interest of New Orleans Judge Jim Garrison. The Minority of One ran “Fifty-One Witnesses” by Harold Feldman, 3/65, exploring the witnesses who stated shots from the grassy knoll. They also ran a letter to the editor, “Oswald Censored” where Lillian Castelano noted that the CBS 1964 program on the Warren Report omitted Oswald’s remark “I’m a patsy.” Journalist Fred Cook composed a short piece raising contradictions in the Warren Report version of the firing sequence and submitted it to Carey McWilliams, the editor of The Nation. After three weeks McWilliams rejected the article, although he could not find flaws in Cook’s reasoning. Cook surmised that McWilliams and others were concerned that, “if the assassination proved to be the work of a conspiracy, it might start another irresponsible witch-hunt comparable to that of the McCarthy era.” Government officials charge that American destroyers sustained two unprovoked attacks by North Vietnamese warships in international waters. This led to the passage of the Tonkin Gulf resolution, which supported any presidential action taken in Vietnam and helped legitimize the subsequent American support of the war. In fact, accounts now reveal that one of the two North Vietnamese attacks on American destroyers probably never took place and that American ships were providing intelligence support for South Vietnamese covert military attacks of North Vietnam. Furthermore, the congressional resolution was actually prepared by the Johnson administration before both the Tonkin Gulf crisis and the 1964 election. This suggests that President Johnson and his administration were able to use the Tonkin Gulf crisis to manipulate the media and maximize domestic political support in order to “get tough” and exercise greater force in Vietnam. In other words because of the secrecy and covert nature of the operation, because of administration lies, both the Congress and the public were seriously misled.14 In contrast, in June 1965 Kilgallen tried to present her findings on the ABC show Nightlife, a talk show that competed with Johnny Carson.

While in the dressing room ABC producer Nick Vanoff approached her and prohibited her from discussing the “too controversial” subject, the source of Vanoff ’s concern was never clear. Early critic Harold Weisberg self-published Whitewash, August 1965, after a series of rejections from publishers. None of the rejections “contained any adverse editorial comments.” Further “seven literary agents … found themselves too busy to do justice to the book once they learned of the subject matter.” One agent noted, “No American publisher will now touch this subject.”15 In August of 1965, Life reiterated its position on Oswald’s guilt in Keith Wheeler’s piece “Cursed Gun: The Track of C2766,” which traced the history of the Mannlicher-Carcano as well as the handgun reported to have been Oswald’s. Considerable attention was given to the history of the rifle, yet the lack of powder burns on Oswald’s cheeks based on a negative paraffin test was unmentioned. Although Dallas police initially reported the rifle found on the sixth floor to be a German Mauser 7.65, a .30-30, a high powered army or Japanese rifle of .25 calibers, an Argentine made Mauser or a British .305, the early confusion was not noted. The initial lack of fingerprints on the rifle didn’t seem noteworthy to Wheeler either. The Mannlicher-Carcano had long been the butt of jokes in Italy where it was called “that cursed gun” and “the humane weapon.” Wheeler however, declared that a man of “impeccable credentials … Robert Frazier, an FBI firearms specialist who test fired the gun, has testified. It is a very accurate weapon.” Those close to the scene realize that if the widow of Lee Harvey Oswald … ever got out the “whole story” of her life with President Kennedy’s alleged assassin, it would split open the front pages of newspapers all over the world. Even if Marina explained why her late husband looked so different in an official police photo and the widely printed full-length picture feature on the cover of Life magazine, it would have caused a sensation.

Marc Sinclair, her lawyer Mort Barber, as well as Mark Lane.17 By then her phone was tapped and she was calling other critics from phone booths. She was the last journalist to interview Jack Ruby, and apparently was intending to print it in her forthcoming book, Murder One. But before she published her story she died, victim of what police said was a drug overdose, yet no quantities were given in the autopsy report. No notes relating to her chapter on Jack Ruby were ever found.18 The junior NYC medical examiner, Dr. James Luke, officially estimated that she overdosed on barbiturates and alcohol “circumstances undetermined,” between 2:00 and 4:00 am, November 8th, just 3-5 hours after appearing on the popular television show What’s My Line? After the show she had cocktails with friends and mentioned that she had “shocking” information and was excited about her upcoming book. In a 1978 interview Dr. Luke noted that Kilgallen probably did not commit suicide: “the pills were not what we might expect to find in cases that are suicide.” Curiously, Kilgallen was found to have 50 cubic centimeters of “pink fluid” in her stomach, which was sent to toxicology for analysis. If the analysis was done it was never made available to Dr. Luke. The Director of Toxicology at the New York City Medical Examiner’s Office, (Dr. Charles Umberger), believed that Kilgallen had been murdered, according to his top assistant, chemist John Broich. Broich agreed and recounted that in 1968 Dr. Umberger advised that he should “keep it under your hat.” The City of New York was not yet regularly using tests that could determine which drug or drugs from three fast-acting barbiturates had been involved in the death. Umberger, using more sophisticated tests, found that secobarbital, (seconal) amobarbital, (tuinal) and pentobarbital (trademark Nembutal), were particularly dangerous in the right amount and in combination. Nembutal is now a controlled substance sometimes used in executions. The chemist who ran the tests for the Department of Toxicology, which were to be given to the Department of Pathology, determined that quinine, which might have covered the bitterness of the secreted barbiturates, was found in “brain, bile and liver.” The quinine somehow was not reported to the Department of Pathology. Further, Kilgallen was found lying on a bed which her friends and family said that she never used, somehow sitting in an upright position. Years later Dr. Broich revealed that it was “not unusual for the medical examiners to screw up a case, there weren’t too many people working there who could get a job anywhere else.”19 Kilgallen was not the first reporter researching Jack Ruby to die under suspicious circumstances.

Bill Hunter, a reporter for the Long Beach Press-Telegram and Jim Koethe a respected reporter for the Dallas Times Herald had visited Ruby’s apartment on the evening after Oswald’s murder. Before the police had an opportunity to search the premises, they met with Ruby’s roommate George Senator, Ruby’s attorney Tom Howard, and attorney Jim Martin. Hunter was killed when a detective’s gun discharged, ostensibly by accident, in the hands of a policeman “playing a game of quick draw” at the Long Beach police station in April of 1964. Jim Koethe, who was writing a book on the assassination, was mysteriously found dead in his apartment five months later. His neck had been broken as he emerged from a shower. None of his writings or notes was found. No investigation of the murder was ever conducted.20 The universally strong support among the major mass media for the Warren Report strengthened the early “lone nut” consensus. The often-derisive characterizations of those who questioned the Report, along with the deaths of Hunter, Koethe and Kilgallen, sent a chilling message to independent voices in the mainstream and alternative media. The sole mainstream media sources to challenge the “Noble Lie” were Esquire and the New York Journal-American. … If one wanted to remain a member in good standing in Washington political and social circles, it was wise not to say something intemperate about the assassination. This expedient position was couched as doing what was right for the country, and helping it get along with business… while the country’s ruling caste – from President Johnson on down–muttered among themselves about a conspiracy, these same leaders worked strenuously – with the media’s collaboration – to calm the public’s fears.21 Ironically, in 1965 Congress funded a quarterly magazine called Censorship, as part of the cultural Cold War, which investigated limitations on free expression around the world. Although most of the articles concerned communist and authoritarian regimes, they also included thought control and press taboos in Japan, Western Europe and the U.S., written by presumably unwitting assets in academe. The editor, Meir Mindlin, admitted years later that he should have guessed that Censorship was a CIA front. Deceptive efforts to support the Warren Report by CBS, the New York Times and Life, the Associated Press and UPI, proved central to the circling of the wagons. These mainstream sources acted solidly supportive of the Warren Report, even two months before the 26 volumes of Hearings and Evidence were released.

These mainstream sources acted solidly supportive of the Warren Report, even two months before the 26 volumes of Hearings and Evidence were released. Cold War media-elite-government cooperation, along with fears of a nuclear war, and the fear of appearing like a banana republic, galvanized the faithful support. Author Gay Talese viewed the relationship between the New York Times and the highest levels of the U.S. government as “a hard alliance,” which in any large showdown would “undoubtedly close ranks and stand together.” Cold war cooperation at the Washington Post centered on the Graham family, and the death of Phil left his wife, the inexperienced and cautious Katherine, at the helm. Since no major American political leader challenged the Report, it made it easier for the media to avoid confronting the confusing contradictions. The Minority of One steadily unraveled contradictions in the official story with monthly reporting which included the investigations of Penn Jones, Sylvia Meagher, Eric Norden, Cedric Belfrige, Mark Lane, Harold Feldman, and Vincent Salandria. Soon they would print articles by Martin Seboty, Jim Garrison and Conner Cruise O’Brien among others. I have a concern for the strange things happening in America in recent months … Miss Dorothy Kilgallen joins the growing list of persons who have died after a private interview with one of the two members of the Jack Ruby-George Senator Team. We have printed the strange deaths of Bill Hunter and Jim Koethe after they had a private interview with George Senator and Ruby’s attorney Tom Howard. Hunter and Koethe were murdered. Lawyer Tom Howard died under strange circumstances. Now Miss Kilgallen dies under clouded circumstances. During the Ruby trial in Dallas, Judge Joe B. Brown granted Miss Kilgallen a privilege given no other newsman. She had thirty minutes alone with Jack Ruby. Even the guards were outside the door. Miss Kilgallen told some of what went on in the interview in her columns. But was someone afraid of the interview in her columns? But was someone afraid that she knew more? What is happening in our land…? How many murders of persons connected in some way with the assassination principal can go unnoticed by our people? The responses of the alternative media were mixed. I.F. Stone’s Weekly strongly supported the official findings. The Nation essentially supported the conclusions of the Warren Report while raising some concerns.

The responses of the alternative media were mixed. I.F. Stone’s Weekly strongly supported the official findings. The Nation essentially supported the conclusions of the Warren Report while raising some concerns. Ramparts, a new left-liberal monthly remained cautiously quiet. The Legal Intelligencer and some alternative media outlets, A Minority of One, the New Republic, The New Leader, Liberation, National Guardian, Saga, and the Village Voice, along with the Midlothian Mirror were critical but faint voices. Independent investigators increasingly posed contradictions and omissions in the Warren Report and prodded media coverage. In Europe the press was much more skeptical of the official findings, and the assassination was widely controversial. A critical book, Who Killed Kennedy? by American expatriate Thomas Buchanan, was already a best seller, and critical books by Leo Sauvage and Joachim Joesten were available. The Sunday Times of London ran a piece by the respected British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, accusing the Warren Commission of setting up a smokescreen which failed to ask basic questions. itizen researchers persevered, sacrificing time not normally available to most media outlets, pouring over the 26 volumes of hearings and evidence. Early books and articles critical of the Warren Report, particularly Rush to Judgment by Mark Lane, and a front page piece in the Washington Post, prompted responses from the mainstream and alternative media, as well as from the FBI and CIA. Steadily the marginalized citizen critics, like a modern Committee of Correspondence, contributed to moving many reluctant mainstream media sources to call for a reinvestigation. The first actual meeting of the critics of the Warren Report, “Warrenologists” as Sylvia Meagher called them, was October 3, 1965, at Meagher’s apartment in New York. The group included Maggie Field, Leo Sauvage, Sylvia Meagher, Isabel Davis, Edward Epstein, Joe Lobenthal, and Tom Stamm, Vince Salandria and his wife and Bill Crehan. The group wondered how Epstein had gained access to many Commission attorneys and Warren Commission members. The meeting proved useful but contentious, so letters and phone calls continued to connect the critics. The Minority of One published March 1966, “The Impossible Tasks of One Assassination Bullet,” based on an article that Vincent Salandria had read in draft form at the meeting at researcher Sylvia Meagher’s home. A companion piece, “A Separate Connally Shot” by Salandria, explored the FBI Report (exhibit 23).1 Immediately after President Kennedy and Governor Connally were admitted to Parkland Memorial Hospital, a bullet was found on one of the stretchers. Medical examination of the President’s body revealed that one of the bullets had entered just below his shoulder to the right of the spinal column at an angle of 45 to 60 degrees downward, that there was no point of exit, and that the bullet was not in the body. An examination of this bullet by the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:126:9ff89f5badd6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 420, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 127, "text": "23).1 Immediately after President Kennedy and Governor Connally were admitted to Parkland Memorial Hospital, a bullet was found on one of the stretchers. Medical examination of the President’s body revealed that one of the bullets had entered just below his shoulder to the right of the spinal column at an angle of 45 to 60 degrees downward, that there was no point of exit, and that the bullet was not in the body. An examination of this bullet by the FBI Laboratory determined that it had been fired from the rifle owned by Oswald. The Warren Report criticisms resurfaced nationally when on May 29, 1966, the Washington Post ran an eight-column banner headline on the front page, “An Inquest: Skeptical Postscript to Warren Group’s Report on Assassination.” Lengthy discussions of Harold Weisberg’s book Whitewash and Edward Epstein’s Inquest warned that these authors raised “grave doubts about the Commission’s work.” Epstein noted the inconsistent documentary and evidentiary placement regarding the back wound, as well as the bureaucratic time pressures that handicapped the Commission. He argued that the Warren Commission was more interested in dispelling rumors that in exposing the truth.2 Epstein examined discrepancies regarding the location of the President’s back wound by noting that the holes in the President’s shirt and jacket matched the FBI reports from Sibert and O’Neill, as well as the testimony of three Secret Service agents, by placing the location in the back below the shoulder. The official autopsy report, though, located the wound much higher, at the base of the neck. Weisberg analyzed: Oswald’s marksmanship; Oswald’s location at the time of the assassination; the single bullet theory; witnesses around the grassy knoll; the head snap (Zapruder film); the shooting of Officer Tippit, and the throat wound. When the New York Times reviewed these books (6/5/66) they buried their story on page 42, and focused solely on a defense of the single-bullet theory. Later that month, Mark Lane’s book Rush to Judgment made the bestseller list. The Times of London and the London Observer also called for a new investigation. Investigative reporter Fred Cook tried to get his critique of the Warren Commission published by Ramparts but after first agreeing, they refused. Then The Nation, after deliberating more than a year, ran Cook’s critique in a two-part series on 6/13/66 and 6/20/66. He observed that, “not a single eyewitness to the Commission heard or saw the action in a way that the commission decided it had happened. All, without exception, were convinced that the President and Governor Connally were felled by separate, wounding shots.” These probing pieces, based largely on contradictions in the Warren Report, were atypically prefaced by an editors’ statement which reiterated “…we never doubted the good faith of the Commission or the good faith or high quality of its staff.

But the facts disclosed by the transcript, as they relate to points which trouble Mr. Cook, are not conclusive, and from them reasonable men may reach different or, as in this case, variant conclusions.” Less than two weeks after Rush to Judgment was published, the CIA circulated a detailed memorandum critiquing the book. This memorandum was followed by another memo, which raised objections to Lane’s research regarding Oswald’s trip to Mexico as well as the intelligence links to Oswald and Ruby.3 Fred Graham, a close social friend of Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, reviewed Whitewash and Inquest in the July 3rd New York Times Book Review. The first half of the review largely defended the methods used by the Warren Commission. Graham called Weisberg a “painstaking investigator,” but asserted, “It is difficult to believe that any institution could be that inept, careless, wrong or venal as he implies. Rather, the reader is impressed with the elusiveness of the truth…”4 Graham saw Inquest as “superficial,” since Epstein spent only two days in the National Archives. While he admitted that the single-bullet theory was “porous,” he somehow declared that no other explanation made sense. Conveniently he concluded that “a major scholarly study is not feasible now because the crucial papers in the archives … have not been declassified.” Citizen researchers, led by Jim Lesar, Bud Fensterwald and Harold Weisberg, joined with a range of political activists, a handful of newspaper editors, and Congressman John Moss, to push for the Freedom of Information Act. Bill Moyers, then in the LBJ inner circle, recalls that Johnson “hated the thought of journalists rummaging in government closets … only some last minute calls from some newspaper editors overcame the president’s reluctance.” He signed “the f_ _ _ ing thing” as he called it, on July 4, 1966, and then went out to claim credit for it.”5 Newsweek saw Inquest as “serious and scholarly.” The New Republic asserted that Weisberg and Epstein have independently “ransacked the twenty-six volumes of testimony and exhibits and the FBI reports on which the Warren Report is based.” The New Leader and the Minority of One echoed that sentiment.6 Talk radio stations at times provided an outlet for critics of the Warren Report. A notable exchange regarding the role of the FBI occurred on a radio program in July of 1966 between reporter Fred Cook and Warren Commission Counsel Burt Griffin.

A notable exchange regarding the role of the FBI occurred on a radio program in July of 1966 between reporter Fred Cook and Warren Commission Counsel Burt Griffin. Griffin was asked if he thought that Oswald had been connected with the FBI and he responded by saying that no one was ever going to know. Cook prodded Griffin on this point and Griffin observed, “I am just stating a fact of life … if anyone from an important federal agency was involved, the record would have been so thoroughly covered up that no one would ever find out.” After the program Griffin told Cook, “I admire what you are trying to do, but I have to tell you that you’re not going to get anywhere.”7 The Nation then ran an article defending the Warren Report conclusions written by Jacob Cohen, “The Vital Documents,” on 7/11/66. Cohen contended that Cook, Salandria and Epstein had accused the autopsy doctors of deliberately falsifying their report or that the autopsy report reproduced by the Warren Report was a forgery. However, Cook’s articles clearly do not state that. Cohen called for a release of the autopsy x-rays and photos, while staunchly defending the Warren Report’s conclusions. Cook demanded that The Nation editor Carey McWilliams give him an unedited response or he would no longer write for the magazine – which was granted. Cook then dismantled Cohen’s arguments. Months later, after debating researcher Vincent Salandria, Cohen did not deny that he was working with the CIA.8 Ray Marcus tried unsuccessfully to get Dell and Pocket Books to print The Bastard Bullet (CE 399). The Minority of One offered to publish it if he could cut it by half but Marcus thought those cuts to be too deep. Undaunted, he explored ballistics tests, interviewed coroners about the likelihood of a bullet falling from a wound, and interviewed Darrell Tomlinson, the hospital engineer credited with finding the bullet on a stretcher other than Connally’s stretcher. Tomlinson “told Marcus that the FBI telephoned him about one o’clock in the morning and told him to keep his mouth shut.”9 Dr. Cyril Wecht, the young director of the Institute of Forensic Sciences at Duquesne University School of Law, condemned the medical aspects of the Warren Report at a meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. “By standards found in most competent medical legal investigative facilities the autopsy report would not be deemed to be a complete one.” Reporter Gaeton Fonzi, after collaborating with Vincent Salandria, interviewed Warren Commission attorney Arlen Specter for the Greater Philadelphia Magazine August 1966; Specter argued that Oswald had an easy shot, that it is not possible to tell", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:129:f6d35463c772", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 423, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 130, "text": "University School of Law, condemned the medical aspects of the Warren Report at a meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. “By standards found in most competent medical legal investigative facilities the autopsy report would not be deemed to be a complete one.” Reporter Gaeton Fonzi, after collaborating with Vincent Salandria, interviewed Warren Commission attorney Arlen Specter for the Greater Philadelphia Magazine August 1966; Specter argued that Oswald had an easy shot, that it is not possible to tell when Kennedy was first hit, that Kennedy waving to the crowd accounts for the location of the location of the holes in his jacket, and that the Warren Commission did not view the x-rays due to considerations of taste and respect for the dead president… CBS radio Mike Wallace, at-large correspondent George Herman interviewed Harold Weisberg 7/24/66. Weisberg argued that the Warren Commission “set out to prove Oswald guilty.… It did it by selecting what evidence it wanted to use, by ignoring the evidence it didn’t want to use, by not looking for what it did not want to find, and above all, as with any such inquiry, you have the built in weakness of no representation of the other side.… The only man who saw Oswald go into the building stoutly maintained that Oswald carried nothing.… There is only one explicit conclusion in Whitewash … the job hasn’t been, and must be done – and entirely in public.” Kennedy aide Richard Goodwin stirred Washington with his strongly supportive review of Inquest in the Washington Post, 7/24/66. He called for an independent panel to review the Warren Report, and if necessary, a new investigation. The New York Times noted that this was “the first member of the president’s inner circle to suggest publicly that an official re-examination be made…” Strong support for the Warren Report from the New York Times continued when Fred Graham reviewed Mark Lane’s Rush to Judgment and Leo Sauvage’s The Oswald Affair for the New York Times Book Review 8/28/66. He ignored the forensic evidence in both books and concentrated upon their reliance on eyewitness testimony. Graham argued that the main source of the Warren Commission’s dilemma was that it had to issue a report before the 1964 election. The broad proof against Oswald and the lack of evidence pointing to any other possible assassin gave the Warren Commission no choice “but to smooth over the inconsistencies to the extent possible and brand Oswald the lone assassin.” He avowed, “It is clear that any jury, faced with the material before the Warren Commission and in these books, would easily convict Oswald of murder.” A Harris Poll released in September 1966 showed that less than one third of the American public believed that the Warren Commission had told the whole story.

So despite the extensive governmental and mass media efforts to support the official story, already a clear majority of the public felt that major questions remained unanswered. Amid the growing controversy, the New York Times Magazine ran an astonishing story 9/11/66, “No Conspiracy, But – Two Assassins, Perhaps?” by Henry Farlie. He acknowledged that the Warren Commission “did a hurried and slovenly job.” Then he creatively claimed that there could be more than one assassin but “it still does not justify making the long leap to a conspiracy theory of the assassination … none of this is to deny that there may have been two or more people involved in the assassination… it is possible to regard such people as fanatics or nuts and nothing more.” It was a coincidence theory. Farlie fearfully opined, “To set up another independent body with no promise that it will succeed, would be to agitate public doubt without being certain that it could in the end settle it. Popular fear and hysteria are dangerous weird to excite…” Meanwhile, the UPI handling of the Nix film taken from Dealey Plaza during the assassination took more perplexing twists. Maurice Schonfeld, the managing editor of the UPI news film service, after working with the film for two years, stated that he saw enough shadows on the grassy knoll to be fearful for his own life. Yet when UPI reporter Jack Fox reported on it, he asserted that there might have been a gunman on the knoll – although it could be “a brown cow grazing.”11 UPI was unwilling to pay for additional research, stating that it would be costly and there would be no financial return, since “UPI does not sell exclusive stories and it is impossible to assign a dollar value to a wire service scoop.” Schonfeld then approached Life and spoke with assistant editor Dick Billings. Billings was purportedly unable to interest his superiors at Life who “felt they had already given sufficient space to the Kennedy assassination.” Schonfeld then offered the film to Newsweek photo editor Tim Orr, who said that he didn’t know what to make of the pictures. Orr made it clear that as a UPI client he was entitled to the pictures as a matter of routine. Schonfeld left and curiously “locked the film in a vault to avoid trouble.” As the value of the film steadily grew, CBS came over to view it; however, they too supposedly “did not know how to handle the story.” According", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:131:7f0936d47d33", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 425, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 132, "text": "the film to Newsweek photo editor Tim Orr, who said that he didn’t know what to make of the pictures.

Lane stated that two-thirds of the Dealey Plaza witnesses reported hearing shots from the grassy knoll. He shared taped clips of witnesses from his upcoming documentary Rush to Judgment – the first time most Americans had seen testimony contradicting the Warren Report. Sahl quipped, “It isn’t fun to awaken America now. It is like walking into a party – everyone’s been drunk for 175 years, and you’re getting the tax for the liquor.… But we gotta keep this thing going … America is at stake.” Finally, by the end of September 1966, the New York Times raised concerns regarding the Warren Report. Tom Wicker questioned the Warren Commission procedures, objectivity and diligence. “The damaging fear has been planted, here as well as abroad, that the commission … was more concerned to quiet fears of conspiracy and treachery than it was to establish the unvarnished truth, and thus made the facts fit a convenient thesis.” Wicker endorsed the call for a Congressional review. Penn Jones’s impact increased with his self-published book Forgive My Grief – it led to an interview on CBS Evening News 10/29/66. He declared, “I would rather be the sorriest bootlegger in Midlothian than be in the shoes of Earl Warren in the eyes of history. If this is the democracy that we claim it is, then he flunked his final when his country needed him most.” The Washington Star ran a range of views, while denigrating the critics. On 10/5/66, reporter Richard Wilson called for a “supplementary report” to examine the x-rays and autopsy pictures ostensibly because “conspiracy theory critics” have played on the “natural gullibility of the American public.” A month later, reporter Jeremiah O’Leary reviewed Leo Savage’s The Oswald Affair and dismissed all critiques of the Warren Report as “dreamed theories.” Recall that O’Leary was a “very friendly source” for the FBI and the CIA. Allen Dulles responded to the rising tide of dissent by pressuring his “old and close friend” David Lawrence, the owner of the U.S. News & World Report. 13 The 10/10/66 issue of USNWR created a faithful defense, “Truth about Kennedy Assassination: Questions Raised", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:132:f5d65d7be951", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 426, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 133, "text": "A month later, reporter Jeremiah O’Leary reviewed Leo Savage’s The Oswald Affair and dismissed all critiques of the Warren Report as “dreamed theories.” Recall that O’Leary was a “very friendly source” for the FBI and the CIA.

The x-rays and autopsy photographs were quickly taken by Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and then released to the National Archives. Under a “deed of gift,” they remained under lock and key. Warren Commission counsel Arlen Specter, who headed this phase of the investigation, said, “The Commission decided that it would not press for the photographs, as a matter of deference to the memory of the late President, because the Commission concluded that the photographs and x-rays were not indispensable.” USNWR conducted a ten-page interview with Warren Commission Counsel Arlen Specter, “Overwhelming Evidence Oswald was Assassin.” Specter somehow determined, “There has not been a scintilla of new evidence,” “we did a responsible and thorough job,” and “that reopening the investigation would not disclose any additional evidence based on all that is known at the present time.” By November 1966, the work of citizen researchers Shirley Martin, Harold Weisberg, Mark Lane, Vincent Salandria, Penn Jones, Sylvia Meagher, Leo Sauvage, Penn Jones, Mary Ferrell, Ray Marcus, Maggie Field, Lillian Castelano, Jim Lesar, Bill Turner, Jerry Policoff, Josiah Thompson, and Bud Fensterwald, along with dozens of others, had significantly contributed to calls for a new investigation from a range of mass media outlets: the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, the Louisville Courier-Journal, the Louisville Times, the Cleveland Press, Washington Post, the Denver Post, the Montgomery (Alabama) Advertiser, The Progressive, Esquire, Ramparts, Commentary, The National Review, Perspectives, Chicago American and even Life. In France Paris-Match declared, “No legal expert today would dare to affirm that Oswald would be judged guilty by a court.” The London Times and L’Obsservatore, the Vatican newspaper, also called for a reopening of the case. Time, though, steadfastly maintained that “there seems little valid excuse” for a new probe. On the third anniversary of the assassination the Washington Post ran an AP story, which reviewed dissent by John Connally regarding the shots and bullets. “There is absolute knowledge … that one bullet caused the President’s first wound and that an entirely separate shot struck me. It is a certainty.” It noted Senator", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:133:5f4b2dd194dd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 427, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 134, "text": "and L’Obsservatore, the Vatican newspaper, also called for a reopening of the case.

It is a certainty.” It noted Senator Russell’s objections to the single-bullet theory, Oswald’s past regarding Russia and Cuba, as well as witness S.M. Holland’s eyewitness statements regarding shots coming from the grassy knoll. The Associated Press, however, did not call for a new investigation. Notably, none of the contradictions and uncertainties in the case, even those mentioned in AP stories, were printed in the redistribution of the AP book The Torch is Passed in 1967. The afternoon Merv Griffin Show invited Penn Jones on 11/14/66, and Mark Lane 11/23/66. Lane sparred with pundit David Susskind who accused him of “alarming the American public” – Lane retorted that “the American should be alarmed, and that evidence, not faith in distinguished Americans, was needed.” The November 25, 1966, issue of Life reassessed the assassination in a series of articles entitled “A Matter of Doubt,” which narrowly focused on the single-bullet theory. The composition of the research team raised questions about the seriousness of the investigation. Hugh Aynesworth, an FBI informant and a CIA applicant, teamed with Dick Billings, the Life editor who worked with the CIA on the failed 1963 Bayo-Pawley mission, Life stringer David Chandler, a major opponent of Jim Garrison’s investigation, and Holland McCombs, a close friend of Clay Shaw.14 Aynesworth’s unpublished report to Newsweek, 2/22/67, reveals that he as well as Life were on to some of the same leads as New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison. Billings made at least two trips to New Orleans to confer with Chandler, some Cubans, and in particular, David Ferrie, the pilot and right-wing mercenary who worked with Oswald and New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw and had FBI, CIA, and mafia connections. Life did not mention the widening critique of the roles of the FBI, CIA, the Secret Service, or the new witnesses who had been interviewed by Mark Lane. Lane’s book was derided as “a grab-bag of virtually all of the conceivable theories that offer an alternative to the Commission. The book is wildly speculative … peripheral and indiscriminate.” Although Life called for a new investigation, it printed only 31 frames of the Zapruder film in the story, and again did not print any frames of President Kennedy being hit in the head. By 1965 the Zapruder film was available in the National Archives but the mass media never seemed to mention this to the public.

By 1965 the Zapruder film was available in the National Archives but the mass media never seemed to mention this to the public. Author Josiah Thompson asserted that the Life article was originally more extensive, but 17 editors significantly limited it. Thompson attributed organizational caution as blunting the probe. Nonetheless, Life shed further doubt on the “single-bullet theory,” and opined that “a new investigative body should be set up, perhaps at the initiative of Congress.” But Life published no other story from this team of reporters. Life’s business partner Time, however, editorialized against the “phantasmagoria” of Warren Commission critics and argued: “…there seems little valid excuse for so dramatic a development as another full scale inquiry.” When asked about the opposing editorial positions, Hedley Donovan, editor-in-chief of both magazines arrived at consistent positions on major issues, “and I am sure in due course we will on this one.” Life reporter Richard Billings stated that a superior told him “it is not Life’s function to investigate the Kennedy assassination.” Billings investigation was ended. Hugh Aynesworth informed the FBI of a research strategy he was using in connection with the Life story, 12/13/66. He passed along information on a Dealey Plaza witness, George Davis, who had not been interviewed, and who thought that the smoke, which came from a point on the overpass, probably came from the motorcycle of Dallas Police Officer Harkness. Aynesworth also mentioned that he had information on critic Mark Lane’s sex life.15 Harrison Salisbury, an editor at the New York Times, reversed his early support for the Warren Report in his article in The Progressive, a small alternative monthly. His readings of Rush to Judgment and Inquest convinced him that major questions remained unresolved. Salisbury now supported Congressman Theodore Kupperman’s resolution for a congressional review. Within this changing political climate, the New York Times seemingly started an investigation of its own in November 1966, under the direction of Harrison Salisbury. This investigation, however, was somehow derailed almost as quickly as it began. It was “temporarily suspended” in December and was never completed. Salisbury received permission to visit Hanoi in December. Another member of that research team, Martin Waldron, noted that he and others came up with “a lot of unanswered questions that the Times didn’t bother to pursue … I’d be on a good lead and then somebody would send me off to California on another story or something. We never really detached anyone for this. We weren’t really serious.”16 There was no real connection between Salisbury going to Hanoi and the decision not to publish, or to continue the inquiry …", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:135:3226d73b19eb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 429, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 136, "text": "of that research team, Martin Waldron, noted that he and others came up with “a lot of unanswered questions that the Times didn’t bother to pursue … I’d be on a good lead and then somebody would send me off to California on another story or something.

We weren’t really serious.”16 There was no real connection between Salisbury going to Hanoi and the decision not to publish, or to continue the inquiry … the basic conclusion was that we couldn’t find that there was supporting evidence to the contentions of the critics … we found no evidence that the Warren Report was not right.… We are not in the business of printing opinion… 17 As Salisbury told it to researcher Bernard Fensterwald “there wasn’t even an overt decision to drop it. He just had other things to do.” Reluctantly the New York Times editorial, 11/22/66, observed, “Further dignified silence, or merely more denials by the commission or its staff, is no longer enough.” Amid a political milieu of distrust regarding the Warren Report in Europe and at home, the revered columnist Walter Lippmann cautiously advocated a new investigation, which would circumvent the Constitution. Though “a certain amount of reasonable doubt exists” that it might be desirable to “open the case unofficially.” He suggested “a reputable agency, politically and financially independent” which could “examine new interpretations of the old evidence and any new evidence that might be brought forward in the future.” Newsweek, 11/7/66, remained stoutly resistant to covering the new contradictions raised by citizen researchers. They were mocked as “a cult … a subculture of assassination buffs who obsessively probe the massive record.… And they have created a growing market: a recent Louis Harris poll showed that three-fifths of the American public doubts the assassination was the work of one man, nearly double the level of two years ago.” The rapidly growing alternative monthly magazine, Ramparts, in a much delayed assassination issue, explored the untimely deaths of numerous witnesses to the assassinations of President Kennedy and officer Tippit. “In the Shadow of Dallas” by (Ret.) Brig. General Penn Jones prophetically predicted “that more killings are to be necessary to keep this crime quiet.” Ramparts started five years earlier as a critical quarterly with a highbrow Catholic identity, and was transformed under the leadership of muckraker Warren Hinkle. By its peak a few years later, circulation would rise to 250,000, and it would soon be confronted by American intelligence agencies. Time, 11/11/66, quickly responded by attempting to rebut some of the issues raised by Penn Jones and Ramparts. Jones was labeled a “mythmaker,” “engaged in a macabre and mischievous exercise.” Time neglected to respond to a number of areas: Tom Howard (Ruby’s lawyer); incessant police harassment of Mrs. Earlene Roberts, Oswald’s rooming house manager; witness Julia Ann Mercer; Carroll Jarnagin, witness to Ruby-Oswald meeting;", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:136:6136313e8135", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 430, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 137, "text": "later, circulation would rise to 250,000, and it would soon be confronted by American intelligence agencies.

No skid marks were found. A doctor riding in the ambulance stated that Bowers was “in a different state of shock than an accident victim experiences. I can’t explain it. I’ve never seen anything like it.” There was no autopsy. Newsweek, 12/5/66, dismissed the Life questions regarding the single bullet theory as “a good deal of fuss.” They creatively claimed that, “As the pictures (of the Zapruder film) suggest … Connally was hit earlier than he thought” – thus he was hit by the same bullet that wounded the president. They questioned the location of Connally’s wrist when it was hit, but made no call for a new investigation to resolve the differences. Newsweek then argued that the notes on the autopsy drawing clarified the discrepancy regarding the location of Kennedy’s back wound. They failed to mention that the bullet hole in President Kennedy’s coat and shirt, as well as the signed death certificate, all indicate a wound 53/4^(′′) below the neck, which does not match the autopsy drawing. They deferred to J. Edgar Hoover who proclaimed that there is “not one shred of evidence” of a conspiracy, before he admitted that there were “no final certainties.” U.S. News & World Report, 12/5/66, conceded some limited contention on specifics of the Warren Report, while strongly reinforcing its conclusions. They noted Governor John Connally’s “disagreement with the Commission on one point – its conclusion that he was hit by a bullet that had passed through the President’s body,” while declaring that “a new investigation would be neither warranted, justified, nor desirable.” They called critics of the Commission “journalistic scavengers.” Esquire, December 1966, printed one of the most insightful pieces during that era, written by citizen-researcher Sylvia Meagher.

She examined the contradictions and gaps regarding Oswald’s arrest and interrogation, the autopsy, the stretcher bullet, and culpable law enforcement procedures. She also explored the allegation that Oswald fired at the home of outspoken right-wing General Edwin Walker. Meagher then proposed fourteen new evidentiary tests for the case, and then developed these proposals in her book Accessories After the Fact, which was published in 1967. Esquire also printed Edward Epstein’s article, “Who’s Afraid of the Warren Report – A Primer of Assassination Theories” which prompted UPI to further analyze the Nix film. UPI managing editor Schonfeld chose to try a firm “which (he) had never heard of, Itek.” Schonfeld regretted that he did not know that former OSS and CIA officer Frank Lindsey, and a close collaborator with Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner in the 1940s and 1950s, headed Itek. Nor did he know that Time Inc. owned 5% of Itek stock, or that 60% of Itek’s business came from the government, mostly for intelligence purposes. Nor did he realize then his contact man at Itek, Howard Sprague, was a former CIA employee. Perhaps it is not a coincidence that Itek found nothing significant on the film, and Time and UPI and many newspapers reported it as such in May of 1967.18 Penn Jones, of the Midlothian Mirror, published Forgive my Grief, which developed his analysis of disappearing witnesses in the case. “Kilgallen said that she was going to New Orleans and break the case wide open, also strangely Miss Kilgallen’s close friend Mr. Earl Smith died two days after Miss Kilgallen. Mr. Smith’s autopsy read that the cause of death was unknown.” The CIA responded to the widening disbelief with a memo “Countering Criticism of the Warren Report” On 1/4/67 they distributed the memo to their media assets at the New York Times, CBS, NBC, ABC, Washington Post etc., suggesting arguments to discredit Warren Report critics. “Conspiracy theorists have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example, by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us.… This affects … the whole reputation of the American government.… Note that Robert Kennedy, attorney general at the time … would be the last man to overlook or conceal any conspiracy.” Robert Kennedy, though, repeatedly told his friends and aides that he needed the power of the presidency to realistically re-investigate the assassination.

Hewitt noted “he dismissed the question with almost studied indifference.… What difference does it make? It won’t bring him back.” Hewitt was deeply suspicious of RFK’s response as well as of the Warren Report.20 Public and media pressure to pursue a comprehensive investigation pushed the CIA to delegitimize new critical books. This CIA memo, 1/4/67 , alleged that many of the critics were anti-American, far left, or Communist sympathizers, some of whom were in search of financial reward, some in love with their theories, and some “raise as many questions as possible while not bothering to work out the consequences.” This document along with two others was released through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1976. 1. (Except where otherwise indicated, the factual data given in paragraphs 1-9 is unclassified.) Some of the authors of recent books on the assassination of President Kennedy (e.g., Joachim Joesten, Oswald: Assassin or Fall Guy; Mark Lane, Rush to Judgment [sic]; Leo Sauvage, The Oswald Affair: An Examination of the Contradictions and Omissions of the Warren Report) had publicly asserted that a conspiracy existed before the Warren Commission finished its investigation. Not surprisingly, they immediately bestirred themselves to show that they were right and that the Commission was wrong. Thanks to the mountain of material published by the Commission, some of it conflicting or misleading when read out of context, they have had little difficulty in uncovering items to substantiate their own theories. They have also in some cases obtained new and divergent testimony from witnesses. And they have usually failed to discuss the refutations of their early claims in the Commission’s Report, Appendix xii (“Speculations and Rumors”). This Appendix is still a good place to look for material countering the theorists. 2. Some writers appear to have been predisposed to criticism by anti-American, far left, or Communist sympathies. The British “Who Killed Kennedy Committee” includes some of the most persistent and vocal English critics of the United States, e.g.’ Michael Foot, Kingsley Martin, Kenneth Tynan, and Bertrand Russell. Joachim Joesten has been publicly revealed as a onetime member of the German Communist Party (KPD); a Gestapo document of 8 November 1937 among the German Foreign Ministry files microfilmed in England and Now returned to West German custody shows that his party book was numbered 532315 and dated 12", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:139:f8b9144d0cf5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 433, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 140, "text": "The British “Who Killed Kennedy Committee” includes some of the most persistent and vocal English critics of the United States, e.g.’ Michael Foot, Kingsley Martin, Kenneth Tynan, and Bertrand Russell.

(The originals of these files are now available at the West German Foreign Ministry in Bonn; the copy in the U.S. National Archives may be found under the reference T-120, Serial 4918, frames E256482-4. The British Public Records Office should also have a copy.) Joesten’s American publisher, Carl Marzani, was once sentenced to jail by a federal jury for concealing his Communist Party (CPUSA) membership in order to hold a government job. Available information indicates that Mark Lane was elected Vice Chairman of the New York Council to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee on 28 May 1963, he also attended the 8^(th) Congress of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers (an international Communist front organization, in Budapest from 31 March to 5 April 1964, where he expounded his (pre-Report) views on the Kennedy assassination. In his acknowledgements in his book, Lane expresses special thanks to Ralph Schoenman of London “who participated in and supported the work”; Schoenman is of course the expatriate American who has been influencing the aged Bertrand Russell in recent years. (See also paragraph 10 below on Communist efforts to replay speculation on the assassination.) 3. A factor has been the financial reward obtainable for sensational books. Mark Lane’s Rush to Judgment, published on 13 publishers had printed 140,000 copies by that date, in anticipation of sales to come. The 1 January 1967 New York Times Book Review reported that book as at the top of the General category of the best seller list, having been in top position for seven weeks and on the list for 17 weeks. Lane has reportedly appeared on about 175 television and radio programs, and has also given numerous public lectures, all of which serves for advertisement. He has also put together a TV film, and is peddling it to European telecasters; the BBC has purchased rights for a record $45, 000 . While neither Abraham Zapruder nor William Manchester should be classed with the critics of the Commission we are discussing here, sums paid for the Zapruder film of the assassination ($25,000) and for magazine rights to Manchester’s Death of a President ($665,000) indicate the money available for material related to the assassination. Some newspapermen (e.g. Sylvan Fox, The Unanswered Questions about President Kennedy’s Assassination; Leo Sauvage, The Oswald Affair) have published accounts cashing in on their journalistic expertise. 4.

Some newspapermen (e.g. Sylvan Fox, The Unanswered Questions about President Kennedy’s Assassination; Leo Sauvage, The Oswald Affair) have published accounts cashing in on their journalistic expertise. 4. Aside from political and financial motives, some people have apparently published accounts simply because they were burning to give the world their theory, e.g., Harold Weisberg, in his Whitewash; Penn Jones, Jr., in Forgive My Grief, and George C. Thomson in The Quest for Truth. Weisberg’s book was first published privately, though it is now finally attaining the dignity of commercial publication. Jones’ volume was published by the small-town Texas newspaper of which he is the editor and Thomson’s booklet by his own engineering firm. The impact of these books will probably be relatively slight, since their writers will appear to readers to be hysterical or paranoid. 5. A common technique among many of the writers is to raise as many questions as possible, while not bothering to work out all the consequences, Herbert Mitgang has written a parody of this approach (his questions actually refer to Lincoln’s assassination) in “A New Inquiry is Needed,” New York Times Magazine, 25 December 1966. Mark Lane in particular (who represents himself as Oswald’s lawyer) adopts the classic defense attorney’s approach of throwing in unrelated details so as to create in the jury’s mind a sum of “reasonable doubt.” His tendency to wander off into minor details led one observer to comment that whereas a good trial lawyer should have a sure instinct for the jugular vein; Lane’s instinct was for the capillaries. His tactics and also his nerve were typified on the occasion when, after getting the Commission to pay his travel expenses back from England, he recounted to that body a sensational (and incredible) story of a Ruby plot, while refusing to name his source. Chief Justice Warren told Lane, “We have every reason to doubt the truthfulness of what you have heretofore told us” – by the standards of legal etiquette, a very stiff rebuke for an attorney. 6. It should be recognized however, that another kind of criticism has recently emerged, represented by Edward Jay Epstein’s Inquest. Epstein adopts a scholarly tone, and to the casual reader, he presents what appears to be a more coherent, reasoned case than the writers described above. Epstein has caused people like Richard Rovere and Lord Devlin, previously backers of the Commission’s report, to change their minds. The New York Times’ daily book reviewer has said that Epstein’s work is a “watershed book” which has made it respectable to doubt the Commission’s finding. This respectability effect has been enhanced by", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:141:24cd7d855f18", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 435, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 142, "text": "Inquest.

The New York Times’ daily book reviewer has said that Epstein’s work is a “watershed book” which has made it respectable to doubt the Commission’s finding. This respectability effect has been enhanced by Life magazine’s 25No - vember issue, which contains an assertion that there is a “reasonable doubt,” as well as a republication of frames from the Zapruder film (owned by Life), and an interview with Governor Connally, who repeats his belief that he was not struck by the same bullet that struck President Kennedy. (Connally does not, however, agree that there should be another investigation.) Epstein himself has published a new article in the December 1966 issue of Esquire, in which he explains away objections to his book. A copy of an early critique of Epstein’s views by Fletcher Knebel, published in Look, 12 July 1966, and an unclassified, unofficial analysis (by “Spectator”) are attached to this dispatch, dealing with specific questions raised by Epstein’s. 7. Here it should be pointed out that Epstein’s competence in research has been greatly exaggerated. Some illustrations are given in the Fletcher Knebel article. As a further specimen, Epstein’s book refers (pp., 93-5) to a cropped-down picture of a heavy-set man taken in Mexico City, saying that the Central Intelligence Agency gave it to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on 18 November 1963, and that the Bureau in turn forwarded it to its Dallas office. Actually, affidavits 1 the published Warren material (vol, Xl, pp. 468-70) show that CIA turned the picture over to the FBI on 22 November, the fact is that the FBI flew the photo directly from Mexico City to Dallas immediately after Oswald’s arrest, before Oswald’s picture had been published, on the chance it might be Oswald. The reason the photo was cropped was that the background revealed the place where it was taken.) Another example where Epstein reports (p. 41) that a Secret Service interview report was even withheld from the National Archives, this is untrue; an Archives staff member told one of our officers that Epstein came there and asked for the memorandum. He was told that it was there, but was classified. Indeed, the Archives then notified the Secret Service that there had been a request for the document, and the Secret Service declassified it. But by that time, Epstein (whose preface gives the impression of prolonged archival research) had chosen to finish his searches in the Archives, which had only lasted two days, and had left town. Yet Epstein charges that the Commission was over-hasty in its work. 8. Aside from such failures in research, Epstein and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:142:6ef2a35feb6f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 436, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 143, "text": "there, but was classified.

Yet Epstein charges that the Commission was over-hasty in its work. 8. Aside from such failures in research, Epstein and other intellectual critics show symptoms of some of the love of theorizing and lack of common sense and experience displayed by Richard H. Popkin, the author of The Second Oswald. Because Oswald was reported to have been seen in different places at the same time, a phenomenon not surprising in a sensational case where thousands of real or alleged witnesses were interviewed, Popkin, a professor of philosophy, theorizes that there actually were two Oswald’s. At this point, theorizing becomes sort of logico-mathematical game; an exercise in permutations and combinations; as Commission attorney Arlen Specter remarked; “Why not make it three Oswald’s? Why stop at two? “Nevertheless, aside from his book, Popkin has been able to publish a summary of his views in the New York Review of Books, and there has been replay in the French Nouvel Observateur, in Moscow’s New Times, and in Baku’s Vyshka. Poplin makes a sensational accusation indirectly, saying the “Western European critics” see Kennedy’s assassination as part of a subtle conspiracy attributable to “perhaps even (in rumors I have heard) Kennedy’s successor.” One Barbara Garson has made the same point in another way by her parody of; Shakespeare’s Macbeth entitled MacBird!, with what is obviously President Johnson (Mac Bird) in the role of Macbeth. Miss Garson makes no effort to prove her point; she merely insinuates it. Probable the indirect form of accusation is due to fear of a libel suit. 9. Other books are yet to appear. William Manchester’s not-yetpublished. The Death of a President is at this writing being purged of material personally objectionable to Mrs. Kennedy. There are hopeful signs: Jacob Cohen is writing a book which will appear in 1967 under the title Honest Verdict, defending Wesley J. Libeler, is also reportedly writing a book, setting forth both sides. But further criticism will no doubt appear; as the Washington Post has pointed out editorially, the recent death of Jack Ruby will probably lead to speculation that he was “silenced” by a conspiracy. 10. The likelihood of further criticism is enhanced by the circumstance that Communist propagandists seem recently to have stepped up their own campaign to discredit the Warren Commission. As already noted, Moscow’s New Times reprinted parts of an article by Richard Popkin (21 and 28 September 1966 issues), and it also gave the Swiss edition of Joesten’s latest work an extended, laudatory review in its number for 26 October.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:143:57dae6806b89", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 437, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 144, "text": "probably lead to speculation that he was “silenced” by a conspiracy. 10.

(In view of this publicity and the Communist background of Joesten and his American publisher, together with Joesten’s insistence on pinning the blame on such favorite communist targets as H.L. Hunt, the FBI and CIA, there seems reasons to suspect that Joesten’s book and it exploitation are part of a planned Soviet propaganda operation.) Tass, reporting on 5 November on the deposit of autopsy photographs in the National Archives, said that the refusal to give wide public access to them, the disappearance of a number of documents, and the mysterious death of more than 10 people, all make many Americans believe Kennedy was killed as the result of a conspiracy. The radio transmitters of Prague and Warsaw used the anniversary of the assassination to attack the Warren report. The Bulgarian press conducted a campaign on the subject in the second half of October; a Greek Communist newspaper, Avgi, placed the blame on CIA on 20 November. Significantly, the start of this stepped-up campaign coincided with a Soviet demand that the U.S. Embassies in Moscow stop distributing the Russian-language edition of the Warren report. Newsweek commented (12 September) that the Soviets apparently “did not want mere facts to get in their way.” In providing facts for Mr. Whalen to use in an article to appear in The Saturday Evening Post in the near future, aimed at silencing critics of the Warren Commission Report.… Whalen states that this [cooperation] is absolutely necessary since he believed he and the Bureau shared a rising apprehension at the new-won respectability and acceptance of the various conspiracy mongers. 21 At the outset of the piece Whalen declared, “Had he (Oswald) been prosecuted for murdering an ordinary citizen the evidence arrayed against him would almost certainly have brought a verdict of guilty.” After summarizing the major critics, Whalen claimed, “The critics raise a great many trivial questions and some troublesome ones, particularly regarding the Kennedy head snaps, the Tague hit and the possibility of misinterpreted photographic evidence. However, they are almost barren of plausible answers when asked what they think happened in Dealey Plaza.” He printed Commander J. Thornton Boswell’s autopsy room chart, in which a bullet hole is shown about six inches down from the president’s neck. Yet the discrepancy from this and the neck wound noted in the Warren Report was attributed merely to Boswell’s carelessness. “Recently he [Boswell] said if he had known his", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:144:b43051cb3edb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 438, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 145, "text": "the Tague hit and the possibility of misinterpreted photographic evidence.

Yet the discrepancy from this and the neck wound noted in the Warren Report was attributed merely to Boswell’s carelessness. “Recently he [Boswell] said if he had known his sketch would be made public, he would have been more careful.” Whalen neglected to mention existing contradictory evidence of the signed death certificate, and the location of the holes in the president’s shirt and coat which indicate a wound about six inches down from the base of the neck – all of which were consistent with Boswell’s chart. Whalen conceded, “there is still room for some doubt about the essential findings.” He questioned Oswald’s marksmanship, CE 399 (the bullet which supposedly went through Kennedy and Connally), the lack of autopsy pictures and X-rays, which were not examined by the Warren Commission and the inconsistencies regarding the wound in the president’s back. He claimed that “the critics who allege a cover-up of the ‘true facts’ by the Warren Commission can as easily argue their case on the basis of the appearance of concealment as they can on the grounds of actual conspiracy.” He concluded that the “evidence against Oswald remains as ‘hard’ as it was when Ruby’s bullet killed him.” Nonetheless, he advocated a pursuit of the “soft” evidence by a Congressional Committee or a “citizen’s panel with unlimited access to the records.” The Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Joe McGinnis, 1/6/67 , interviewed Vincent Salandria for “The Fine Edge of Believability.” Salandria overviewed the critical perspective and then speculated on who was responsible. He noted the condition of CE 399, the Zapruder film showing the president pushed backward and to the left, that there were “at least three or four assassins … and Oswald was not one of them. He was standing on the front steps of the Depository when the shooting took place. The CIA set him up to be a patsy.” Salandria viewed the CIA and the military leaders as fearful that Kennedy would end the Cold War, and that they would lose their power. Johnson would not make those changes and Johnson would go along with the assassination “They will get Bobby killed.… They’ll turn us into a closed totalitarian society.” McGinnis thought that Salandria had been working too hard, and that “the sad part was that Vincent Salandria really believed in everything he said.” It is important that legitimate questions are asked that are answerable but are unanswered in the report, then even for those who may find the answers implicit, or who reach them for themselves by an imaginative leap or by an act of faith, a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:145:024dfdea26ad", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 439, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 146, "text": "will get Bobby killed.… They’ll turn us into a closed totalitarian society.” McGinnis thought that Salandria had been working too hard, and that “the sad part was that Vincent Salandria really believed in everything he said.” It is important that legitimate questions are asked that are answerable but are unanswered in the report, then even for those who may find the answers implicit, or who reach them for themselves by an imaginative leap or by an act of faith, a fresh investigation is not merely desirable; it is as imperative as the first one was. The next task of a new commission would be.… To exclude the possibility of a second assassin. The Warren Commission never really tested theories of how the assassination might have been accomplished other than its own hypothesis concerning the timing of the shots, and the initial wounding of both President Kennedy and Connally with a single bullet. 22 Ramparts, January 1967, weighed in with a detailed critique of the Warren Report, “The Case for Three Assassins” by citizen investigators David S. Lifton and David Welsh. They explored contradictions in the New York Times coverage as well as the major conclusions of the Report primarily through testimony from the 26 volumes of Hearings and Exhibits in the Warren Report itself. The areas included: 1) How Could the President Have Been Shot in the Front from the Back; 2) The Parkland Doctor’s Testimony; 3) The 64 Witnesses Indicating Firing from the Grassy Knoll area – Witnesses from the Overpass, Standing on the Knoll, Standing in Dealey Plaza; In or Immediately Outside the Depository; Members of the Dallas County Sheriff ’s Department, Secret Service Agents, Dallas Police Officers, Witnesses in the Motorcade as well as Other Witnesses.23 BBC seemed more open to debate the assassination controversy than the American networks but this proved illusory. On January 29, 1967, BBC ran a five-hour program starting with the premiere airing of the documentary Rush to Judgment by Emile de Antonio and Mark Lane. This was to be followed by a discussion including three supporters of the Warren Report, Professor Bickel, Warren Commission counsel Arlen Specter, who had not debated Lane in the U.S.; and Britain’s Lord Devlin, confronting Mark Lane. They were to dress in black robes and were to act as judges, while journalist Kenneth Harris was to moderate. Lane argued for a more balanced discussion but to no avail. An inaccurate model of Dealey Plaza bolstered their defense of the Warren Commission. Major areas of the investigation had been rehearsed without Lane’s knowledge. Harris once even apologized off camera to Specter for asking a question regarding the location of shots, which they had not rehearsed. Twice Lane’s efforts to contend with Warren Commission counsels David Belin and Specter were cut off by the moderator.

Twice Lane’s efforts to contend with Warren Commission counsels David Belin and Specter were cut off by the moderator. Lane then shifted to commenting on the single-bullet theory when Specter walked over to Harris and loudly declared, on camera, that Lane should not be allowed to trifle with his theory. Harris yielded again. The program curiously closed with Lord Devlin’s sophistry: “we let President Kennedy’s soul rest in peace, and if there were another assassin, no one had proved he was a subversive, and if he wasn’t subversive what difference did it make?”24 My loyalty was loyalty to one’s country, not to its institutions or its officeholders. The country is the real thing, the eternal thing … to be loyal to; institutions are extraneous, mere clothing, and clothing can wear out, become ragged … cease to protect the body from winter disease and death. To be loyal to rags, to shout for rags, to worship rags to die for rags – that are loyalty of unreason … it belongs to monarch; let monarchy keep it … I was from Connecticut, whose constitution declares, “that all power is inherent in the people.… The citizen who thinks he sees that the commonwealth political clothes are worn out and yet held his peace and does not agitate for a new suit; is disloyal; he is a traitor. That he may be the only one who thinks he sees this decay, does not excuse him; it’s his duty to agitate anyway. 25 The virtue and vigilance of citizen investigators revealed major contradictions in the Warren Report and catalyzed coverage by elements of the alternative and mass media. While the alternative press was slowly growing in strength, limited resources and modest circulations constrained their impact. The Nation ran articles critiquing as well as supporting the Warren Report. The New Republic was somewhat more critical and called for a new investigation. The Minority of One and the Midlothian Mirror steadfastly continued their critiques. Ramparts regularly ran critical reporting, and rapidly increased their circulation. The CIA responded with dirty tricks to hurt their circulation and financing. A few elements of the mass media periodically probed the case, notably some radio stations along with the Washington Post and Esquire, while most of the mainstream media, including the television networks and news services, skepticly reviewed the contributions of the citizen-critics. Nonetheless, in spite of the propaganda of the CIA and FBI, by early 1967, many in the mainstream media called for some form of reopening the case.

During a Cold War period of urban riots and a floundering and increasingly unpopular war in Vietnam, government-corporate-media elites probably viewed a limited reinvestigation as a tactic to strengthen systemic legitimacy. But the possibility of an independent, aggressive, maverick, district attorney revealing the seamy sides of American power generated a widespread establishment backlash. By early 1967, when New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison’s investigation began, the mass media rushed to cover it. The Washington Post, 3/1/67 , ran a political cartoon of Garrison as a strip-tease artist covering himself with fans labeled “D.A. Publicity Stunts,” which foreshadowed the daunting challenge. The CIA and FBI efforts to mislead the public would unleash a stunning new phase of psychological warfare. he bold and flamboyant New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison unraveled many aspects of the assassination, although his un-T orthodox style contributed to a problematic relationship with most of the media. He challenged the government and the media were challenged to revisit our national nightmare at a time when the Vietnam War protests were expanding and race riots had scarred several cities. Federal non-cooperation with the Garrison’s investigation was bolstered by a wide gamut of tactics including: FBI wiretapping and infiltrating Garrison’s investigation; mass media covers for spying, FBI and CIA-linked reporters weakening Garrison’s credibility, biased network specials on NBC and CBS; slanted wire service reporting and book publications; and even a biased interview on a famous evening TV talk show. Detailed CIA memos, designed to counter Warren Commission critics, clouded key issues. The closer Garrison got to the truth, the more vicious the psychological war became. In this David vs. Goliath drama Garrison was passionately dedicated, insightful and witty but also, at times self-righteous and sarcastic. In a critical, convoluted case, with controversy at every turn, misperceptions of style and substance, as well as misstatements, provided fodder for those committed to the Warren Report. Media attacks put Garrison on the defensive on complex issues, not amenable to sound bites. Unaccustomed to the media glare, Garrison needed a P.R. team as well as a few dozen more investigators. He also needed cooperation from the CIA, FBI, Secret Service, IRS and the DOD – but this was not the time for governmental atonement. In November 1966, Garrison mentioned his assassination conspiracy case with reporter David Chandler.

In November 1966, Garrison mentioned his assassination conspiracy case with reporter David Chandler. Chandler told Richard Billings of Life (and “Operation Tilt”) who met with Garrison in January of 1967. According to Garrison, Billings said that the top management at Life thought that he was “moving in the right direction” and he offered to work closely with Garrison. Billings also suggested that “the magazine would be able to provide … technical assistance, and … a mutual exchange of information.”1 This seems to have been merely a ruse. On January 23rd, 1967 the New Orleans States-Item ran a brief report by Jack Dempsey stating, “At least five persons have been questioned by the District Attorney’s office in connection with another investigation into events linked to the Kennedy assassination.” Garrison was furious and threatened to take Dempsey before the grand jury to determine his sources. Dempsey was replaced, and the story was given to Rosemary James.2 Garrison’s investigation quietly made considerable progress through early 1967, but on February 17, a New Orleans States-Item story by Rosemary James decried the expenses for a probe of an assassination plot as scandalous. This unexpected early attention hampered the investigation and enabled disinformation and biased coverage to significantly delegitimize the case. Hundreds of reporters then stormed into New Orleans to focus on this shoestring investigation. Less than a week later two key suspects in the case died mysterious deaths. David Ferrie supposedly committed suicide and Eladio Del Valle was shot at point-blank range. Just two weeks earlier Garrison had interviewed Carlos Bringuier, an active anti-communist and CIA contact, who had interacted with Oswald. Bringuier was also a member of both INCA, (Information Council of the Americas) an elite right-wing New Orleans organization, and DRE, the CIA-backed Cuban Student Directorate. After that interview, Bringuier immediately requested an interview with Hunter Leake of the New Orleans CIA office. In a CIA memo from the Chief of the New Orleans office Lloyd Ray to the Director of the Domestic Contact Service, Ray noted his belief that the Garrison investigation was credible. The suspicious suicide of key witness David Ferrie, who had ties to Oswald and Clay Shaw as well as the CIA, FBI and Mafia, forced Garrison to move quickly or lose other witnesses. The next day, 3/3/67 , Garrison arrested socialite, international businessman, and CIA asset Clay Shaw, who had been seen with Oswald in both New Orleans and Clinton, Louisiana. Neil Strawser of CBS News asked newly confirmed Attorney General Ramsey Clark if he had information about Shaw. Clark stated that Shaw “was involved in an FBI investigation – in the New Orleans area in November-December 1963.

Clark stated that Shaw “was involved in an FBI investigation – in the New Orleans area in November-December 1963. Shaw was checked out and found clear.” His comments were carried in all the major newspapers. The New York Times $3 / 3 / 6 7 $ , added that “a Justice Department official said tonight that his agency was convinced that Mr. Bertrand (an alias used for social occasions) and Mr. Shaw were the same man, and that this was the basis for Mr. Clark’s assertions.” Cryptically they noted, “Mr. Clark’s statement however caused a certain amount of bewilderment in some quarters.” The determination that Clay Bertrand was Clay Shaw inadvertently strengthened Garrison’s case; however, three months later the Justice Department issued a statement that the FBI did not investigate Clay Shaw, and that Clark’s 3/2/67 statement was in error.3 The New York Times printed no reason for the reversal. The FBI seemingly utilized some of its reporter/assets to gather information for Clay Shaw as well as for spin control during this period. Lawrence Schiller, Jack Ruby’s former “business agent,” authored a vicious, pro-Warren Commission book. Widely syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, reporters Hugh Aynesworth and Charles Roberts from Newsweek, James Phelan from the Saturday Evening Post, and UPI reporter Merriman Smith all worked with the FBI. Some reporters, such as Hugh Aynesworth, also appear to have cooperated with the CIA. In March 1967, Jack Anderson ran two pieces in his “Washington Merry-Go-Round” column, asserting Castro’s role in the assassination (3/3/67 and 3/7/67). Anderson mentioned a “political H-bomb- an unconfirmed report that Senator Robert Kennedy may have approved an assassination plot which then backfired against his brother.” Anderson then briefed the FBI about his lengthy interview with Jim Garrison.4 The unsuspecting Garrison invited Anderson into his home for a six-hour interview. According to the FBI report, Anderson told the Bureau that Garrison was a convincing talker who had considerable facts at his disposal that the CIA had coordinated the assassination of JFK. In public news reports, however, Anderson argued that President Kennedy was assassinated by elements of the Mafia working with the CIA as the Castro assassination plots “backfired.” Years later Anderson claimed that Castro retaliated against Kennedy. The popular Mormon muckraker aggressively pursued leads and had boldly reported his findings.

Widely viewed as Nixon’s nemesis, and the source of straight-forward reporting and colorful commentary, this style was often viewed with disdain by the mainstream media. He utilized a remarkable range of contacts without remaining loyal to them. Later in his career, when he was more popular and more accepted by the mainstream media, he exposed major scandals with the CIA, State and Defense Departments and the Nixon White House. Anderson’s major source on the assassination was Mafia lieutenant Johnny Roselli, who had been involved with the CIA-Mafia plots against Castro. Roselli, however, had just been convicted of fraud, and was facing deportation. According to former FBI man William Turner, the story originated from Robert Maheu, a CIA-Mafia intermediary, who gave it to Edward P. Morgan, a former FBI man and well-known lawyer, who passed it on to Anderson.5 Perhaps I. Irving Davidson, the powerful lobbyist who had been his office mate and at times his benefactor from 1954-1964, also influenced Anderson. Davidson had a wide range of contacts including Carlos Marcello, J. Edgar Hoover, Teamster Union boss Jimmy Hoffa, the CIA, the Somozas, and the Murchisons of Dallas.6 Also, Anderson’s longtime mentor and senior partner in journalism, Drew Pearson, was a CIA asset. (Commission Document 990). Author Jim DiEugenio has revealed some of reporter Hugh Aynesworth’s intelligence ties as well as his cooperation with the Shaw defense team. One month before the assassination, CIA agent J. Walton Moore, who had been meeting with Oswald’s friend George de Mohrenschildt, was also meeting with Aynesworth about traveling to Cuba (Moore, Walton, Ford, Ford Report 9/28/62). In Aynesworth’s reports to Newsweek, 2/24/67, he described David Ferrie’s ordination into the Old Catholic Church of North America. He noted parenthetically, “We’re trying to protect our own in this group and would appreciate your not using the church’s name.” This suggests that Aynesworth knew that the CIA was using this strange religious sect as a front organization. In another report, 3/3/67 , Aynesworth wrote that the CIA attempted to get Nazi intelligence officer turned CIA mercenary Otto Skorzeny in on a Castro kidnapping plot in 1963. Since this was not even revealed in the 1967 Inspector General Report on CIA plots to kill Castro, it indicates Aynesworth’s connections. Aynesworth later cooperated with Clay Shaw’s defense team and a number of his investigative interviews were given to Shaw’s lead attorney Ed Wegmann. The positive public response to new critical books, as well as the Garrison investigation, prompted the CIA to generate a wider range of defensive strategies.

The positive public response to new critical books, as well as the Garrison investigation, prompted the CIA to generate a wider range of defensive strategies. A CIA memo distributed to CIA media assets at the New York Times, CBS, NBC, ABC, and elsewhere (4/1/67) focused on “Countering Criticism of the Warren Report.” 1. Our Concern. From the day of President Kennedy’s assassination on, there has been speculation about the responsibility for his murder. Although this was stemmed for a time by the Warren Commission report (which appeared at the end of September 1964), various writers have now had time to scan the Commission’s published report and documents for new pretexts for questioning, and there has been a new wave of books and articles criticizing the Commission’s findings. In most cases the critics have speculated as to the existence of some kind of conspiracy, and often they have implied that the Commission itself was involved. Presumably as a result of the increasing challenge to the Warren Commission’s Report, a public opinion poll recently indicated that 46% of the American public did not think that Oswald acted alone, while more than half of those polled thought that the Commission had left some questions unresolved. Doubtless polls abroad would show similar or possibly more adverse results. 2. The trend of opinion is a matter of concern to the U.S. government, including our organization. The members of the Warren Commission were naturally chosen for their integrity, experience, and prominence. They represented both major parties, and they and their staff were deliberately drawn from all sections of the country. Just because of the standing of the Commissioners, efforts to impugn their rectitude and wisdom tend to cast doubt on the whole leadership of American society. Moreover, there seems to be an increasing tendency to hint that President Johnson himself, as the one person who might be said to have benefited, was in some way responsible for the assassination. Innuendo of such seriousness affects not only the individual concerned, but also the whole reputation of the American government. Our organization itself is directly involved: among the other facts, we contributed information to the investigation. Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald works for us. The aim of this dispatch is to provide material for countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such claims in other countries.

Background information is supplied in a classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments. a. To discuss the publicity problem with liaison and friendly elite contacts (especially politicians and editors), pointing out that the Warren Commission made as thorough an investigation as humanly possible, that the charges of the critics are without serious foundation, and that further speculative discussion only plays into the hands of the opposition. Point out also that parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists. Urge them to use their influence to discourage unfounded and irresponsible speculation. b. To employ propaganda assets to answer and refute the attacks of the critics,. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. The unclassified attachments to the guidance should provide useful background material for passage to assets. Our play should point out, as applicable, that the critics are (i) wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in, (ii) politically interested, (iii) financially interested, (iv) hasty and inaccurate in their research, or (v) infatuated with their own theories. In the course of discussions of the whole phenomenon of criticism, a useful strategy may be to single out Epstein’s theory for attack, using the attached Fletcher Knebel article and Spectator piece for background. (Although Mark Lane’s book is much less convincing than Epstein’s and comes off badly where contested by knowledgeable critics, it is also much more difficult to answer as a whole, as one becomes lost in a morass of unrelated details.) a. no significant new evidence has emerged which the Commission did not consider, the assassination is sometimes compared (e.g. by Joachim Joesten and Bertrand Russell) with the Dreyfus case; however, unlike that case, the attacks on the Warren Commission have produced no new evidence, no new culprits have been convincingly identified , and there is no agreement among the critics. (A better parallel, though an imperfect one, might be with the Reichstag fire of 1933, which some competent historians (Fritz Tobias, A.J. P. Taylor, D. C. Watt) now believe was set by Nazis or Communists; the Nazis tried to pin the blame on the Communists, but the latter have been much more successful in convincing the world that the Nazis were to blame.) b. Critics usually overvalue particular items and ignore others. They tend to place more emphasis on the recollections of individual eyewitnesses (which are less reliable and more divergent – and hence offer more hand-holds for criticism) and less on ballistic, autopsy, and photographic evidence.

A close examination of the commission’s records will usually show that the conflicting eyewitness accounts are quoted out of context, or were discarded by the Commission for good and sufficient reason. c. Conspiracy on the large scale often suggested would be impossible to conceal in the United States, esp., since informants could expect to receive large royalties, etc. note that Robert Kennedy, Attorney General at the time and John F. Kennedy’s brother, would be the last man to overlook or conceal any conspiracy. And as one reviewer pointed out, Congressman Gerald R. Ford would hardly have held his tongue for the sake of the Democratic administration, and Senator Russell would have had every political interest in exposing any misdeeds on the Part of chief Justice Warren. A conspirator moreover would hardly choose a location for a shooting where so much depended on conditions beyond his control: the route, the speed of the cars, the moving target, and the risk that the assassin would be discovered. A group of wealthy conspirators could have arranged much more secure conditions. d. Critics have often been enticed by a form of intellectual pride: they light on some theory and fall in love with it; they also scoff at the Commission because it did not always answer every question with a flat decision one way or the other, actually, safeguard against over commitment to anyone’s theory, or against the illicit transformation of probabilities into certainties. f. As to charges that the Commission’s report was a rush job, it emerged three months after the deadline originally set. But to the degree that Commission tried to speed up it’s reporting, this was largely due to the pressure of irresponsible speculation already appearing, in some cases coming from the same critics who, refusing to admit their errors, are not putting out new criticisms. g. Such vague accusations as that “more than ten people have died mysteriously” can always be explained in some more natural way: e. g., the individuals concerned have for the most part died of natural causes; the Commission staff questioned 418 witnesses (the FBI interviewed far more people, conducting 25,000 interviews and re-interviews), and in such a large group, a certain number of deaths are to be expected.

Where possible, counter speculation by encouraging reference to the Commission’s Report itself, Open-minded foreign readers should still be impressed by the care, thoroughness, objectivity and speed with which the Commission worked. Reviewers of other books might be encouraged to add to their account the idea that, checking back with the Report itself, they found it far superior to the work of its critics. The Saturday Evening Post, then owned by Curtis Publishing, whose president, Martin Ackerman, was also a friend of CIA operative Robert Maheu, printed a highly misleading story on April 6, 1967, entitled “Rush to Judgment in New Orleans.” The reporter, James Phelan, an FBI contract agent, claimed that after ten hours of talking with Garrison he felt the case was “wildly speculative.” “Boiled down… [It was] the result of a homosexual conspiracy masterminded by David Ferrie.” Phelan made no mention of Garrison’s evidence raising questions about the FBI, CIA, or the Secret Service. Phelan also omitted Perry Russo’s confirmation that he had told Garrison’s office that he had identified Shaw as Bertrand. When questioned by Mark Lane about this omission Phelan complained that he was facing a tight deadline.7 Since the piece appeared almost two years before the trial date, Mark Lane noted that Phelan and The Saturday Evening Post had rushed to judgment, to delegitimize Garrison and his case. Some of “reporter” Phelan’s activities on this case raise significant concerns. Phelan, like his boss Ackerman, was friends with Robert Maheu, Howard Hughes’s contact man with the CIA and the Mafia. Surreptitiously he visited witness Perry Russo four times to entice him to change his testimony and wreck Garrison’s case. Phelan was later accompanied and aided by ex-FBI and NSA asset, and RFK confidant, Walter Sheridan in these attempts to bribe Russo in order to discredit Garrison.8 During the trial Phelan rented a house and would invite reporters over every evening to serve refreshments and give his views. On the day that Garrison showed the Zapruder film, journalists were shocked. That evening Phelan expounded on the “jet effect” theory to counter the strong impression of the fatal head shot coming from the front. Garrison’s staff then made several bootleg copies of the Zapruder film and distributed them to assassination researchers.

The intelligence community’s connections with The Saturday Evening Post were utilized in a story 5/20/67 , “I’m Glad the CIA is Immoral” by Tom Braden, formerly head of the CIA’s International Organizations Division. Years later Braden revealed his role in Operation Mockingbird. (The CIA’s media operation) “If the director of the CIA wanted to extend a present … he could hand it to him and never have to account to anybody … there was simply no limit to the money it could spend and no limit to the people it could hire and no limit to the activities it could decide were necessary to conduct the secret war.… Journalists were a target, labor unions a particular target – that was one of the activities in which the communists spent the most money”9 (Granada Television, World in Action 1975). Another response to the critics of the Warren Report came from nationally acclaimed Merriman Smith, the UPI White House reporter. Smith coarsely proclaimed in a Dallas Times Herald editorial on 4/27/67 that decent folks should tell [The Warren Report critics] “to shut the hell up.” Quite a statement from a reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the assassination. Back in November 1966, Smith imaginatively wrote: The car in which I rode was not far from the presidential vehicle and in clear view of it. We were coming out of an underpass when the first shot was fired. The sound for a split second resembled a big firecracker. As we cleared the underpass, then came the second and third shots. The shots were fired smoothly and evenly. There was not the slightest doubt on the front seat of our car that the shots came from a rifle to the rear. There is only one underpass in Dealey Plaza and the Presidential limousine was proceeding toward it. When the President was about 350 feet from the underpass the first shot was fired, and about 260 feet from it when the last shot was fired. Smith clearly was not where he claimed to be when the shots were fired. (Perhaps he deserved a Pulitzer Prize for fiction.) We now know that Smith was an FBI informant, according to documents released in 1995. Reporter Hugh Aynesworth not only had FBI and CIA connections, he also served as an informant for President Johnson.

Reporter Hugh Aynesworth not only had FBI and CIA connections, he also served as an informant for President Johnson. In a Western Union memorandum dated 5/13/67, he forwarded a rough draft of his Newsweek story of 5/15/67 to President Johnson’s Press Secretary George Christian, in order to make “a complete report of my knowledge available to the FBI, as I have done in the past.”10 He indicated in his memorandum that the wire services would carry this story, which they did. Whether the wire services knew of Aynesworth’s connections remains unclear. Aynesworth piled on unproven allegations in a vicious smear. Jim Garrison is right. There has been a conspiracy in New Orleans – but it is a plot of Garrison’s own making. It is a scheme to concoct a fantastic “solution” to the death of John F. Kennedy, and to make it stick; in this cause, the district attorney and his staff have been indirect parties to the death of one man and have humiliated, harassed, and financially gutted several others.… I have evidence that one of the strapping D.A.’s investigators offered an unwilling “witness” $3, 000 and a job with an airline – if he only would fill in the facts of an alleged meeting to plot the death of the President… When the New Orleans Police Department and the Deputy Superintendent of Police conducted an internal investigation of the Beauboef bribery matter (Al Beauboef was Dave Ferrie’s friend) they completely exonerated New Orleans Assistant D.A.’s Lynn Loisel and Lou Ivon of any wrongdoing. Beauboef then retracted his charges of bribery in a sworn statement. Although this material was released on June 12, 1967, Aynesworth never included this in his subsequent reporting. He then implied incompetence or foul play by asserting that key witness Perry Russo had been hypnotized just “hours before he testified” at the preliminary hearing. Aynesworth neglected to mention that Russo had been hypnotized 50 hours prior to the hearing, in a controlled setting, with both Dr. Esmond Fatter, a court accredited expert on hypnotism and Dr. Nicholas Chetta, a coroner of Orleans parish, present. Aynesworth nonetheless derisively declared: “The real question in New Orleans is no longer whether Garrison has solved the assassination. The question is how long the people of the city and the nation’s press will allow this travesty of justice to continue.” Aynesworth’s suspicious involvement in the assassination coverage from the outset warrants review. Immediately after the assassination Aynesworth, who was friendly with the Dallas police, somehow incredibly “felt a story breaking near the TSBD building when all of the other newsman had followed", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:157:3250197a7c4d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 451, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 158, "text": "declared: “The real question in New Orleans is no longer whether Garrison has solved the assassination.

Aynesworth was also somehow the recipient of Oswald’s alleged diary, and it was published under his byline. One of his newspaper friends, Holmes Alexander, wrote in 1964 that Aynesworth was putting pressure on both the Warren Commission and the FBI to portray Oswald as a crazy leftist assassin. 11 About the Assassination, which coincidentally followed the CIA memo “Countering the Criticism of the Warren Report,” almost point for point. Roberts took the statements of witness S.M. Holland out of context. He criticized Mark Lane’s arguments regarding the location of the shots and claimed that “the Commission found witnesses who were near the Book Depository who thought the shots came from the building.”12 The Warren Report noted, however, that “When the shots were fired, many people near the Depository believed that the shots came from the railroad bridge over the triple underpass or from the area to the west of the Depository.” 13 He distorted the testimony of witness Julia Mercer who claimed to have seen someone with what appeared to be a “so-called gun case” “near” the scene of the murder. He viewed this as “insignificant” since “60-odd” similar statements were made to the Warren Commission. Actually 30 statements were made, and Mercer’s testimony places a gunman precisely at the scene of the murder, not “near” it.14 Are they bona fide scholars, as the reviewers took them to be, or are they “journalist scavengers” as Connally has suggested … unlike Emile Zola and Lincoln Stephens, who rocked the nation by naming the guilty, the Warren Report critics never tell us who’s in charge of the scheme that has victimized us all. Nor are they able to define its purposes, although they offer half a dozen conflicting theories … clearly the pattern of the Warren Commission critics is: If the experts agree with you, use them. If they don’t ignore them.15 By selecting the incredible and contradictory, scavengers like Mark Lane sowed confusion.

By writing an honest guide for the perplexed, Roberts performs a public service. 1. - Deleted - have obtained a supply of copies of Robert’s book and can provide these and reproductions of the Goodhart article. We also have reproductions of Newsweek’s exposé of Garrison. Furthermore, a limited number of copies of the Warren Commission Report are available if needed. (CIA document 180-10098-10194) I think that the Warren Report in many respects unfortunately is in the position of Humpty Dumpty…. the conclusion is totally indefensible … a study of the Zapruder film, which was never studied by the Warren Commission before it reached that conclusion, shows that his head went to the back, to the back and rear as if he were hit with a baseball bat … this is one of many areas which would have come to light had there been an adversary proceeding. By May of 1967 the New Orleans States-Item ran a series of articles by Hoke May and Ross Yockey that treated the Garrison case seriously and revealed some of the CIA connections around Gordon Novel and his lawyers. Ross Yockey’s piece 7/1/67 was titled “CIA Hiding 51 Documents Vital to Probe – D.A. Aide.” Reactions were rapid. CIA General Counsel Lawrence Houston had his assistant, John Greaney meet with local CIA officer Lloyd Ray in New Orleans to discuss the Garrison investigation. This memo remains partly redacted. Then, Bill Gurvich, a short-term volunteer with unknown CIA connections, who had left the DA’s office, met with the hierarchy at the States-Item. Quickly and inexplicably, Yockey and May were pulled from the Garrison case. Gurvich later admitted to stealing the DA’s master file and contacting Walter Sheridan, who coordinated and produced the NBC “White Paper” on Jim Garrison.16 Walter Sheridan, a former member of the DOJ “Get Hoffa” team, and a former chief of Counterintelligence at the NSA, also provided information to the former DOJ head of Criminal Division, then a CIA attorney. Attorney Herbert Miller stayed in touch with CIA Associate General Counsel Richard Lansdale regarding Garrison’s case, and in particular Al Beauboef. Beauboef refused to cooperate with Garrison after his trip to Washington.

A CIA memo 5/11/67 reveals that Sheridan wanted to meet with the CIA “under any terms we propose.”17 Richard Lansdale, Associate General Counsel, has advised us that NBC plans to do a derogatory television special on Garrison and his probe of the Kennedy assassination; that NBC regards Garrison as a menace to the country and means to destroy him. The program is to be presented within the next few weeks. Mr. Lansdale learned this information from Mr. Walter Sheridan. A local FBI agent reported that Richard Townley, [of NBC affiliate] WDSU-TV, New Orleans, remarked to a special agent of the New Orleans office last evening that he received instructions from NBC, New York, to prepare a one hour television special on Jim Garrison with the instruction “shoot him down.” NBC led its “White Paper,” entitled “The Case of Jim Garrison,” 6/19/67, with interviews of three people, unknown to Garrison personally, who accused him of pressuring witnesses and bribery. None of these “witnesses” ever repeated their charges under oath, and all later pleaded the Fifth Amendment before the Orleans Parish Grand Jury. Next, attorney Dean Andrews claimed that Clay Shaw had not called him the day after the assassination. Following the NBC show Andrews was indicted and found guilty by the Orleans Parish Grand Jury for committing perjury when he testified that Clay Shaw was not the “Clay Bertrand” who called him to be Oswald’s lawyer. On the program, businessman Fred Leemans asserted that Garrison and reporters offered him money if he could remember that Clay Shaw also used the name Bertrand and frequented his New Orleans Turkish bath with a young man named “Lee.” After the NBC special Leemans admitted in a sworn statement that he had received threatening phone calls “relating to the information that he had given Garrison.” Leemans was told to contact Irvin Dymond, one of Shaw’s attorneys, and was offered an attorney and bond in the event he was charged with giving false testimony to the D.A.’s office. NBC included a jailhouse interview, wherein Miguel Torres claimed that Garrison had offered him his freedom, $75 worth of heroin and a vacation in Florida in exchange for his incriminating testimony. Another convict, John “The Baptist” Cancler, who Garrison had recently prosecuted for burglary, claimed that Garrison had promised him freedom if he would break into Clay Shaw’s home and plant incriminating evidence. After the NBC special, Garrison called Torres and Cancler to repeat their stories to a Grand Jury. Both pleaded the Fifth Amendment and were convicted for contempt.

The day after the “White Paper,” the New York Times, to their credit, reported, 6/20/67 , about a press conference in Garrison’s office, where Perry Russo charged that Walter Sheridan and other NBC-TV employees sought his help to wreck the investigation. Russo also declared that Richard Townley of WDSU-TV and James Phelan (The Saturday Evening Post) spoke to him on behalf of NBC-TV. Russo said that the NBC-TV team used threats and promises of a job in California to persuade him to appear on the program. Russo’s charges have been confirmed, because Jim Garrison had secretly wired Russo to record the meeting.18 According to two sources, Sheridan was the NSA liaison to a CIA cover organization named International Investigation Incorporated. NBC also hired CIA operative Gordon Novel, the man who wiretapped Garrison’s office, as a consultant for the show.19 Sheridan put Novel on a $500 a day retainer, then urged him to skip town to avoid being indicted, and paid him an additional $750 while he was in Columbus, Ohio.20 Newsweek, nonetheless, reported that the program was a “tough … hard-nosed analysis” (7/3/67) . The L.A. Times condemned Jim Garrison’s “fantastic allegations and weird evidence” and supported Walter Sheridan’s “White Paper.” Later that year though, the FCC, in an unprecedented decision based on the “Fairness Doctrine,” provided Garrison one-half-hour to respond to the hour long White Paper.21 Garrison calmly observed, The people of their country don’t have to be protected from the truth. The country was not built on the idea that a handful of nobles, whether located in our federal agencies in Washington D.C., or in the news agencies in New York, should decide what was good for the people to know and what they should not know … I would rather put my confidence in the common sense of the people of this country. Garrison’s brief overview on NBC was clear and compelling, but the better advertised and more reported “White Paper” had recast the public perception of Garrison, from a crusader to merely a character. Garrison also moved to arrest Sheridan for bribing witnesses, although the charges were later dropped. Author David Talbot argues that RFK stepped in to assist his old ally Sheridan. Back then NBC was owned by RCA, whose Pentagon contracts had increased more than $1 billion from 1960 to 1967.

Questions linger regarding the role played by NBC’s chairman, retired General David Sarnoff, and CEO Robert Sarnoff, both noted cold warriors, in the coverage of Garrison’s investigation. General Sarnoff was the former president and a permanent director of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA), a network of the American electronics industry and the military establishment. In an address at an annual AFCEA banquet, 5/26/65, Sarnoff connected: The working alliance of industrial and military leadership represented in this organization… It took nearly two centuries and several prolonged conflicts to teach us that the absence of this vital alliance in times of peace could be costly in time of war … AFCEA has fashioned a community of interest as closely interwoven that whatever affects the progress of one partner is reflected in the progress of the other.22 These NBC connections cast new light on the reporting of Oswald’s activities in the summer of 1963 by NBC New Orleans affiliate WDSU-TV, owned by Edith and Edgar Stern, who were close friends with Clay Shaw. Strangely, WDSU-TV filmed Oswald outside the New Orleans Municipal Court after receiving a $10 fine for a fracas with CIA operative Carlos Bringuier, while distributing “pro-Castro” leaflets in front of the Trade Mart. These actions hardly constitute news in a big city; they do, however, appear to be pre-planned elements of a “lone communist nut” scenario.24 After this incident, Oswald was invited to “debate” CIA operatives Carlos Bringuier and Ed Butler on WDSU radio, which had the effect of publicly identifying Oswald as a Marxist Soviet defector. Later, as the Garrison case unfolded, another WDSU-TV reporter, Ed Planer, offered to share information he had on the Garrison investigation with the FBI. The context for these connections is revealing. The Sterns, heirs to the Sears Roebuck fortune, were active members of INCA, the Information Council of the Americas. The Stern’s son, Philip, worked for the CIA as “liaison clearance” with the Deputy Asst. Secretary Of State for Public Affairs. Dr. Alton Ochsner, (a cleared source for the CIA since 1955) and Edwin S. Butler who founded INCA in 1961, attempted to protect the interests of the New Orleans economic elite and stimulate anti-communism. Standard Oil, the Reily Foundation, Hibernia Bank, and Mississippi Shipping Company funded it, along with the International Trade Mart, whose managing director was Clay Shaw. Butler openly bragged about his relationship with CIA Deputy Director Charles Cabell, who was fired by President Kennedy.

Butler openly bragged about his relationship with CIA Deputy Director Charles Cabell, who was fired by President Kennedy. Ochsner was a member of the exclusive Boston Club and had been a guest at the elite Bohemian Grove in California. His friends included Samuel Zemurry of United Fruit, Turner Catledge, managing editor of the New York Times, Clay Shaw, Edgar Stern owner of WDSU radio and many of the New Orleans elite.25 By early 1967, three members of INCA helped form a group called “Truth or Consequences,” which raised funds for Jim Garrison’s investigation. Willard Robertson and Cecil Shilstone were also founding members of INCA, and attorney Eberhard Duetch was a director for INCA who had been Garrison’s former law partner. Critics have long contended that Truth or Consequences was well situated for surveillance of Garrison’s investigation. Some of the best reporting during this period appeared in Fred Powledge’s 6/17/67 piece in The New Republic. He outlined Oswald’s links to an anticommunist group, the fictional New Orleans chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He then explored Garrison’s research regarding 19 witnesses who had originally testified before the Warren Commission that they had heard shooting coming from the grassy knoll. Powledge examined some of the links between Gordon Novel and Clay Shaw to the CIA, as well as the possibility of a CIA and media cover-up. He determined that Garrison had uncovered the connection of witness Gordon Novel to the CIA, which led to the New Orleans States-Item headline “NOVEL CIA AGENT, ATTORNEY ADMITS” on May 23, 1967. The New York Times also printed the acknowledgement by Novel’s lawyer that he had been a CIA agent, but buried their brief story on page 44.27 Even the Associated Press noted “When Novel first fled from New Orleans, he headed straight for McLean, Virginia, which is the Central Intelligence Agency suburb, this is not surprising, because Gordon Novel was a CIA employee in the 1960s.” I used to attend, among other things, the Director’s morning meeting. This was Richard Helms at the time and he held a meeting every morning at 9, which was attended by 12 or 14 of his leading Deputies plus 3 or 4 staffers … I used to take minutes of this meeting.… But during the Clay Shaw trial I remember the Director on several occasions asking questions like, you know, “Are we giving them all the help they need?” I didn’t know who they or them were.

How CBS management mangled their proposal is revealing. This proposal, promoted by CBS Senior VP Gordon Manning, was rejected by Richard Salant, president of the CBS News Division. By November 1966 Manning, along with Executive Producer Leslie Midgely, then proposed a 3-hour even-handed debate of the Warren Report. The final hour would consist of deliberations by a panel of law school deans. Salant’s revised this proposal and advocated putting the Warren Report on trial. When this was presented to the president of CBS Broadcast Group, John Schneider he told Salant to bring it to CBS News Executive Committee (CNEC). Former CBS attorney Roger Feinman revealed the editorial power of the little known CNEC in rapidly transforming the series. Weekly meetings of the CNEC, which determined CBS News policies and operations, consisted of William Paley, Frank Stanton, (LBJ’s friend and business partner) Richard Salant, Sig Mickelson, and John Schneider. Richard Salant, Frank Stanton’s protégé, started to get second thoughts and then sent Gordon Manning and Leslie Midgely to California to meet with two prominent lawyers to dissuade them. They were Edwin Hudelson, board member of RAND Corporation and a Harvard law school classmate of Frank Stanton (also a State Department of Intelligence attorney) and Bayless Manning, Stanford Law School Dean, and a Chair on the Board at RAND with Stanton. Both feared national security risks and strongly advised that CBS should let the JFK assassination rest. Gordon Manning then changed his proposal to “A Defense of the Warren Report,” while Midgely continued to lobby for at least some pertinent inquiry. Midgely suggested running experiments more scientific than the FBI, as well as holding a mock trial. Salant responded with an anonymous attack crafted by Warren Commissioner", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:164:ea0879379f67", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 458, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 165, "text": "Stanford Law School Dean, and a Chair on the Board at RAND with Stanton.

Midgely suggested running experiments more scientific than the FBI, as well as holding a mock trial. Salant responded with an anonymous attack crafted by Warren Commissioner John McCloy. The Boston Herald-Traveler television editor, Eleanor Roberts, revealed 4/19/67, some of the CBS infighting on the series. “A most unusual television experiment is taking place at CBS News – the preparation of a documentary on another look at the Warren Commission Report – which may never be telecast.” The series could be tabled unless CBS could find new information to counter the Commission’s critics. After reading the article, critic Ray Marcus called CBS reporter Bob Richter to opt out of the project. Richter retorted, “If those of you who have important information don’t cooperate with us you’re just guaranteeing that the other side wins.” Five days prior to this program airing, author Richard E. Sprague met with reporters Bob Richter and Dan Rather and both agreed that the conclusions stating conspiracy had to be made stronger. Last minute changes, which gutted this critique, caused an outraged producer Bob Richter to resign. Sprague’s correspondence with Walter Cronkite showed that script changes came from Midgely and reporter Robert Lister.29 Richter told author Bill Turner that the series started out objective, but somewhere along the line the whole tone was changed so as to completely reinforce the Warren Report. The change came, Richter observed, after a phone call from Washington to CBS President Frank Stanton. The caller was a top government official, possibly Stanton’s old friend and business partner Lyndon Johnson. In June of 1967, CBS broadcast their highly touted four-hour program which strongly supported the Warren Commission’s findings. The New York Times billed it as “very well the most valuable four hours you ever spent with television.” CBS President Richard Salant asserted in a press release that the program was a work of “genius.” The Special Reports unit, which had developed the two-hour “illustration” of the Warren Report for CBS in 1964, did the reporting. Upper-level management at CBS, Richard Salant President of CBS News, and Gordon Manning, Vice President of News, were “unusually concerned and involved,” according to Executive Producer Les Midgely. Salant claimed, “that it would not be a documentary marshaling of facts.” He said long before the work was done that CBS News would reach and state its own conclusions – “no matter what they might be.” (Deleted two lines) advised me confidentially that the Columbia Broadcasting Company was planning a five-hour documentary on the assassination.

He was of the opinion that they were certainly cooperating, or were going to cooperate in this production. (Deleted word) requested that this information be kept confidential, and he said he would furnish me more details at a later date. Bureau will be kept advised of any further development. In the program CBS alluded to Oswald’s marksmanship. A fellow serviceman noted “he was not a genuine marksman.” CBS could have also interviewed Oswald’s Sergeant, Nelson Delgado, as had filmmaker Emile de Antonio, since Delgado had already stated that he was threatened by the FBI to remain silent about Oswald’s poor marksmanship. This line of inquiry then shifted to whether the rifle could be shot quickly enough. CBS attempted to replicate the alleged marksmanship of Oswald using 11 marksmen. Out of 37 attempts to fire three shots, seventeen of those attempts were not counted “because of trouble with the rifle,” yet CBS did not state what the trouble was. In the 20 attempts [remaining] where time could be recorded, the average was 5.6 seconds. CBS divulged only four of the twenty attempts – one had three hits in 5.2 seconds; one had 2 of 3 hits in slightly less than 5 seconds; one had one hit in 4.1 seconds and one had one hit in 5.4 seconds. Walter Cronkite, the respected CBS anchorman, often referred to as an American television father figure, creatively claimed that: It seems reasonable to say that an expert could fire that rifle in five seconds.… It seems reasonable to say that Oswald, under normal circumstances, would take longer [than experts]. But these were not normal circumstances. Oswald was shooting at a President. So the answer is: probably fast enough. Dan Rather chose to reject previous FBI test firings as well as the results of the marksmen hired by CBS and deduced that it was, “A much easier shot than even it looks in our pictures.”30 In a documentary 26 years later CBS finally revealed that only four of the eleven", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:166:869c1f2ea8a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 460, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 167, "text": "that Oswald, under normal circumstances, would take longer [than experts].

Notably the discussion of the single bullet theory neglected to mention the Army ballistics test, which determined that a bullet hitting dense objects would be deformed. Also unmentioned was the critical fact that more grains of a bullet were found in Governor Connally’s body than were lost from the magic bullet. According to CBS attorney Roger Feinman, the questions to be asked of former Warren Commission counsel Arlen Spector were provided in advance, sidestepping CBS’s own book of Standards and Procedures. Warren Commissioner John McCloy was questioned by CBS, but not regarding the evidence raised by critics like Lane, Epstein, or Weisberg. Jim Garrison’s criticisms were shown for only about thirty seconds. McCloy confirmed his continued support for the findings of the Warren Commission. Internal memos indicate that John McCloy’s daughter Ellen had indeed kept her dad posted regarding the script. One comment that Dad made after reading the “rough script” Mr. Salant wanted me to pass along to you. It concerned a sentence that appears on the top of page 5C … Dad said: 1) he has no recollection of President (LBJ) asking or urging the members of the Warren Commission to “act with speed.” 2) The phrase “in less than a year” again implies that the Commission might have acted in haste. Dad suggests that you say 8% months.” Ellen, (to Les Midgely the producer of the series). 31 In the first of the four one-hour programs, CBS attempted to examine whether Oswald owned a rifle. The controversial picture of Oswald holding the alleged murder weapon was analyzed by, according to Cronkite, “a professional photographer and photo analyst,” yet remarkably the “independent study” was made by FBI informant Lawrence Schiller, the alleged former business agent for Jack Ruby. Although the FBI and the London Times (1966) had failed to prove the authenticity of the backyard photo of Oswald, CBS “expert” Lawrence Schiller claimed to succeed.32 The 1967 CBS interview with Orville Nix, who, like Zapruder, filmed the assassination, recycled some of the procedures used in the 1964 CBS documentary. When asked where the shots came from, Nix said, “From over there on the grassy knoll behind the fence.” This was then disregarded and Nix was again asked the same question, to which he gave the same response – this sequence was repeated six or seven additional times.

Then a producer asked him where the Warren Commission said the shots came from? Nix answered, “From the Texas School Book Depository.” Only Nix’s last response was used. CBS producer Bernard Birnbaum, who worked on the documentary, denied the exchange. He asserted, “We never tried to put words in anyone’s mouth.”33 According to Nix’s granddaughter Gayle Jackson, her grandfather told CBS that there were four shots fired; however, CBS ran Nix saying, “bang, bang, bang” suggesting only three shots were fired. After the CBS interview the normally gentle Nix became furious. He was hitting the steering wheel on the ride back home saying “Why are they trying to make me feel like I am insane?” Jackson recalls. A year later when Jim Garrison called for Nix to testify, he refused. Jackson thought he feared for his life.34 Regarding the question “Was Oswald’s rifle fired from the building?” CBS appeared to gloss over the equivocating responses from a key witness, Dallas Deputy Sheriff Seymour Weitzman, who had managed a sporting goods store and was known as an expert with rifles. Weitzman originally stated to the Dallas police that he found a German Mauser 7.65 in the TSBD. Curiously, he changed his story when questioned by the Warren Commission. Weitzman repeated to CBS essentially what he told the Warren Commission: “that he had seen the weapon at a glance … it’s a German Mauser, that it’s an Italian type gun and that it looked like a Mauser, which I said it was mistaken, and it was proven that my statement was a mistake…” Rather reported, “So Mr. Weitzman now seems sure that the rifle was indeed Oswald’s Mannlicher-Carcano.”35 CBS was given a blow-up of a snapshot taken by Mary Moorman who was facing the grassy knoll when the shots were fired. Researcher Raymond Marcus gave the picture to producer Robert Richter who said he strongly believed that he discerned a man. Executive producer Les Midgely, who had the final say, disagreed, and viewers only briefly saw the picture with a denigrating description, “If there are men up there, they definitely can’t be seen with the naked eye.” Marcus asked a dozen experts, some from MIT and UCLA, to examine the blow-up without mentioning its connection to the assassination and 10 of them concluded that at least “probably” they saw a man in the photograph.36 In a creative attempt to scientifically bolster the findings of the Warren", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:168:039cbcee9f5a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 462, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 169, "text": "had the final say, disagreed, and viewers only briefly saw the picture with a denigrating description, “If there are men up there, they definitely can’t be seen with the naked eye.” Marcus asked a dozen experts, some from MIT and UCLA, to examine the blow-up without mentioning its connection to the assassination and 10 of them concluded that at least “probably” they saw a man in the photograph.36 In a creative attempt to scientifically bolster the findings of the Warren Report, CBS included a “jiggle analysis” of the Zapruder film. Dr. Luis Alvarez, a physicist at UC Berkeley, noted that Abraham Zapruder would not be able to hold his camera steady when he heard the shots fired, thus significant blurring would occur after each shot was fired. Although blurring could occur due to panning errors as Zapruder turned his camera, if only three blurs existed it would constitute important evidence that three shots were fired. The fatal headshot occurred at frame 313 and frames 318-322 are unquestionably blurred. CBS claimed to have found blurring at 186 and at 222, and concluded that only three shots were fired. CBS neglected to reveal that Dr. Alvarez thought that the blurred frames occurred at frame 177 and again at frame 216. Another problem with the CBS and Alvarez analysis was that the first and second shot were placed too closely together. The Warren Commission found that an expert marksman using the Mannlicher-Carcano could not fire two shots in less than 2.3 seconds.37 This translates to about 43 frames of film, since Zapruder’s camera ran at 18.3 frames per second. In the CBS study the first two shots differ by 36 frames (less than 2 seconds) and in Dr. Alvarez’s study they differ by 39 frames (2.1 seconds). Actually, if either CBS News or Dr. Alvarez were correct, either would have inadvertently proved that Oswald … was not the lone assassin. CBS used a military doctor and former Warren Commission consultant to test whether a bullet could penetrate both Kennedy and Connally. In all four tests the bullet failed to penetrate the equivalent of Connally’s thigh, nonetheless the doctor concluded it would have taken very little more velocity to cause a similar wound. CBS did not announce the distance from which the test bullets were fired and neglected to duplicate the strange path of the “magic bullet.” To clarify the location of the President’s back wound CBS chose Commander Humes, the pathologist who had directed the autopsy and had subsequently burned his preliminary draft of the autopsy. Humes confirmed that one wound was in the back of the neck; disregarding the reports of four Secret Service agents, two FBI agents, the signed death certificate, the autopsy description sheet, and the President’s shirt and jacket, which all pointed to a hole 5% inches below the collar, in the back.

In their research for the series, CBS had discovered a document that the Warren Commission did not have. The afternoon of the assassination, Perry had given a press conference along with Dr. Kemp Clark. Although it was filmed, when the Commission asked for a copy or a transcript, the Secret Service said they could not locate either. (Doug Horne, Inside the ARRB, vol. 2, p. 647) This was a lie. The Secret Service did have such a transcript. It was delivered to them on November 23, 1963. The ARRB found the timestamped envelope. But Feinman discovered that CBS had found a copy of this transcript years before, White House correspondent Robert Pierpont found a transcript through the White House press office. One reason it was hard to find was that it should not have been at the White House; it should have been at the Kennedy Library. But as Roger Feinman found out, it had been relabeled. It was not a Kennedy administration press conference anymore; but the first press conference of the Johnson administration. So it ended up at the Johnson Library. None of this was revealed on the program by either Cronkite or Rather. And neither the tape nor transcript was presented during the series. In fact, Cronkite did his best to camouflage what Perry said during this November 22^(nd) press conference, specifically about the anterior neck wound. Perry clearly said that it had the appearance to him of being an entrance wound, and he said this three times. Cronkite tried to characterize the conference as Perry being ushered out to the press and badgered. Not true, since the press conference was about two hours after Perry had done a tracheotomy over the front neck wound. The performance of that incision had given Perry the closest and most deliberate look at that wound. Perry therefore had the time to recover from the pressure of the operation. And there was no badgering of Perry. News men were simply asking Perry and Clark questions about the wounds they saw. Perry had the opportunity to answer the questions on his own terms. Again, CBS seemed intent on concealing evidence of a second assassin. For Oswald could not have fired at Kennedy from the front. Walter Cronkite, who reportedly read the script given to him, disregarded the limited number of eyewitnesses in Dealey Plaza who were interviewed by CBS invoking “an old axiom among lawyers that nothing carries", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:170:96fd3f3f702c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 464, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 171, "text": "men were simply asking Perry and Clark questions about the wounds they saw.

Walter Cronkite, who reportedly read the script given to him, disregarded the limited number of eyewitnesses in Dealey Plaza who were interviewed by CBS invoking “an old axiom among lawyers that nothing carries more weight with a jury, or is less reliable, than eyewitness testimony.” The preponderance of witnesses running up the grassy knoll was not mentioned. When critic William Turner was interviewed he asserted, “That the massive head shot … came from a quartering angle on the grassy knoll.” Turner also rebutted one of Cronkite’s earlier statements regarding a lack of cartridge shells, because “with a revolver or pistol the shells do not eject.… Number two they can slip the gun under their coat.” Cronkite determined “that it was difficult to take such versions seriously…” Regarding Jack Ruby’s motive, Cronkite stated, “…maintaining to the last that he was no conspirator, that he killed Oswald out of anger and a desire to shield Jacqueline Kennedy from the ordeal of a trial …” Three months earlier Newsweek reported that Ruby’s new lawyer, Joe Tonahill, said that Ruby wrote him a note stating, “Tom Howard (Ruby’s first lawyer) told me to say that I shot Oswald so that Caroline and Mrs. Kennedy wouldn’t have to come to Dallas to testify.” Cronkite nevertheless posited, “the Oswald murder still appears to have been not a conspiracy but an impulse – meaningless violence born of meaningless violence.” CBS commentator Eric Sevareid caustically closed the series by denigrating critics of the Warren Report. Those who do not accept Oswald’s lone guilt were compared with “people who think Adolph Hitler is alive, people who think the so-called Elders of Zion are engaged in a Jewish plot to control the world.… It would be utterly impossible in the American arena of a fierce and free press and politics to conceal a conspiracy among so many individuals who live in the public eye.” He proclaimed that the notion that the Commission members “knowingly suppressed or distorted decisive evidence … is idiotic.” Dan Rather’s summation perplexed many viewers. I’m content with the basic findings of the Warren Commission, that the evidence is overwhelming that Oswald fired at the President, and that Oswald probably killed President Kennedy alone. I am not content with the findings on Oswald’s possible connections with government agencies, particularly with the CIA. I’m not totally convinced at some earlier time, unconnected with the assassination, Oswald may have had more connections than we’ve been told about, or that have been shown.

I’m not totally convinced about the single-bullet theory. But I don’t think it’s absolutely necessary to the final conclusions of the Warren Report. There has been a loss of morale, and a loss of confidence among the American people toward their government and the men who serve it. And that is perhaps more wounding then the assassination itself.… The damage that Lee Harvey Oswald did to the United States of America, the country he first denounced, and then appeared to embrace, did not end when the shots were fired from the Texas School Book Depository. The most grievous wounds persist and there is little reason to believe that they will soon be healed. Remarkably, just a day after the series, a CBS press release ran a headline “[CBS] Says Question of Oswald Connection to CIA, FBI Not Frivolous.” Recall the statements in the series by Rather and Cronkite noting, “the Commission’s handling of that question is scarcely justifiable … there remain disturbing indications {of} some kind of link between Oswald and various intelligence agencies of the United States.” So how could CBS claim in their series that Oswald had “denounced” his country, “was the sole assassin” and now concede that he may have been working for the government intelligence agencies? Viewers did not even see a critic until the end of the third night of the series. A thirty minute taped interview of critics Mark Lane and William Turner was somehow sliced to one-minute segments. Garrison’s lengthy interview was also cut to about 30 seconds. Garrison later cracked to Turner that “This gave me just enough time to be a discordant bleep in the network’s massive four hour tribute to the Warren Commission.” Similarly, the interview with noted forensic pathologist and critic Dr. Cyril Wecht was edited so that the aired excerpt contained only Wecht’s concession that it was possible that the backward motion of Kennedy’s head could have been the result of a neuro-muscular reaction. TV Guide, 6/24/67, then owned by Philadelphia Inquirer publisher Walter Annenberg, gushed that the program “ranks as a major journalistic achievement.… It was a masterful compilation of facts, interviews, experiments and opinions – a job of journalism that will be difficult to surpass.” Coincidentally, Walter Annenberg’s father Moe had been heavily involved with organized crime, and John Roselli was Moe’s primary business representative in Los Angeles in 1929.

While the CBS series was on, Garrison aide William Gurvich resigned from the New Orleans D.A. office and blasted Garrison’s investigation. Jack Nelson of the L.A. Times covered the murky charges and countercharges for three days. Comments from Gurvich (who was influenced by former NSA agent Walter Sheridan) and Clay Shaw were far more prominent than statements from Garrison. The L.A. Times story by Jack Nelson, 6/28/67, “Shaw Hopeful 4-Month ‘Nightmare’ is ending” discussed Shaw’s feelings, rather than Garrison’s case. This perspective was probably influenced by former FBI agent Aaron Kohn working with Nelson as well as L.A. Times reporter Jerry Cohen working with FBI asset Lawrence Schiller. Times chief editor Ed Guthman spoke with Garrison, and publicly decided that Garrison did not have a case. Yet Guthman had told Wesley Liebeler (Warren Commission counsel) that Garrison had shown two months before that Clay Shaw was actually Clay Bertrand – a central contention of the Garrison case. The L.A. Times omitted this contention from their coverage, yet proclaimed in an anti-Garrison editorial, 7/14/67, that “Whatever the outcome, the press will not be muzzled in its search for the truth in New Orleans”39 The first hour was a brilliant achievement, which demonstrated what an incomplete job the Warren Commission had done, and how much new light a second, more effective official inquiry could shed. After that, the more accustomed TV atmosphere closed in again, and things got evasive and fatuous. The first program showed convincingly, taking full advantage of the visual medium that three shots had been fired, and that Oswald’s rifle could have fired all three from the Texas School Book Depository. Bickel argued that the CBS tests were more “complex and realistic” than any done by the FBI.

He accepted CBS’s jiggle analysis of the Zapruder film but was unconvinced with the CBS case for the single-bullet theory. He credited CBS for its retesting of the bullet but noted that the test “disproved” the conclusion and that the CBS expert Dr. W. F. Enos had stated “it’s highly improbable.” Bickel observed that Cronkite’s conclusion on behalf of CBS evaded the fact that there were more fragments left in Governor Connally than the bullet accepted by the Commission was likely to have lost. Bickel blasted Garrison, “who cuts a preposterous figure,” while approving of the statements by Eric Sevareid and John McCloy. He closed by castigating historian Henry Steele Commanger for declaring he saw “no value, really, in another investigation,” since anyone who disbelieved the first investigation would disbelieve “a second, third and fourth.” This review generated a brief exchange between CBS and The New Republic a month later. CBS Special Reporter Walter Lister responded to Bickel and focused on “one major error of fact and … specious arguments against the single bullet theory.” Lister in some way declared that the autopsy pathologists were mistaken in describing that more particles were embedded in Connally’s wrist than were lost from [CE 399] the single bullet. Three particles were removed; the largest weighed half a grain. The other two and those left in his wrist was far tinier. There was also a tiny particle in his thigh. The total weight of these particles could easily be less than two grains. There were two or three grains missing from the bullet so this did not disprove the single bullet theory, nor prove it. Lister asserted that the ballistics tests conducted by Dr. Alfred Oliver, Chief of Wound Ballistics at the Army’s Edgewood Arsenal, show that one bullet could have caused all of the wounds. Lister’s third point clarified that pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht made the statement that the single bullet theory was “highly improbable.” Bickel’s brief reply conceded that the single-bullet theory was possible. Bickel noted that he had never argued that the throat wound was one of entrance and that he had never challenged the physical findings of the autopsy report. Bickel’s lone rejoinder was that Dr. Humes, the autopsy surgeon, and Dr. Finck, who assisted in the autopsy, both said that CE 399, the stretcher bullet, could not have caused all of Connally’s wounds.

Hal Humphrey’s article noted that only one major criticism was made of the Warren Report – that the CIA and FBI were allowed to investigate themselves on matters involving those organizations. “Otherwise the CBS inquiry tended to turn its back on all of the chief critics of the Warren Report.… An overall evaluation … seems to indicate that it was done primarily to allay fears and doubts of much of the public, not just on the matter of the Kennedy assassination but on the subject of trusting our government per se…” Newsweek declared, 7/3/67 , that the “CBS documentary thoroughly probed into aspects of the assassination which, if examined more closely by the Warren Commission might have dispelled at least some of the doubt that Oswald was the lone assassin.…The network argues that the failure of some persons to accept the bulk of the Commissions’ voluminous report is due simply to irrationality.” Those believing in conspiracy were referred to as “cultists.” During this period, unidentified phone callers attempted to manipulate reporters. Reporter Jack Payton of the St. Petersburg Times observed, …Somebody put together a carefully orchestrated campaign to discredit him (Garrison) right from the beginning.… Reporters, myself included, started getting strange telephone calls from people who wouldn’t identify themselves.… You would try to check these things out and always end up getting nowhere. Even so, some of it would show up in the media, attributed to unnamed sources. One I remember in particular was a noted pederast … others suggested marital infidelities, financial improprieties, or ties to the local mafia clan.40 By mid-1967 the Associated Press re-released The Torch is Passed, yet remarkably they just reprinted their 1963 version unchanged. No new questions were even raised.

Life ran a lengthy two-part piece on “The Mob,” written by Sandy Smith and assisted by David Chandler, Dick Billings and Robert Blakey that implicated Jim Garrison (9/1/67 and 9/8/67). Robert Kennedy’s extensive organized crime prosecutions were omitted, as well as the rapid drop off in mob prosecutions under Lyndon Johnson. The only official Life deemed worthy of examining was Jim Garrison. According to Life reporter and chief researcher for the article, Richard Billings, “The Director (FBI) likes to do things for Sandy [Smith].”42 Assisting Billings was Life stringer David Chandler, a close friend of Clay Shaw. Just month’s earlier Chandler had written that Garrison was “an incorruptible crusader for justice” in the November 1966 issue of New Orleans. Chandler, coincidentally, moved into the New Orleans apartment of Ruth Kloepfer, a Quaker, who after being contacted by Ruth Paine, visited Marina a number of times. Billings and Chandler wrote, The well-known New Orleans District Attorney was the guest of Marcello mobster Mario Marino at a Las Vegas hotel. Garrison denies knowledge of Marino’s connection with Marcello … Garrison knows Marcello’s bookmaking brother Sammy – but denies knowing he is a bookie. Three times since 1963 Sammy has paid Garrison’s hotel bill.… On his last visit in March the tab was signed by Marino himself. Garrison was also rated a $5000 credit. Garrison contends that he didn’t gamble and that Marino gave him the credit so he could cash checks.… He is unable, he told Life, “to see anything wrong with a prosecutor freeloading at a mob-controlled casino… “ The wide-ranging critiques of Garrison’s investigation seemed to have peaked by late summer of 1967, but his credibility already had been significantly tarnished.

Garrison’s impatience and inexperience with the mass media hurt his credibility as well. He was an uneven public speaker, sometimes ponderous and unfocused. His case could not be recapped in sound bytes. Reporter and former FBI agent William Turner recounted that once, after working all night, Garrison was confronted by a group of aggressive reporters pushing to be updated on his progress. “When are the arrests going to be made?” Garrison reiterated past statements by noting, “Of course there will be arrests.” A reporter then asked, “You mean you’ve solved the case?” Garrison retorted, “Of course. We solved it weeks ago in its essentials.” The New Orleans newspaper ran the caption, “Case Solved Says Garrison,” and the wire services ran this story. Although Garrison knew far more than he could prove, his sobering speculation along with fragmentary evidence contributed to the confusion. In another instance Garrison poetically avowed to reporters that, “The key to the whole case is through the looking-glass. Black is white, white is black. I don’t want to be cryptic, but that’s the way it is.” Some media outlets claimed that the case was like Alice in Wonderland, missing the metaphoric description of an intelligence operation.43 Reporter Peter Noyes found Garrison’s lack of clarity a source of frustration. His statements regarding the complicity of mobster Eugene Hale Brading plotting with Shaw, Ferrie and Oswald seemed vague. The indictment claimed that a meeting among these four suspects occurred in New Orleans sometime in the middle of September 1963. Noyes thought the witnesses should know the exact date of the conspiracy. Developing the Brading connection was rendered impossible since California Governor Ronald Reagan refused to extradite him to stand trial. Look’s editor-in-chief, William Attwood, formerly the secret liaison to Cuba under JFK, met with Garrison and was impressed with the case. Attwood urged Bobby Kennedy to so something and mentioned that Look was going to report on the investigation. Soon thereafter, Attwood suffered a heart attack, and when he returned to work three months later, Look had decided that it had other priorities. CIA defensive strategies were revised in a late September 1967 memo, which outlined two main courses of action. First get sympathetic members of Congress, and/or the Executive branch to attack Garrison and support the Warren Report. The second strategy was to use the media, both at home and abroad, to smear the DA. To prepare for the trial of Clay Shaw the CIA memo stated, “it would be prudent to have carefully selected channels of communication lined up in advance.” It suggests that CIA Director Richard Helms should “assure that the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:177:1bf152a614d4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 471, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 178, "text": "which outlined two main courses of action.

A week later, Donovan Pratt (of CIA Director of Counterintelligence James Angleton’s staff) was suggesting specific “story lines” for press contacts to use.44 Garrison found the mass media reporting of his statements to be often inept and biased. Years later he lamented that his public statements got twisted so often that he stopped speaking to the press. This self-censorship contributed to even less accurate and less favorable coverage. A Harris poll showed a marked decline in confidence that Garrison would “shed light on the JFK death” – from 45% in March 1967 to 32% in September 1967. Bill Turner’s piece in Ramparts (9/67), “The Press verses Garrison,” critiqued the CBS and NBC specials as “designed to revitalize the sagging public confidence in the Warren Report. Turner lamented that the half hour interviews with Mark Lane and himself were both cut to one minute segments.… Meanwhile, a string of handpicked witnesses and “experts” were heard from.” He recounted Garrison’s top volunteer, William Gurvich, defecting to speak with Walter Sheridan, as well as the NBC threats to Garrison witness Perry Russo. Garrison’s most compelling public statement appeared in the October 1967 Playboy. Although limited in his pre-trial comments by Judge Haggarty, Garrison explored Oswald’s ties with CIA agents, the CIA manipulation of the Warren Commission, and the CIA threat to democracy. The CIA memorandum 10/3/67 regarding this article remains partly redacted. He colorfully declared: In over five years of office, I have never had a single case reversed because of improper methods, a record I’ll match with any D.A. in the country. I only wish the press would allow our case to stand or fall on its merits in court. It appears that certain elements of the mass media have an active interest in preventing this case from ever coming to trial at all and find it necessary to employ against me every smear device in the book. To read the press accounts my investigation, my “circus,” I should say, I’m a cross between Al Capone and Attila the Hun, ruthlessly hounding innocent men, trampling their legal rights, bribing and threatening witnesses and in general violating every canon of legal ethics.

My God, anybody who employs the kind of methods that elements of the media attribute to me should not only not be a district attorney, he should be disbarred. This case has taught me the power of the mythmakers. Playboy confronted Garrison about allegations on NBC’s special “The J.F.K Conspiracy: The Case of Jim Garrison.” NBC reporter Frank McGee claimed that NBC investigators had discovered that two key witnesses against Clay Shaw, Perry Russo and Vernon Bundy, both failed polygraph tests prior to their testimony to the grand jury. Garrison defiantly challenged NBC: NBC’s allegations in this area are about as credible as its other charges. The men who administered both polygraph tests flatly deny that Russo and Bundy failed the test.… I want to make a proposition to the president of NBC: If this charge is true, then I will resign as district attorney of New Orleans. If it’s untrue, then the president of NBC should resign. Just in case he thinks I’m kidding, I’m ready to meet with him at any time to select a mutually acceptable committee to determine once and for all the truth and falsehood of this charge. At 12 : 45p.m . on November 22^(nd) , the Dallas police had broadcast a wanted bulletin for Oswald, over a half hour before Tippit was shot and at a time when there was absolutely no evidence linking Oswald to the assassination. The Dallas police have never been able to explain who transmitted this wanted notice or on what evidence it was based; and the Warren Commission brushed aside the whole matter as unimportant… As I said earlier, the evidence we’ve uncovered leads us to suspect that two men, neither of whom was Oswald, were the real murderers of Tippit.… The critics of the Warren Report have pointed out that a number of witnesses could not identify Oswald as the slayer, that several said the murderer was short and squat, Oswald was thin and medium height, another said that two men were involved. [Beyond the time factor.] The clincher … is that four cartridges were found at the scene of the slaying. Now, revolvers do not eject cartridges, so when someone is shot, you don’t find gratuitous cartridges strewn over the sidewalk, unless the murderer deliberately takes the trouble to eject them. We suspect that cartridges had been previously obtained from Oswald’s .38 revolver and left at the murder site", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:179:32ec5ba9ff15", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 473, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 180, "text": "Oswald was thin and medium height, another said that two men were involved.

We suspect that cartridges had been previously obtained from Oswald’s .38 revolver and left at the murder site by the real killers as part of the setup to incriminate Oswald. However, somebody slipped up there. Of the four cartridges found at the scene, two were Winchesters and two were Remington’s, but of the four bullets found in Officer Tippit’s body, three were Winchesters and one was a Remington! What worries me deeply, and I have seen it exemplified in this case, is that we in America are in great danger of slowly evolving into a proto-fascist state.… Its origins can be traced in the tremendous war machine we’ve built since 1945, the military industrial complex that Eisenhower vainly warned us about … In a very real and terrifying sense, our Government is the CIA and the Pentagon, with Congress reduced to a debating society. Of course, you can’t spot this trend of fascism by casually looking around … the clever manipulation of the mass media is creating a concentration camp of the mind that promises to be far more effective in keeping the populace in line.… The test is what happens to the individual who dissents? The CIA could not face up to the American people and admit that its former employees had conspired to assassinate the president, so from the moment Kennedy’s heart stopped beating the agency attempted to sweep the whole conspiracy under the rug … it has become an accessory after the fact in the assassination. The New York Times 9/11/67, review of the Playboy interview, not its usual grist for the mill, merely noted that Garrison expanded on earlier charges that CIA ex-aides were involved in the assassination. “Garrison rose to at least 7 the number of men he says took direct part in the killing of President Kennedy.… Garrison says the plotters were disturbed by Kennedy’s peace overtures to Cuba.” In November Jim Garrison spoke to the L.A Press Club, though only The L.A. Free Press (The Freep), an independent weekly, printed much of his scathing statement. (11/17/67) He declared a “Fascist cover-up” was continued by constant government lies, destruction of evidence and “blowing up the case.” Garrison challenged the “apathetic” American press to ask as many questions of the government as they had asked about him. Revealing their ties to Dallas officer Joe Cody, Garrison developed the links between Ruby, Oswald, and the Dallas Police. He clarified Oswald’s Armed Forces Russian Test, P.R.T. 21, indicating military training.

Revealing their ties to Dallas officer Joe Cody, Garrison developed the links between Ruby, Oswald, and the Dallas Police. He clarified Oswald’s Armed Forces Russian Test, P.R.T. 21, indicating military training. He closed by pleading to the press “If you ever wished for an opportunity to do something for your profession and do something for your country, then you have such an opportunity … if you can only get interested … Your country needs you now, as it never has before.” Few media outlets rose to the challenge. The L.A. Free Press 11/24/67 also published Raymond Marcus’s work on the Mary Moorman photo of the grassy knoll at the time of the fatal assassination shot. Marcus noted that the Warren Commission neither interviewed Moorman nor presented her photo as evidence. He showed blowups of the picture to professional photographers, and asked if they saw the outline of a man holding a rifle. Many did. By early December 1967 The Saturday Evening Post shifted its stand on the assassination in its review of Six Seconds in Dallas, written by philosophy professor Josiah Thompson. Its editorial called for a new investigation stating it had now been “demonstrated fairly conclusively that the Warren Commission was wrong.” A brief book review in The New Republic, “Return to Dallas” by Alexander Bickel, 12/23/67, surmised the social costs of continued national denial, “it would be a devastating commentary on the American spirit if we were all content to let the matter rest … the Warren Commission … failed to satisfactorily establish the central facts about the awful event.” Bickel found Accessories After the Fact by Sylvia Meagher to be “indiscriminate and unfocused” though he had praised her “welcome” index, published in 1966. Josiah Thompson’s Six Seconds in Dallas was viewed as “pretentious” but useful in carefully exploring the possibility of a frontal shot by analyzing the Zapruder film. Bickel concluded that testimonial evidence had gone stale but “physical evidence is as good as ever” and this could be “fruitfully reinvestigated even now.… The attempt should, however, be made by another official body, for the Warren Commission did not try hard enough.” Life magazine then exercised its proprietary rights to own American history. Life sued its former reporter Josiah Thompson, his publisher Random House, and Bernard Geis Associates, to stop the distribution and sale of his book. Life alleged that its copyright of pictures from the Zapruder film had been violated, and that the film had been “stolen” by Thompson at the instigation of Bernard Geis. The court determined that Life could not claim financial damage since Thompson offered all of the profits", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:181:f110e4c3fd66", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 475, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 182, "text": "magazine then exercised its proprietary rights to own American history.

The court determined that Life could not claim financial damage since Thompson offered all of the profits to Life. So Six Seconds in Dallas was published without the photographic evidence, using instead charcoal drawings of the different frames of the Zapruder film, thus giving America its first view of this compelling evidence. Soon thereafter Life scuttled their investigation of the assassination that they had assigned to editor Richard Billings. Notably, Billings worked with Holland McCombs, formerly of the Office of Naval Intelligence, and a friend of Clay Shaw. Photo researcher Richard Sprague, who was working with Billings, asserted that the Life team was ordered to stop all work on the story. “All of the research files, including the Zapruder film and slides, and thousands of film frames and photographs, were locked up tight.” Billings resigned claiming that he was outraged.45 Two Dallas newspapers may have suppressed potentially significant photo and video evidence. Researcher Richard Sprague asserts that the Dallas Morning News in late 1967 locked up a picture taken by its photographer Jack Beers which showed cartons on the sixth floor “snipers nest” before the Dallas police moved them, and that the Dallas Times Herald pictures taken by their photographer Bob Jackson of the TSBD 6th floor at the time of the assassination, which could have indicated no one in the “snipers nest,” were locked in DTH files in 1968.46 At a press conference in December 1967 Jim Garrison revealed that the FBI had prior knowledge of the assassination attempt. Former FBI security clerk William Walter said that he received a TWX (now Telex) message November 17th, which was directed to all southern regional offices of the FBI regarding the attempt to assassinate President Kennedy. Another TWX came in a few hours later, countermanding the first one. After the assassination, agents “were ordered to resolve the conflicts with the new reports and to destroy old ones.” The FBI stonewalled the press on this matter. Perhaps not coincidentally, three days later Chicago Tribune reporter Russell Freiburg questioned Garrison’s mental capacity. Freiburg was somehow given Garrison’s leaked Army 201 file, which he misreported. When confronted by ex-FBI agent William Turner as to J. Edgar Hoover being the source of the 201 file, Freiburg did not categorically deny it.

Coverage of the Garrison investigation in The New Republic abruptly changed from support in June 1967 to a vicious condemnation in March 1969. Possibly the 1968 appointment of former high ranking CIA agent Robert Myers to the position of publisher explains this reversal. Myers’ career took him from army intelligence to 12 years with the CIA, where for a while he was an aide to William Colby, who later directed the CIA. During the Shaw trial “reporters” James Phelan and Hugh Aynesworth abandoned all guise of being journalists. Phelan appeared as a witness for the defense. Aynesworth helped Shaw’s attorneys by sandbagging the prosecution, obtaining its witness list, and then running background checks to provide information for the defense.47 Drew Pearson, an eminent syndicated columnist who had worked with Jack Anderson, took some of his leads to Chief Justice Earl Warren in 1967. According to revelations from the 1976 Schweiker-Hart Report (Senate Intelligence Subcommittee), Drew Pearson conferred with the Chief Justice about the Roselli-Maheu story regarding CIA-Mafia efforts to assassinate Castro. The Secret Service was then alerted, as was the FBI, although neither agency followed the new leads. Pearson’s actions can perhaps be clarified by reviewing Commission Document 990, which had been suppressed for twelve years. Previously, Pearson had worked with the CIA as a reporter to “interview” Khrushchev regarding his response to President Kennedy’s assassination.48 York Free Press, that “over a period of several weeks, two different emissaries had arrived in New Orleans.… Each had sought out Jim Garrison.… Each stated that he was carrying a message from Robert Kennedy.… Each was known by Garrison to be associated with Kennedy.… Each said that Robert Kennedy did not believe the conclusion of the Warren Commission and agreed with Garrison that a conspiracy had taken the life of his brother.” According to comedian Mort Sahl, who was actively researching and publicly speaking about the case, the message from Bobby Kennedy was “I must wait until I reach the White House … [to] get the guys who killed Jack.” Garrison’s response was that RFK’s only chance was to speak out about the conspiracy, which could delay his enemies from attacking him. RFK’s circle disagreed. Also, conceivably Garrison could uncover and reveal RFK’s role with the CIA’s violent anti-Castro Cubans, and even of RFK’s knowledge of Oswald. This could prove devastating politically and personally. This might also explain RFK’s apparent silence to the “reporting” of his old friend Robert Sheridan.

The day after Christmas 1967, Garrison and Turner appeared at a press conference in the Monteleone Hotel to announce a forthcoming article for Ramparts. Turner returned to his room after the press conference to get some documents but the door had been jammed shut, someone had pushed a chair under the inside doorknob. Through a crack in the door Turner could see a man in a business suit climbing out onto the fire escape. He told chief D.A. investigator Lou Ivon, “We must be getting close … someone out there wants very badly to know what we know.” Pacifica Radio, 12/29/67, ran an hour-long interview with Josiah Thompson, soon after his book Six Seconds in Dallas had been published. Thompson carefully analyzed trajectories, wounds, ballistics to present a compelling case for conspiracy and cover-up. Further, he declared that the assassination was in fact a coup d’état, but that “evidence did not yet support this.”49 In January 1968 Ramparts ran an extensive expose by William Turner, “The Garrison Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy,” which expanded Garrison’s Playboy interview. Again the alternative media significantly deepened the inquiry, and this piece foreshadowed portions of the movie JFK. Garrison was finally humanized as insightfully pragmatic, patriotic, and professional. Progress on reporting the case included: Guy Banister’s links to the CIA, Clay Shaw and the ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence) and CIA; Gordon Novel’s activities for the CIA; clarification regarding Oswald’s statements during a New Orleans radio interview 8/21/63 ; Oswald’s interest in Soviet military deployment as well as “microdots” and spy cameras; connections between Oswald and Clay Shaw; inconsistencies regarding the bullets in the Tippit killing; Rose Cheramie’s statements warning of a pending assassination of President Kennedy; Ruby’s links to certain Dallas policemen including Dallas Police Department’s Joe Cody, who escorted Oswald; the two honks in the Dallas Police Department headquarters prior to Ruby shooting Oswald; as well as Jules Kimble’s statement connecting Ruby to the rightwing Minutemen. By January 1968 it appears that archival files denied to researcher Harold Weisberg were eagerly released to Fred Graham of the New York Times. Graham’s piece in the Times 1/6/68 incorrectly placed responsibility for the suppression of the photographic evidence of the autopsy on the Kennedy clan. In 1972 Graham told Weisberg that the Assistant Archivist Dr. James Rhoads had begged him to request that material through the F.O.I.A.50 NBC invited Jim Garrison to appear on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on 1/31/68, based on an overwhelming audience reaction to a Mort Sahl suggestion on one of his previous shows.

Bobby Kennedy tried to get Carson to withdraw the invitation. “CNN political reporter Jeff Greenfield, who was a young aide at the time, remembers walking into his Senate office and overhearing Bobby Kennedy on the phone. He was telling Carson that Garrison was full of crap.… Don’t believe him, if I thought there was anything to this, I would have done something.”51 The afternoon of his appearance though, NBC attorneys questioned Garrison for several hours in Carson’s offices. On stage Garrison saw that Carson had cards which recorded his answers with responses inserted, hardly an open discussion. During the show, when Garrison tried to show a picture of the three “tramps” being marched off by Dallas police immediately following the assassination, Carson lunged to pull down Garrison’s arm. After disagreeing about whether the pictures would show up on television, Carson again yanked down Garrison’s arm. At this point, the director of the show turned off the cameras. Carson had inadvertently meandered into the ongoing NBC fight with Garrison.52 Garrison also faced the loss of a considerable number of his case files. William Wood, a Garrison investigator, admitted that he had worked with the OSS. He worked previously as a journalist for various newspapers, and in 1967 applied to work for the CIA. According to CIA records he was turned down and soon thereafter worked for Garrison. When the staff became suspicious of Wood toting an oversized briefcase, Garrison asked to meet Wood at Garrison’s home. Wood never showed up. Garrison then visited Wood’s rented apartment and found out from his landlady that he had never stayed at the apartment.53 Playboy February 1968 ran strongly supportive reviews of Sylvia Meagher’s book Accessories After The Fact and Josiah Thompson’s Six Seconds in Dallas. Playboy saw Meagher’s book as “the best of the crop of books and the most chilling in its implications.” Both books clarified “the failure of the Warren Commission to investigate, evaluate – or even acknowledge – the huge body of evidence in its possession indicating the possible presence of more than one gunman … [and] lend weight to widening appeals by Congressmen and the press for an independent new investigation.” Fred Graham’s New York Times Book Review, 2/28/68 , of Six Seconds in Dallas and Accessories After the Fact found it “astonishing” that there was such disbelief “in a document that has the endorsement of some of the highest officials in government.” Graham avowed that “despite", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:185:a0bfc5509ad2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 479, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 186, "text": "the huge body of evidence in its possession indicating the possible presence of more than one gunman … [and] lend weight to widening appeals by Congressmen and the press for an independent new investigation.” Fred Graham’s New York Times Book Review, 2/28/68 , of Six Seconds in Dallas and Accessories After the Fact found it “astonishing” that there was such disbelief “in a document that has the endorsement of some of the highest officials in government.” Graham avowed that “despite the fact that embarrassing gaffes by the Commission and inconsistencies in the evidence have been pointed out, none of the critics have been able to suggest any other explanation which fits the facts better than the Warren Commission’s.” Another New Orleans reporter, Sam DePino of WVUE-TV, fed information to both the FBI and CIA on the Garrison probe. The CIA’s Lloyd Ray noted in a memo that DePino was offering information to the CIA. Ray then discussed DePino with the FBI, who confirmed that DePino had talked to the FBI on many occasions, and was considered “an eager beaver.” After the assassination of Martin Luther King, reporter William Turner wrote in Ramparts about parallels with the JFK assassination. Rifles conveniently left at the crime scene were easily traceable to men with aliases. Immediately police radio reports emanated from unknown sources, they described Oswald, and in the MLK assassination a white Mustang getaway car in what is now known to be a non-existent “police chase.” Purported maps surfaced in Oswald’s possessions with circled points on the parade routes and one was found in “Galt’s” ( James Earl Ray’s alias) car. The FBI also determined that since August 1967 (Ray) had spent about $10, 000 , although no source of income was known. Turner admonished that, “Congress has shown little inclination to take on such a controversial and politically loaded task, and the citizen’s committee might serve as an interim force until public opinion compels Congress to act.” The Saturday Evening Post, 4/6/68, in “Secret Evidence on the Kennedy Assassination” by David Wise, defended the Warren Commission, findings, while blaming the suppression of evidence on Earl Warren. Oswald was portrayed as possibly a KGB operative who might have revealed radar information leading to the first Soviet shoot-down of Gary Powers U-2 spy plane; this incident led to the canceling of the U.S.-Soviet Summit. Powers claimed in his book Operation Over-flight that Oswald’s information allowed the Soviets to down the U-2.

The National Archives somehow estimated that 25,000 pages of Warren Commission files remained classified, and a sampling of the Chief Archivists estimated that “very little would be closed by 1975.” According to author and researcher Harold Weisberg, Assistant National Archivist James Rhoads declassified benign intelligence documents exclusively to Wise. Wise reviewed the declassified transcripts of 11 commission meetings and highlighted: The timing of an interview with Jackie Kennedy; whether the FBI report could be turned over to the CIA; avoiding a subpoena from Ruby’s lawyers; the agreed upon suppression of the autopsy photos from the public record, although Chief Counsel Rankin and Warren could view them. Wise noted that CD 931, Helms’ memo to Hoover on “Lee Harvey Oswald’s access to classified information about the U-2,” remains classified. The memos regarding Oswald in Mexico City remained classified. Chief of Archives, Dr. Robert Bahmer, asserted that nothing in the sealed files “from what I know of the records,” would contradict the Warren Report’s conclusions. Wise admonished that as long as 20% of the Commission’s files remain locked in the Archives, doubts will continue to multiply. The vagueness of classification standards was not questioned. Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach was viewed as proactive, submitting guidelines for declassification on 1/28/65 . The Warren files were to remain closed: when existing law required it; when national security is involved; when disclosure might “be a source of embarrassment to innocent persons.” The CIA was aggressive in distributing anti-Garrison articles. The New Yorker magazine, 7/13/68, ran a fiercely anti-Garrison tract by Ed Epstein. Epstein had worked closely with CIA counterintelligence Chief James Angleton for Inquest, his book on the Warren Commission. A subsequent CIA memo to Chiefs of Staff worldwide cautioned against attacking Garrison personally but provided them with Epstein’s article to “use the article to brief interested contacts.”54 Garrison had doubted Epstein’s credibility but accommodated him for the article. Epstein spent two days in New Orleans but only three hours at Garrison’s office. According to former FBI man Bill Turner, Garrison was heartbroken when the piece was printed. Turner responded in Ramparts, 9/7/68_(i) , where he quoted author Richard Popkin’s reactions to Epstein’s tract: Toward the end of 1968 Garrison tried to legally secure the release of the photos and x-rays. The Justice Dept. under Attorney General Ramsey Clark tried to block this action by releasing a report by a panel of forensic pathologists who had examined the photos and x-rays a year earlier – confirming the medical findings of the Warren Commission. Fred Graham’s supportive coverage of the Panel Report for the New York Times ran on page 1, 1/17/69. But the Panel Report raised new and troubling questions.

The Clark Panel Report differed from the original autopsy report and the Warren Commission testimony regarding the autopsy surgeons – and the fatal head wound had mysteriously moved up about four inches. Researcher Sylvia Meagher brought this to Graham’s attention, but no follow-up story was written.55 The New York Times coverage of the Shaw trial (2/25/69) , as with most of the mass media, buried the lead. Colonel Pierre Finck, an Army pathologist, who assisted with the autopsy of President Kennedy, testified that he had been ordered by one of the generals or admirals at the autopsy to not dissect the President’s neck. This appeared on page 18, six paragraphs into the piece, which was headlined “Kennedy Autopsy Doctor Tells Shaw Jury Shots Came from Rear.’” Dr. Finck testified that he was told that the President’s family wanted no examination of the neck organs. Finck also testified that the autopsy would not meet the standards of the American Board of Pathologists, since it omitted a study of a number of the President’s organs. The two most reliable mainstream sources for covering the Clay Shaw case were the New Orleans Times-Picayune and the New Orleans States-Item. Off the record, the reporters at both newspapers supported Garrison’s investigation, as seen in Plot or Politics by two reporters, Rosemary James and Jack Wardlaw. The average New Orleans citizen was aware of far more than the rest of the country. They had heard of: the justice department delays; CIA payments to Shaw’s lawyers; the FBI search for Shaw under his alias Clay Bertrand even before Dean Andrews mentioned it; that twelve people saw Shaw, Ferrie, and Oswald together on many occasions; and Colonel Pierre Finck’s testimony that during the autopsy he was ordered by an unidentified general not to probe the president’s neck wound. It was only after the final verdict that the papers savagely attacked Garrison in their editorial pages. The mass media reaction to Garrison’s prosecution of Clay Shaw was generally to overlook the many pearls amid the slime. The New York Times accused Garrison of the “prosecution of an innocent man” and called the case “one of the most disgraceful chapters in the history of American jurisprudence” (3/2/69) . Reporter Sydney Zion claimed that Garrison “restored the credibility of the Warren Report.” The New Orleans States-Item, 3/1/69 , demanded that Garrison resign; “…[He was] a man without principle who would pervert the legal process to his own ends.” The cumulative impact on Garrison’s case of federal non-cooperation, FBI spying, files mysteriously disappearing, the loss of key witnesses, FBI and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:188:4b6b9597e156", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 482, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 189, "text": "innocent man” and called the case “one of the most disgraceful chapters in the history of American jurisprudence” (3/2/69) . Reporter Sydney Zion claimed that Garrison “restored the credibility of the Warren Report.” The New Orleans States-Item, 3/1/69 , demanded that Garrison resign; “…[He was] a man without principle who would pervert the legal process to his own ends.” The cumulative impact on Garrison’s case of federal non-cooperation, FBI spying, files mysteriously disappearing, the loss of key witnesses, FBI and CIA media manipulation and significant aid to the defense team, all tarnished Garrison’s image and gutted the case. The leads and implications were startling, but by the time the case got to trial the evidence was fragmentary. The courageous gamble by the out-manned D.A. unearthed vital aspects of the assassination, however, the rapid acquittal of Shaw provided the basis for a mass media response that Garrison lacked a case, and that the Warren Report may have been right. Some reporters and editors knew that promising leads were generated but the political turmoil of the Vietnam War, race relations and cultural change competed for coverage. Citizen researchers emerged divided, with their reputations and momentum diminished. The investigation languished in the media for two more years before even the alternative press would clarify the new information and outline a critical case. Jim Phelan and Hugh Aynesworth, both fiercely anti-Garrison, became in effect special advisors to the defense. They consulted frequently with Shaw’s attorneys, passing along tips.… The two of them, says chief defense attorney F. Irvin Dymond, were “extremely valuable” to the defense case … Aynesworth could have chosen between his twin functions of reporter and participant …Newsweek’s editors should have made the choice for him, to protect their own interests and the interests of the readers. Epstein discussed the single-bullet theory by citing a 1967 CBS inquiry, which had theorized that three jiggles in Zapruder’s files represented reactions by Zapruder to the sound of shots, thus allowing the determination of the timing of the shots. CBS had speculated that the first shot had been fired earlier than the Commission had reasoned likely – at the point where the presidential limousine would have been briefly visible (1/10 second) from the sixth-floor window through the foliage of a large oak tree. “In other words, the President and Governor could have been hit by separate bullets by a single assassin. The CBS analysis which persuasively argues that this was the case renders the single-bullet theory irrelevant.” CBS however, ignored the fact that there were several jiggles in the Zapruder film and five not three, in the frame sequence in question. Life magazine, which owned the original Zapruder film, rejected the “jiggle theory,” attributing all but the most pronounced jiggle that coincided with the headshot, to imperfections in the camera mechanism.

Moreover, CBS did not allege an earlier hit, but an earlier miss. Epstein misrepresented its conclusions. CBS had recognized that an earlier hit meant a steeper trajectory which precluded the throat wound being one of exit and which again implied a fraudulent autopsy report. Epstein dismissed the head movement on the Zapruder film by citing a Justice Department Report in which a panel of forensic pathologists who had studied the sequestered autopsy photos and X-rays had supported the Warren Report. The Clark Panel Report (so-called, after Attorney General Ramsey Clark) however, revealed glaring differences between its findings and the original autopsy such that serious doubts had been raised as to whether the Panel had seen the “genuine” material. Ironically, in September 1969 it was former President Johnson who nearly revealed a useful perspective about the case. In an interview for CBS-TV Johnson remarked, “I don’t think that they [the Warren Commission], or me, or anyone else is absolutely sure of everything that might have motivated Oswald or others that could have been involved. But he was quite a mysterious fellow, and he did have connections which bore examination.” Although this seems a modest understatement, Johnson felt he had said too much, and he asked CBS to withhold this section of the interview on the grounds of “national security.” Although the CBS news department wanted to run this story, the CBS management obliged, and suppressed those statements until 1975.57 Remarkably, in 1969 Nicholas Johnson, a member of the Federal Communication Commission, bluntly declared that: “The networks in particular … are probably now beyond the check of any institution in our society. The President, the Congress of the United States, the FCC, the foundations, and universities are reluctant even to get involved. I think that they may now be so powerful that they’re beyond the check of anyone.”58 By 1969 America was convulsed and bitterly divided over the Vietnam War. Chaotic race relations, as well as the cynicism surrounding the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, amplified anti-government sentiment. The tumultuous times strengthened an already strong rationale for national security for the FBI and CIA to influence the press to dampen the public dissent. Those in power could easily imagine how strongly the country might have reacted to a fair reporting of Garrison’s investigation and its implications. In January 1970 Senator Richard Russell granted an interview to Cox Television to discuss the Warren Report. Russell declared that he “never believed that Lee Harvey Oswald", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:190:0070220a983e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 484, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 191, "text": "Robert Kennedy, amplified anti-government sentiment.

Russell declared that he “never believed that Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President Kennedy without at least some encouragement from others … that’s what a majority of the committee wanted to find. I think someone else worked with him…” The New York Times book reviews by John Leonard, 12/1/70 , on books critical of the Warren Report illustrate their continuing policy. Between the early and late editions the title of the review changed from “Who Killed John F. Kennedy?” to “The Shaw-Garrison Affair.” A paragraph headed “Mysteries Persist” was cut, along with the last 30 lines of the review, which were critical of the Warren Report. This portion includes: Frankly I prefer to believe that the Warren Commission did a poor job, rather than a dishonest one. I like to think that Mr. Garrison invents monsters to explain incompetence. But until somebody explains why two autopsies came to different conclusions about the President’s wounds, why the limousine was washed out and rebuilt without investigation, why certain witnesses near the “grassy knoll” were never asked to testify by the Warren Commission, why we were all so eager to buy Oswald’s brilliant marksmanship in split seconds, why no one inquired into Jack Ruby’s relations with a staggering variety of strange people, why a “loner” like Oswald always had friends and could always get a passport - who can blame the Garrison guerrillas for fantasizing? Something stinks about the whole affair, A Heritage of Stone rehashes the smelliness; the recipe as unappetizing as our doubts about the official version of what happened. Would then – Attorney General Robert Kennedy have endured his brother’s murder in silence? Was John Kennedy quite so liberated from the cold war clichés as Mr. Garrison maintains? But the stench is there and it clings to each of us. Why were Kennedy’s neck organs not examined at Bethesda for evidence of a fatal shot? Why was his body whisked away to Washington before the legally required Texas inquest? Apparently the New York Times did not deem this as “all the news that’s fit to print.” John Leonard was told that a “night editor” felt it [the review] was overly editorial. Leonard was upset and attempted to determine the source of the editing – yet he was never able to find out.

Leonard remarked once to researcher Jerry Policoff in his new position as a book reviewer for the Sunday Times that new books on the JFK assassination were already pre-assigned to others, sometimes to David Belin, Warren Commission counsel, or to Priscilla Johnson McMillan. In January of 1971, popular maverick columnist Jack Anderson revised his earlier reporting regarding his Cuban retaliation theory for the assassination. He clarified the CIA-Mafia assassination plots against Castro, which ostensively prompted the highly risky Cuban response. (1/17 and 1/18) Anderson’s February column about Roselli, from confidential FBI files, identified him as “a top mafia figure” who “handled undercover assignments for the CIA.” Roselli’s lawyers were now “trying to get clemency for their client.” Anderson also mentioned ex-CIA officer William Harvey and CIA contract agent Robert Maheu, the liaison on the CIA-mafia plots of 1960 (plots involving Nixon but not Kennedy). This column “caused a flurry of investigative memos inside the Nixon White House including a warning from one of the White House dirty tricks operatives, Jack Caulfield, that Maheu’s covert activities … with CIA … might well shake loose Republican skeletons from the closet” (P.D. Scott The Assassinations, p. 375). According to journalist Anthony Summers, Attorney General John Mitchell arranged a deal with Maheu that if he stayed quiet on “the entire Castro story,” he would not have to testify before a grand jury on a Las Vegas gambling prosecution. 59 Meanwhile, CBS boldly reported on Pentagon public relations in their documentary “The Selling of the Pentagon.” (2/23/71) . The Congressional reaction deepened mass media caution on national security issues. Following its airing, a Special Investigations Subcommittee of the House of Representatives Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee announced that they would investigate CBS News and the documentary. The committee feared the growing power of the press and subpoenaed the outtakes of the documentary to determine bias. CBS President Frank Stanton refused, calling this an “assault by Congress on the independence of editorial judgment.” The FCC backed CBS. The Committee then pushed for a Congressional vote on contempt of Congress. Although Congress voted that CBS was not in contempt, a chilling message was sent. After an extended media silence on the JFK assassination, Fred Cook in “The Irregulars Take the Field” reassessed the status of assassination investigations in The Nation, 7/19/71. Cook broke new ground on the cases of both President Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., and summarized Congressional caution and citizen activism.

I tried to interest some of these men in the Senate, many of them good friends of mine, in doing something about the Warren Report. I got no response at all, largely, I think, for two reasons: the great regard a lot of these men had for Chief Justice Earl Warren, and the fact that other distinguished members of Congress, like Senator Richard Russell of Georgia, had their reputations on the line – and so nobody wanted to mess with the case. Cook clarified the material from the former Miami Chief of Police, Walter Headley, Jr., regarding the tape-recorded assassination threat from Minuteman Joseph Milteer, which was not included in the Warren Report. He summarized the key points from Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry’s book JFK Assassination File: In August 1971 the small but influential weekly, the Texas Observer, printed a lively exchange between Sylvia Meagher (Accessories After the Fact) and David Belin, a junior counsel for the Warren Commission. The exchange focused on the statements of an Oswald co-worker named Charles Givens. Meagher pointed out that Givens had repeatedly told authorities that he had last seen Oswald on the first floor of the Depository reading a paper, rather than on the sixth floor at 11:45 a.m. as he told Belin. Meagher noted an FBI document quoting Lt. Jack Revill of the Dallas Police Department to the effect that Givens would “probably change his testimony for money.” Belin ignored this contention and attacked “assassination sensationalists” in general. Meagher sent a copy of the exchange to Harrison Salisbury, then the editor of the New York Times op-ed page. Salisbury chose, however, to print a condensed version of only Belin’s Texas Observer piece for their story on the eighth anniversary of the assassination. Belin concluded by proclaiming that “…the Warren Commission Report will stand the test of history for one simple reason: The ultimate truth beyond a reasonable doubt is that Lee Harvey Oswald killed both President Kennedy and Officer Tippit…” Meagher’s repeated efforts to respond were rejected. Ironically, the New York Times was then boldly defending freedom of the press in the Pentagon Papers case. When the FBI stopped the New York Times from printing the Pentagon Papers, the Washington Post took over, then the Boston Globe.

The courageous Dan Ellsberg and Tony Russo distributed the RAND study widely, and 17 newspapers ultimately confronted the government and printed portions of the leaked national security documents. Exposing the history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam during a deeply divisive, failed policy was worthy of a major legal battle, but exposing the assassination of President Kennedy questioned the political legitimacy of government as well as the mass media. Leslie Gelb, who produced and revealed the report, commented, “most of the elected and appointed leaders in the national security establishment felt they had the right – and beyond that the obligation – to manipulate American public opinion in the national interest as they defined it. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black asserted in his concurring opinion on the Pentagon Papers case that, In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors. The government’s power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the government. The press was protected so that is could bare the secrets of government and informs the people.45 Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the Government from deceiving the people. The L.A. Free Press (5/7/71) bluntly declared that Dealey Plaza was an assault on civilian control. “When an assassination has been supported by elements of the federal government an independent investigation is as welcome as a snake dropped inside one’s shirt.… Every possible government agency will be used in the counter attack against the menace presented by an outside agency.” Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo, the DOD and RAND researchers who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the media, triggered the ”Plumbers” unit from the White House to break into Ellsberg’s psychiatrist’s office, with help from the CIA’s Office of Security. Further, Ellsberg was friendly with Frances FitzGerald, the author of Fire in the Lake, a critical history of Vietnam, and the daughter of the late Desmond FitzGerald, a former deputy director of the CIA. Desmond FitzGerald had coordinated the anti-Castro plots in 1963, as well as directing his special affairs staff to follow Lee Harvey Oswald.62 The allegation that the Kennedy family had suppressed autopsy photos resurfaced in Fred Graham’s front page exclusive, in the New York Times, 1/9/72.

According to Harold Weisberg, Fred Graham said that Assistant National Archivist Rhoads had told him that a urologist and right-wing fanatic Dr. John Lattimer, J.Edgar Hoover’s doctor, had been allowed to view the autopsy photos. Lattimer’s perspective is seen in World Medical News, 3/13/70, where he declared “Oswald showed what the educated, modern-day, traitorous guerrilla can do among his own people…” This story reads: The family of President Kennedy … previously allowed only representatives of the government to inspect pictures and X -rays of the assassinated leader’s body.… Lattimer … said that they “eliminate any doubt completely about the validity of the Warren Commission’s conclusion the Lee Harvey Oswald fired all the shots that struck the president.… The 65 x -rays, color transparencies and black and white negatives taken in the autopsy have been the focus of controversy because the Kennedy family previously guarded them so closely that they were not allowed to be seen even by members and staff officials of the Warren Commission… The preserved brain of President Kennedy, plus microscopic slides of tissues removed from his bullet wounds, have been withheld, apparently by the Kennedy family from the assassination evidence in the National Archives … [Dr. Wecht] asserted that questions about President Kennedy’s wounds would remain unanswered so long as these objects were not available for examination. Interviews with Government officials and President Kennedy’s personal secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, disclosed that the slides and probably the brain, which was removed from the body in the autopsy in 1963 and was placed in container of formalin, were delivered in a locked chest to a representative of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1965. When the autopsy materials were placed in the National Archives in 1966 by Burke Marshall, a representative of the Kennedy family, the brain and possibly some of the other items were not included. Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein observed that in 1972 when he started covering Watergate there were about 2,000 reporters in Washington, yet only 6 were assigned to cover Watergate full time. And even the Post chose not to explore CIA complicity to any extent, even though all of the Plumbers had CIA connections. Through 1972 and 1973 the presidential election, the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal commanded the attention of the nation and the media. In the July 1973 Atlantic LBJ revealed more about the JFK assassination.

He declared, “I never believed Oswald acted alone, although I can accept that he pulled the trigger.… We have been running a damned Murder Inc. in the Caribbean.” A little-noticed article in the November 1973 edition of Esquire regarding Life publisher C. D. Jackson was revealing. Richard Stolley, the editorial director of all Time, Inc. magazines and the purchaser of the Zapruder film, claimed that “…Jackson was so upset by the head wound sequence that he proposed the company obtain all rights to the film and withhold it from the public viewing at least until emotions had calmed…” So even a decade after the assassination, the frames of the Zapruder film had not yet been printed in sequence. Meanwhile, a film exploring the assassination of President Kennedy, Executive Action, opened amid controversy. Several television stations refused to show trailers for the film, and very few movie theaters showed it. Critics Mark Lane and Donald Freed wrote the story along with consultants Penn Jones and David Lifton. The screenplay was written by Dalton Trumbo. It was told in a semi-documentary style, through the perspective of the conspirators, by focusing on a Texas oil baron and a former CIA black ops specialist. The movie was pulled from theaters before Christmas that year. The gamut of psychological warfare coupled with federal non-cooperation, bugging and stealing files, along with the murder of key witnesses, had effectively decimated Garrison’s investigation. Like Hemingway’s great fish in the Old Man and the Sea, not much was left after the fight. Elements of the mass media shielded FBI spying, and gave assistance to Clay Shaw’s attorneys. FBI and CIA mass media assets diminished Garrison’s legitimacy. CIA memos to selected media assets influenced their critiques. Government biases from both AP and UPI impacted mass media coverage. Negative network specials at NBC and CBS, spun in part by CIA, NSA and FBI assets, reached wide audiences. The investigation of CBS by the Congressional Special Investigative Subcommittee of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee deepened media caution on national security. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis wrote in the landmark case Olmstead vs. U.S. (1928) that “our government is the potent omnipresent teacher. For good or ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for the law … it invites anarchy…” Garrison, the critics and the alternative media had unearthed considerable new evidence and leads but fell short of critical mass.

The trial muddied the waters for mainstream journalists on the case for a few years, although a number of new critical books on the assassination found publishers. Meanwhile, other issues dominated the national attention. For a couple of years only Ramparts, The Nation and The Realist, along with Mae Brussell’s radio show World Watchers International (out of Oklahoma) continued to regularly critique the Warren Report. Due to the divisive and unending Vietnam War and Watergate, the institutions of national security become more accessible to Congressional and mass media review, but that access, as well as media assertiveness, was short-lived. Nevertheless, most media historians view this period as a golden age of journalism, one less compromised by the corporate pressures for profits than in the upcoming consolidation of media ownership. he assassinations in the 1960s, the Vietnam War, urban riots and the Watergate scandal severely diminished trust in government as well as official history. After Watergate, the mass media appeared to have finally ascended to the role envisioned by our Founding Fathers. In late 1973 New York Times columnist Tom Wicker observed, “In the last few news conferences, for the first time in my experience, the press has sudden ly become what it has touted itself to be all these years–an adversary.” This new role surfaced in Seymour Hersh’s extensive series on CIA abuses of power, which the New York Times ran from late December 1973 through February of 1974. While these CIA stories reverberated, elite elements of society, including much of the mass media, thought Hersh had gone too far. Senator J. William Fulbright, a staunch critic of the Vietnam War, declared in the Columbia Journalism Review that the “inquisition psychology” of journalists should end, and that “voluntary restraint” was needed to reaffirm the “social contract.”1 William Greider, a progressive editor with the Washington Post, wrote “There is a story wish all over town, a palpable feeling that it would be nice if somehow this genie could be put back in the bottle. It is a nostalgic longing for the easy consensual atmosphere which once existed among contending elements in Washington.” Ben Bradlee, after retiring from editing the Washington Post observed, “I think the press was appalled at what had happened as a result of Nixon, it was not clear that the press wanted that power. Many editors cautioned, ‘Let’s watch out for the reporters who try to act like Woodward and Bernstein’.”2 This short-lived adversarial phase impacted the mass media coverage of the assassination of President Kennedy – but it faded almost", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:197:11b77d6bb9e9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 491, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 198, "text": "which once existed among contending elements in Washington.” Ben Bradlee, after retiring from editing the Washington Post observed, “I think the press was appalled at what had happened as a result of Nixon, it was not clear that the press wanted that power. Many editors cautioned, ‘Let’s watch out for the reporters who try to act like Woodward and Bernstein’.”2 This short-lived adversarial phase impacted the mass media coverage of the assassination of President Kennedy – but it faded almost as fast as it came. The death of the feared J. Edgar Hoover coupled with the excesses of the FBI and CIA during Watergate opened some political space for the mainstream media to explore FBI connections to the assassination, as well as call for a new investigation. The Senate Intelligence Committee tasked a subcommittee to review the Warren Commission findings, which opened new leads, bolstering calls for a new investigation, as well as for the Senate Intelligence Committee (the so-called Church Committee) to investigate the CIA. Mainstream media coverage of the assassination cautiously widened in many outlets and chipped away at the flaws in the Warren Report. Meanwhile, the alternative media, led sometimes by tabloids or adult magazines, pushed further and theorized more. A complicated case became more problematic, murky and ominous. Relentless and better organized citizen critics, along with some elements of the media, revealed important lines of inquiry. The confluence of these forces pushed the House of Representatives to reinvestigate the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King in the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The National Tattler, a tabloid, devoted most of their November 1973 issue to assassination coverage. The lead article by James Kerr, also a staff writer for WBAP-TV Dallas-Fort Worth included witness Howard Brennan’s changed stories, James Tague’s wound; Dallas policeman Roger Craig’s account of Oswald running from the TSBD to a honking station wagon; Eugene Brading’s arrest, Mafia-oil links and listed more witnesses saying shots came from the grassy knoll. They lamented, “if only the Warren Commission could have acted like the Watergate investigation.” Jury, defending the Warren Commission findings. Harrison Salisbury, the New York Times editor who encouraged Belin to write the book, wrote a laudatory introduction. The book was glowingly reviewed for the New York Times Book Review, 11/15/73 by, of all people, George and Priscilla Johnson-McMillan. Four days later, witting CIA asset Priscilla McMillan creatively psychologized in the New York Times that the reason people cling to conspiracy theories is that Oswald had committed symbolic patricide. She asserted that since we all subconsciously want to kill our fathers we believe in conspiracy “as a defense, a screen, a barrier, against having to hold those feelings in ourselves.”3 Ramparts bluntly bolstered the critics, “It is clear that a reopening of the assassination investigation is in order.”4 The secret release of the Zapruder film from Time-Life Inc., which was optically enhanced", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:198:03900a5ee128", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 492, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 199, "text": "York Times that the reason people cling to conspiracy theories is that Oswald had committed symbolic patricide.

One was Billy Kemp, a WWII fighter pilot and the other feared to go on the record. Cooper’s wife and his attorney do not think suicide was the case.”5 The New York Times reached out to Warren Commission lawyer David Slawson regarding an FBI memo three years before the assassination that an “imposter might be using Oswald’s birth certificate.” Slawson then attacked the CIA, on the record in the Times, for not sharing more documents with the Warren Commission. A few days later Slawson got a strange and threatening call from James Angleton, former CIA Counterintelligence Chief, stating that the CIA needed Slawson’s continuing help as a “partner … we hope that you will remain a friend.”6 Finally, on March 6, 1975, an optically enhanced version of the Zapruder film was shown on the ABC-TV show Goodnight America hosted by Geraldo Rivera. Robert Groden, activist Dick Gregory and Rivera successfully lobbied for the Zapruder film to be aired on ABC. Rivera threatened, “It was one of those things where I said (to ABC), ‘It gets on or I walk.” ABC relented, but only after Rivera signed a waiver accepting sole financial responsibility if Time or the Zapruder family sued.7 Rivera thought that Time-Life did not sue because they “were blown away by the [positive] reaction to the program.” A New York Review article, 4/3/75 , explored the CIA pictures purported to be of Oswald during his visit to Mexico City in October 1963.

In “The CIA and the Man Who Was Not Oswald,” researchers Bernard Fensterwald and George O’Toole examined the stated FBI and CIA positions regarding the pictures of Oswald outside of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, which clearly were not pictures of Oswald. They revealed Warren Commission dialogue regarding the difficulty of clarifying records on intelligence assets, the “terribly bad character of some agents,” and the need to become less dependent on the FBI for the investigation.8 Fensterwald and O’Toole proposed a Congressional investigation, and then issued a clarion call for the press to cover the case. Without pressure from the press, government officials generally do little. Recall that, Attorney General Richard Kleindienst had promised that the Justice Department would attack the Watergate scandal with the most extensive, thorough and complete investigation since the assassination of President Kennedy. The Justice Department, ironically, prosecuted no further than Gordon Liddy. Some elements of the press didn’t accept the official truth as the whole truth. The Washington Post pursued the story and subsequently so did the rest of the national press, until reluctantly, Congress acted. Ron Kessler did a recent story knocking down the second gun theory in the Robert Kennedy assassination and nuts from both coasts were all over me. Letters, telegrams, phone calls, personal visits, I’ve been up to my ass in lunatics.… Back in 1965 Russ Wiggins, the man I replaced here at the Washington Post told me there would never be an end to this story [the JFK assassination]. He said unless you can find someone who wants to devote his life to it, forget it.9 On April 24, 1975, CBS finally aired their 1969 interview with Lyndon Johnson regarding the Warren Commission. Johnson did not rule out foreign involvement. “I don’t believe that the Warren Commission, or I, or anyone else is absolutely sure of everything that might have motivated Oswald or others that could have been involved.” Developing leads remained problematic, as seen by the reaction of how CIA Director Richard Helms exited the Rockefeller Commission hearings on CIA attempts to assassinate foreign leaders. Schorr had broadcast some stories about CIA-mafia assassination conspiracies and sought comment from Helms outside of the hearing room (4/28/75) . The generally reserved Helms screamed, “You son-of-a-bitch! You killer! You cocksucker! Killer Schorr-that’s what they ought to call you.”10 Despite LBJ’s statement, as well as the range and clarity of the critics, the L.A. Times still staunchly supported the Warren Commission. “Kennedy Conspiracy Discounted” by W.

Times still staunchly supported the Warren Commission. “Kennedy Conspiracy Discounted” by W. David Slawson and Richard Mosk, 5/11/75, psychologized that, “The conspiracy theory persists partly because some persons find it difficult to believe that such a momentous act could be done so capriciously, and by such an insignificant, hapless man …” “The evidence ‘supporting Oswald’s guilt is overwhelming’. Thus a reopening of the inquiry would not serve any useful purpose.” Some mainstream sources adopted a different perspective, particularly regarding the FBI after the death of J. Edgar Hoover. In late spring of 1975 the Dallas Times Herald received information concerning an alleged visit to the Dallas FBI office by Lee Harvey Oswald, about ten days prior to the assassination. The FBI had covered up this incident. Apparently Oswald had left an envelope containing a note after asking for an FBI agent by name, and that after Oswald was murdered, the letter had been destroyed. Publisher Tom Johnson decided to delay publication until he had checked the story with FBI director Clarence Kelly. The day after the meeting, 7/8, the Attorney General was advised, “the Bureau failed to develop any information indicating Oswald had ever visited an FBI office in Dallas or that he had left a note.” Senator Richard Schweiker (R-Pa) Chair of the Intelligence Committee, however, had subsequent interviews with FBI personnel, who confirmed: 1) Oswald visited the Dallas FBI office; 2) Oswald asked to see FBI Agent James Hosty; 3) a note was left for Hosty; and 4) the note was destroyed after the assassination. The Schweiker Report determined that the FBI internal investigation was unable to establish either whether the note was threatening in nature or who directed the note to be destroyed. In the wake of Watergate the U.S. News & World Report, 6/2/75, asserted the need to reopen an investigation of the assassination by exploring the newly uncovered evidence raised by Senator Schweiker. “The increased cynicism of Watergate, the Vietnam War and the revelations about CIA operations has made both officials and the American public more inclined to accept a conspiracy as possible.” The report concluded by noting that many Americans will now be “watching what the Senate does with his [Schweiker’s] idea.”11 Eugene Brading (aka Jim Braden), arrested minutes after the assassination in the Dal-Tax building, was tied to mafia and oil interests. Jack Ruby’s ties to Dallas mafia boss Joe Civello were indicated by one of Ruby’s piano players.

Jack Ruby’s ties to Dallas mafia boss Joe Civello were indicated by one of Ruby’s piano players. Golz also mentioned the Phil Willis’ picture of a man who looks just like Ruby in front of the TSBD after the assassination. Golz argued “The Warren Commission had enough evidence to make a strong case for a mafia assassination of President John F Kennedy.” Another tabloid, National Star, pushed to revive the investigation with an article “10 Questions to still be answered on the JFK assassination.” 6/21/75 . Warren Commission lawyer, now Judge Burt Griffin stated, “I don’t think that the Dallas Police or the FBI told us the entire truth.” Congressman Stewart McKinney (R-Conn) declared, “There are just too many questions in the minds of too many people.” According to a Gallop Poll 78% of the American people no longer believed in the Warren Commission. At the end of June 1975, the CBS Evening News ran a short piece by Daniel Schorr about the relationship between the CIA and Oswald. An unidentified ex-CIA agent asserted that he saw an interview report from a re-defector from the Soviet Union. This re-defector was identified as a former Marine, and he was returning to the U.S. with his family. The contents of the memo dealt mainly with intelligence at the Minsk radio plant. Schorr: CBS News has waited a week for the CIA to check on this report of a possible Oswald contact. The agency now says it did interview a redefector in 1962, a case very similar to Oswald, but an ex-Navy man, not an ex-Marine, who worked in a plant in another Soviet City, not Minsk. The Navy says it found no record of such a man … The Dallas Times Herald, 8/31/75, broke the story of Oswald’s note to Hosty on the uncorroborated testimony of a receptionist at the FBI who somehow read a “partly visible” note, in an unsealed envelope that Oswald wrote. She claimed that Oswald had written “I will blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you don’t stop bothering my wife.” Other headlines and articles in the September Dallas Times Herald also characterized Oswald’s nature as violent – “FBI destroyed the threat note from Oswald” and “Note from Oswald threatened to bomb FBI.” The purported reasons for destroying evidence, which would have bolstered the lone nut thesis, went unexplained. The New York Times, for a change, took the lead and briefly probed the role at the Dallas FBI. It was easier to investigate the FBI after Hoover’s death than to probe the CIA’s role during Congressional hearings.

It was easier to investigate the FBI after Hoover’s death than to probe the CIA’s role during Congressional hearings. Just two days later, they noted that FBI agent Hosty’s immediate superior, Gordon Shanklin, asked Dallas Police Chief Jessie Curry not to disclose Hosty’s previous dealings with Oswald. Chief Curry agreed to “sit on” the information, and only disclosed Shanklin’s request after the New York Times broke the story. By September 17, 1975, the New York Times cited an unnamed source who asserted that the decision to destroy the note came from FBI Director Hoover. The same week, also citing unnamed sources, Time named John Mohr, former FBI administrative chief, and his aides as responsible. Kennedy family and he broke down in tears recounting his feelings and actions in Dealey Plaza. Convulsing with emotion, Hill lamented that he had not taken the fatal head shot instead of Kennedy. Ironically, Hill, riding in the follow-up car, disregarded orders and bravely raced to the presidential limousine to push Jackie Kennedy safely back in. Only years later did researcher Vince Palamara discover that the Secret Service had ordered that no agents were to ride on the running boards of the presidential limousine or at the rear of the car. Other areas of the Secret Service non-compliance with their policies and procedures or their role in the Warren Commission investigation went unexplored. Congress finally decided to investigate the CIA, while the mass media widened its examination of the FBI. However, key elements of the mass media rejected a thorough investigation of the CIA. Initially the mass media supported the hearings, led by conservative but independent Republican Congressman Otis Pike; however, when the State Department was probed, support not only immediately vanished – Pike was quickly castigated as a “McCarthyite.” Kissinger’s close friend, James Reston, the well known New York Times columnist, phoned the chief counsel of the Pike committee and bellowed “What the hell are you guys doing down there? Are you reviving McCarthyism?” A New York Times editorial referred to Pike as “hip shooting toward some high noon in a federal courtroom.” Another editorial ‘Neo-McCarthyism?’ declared that the investigation was “clearly contrary to the national interest.” (10/19/75). The L.A. Times also invoked the image of McCarthyism; and the Tulsa Daily World called Pike “a small minded egotist.” Even the Washington Post saw Pike’s committee as irresponsible: Journalistic challenges regarding national security reporting were partly revealed by the experiences of New York Times reporter Nicholas Horrock. Horrock tentatively questioned the Warren Commission access to information, after communicating", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:203:43774ee2c3e9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 497, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 204, "text": "high noon in a federal courtroom.” Another editorial ‘Neo-McCarthyism?’ declared that the investigation was “clearly contrary to the national interest.” (10/19/75). The L.A.

Horrock tentatively questioned the Warren Commission access to information, after communicating with the CIA, in an article “The Warren Commission Didn’t Know Everything.” In respectful tones he noted that the withholding of evidence by the FBI and CIA left gaps in the “encyclopedic” work of the Warren Commission. “No one is suggesting these new inquiries will change the commission’s conclusion … [but] the age of trust in government ended in the months after John Kennedy’s death. That might be a good point at which to restore credibility.” The omission of CIA assassination plots to the Warren Commission kept it from giving “far greater attention to the question of whether Oswald was part of the retaliation plot [from Cuba].” Horrock accepted the FBI acknowledgment that “a letter from Oswald was delivered to the Bureau ten days before Kennedy was shot, in which he threatened to blow up the Dallas police headquarters, was withheld from the Warren Commission and then destroyed. The destruction was reportedly ordered by J. Edgar Hoover.” Nick Horrock called again on the Oswald theory. He said he didn’t want to barter like a fish peddler and then proceeded to do just that. He said they would be willing to leave out the Mexico source if we did give them a verbatim transcript of what was said. I told him that was undoubtedly out of the question. That we might be able to characterize the type of contract that was involved. Horrock said that two people who knew about the conversations said that the embarrassment to the CIA was that we never told the FBI of former defectors contact with one of the embassies prior to the assassination of John Kennedy. This is clearly wrong for contact with the Soviet embassy was brought to the attention of the FBI and this is clear in the proposed press release. Finally, Horrock said that he had been told that the information had only been told to Lee Rancon [sic] and he had not gone to the members of the Warren Commission. DDO’s file indicates that Chief Justice Warren and members of the Commission came out to headquarters and among other things had access to the Oswald 201 file. In late 1975, The New York Times Magazine reverted to its staunch support for the Warren Commission and assigned James Phelan to write an overview of the assassination. In “The Assassination That Will Not Die” Phelan referred to Kennedy’s backward head snap as a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:204:a751430df59d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 498, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 205, "text": "not gone to the members of the Warren Commission.

In “The Assassination That Will Not Die” Phelan referred to Kennedy’s backward head snap as a neuromuscular reaction; he again defended the single-bullet theory, and called the early Warren Report critics a “housewives’ underground.”13 The adult magazine Gallery, 10/75, published a solid critique of the Warren Commission, “The Guns of Dallas” by Colonel Fletcher Prouty. After Prouty’s book The Secret Team, which pointed to a CIA-military role in the assassination, was published by Ballantine, he was still having difficulty finding publishers to print his articles. Although previously he had been published in The Nation, The New Republic and Air Force Magazine, now he was reliant on Gallery. Not only did the Secret Service disregard experienced and qualified assistance from the Armed Forces, but also they did not act in accordance with their own regulation … William McKinney, a former member of the crack 112th Military Intelligence Group at 4th Army Headquarters, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, has revealed that both Col. Maximillian Reich and his deputy Lt. Col. Joel Cabaza, protested violently when they were told to “stand down” rather than report their units for duty in augmentation of the Secret Service in Dallas. All the Secret Service had to do was nod and these units (which had been trained at the Army’s top Intelligence school at Camp Holabird, Maryland) would have preformed their normal function of protection for the President in Dallas.14 The journalistic challenges faced by CBS reporters echo those of Nicolas Horrock, and declassified documents prove revealing regarding the CBS Twelfth Anniversary Special. In September of 1975 CBS-TV reporters Dan Rather and Bruce Hall explored the nature of the FBI’s relationship with Oswald. A known FBI informer, Orest Pena, who had worked with FBI Agent Warren de Brueys in New Orleans, charged that he had seen Oswald and de Brueys together at a restaurant. He further claimed that de Brueys “threatened” him into giving false testimony to the Warren Commission. Allegedly de Brueys said, “If you ever talk about me I will get rid of your ass.” de Brueys, however, denied all of Pena’s allegations. Former FBI clerk William Walter was carefully questioned by CBS about the FBI memo to all offices giving advance warning of assassination threats. CBS-TV pursued CIA connections to Oswald in a more collegial manner according to documents of meetings and correspondence between Dan Rather and Les Midgely and DCI William Colby. At a meeting on September 3rd Rather and Midgely covered “a variety of matters” which CBS planned to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:205:baa78f5db1c2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 499, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 206, "text": "of your ass.” de Brueys, however, denied all of Pena’s allegations.

At a meeting on September 3rd Rather and Midgely covered “a variety of matters” which CBS planned to pursue in its upcoming series The Assassins. This meeting appears to have conformed with the CBS Procedures Handbook, which states that prior to interviews the questions cannot be divulged, however, areas of inquiry can be discussed. Colby reiterated “that the CIA had no contact with Oswald either during his Russian period or afterwards, that the CIA’s only records of Oswald came from our being aware of his visits to embassies in Mexico City, which information was made available to the Warren Commission…” Colby’s memo to the CIA hierarchy continued: We discussed Allan Dulles’ comments about whether an intelligence agent could ever be exposed, but we left on the final comment by Mr. Dulles that he believed Mr. Hoover’s comments on this matter, which Mr. Rather said he probably would himself at the time. I said that this in no way indicated a desire by Mr. Dulles to conceal any CIA activity. Mr. Rather also said that Mr. Helms had become somewhat agitated over the Garrison allegations, and I said that was easily explained by Mr. Helms’ concern that such false allegations be made of the CIA… With respect to Oswald’s one appearance in our records, I explained that the CIA might well have shied off from any interview with him if there was an indication of prior FBI interest. As for the military, I said the Interagency Source Register did not indicate Mr. Oswald was a clandestine source and that DCS Joint Debriefing Program with the military services from 1953 on would probably have indicated any military debriefing for intelligence purposes, but none appear in our files, so I believe none had been conducted. From their attitude, I believe there is a chance that the program will indicate that there is no CIA connection with Oswald beyond that noted above. This could make a contribution to knocking down the paranoia belief to the contrary. We must, however, insure that Mr. Rather does not learn anything, which could cause the slightest doubt on the above account before he produces the programs in November. 15 A note, 10/1/75, from Rather to Colby requested a response to filmed accusations of a CIA role in the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., while noting Colby’s explicit denials of a CIA role.

There was an internal CIA memo regarding the upcoming interview with Rather, which was sent from Angus Thuermer, Assistant to DCI, to Colby, 10/21/75. Thuermer, a former AP reporter, stated that his office had been called on 10/17 by CBS reporter Daniel Schorr, and that Schorr had been told by Colby that Colby “would look into the possibility of declassifying and giving to him a memo in the file that indicated back in 1962 that the CIA did not interview Lee Harvey Oswald because the FBI was handling the case. Wanted to remind Colby of this.” Thuermer admonished: Did the CIA not debrief him when he came back from Russia? This seems almost unbelievable to CBS that we didn’t. Midgely is aware that you have said we did not and believes you. He also believes that the FBI did debrief him; CBS is working on getting the agent who debriefed him on the tube. Nevertheless Rather will ask about this for the show. Were either Thuermer or Midgely directed to further clarify the questions? Did Midgely, in an effort to be cooperative, allow himself to be co-opted again? This procedure seems consistent with his efforts during the 1967 CBS documentary when Midgely communicated with Warren Commissioner John McCloy through McCloy’s daughter Ellen, an assistant producer, prior to the airing in 1967. The November 1975 two-part CBS special “The American Assassins” hosted by Dan Rather, essentially paralleled their previous conclusions on the JFK assassination. After six months of investigation the first of the CBS Reports Inquiry presented a number of questionable specialists who consistently omitted critical information. The second program went further and touched on Oswald’s intelligence ties but chose to omit any discussion of Jack Ruby, his ties to the mafia, FBI, Dallas police, Cuba and possibly Oswald. Yet the previous spring 60 Minutes had spent two months researching a segment “The Oswald-Ruby Connection,” and while it was canceled, the research was supposedly made available to the Reports Inquiry team. Dr. James Weston, the president-elect of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, asked by CBS to analyze Kennedy’s wounds, is the only recent Academy president still satisfied with the original Warren Commission conclusions about two shots striking from the rear.

Dr. Alfred Oliver, called on by CBS to uphold the controversial belief that a single bullet could emerge unscathed after hitting both Kennedy and John Connally, was actually a veterinarian at Edgewood Arsenal. The Warren Commission, as well as the Rockefeller Commission has called his lone approving voice the gospel on CIA activities, and now CBS. Former CBS editor Bob Richter, who resigned from the 1967 CBS assassination special, noted that the latest CBS effort “seems a form of unusual advocacy journalism. Especially the first program … they should have said, here’s the evidence and here’s what the experts say – experts who disagree. A third conclusion ought to have been considered for the evidence: not proven.” Both Wecht and Thompson privately wondered if the script didn’t undergo last minute editing from CBS higher-ups. After calling him twice to go over word for word what Rather would say about Wecht’s statements, Wecht says CBS then “cut the heart of my presentation.” Senator Russell’s critiques of CBS’ version of the single-bullet theory and the fatal shot were also somehow omitted. CBS refuted the doubters on this issue by claiming it was impossible to tell precisely how Kennedy and Connally were sitting when struck. This time the network chose to use the temporary obstruction of the freeway sign in the Zapruder film to make it’s point. If the men change position in that time frame, CBS said, the strange trajectory could have occurred. Had CBS consulted available films taken from other angles, it would have been obvious that neither man moved in that less-than-a-second interval to allow the otherwise impossible flight of the so-called “magic bullet.” The program’s experts also maintained that a slight visible movement on Connally’s part right after Kennedy was hit indicates that the same bullet is striking him. Josiah Thompson and Dr. Wecht painstakingly showed CBS how, more than a second later in the Zapruder frames, Connally clearly reacts – his right shoulder collapsing, cheeks puffing, and hair dislodged. Connally’s own doctors believe that is the momentum of a bullet hitting him, while the earlier movement is a startled reaction to hearing a shot hit Kennedy. Connally agreed. In fact, he told that to CBS in an earlier interview where he also stated his feeling that all the shots did come from the rear. CBS chose to use the latter segment but eliminated Connally’s remarks about different bullets. CBS also eliminated Dr. Wecht’s discussion of the implausibility of the single bullet’s remarkably pristine condition, if indeed it could do what the Warren", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:208:8b5d2fb935bc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 502, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 209, "text": "while the earlier movement is a startled reaction to hearing a shot hit Kennedy.

CBS also eliminated Dr. Wecht’s discussion of the implausibility of the single bullet’s remarkably pristine condition, if indeed it could do what the Warren Commission claimed. Not one scientist has ever come up with a bullet in such good condition in simulated experiments with cadavers. Yet CBS took the word of veterinarian Alfred Oliver that it could happen. CBS asserted that Itek’s image enhancement technique (of the Zapruder film) claims to show a perceptible forward movement of Kennedy’s head before the backward “reaction” sets in. If so, it was invisible in CBS’ rendering. CBS backed this up with the hypothesis that Jacqueline Kennedy may have inadvertently pushed her husband backward. This is nonsense, since the film shows no reaction on Mrs. Kennedy’s part until ten frames after the fatal shot. Recall that Itek was run by former CIA officer Franklin Lindsey, who had worked closely with Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner. Itek Corporation had helped build the CORONA spy satellite system. For further evidence Dan Rather asserted that the greater portion of the president’s brain matter flew forward, indicating once again a shot from the rear. Almost every witness in the motorcade contradicts this statement. Both policemen riding behind the limousine were splattered, one so hard he thought he’d been shot, and two skull fragments also went flying backward. Only a small amount of debris flew in front of the limousine. The second program, which dealt with Oswald’s relationships, failed to discuss Jack Ruby. Why, in interviewing ex-CIA official Victor Marchetti, didn’t CBS ask about the meeting he attended in 1968 with then-director Richard Helms? At the height of Jim Garrison’s conspiracy investigation in New Orleans, Marchetti recalls Helms conceding that Garrison’s two principle figures – accused conspirators Clay Shaw and David Ferrie – were indeed once CIA contact employees. The Garrison probe wasn’t mentioned once by CBS.… But the one startling revelation – an interview with Robert McKeown [mafia ties and gun running] about Oswald approaching him, to buy four high-powered rifles – wasn’t pursued very far…17 In the wake of Watergate, the New York Times and particularly the Washington Post pushed deeper than in the past on the twelfth anniversary. The Times cautiously focused on Warren Commission counsel David Belin’s comments to Congress. He called for a reinvestigation primarily to “contribute toward a rebirth in confidence and trust in government.” Belin believes that “the bulk of the criticism of the commission is unfounded and “many of the most extreme and vocal critics have deliberately misrepresented the overall record of evidence.” Belin also", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:209:632a07cd35fa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 503, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 210, "text": "New York Times and particularly the Washington Post pushed deeper than in the past on the twelfth anniversary.

Anson, a political correspondent for New Times and a public television producer in New York, chronicled JFK’s conflict with the CIA and noted that they had never been investigated regarding the assassination. CIA bitterness built over a range of issues: the Bay of Pigs fiasco; deep disagreement with the President’s policies to normalize relations with Cuba combined with the “banning of atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons; accommodation with Communists in Laos; to the reevaluation of the entire American commitment in Southeast Asia.… A thousand advisors were to be called home by the end of the year … a clear sign of where Kennedy was heading.… Kennedy was potentially [the CIA’s] most dangerous adversary … the CIA had a motive, It had the means. It had the experience. It had the disposition. The agency could have killed him, and far better than anyone else covered its crime.” Anson speculated that Oswald could have gone rogue, which was possible with “bright, tough, competitive guys … trained to win.” Oswald’s mafia connections to Banister, Marcello, Ferrie and Shaw further created a confluence of interests. “The two most secret and powerful organizations in America working hand in glove… that [CIA/ mafia differences] had ceased to be a distinction… the key to understanding John Kennedy’s murder.”18 Perhaps Anson’s piece nudged the New York Times toward printing Jerry Policoff ’s probe of the evidence in “A Critic’s View of the Warren Commission Report” (12/8/75). Policoff noted that “Recent disclosures show that both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency systematically withheld evidence from the commission, and declassified executive session transcripts tell of untenable circumstances under which the commission operated.” Policoff cogently clarified why the former commission staffers were mistaken since the evidence available to them “weaves a fabric pointing unavoidably toward conspiracy.” He recapped the missing evidence: the views of the majority of witnesses regarding the location of the shots: the backward reaction of the President’s head [when he was hit]; the doctors at Parkland Hospital seeing an apparent entrance wound; Oswald’s poor marksmanship; the disparity between the President’s back wound and the holes in his shirt", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:210:962f4c47fb38", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 504, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 211, "text": "commission operated.” Policoff cogently clarified why the former commission staffers were mistaken since the evidence available to them “weaves a fabric pointing unavoidably toward conspiracy.” He recapped the missing evidence: the views of the majority of witnesses regarding the location of the shots: the backward reaction of the President’s head [when he was hit]; the doctors at Parkland Hospital seeing an apparent entrance wound; Oswald’s poor marksmanship; the disparity between the President’s back wound and the holes in his shirt and jacket; the time necessary to fire the rifle; and the impossibility of one bullet causing seven wounds and remaining unscratched.19 Itek, a photo-analysis corporation hired to examine the frames of the original Zapruder Film, is a Rockefeller company that gets 60 percent of its contracts with the government. Mainly the military and the CIA seek Itek’s knowledge about things like development of bombsights. Itek’ chairman of the Board, Franklin A. Lindsey was CIA. Lindsey’s assistant writes [Maurice] Schonfeld [for CJR] Howard Sprague, has also been a CIA employee. And this CBS study was Itek’s third purporting to show no photographic evidence of conspiracy in the JFK assassination. The others were from UPI and Life. 20 The Village Voice report by Dick Russell, one week later, “Senator Schweiker Reopens Assassination Probe: The Finger Points to Fidel, but should not,” widened the investigation. Senator Richard Schweiker notes from his subcommittee investigation “The more witnesses, the more they raise the fact that the Warren Commission really is a house of cards.… I’ve learned more about the inner workings of government in the past nine months than my previous fifteen years in Congress.… A lot of stuff is not in certain files. So when Hoover says his files show only three FBI contacts with Oswald, he could be narrowly telling the truth, where in fact he is lying through his teeth.… Why did the FBI withhold for twelve years that he’d ( Jack Ruby) informed for them on nine occasions?” Russell revealed that William Attwood, America’s number two man at the UN, “held a series of talks with the Cuban ambassador to the UN to discuss opening negotiations on an accommodation between Castro and the U.S. The progress was reported regularly to the White House, where Mc-George Bundy says JFK was in favor of pushing an opening with Cuba.… In November a French journalist named Jean Daniel went off to see Castro as a quasi-official spokesman for JFK” Meanwhile, according to the CIA’s 1967 inspector general’s report, “it is likely that at the very moment President Kennedy was shot, a CIA officer was meeting with a Cuban agent and giving him an assassination device for use against Castro.” Russell also revealed the Schweiker file on J.A. Milteer of the National States Rights Party, who told a police informant in Miami, “that a plan to kill Kennedy was in the works.” Two weeks prior", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:211:be10c2d59a3a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 505, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 212, "text": "a quasi-official spokesman for JFK” Meanwhile, according to the CIA’s 1967 inspector general’s report, “it is likely that at the very moment President Kennedy was shot, a CIA officer was meeting with a Cuban agent and giving him an assassination device for use against Castro.” Russell also revealed the Schweiker file on J.A. Milteer of the National States Rights Party, who told a police informant in Miami, “that a plan to kill Kennedy was in the works.” Two weeks prior to the assassination, the informant passed that information to the Secret Service about an assassination plan from a window with a high-powered rifle. As Senator Schweiker deepened his inquiry of the role of U.S. intelligence agencies in investigating the assassination he wrote of his respect for citizen-researcher Sylvia Meagher. Accessories After the Fact was instrumental in finally causing a committee of Congress – with full subpoena power, access to classified documents, and a working knowledge of the nuances of the FBI and CIA – to take a second official look at what happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963.”21 By late 1975 The Saturday Evening Post joined the call for a new investigation, and offered a reward for information leading to the conviction of the conspirators. Meanwhile, Colonel Fletcher Prouty and Gallery tried to deepen the discourse and Congressional investigation of the CIA with the 12/75 piece “The Fourth Force,” which explored CIA-military cooperation. The Bay of Pigs in 1961 was a large, military exercise. It involved an air force, a navy, and a sizable over-the beach force of Cuban expatriates. The insurrection against the Sukarno government in Indonesia in 1958 involved more than 42,000 rebel troops and a good sized clandestine air force, and a navy. In Tibet in 1959-60 more than 14,000 insurgent Kham tribesmen were supported by a major airlift of arms over the Himalayan Mountains. Cold War needs and perceptions forged broad CIA-military cooperation as “The Fourth Force,” in Indonesia 1958, Tibet 1959 and Cuba in 1961. The military was to shield Congress from its cooperation. Prouty asserted that the Rockefeller Commission did not look into this because it had been penetrated on behalf of the CIA by David Belin, its chief counsel and former counsel of the Warren Commission.22 The close relationship between CBS and the CIA reemerged a few months later regarding the release of the Pike Committee Report. By a close congressional vote the House determined that the Pike investigation should not be released to the public, but a leaked copy was given to CBS reporter Daniel Schorr. CBS rejected Schorr’s efforts to either report on or write about the leaked report. Soon after, CBS chairman Bill Paley met with the new CIA director George H.W. Bush. Schorr quickly released the report to the Village Voice and was then castigated by the Washington Post, the New York Times, and most of the mass", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:212:c3b917b2af20", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 506, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 213, "text": "the House determined that the Pike investigation should not be released to the public, but a leaked copy was given to CBS reporter Daniel Schorr.

Schorr quickly released the report to the Village Voice and was then castigated by the Washington Post, the New York Times, and most of the mass media. Not long afterward, Schorr was forced to resign from CBS. Mass media coverage of Schorr’s efforts was muted, and a public which was emotionally weary from the Vietnam War and Watergate, had seemly shifted somewhat from valuing transparency to desiring security. A December 1975 Harris poll showed that slightly more respondents disapproved of the Congressional investigation of the CIA than approved of them. This provocative congressional probe could have impacted coverage of political assassinations if Congress had voted to declassify it, or if the mass media would have covered it like the Pentagon Papers or Watergate. Argosy, 4/76, ran Dick Russell’s interview with former mercenary and CIA contract agent Gerry Patrick Hemming, who claimed to have been repeatedly offered money to assassinate Kennedy. Hemming, a big ex-Marine and Green Beret, knew Oswald, Sturgis, Castro and Che Guevara. He fought with Castro to overthrow Batista, and then fled to the U.S. in 1960 to train embittered Cuban exiles in guerrilla warfare. He worked with the CIA, elements of the mafia, Howard Hughes, Congress and others. Hemming clarified his statement to Senate investigators about ex-CIA contract employee Loran Hall being seen in Dallas on the day of the assassination (recall that Hall was named by the Warren Commission as visiting Sylvia Odio with Oswald). Hemming then recounted a number of CIA-mafia plots to assassinate Castro, yet he felt that Castro was being set up for the blame on the assassination to justify an invasion.23 Russell again broke ground with his Village Voice piece, 4/26/76, which pointed to inconsistencies with the CIA reports on Oswald’s alleged rifle, Oswald’s ties to the CIA, Khrushchev’s disbelief in the Warren Report, and the mysteries of Mexico City, as well as Ruby’s connections. CIA memos indicate that CIA pictures of Oswald supposedly visiting the Soviet Embassy were not pictures of Oswald. The CIA admitted so while recommending that the photographs not be reproduced in the Warren Report. British journalist John Wilson revealed Ruby’s visit to Mafiosi Santo Trafficante in a Cuban jail in 1959. Wilson states that while jailed in Cuba, he met Trafficante and that Trafficante had been visited by Ruby. Russell also pointed to Oswald’s other associates with purported CIA ties, Arnesto Rodriguez and “Ruedolo.”24 The muted response of the mainstream media can be partially attributed to the public relations efforts of the Association of Retired Intelligence Officers.

In 1976 retired CIA propaganda expert David Phillips (AKA Maurice Bishop) organized over 600 former spies to generate “background material” to distribute to national organizations. Guidelines for public relations on speeches, op-ed pieces, etc. were crafted to promote at first the view that CIA agents were physically endangered by the Congressional investigation. The P.R. work became vital after Senator Richard Schweiker’s (R-Pa.) statement on CBS’s Face the Nation 9/27/76. “I think the [Warren] Report … has fallen like a house of cards … the fatal mistake the Warren Commission made was not to use its own investigators, but instead to rely on CIA and FBI personnel, which played directly into the hands of senior intelligence officials who directed the cover-up.”25 The Castro retaliation theory would increasingly percolate into print. Those promoting this theory either neglected or were unaware of: 1) Castro’s communications with Kennedy; 2) Castro’s early writings declaring that the U. S. far right was responsible for the assassination; 3) the logic in creating a significant rationale for the invasion of Cuba and conceivably a world war; 4) Castro’s overtures to LBJ; and 5) Castro’s views of LBJ as more hawkish than JFK. Years later, Senator Gary Hart (D-CO) told the Huffington Post “It’s amazing to me that American journalism never followed up on that story very much (the murders of Johnny Roselli and Sam Giancana) because if you found out who killed those two guys, you might have some really interesting information on your hands.” There were “all kinds of leads … I went down to Miami when Roselli was killed and talked to this Dade County sheriff from the Miami Police Department, and they showed me pictures of him being fished out of the water in a barrel and how he had been killed – nightmarish stuff. And [Momo Salvatore] Giancana was killed in his own basement with six holes in his throat with a Chicago police car and an FBI car outside his house.” During his Presidential run in 1988 Senator Hart called to reopen the investigation of the JFK assassination and received death threats. In 2013 Hart admitted that in revealing the assassination story, even as a journalist, “you risk your life because whoever killed these two guys is still out there.”26 PBS’s Jim Lehrer probed the role of intelligence agencies in the assassination during the Robert McNeil Report, June 24,1976.

The guests included David Phillips (ret. CIA office), Senator Robert Morgan (D-NC) (and member of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee) and Nicholas Horrock, N.Y. Times reporter. Lehrer started by clarifying the poor performance of the CIA and FBI during the Warren Commission investigation and characterized the findings of the Senate Select Intelligence as indicating that the CIA and FBI were involved in a cover-up. Senator Morgan viewed the FBI as protecting its image, while the CIA did not offer any information not asked of it. The Senate Select Committee determined that the CIA plotted to assassinate Castro, which Morgan saw as dereliction. Lehrer noted that the FBI used the Domestic Intelligence Division but never consulted their expert on Cuba. Horrock then suggested the underlying possibility of foreign involvement so, $ { { } ^ { } } $ the surface it appears the bureau is just trying to cover itself.” Then Horrock seemed to start revealing something. “But at that time, I don’t think that the Warren Commission was overly eager to discover that sort of…” Lehrer shifted to ask, “What startled you the most?” and Horrock responded with, “a fellow boards an aircraft in Mexico City and apparently sits with the pilot, doesn’t go through normal customs, and ends up in Cuba nine days after the assassination.” Lehrer then turned to David Phillips to discuss the Cuban Connection, and Phillips wove quite a tale. The first one is the story about “D.” The Warren Report identified him as a Latin America secret agent. He was in fact a fabricator. “I [Phillips] am convinced he was a fabricator. I interviewed him personally.… And one of the last things he said was “that wasn’t really true [seeing Oswald receive $6500 in the Cuban embassy] I said this because I hoped the United States would do something about Castro.

Purportedly this came from a CIA Report from Washington. Phillips then denied knowledge of AMLASH, the CIA operative attempting to assassinate Castro.

No mention was made of forensic evidence, or the roles of the mafia, Secret Service, the military or LBJ. Lehrer was taken by a supposed Cuban connection, and Phillips predictably enabled that line of inquiry. Horrock advocated a notion of national security which meant a self-censoring of the press and government.27 On August 3, 1976, a United Press dispatch stated that “Congressman Thomas Downing had distributed a 79-page packet compiled by former CIA operative Robert Morrow … suggested right-wing Cuban exiles sought Kennedy’s assassination in retaliation for his withdrawal of air support for the Bay of Pigs invasion … this material alleged that Nixon was the action man behind the Bay of Pigs and that Nixon promised the right-wing Cuban exile leader, Mario Kohly, that he would eliminate leftwing anti-Castro exiles after the invasion.” Meanwhile, the murders of Mafiosi Sam Giancana before he was scheduled to speak to the Senate Select Committee (Church Committee or CIA oversight), and of John Roselli, after his testimony to the Senate Select Committee, fueled government investigations). The New York Times, 8/14/76, commented editorially on the Giancana-Roselli-Kennedy assassination connections, and for the first time called for a new Congressional probe. In 1976, the National Archives disclosed that two of Leon Jaworski’s letters to the Warren Commission were missing from the records of the Commission: a “Letter of December 18, 1963^(′′) expressing a continuous “willingness to assist in any way” and a “Letter of Leon Jaworski to J. Lee Rankin, May 8, 1964.” Also found missing from the Warren Commission documents in the Archives was a “Letter of Gerald Ford, April 7, 1964, concerning expediting the FBI investigation.” Coincidentally, evidence started to disappear from the National Archives. A 8/22/76 UPI story reported, based on Roselli’s unnamed lawyer, who told the FBI in 1967 that Roselli and another client were involved with “a government approved project aimed at assassinating Castro” in the early 1960s, and that Castro planned to murder President Kennedy.

ABC’s Good Morning America, however, twice granted the Assassination Information Bureau, a citizen’s research group, five minutes of airtime to comment on the documents during late 1976 and early 1977. ABC was the only major media outlet to do so. “The Trial of the CIA,” by Taylor Branch, which appeared in The New York Times Magazine (9/12/76) was subtitled “Not all of its covert actions have succeeded,” but the agency did manage to outfox Congressional investigators. While the Rockefeller Commission had neither the time nor mandate, the Senate Intelligence Committee, referred to as the Church Committee after Chairman Senator Frank Church, D-ID continued exploring CIA foreign assassinations. Branch claimed: Where American efforts to kill were direct and persistent – in the case of Castro – they were unsuccessful, and where foreign leaders were actually killed – Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, Diem in South Vietnam, Schneider in Chile – there was no hard proof that CIA operatives actually took part in the murders.… Certainly many thousands of people have died as a result of CIA paramilitary interventions … [Regarding Trujillo] the Committee showed how American policy turned against the Dominican strongman, how the agency provided assurances of support to those who plotted against him, how CIA officials smuggled weapons into the country and exchanged cryptic messages on the likelihood of a successful assassination, however the committee exonerated the agency of Trujillo’s murder on the grounds that the weapons it smuggled in were probably not the ones used in the killing.… By the time we finished the assassination report we lost three things, the public attention, much of our own energy, will power and our leadership.… Church wanted to wrap up investigative chores to begin his own Presidential campaign.… The committee was floundering: Rogovin [CIA Special Counsel] pressed his advantage. We agreed with the committee that they could have access to information for six case studies in covert action provided they would go public with only one of them. They swore all sorts of secrecy oaths that they would not let the names of the other countries leak.… By December 1975 the House and Senate committees were set on opposite courses.

The CIA bowled over the Pike Committee.… The agency began these searching investigations on the ropes, and clearly emerged the winner. Its powers, so unique and hidden, remain essentially unchallenged. 28 A Gallup poll, September 1976, indicated that over 80% of the public believed that a conspiracy was responsible for both the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. This perspective is a tribute to the assassination research community, some bold witnesses, portions of the media, a few mainstream investigations and the American public. This public sentiment, along with activist assassination researchers led by Mark Lane in a post-Watergate political climate, led to the reluctant authorization of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in late 1976. Professor Peter Dale Scott now viewed the mainstream media as making “a large contribution to the mounting public pressure to reopen the investigation of the Kennedy assassination.… “The only way the press will appreciate the significance of the less sensational research is through its own sustained investigation.”29 New challenges emerged. CIA fingerprints seemed evident in the Houston Post piece “No cover-up and Oswald’s Mexico visit,” 12/2/76 , by Donald Morris, who had worked with the CIA for 17 years before joining the Post in 1972. It appeared to have been edited by the newly formed Association of Retired Intelligence Officers. The article characterized the interest in Oswald’s visit to Mexico City as “a perfect example of paranoia at work.” All CIA actions and procedures were stoutly defended. No attempt was made to clarify Senator Schweiker’s questions about the purported pictures of Oswald entering the Cuban and Russian embassies clearly not being pictures of Oswald. Morris even attempted to revise the record regarding these “visits” by claiming Oswald merely called the embassies.

Sprague, the effective, no-nonsense, Philadelphia D.A., planned to aggressively pursue the investigation including questioning of the CIA, FBI and Military intelligence. By November 1976 he had hired a staff of 170 and he soon became a threat to many in Washington, as he aggressively sought more money, time and subpoena power. Select committees essentially have to lobby for money, and when Congressman Tom Downing (R-Va.) retired this became more problematic. Sprague’s seventeen-year record in Philadelphia solely in terms of the controversies he provoked. He recycled a discredited attack printed years earlier in the Philadelphia Inquirer though the Inquirer was hit with a $34 million judgment for defamation of a public official in the U.S. Burnham quoted CIA asset Walter Pincus, a Washington Post reporter, regarding HSCA debate, “Mr. Walter Pincus calls it [HSCA] perhaps the worst example of congressional inquiry run amok.” 1/2/77 . (Burnham was the reporter whom anti-nuclear activist Karen Silkwood was supposed to meet the night that she was driven off the road and killed.) Nonetheless, the Burnham articles served to almost derail the HSCA. Two days later the attempt to reconstitute the committee by voice vote failed, which delayed the HSCA for weeks. The January 6, 1977, New York Times piece by Burnham ran a warning from Rep. Don Edwards (D-Cal.), an ex-FBI man who chaired the House Judiciary subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights. Edwards argued that the HSCA’s investigative techniques were “wrong, immoral, and very likely illegal.” He was referring to alleged plans to secretly tape witnesses and then do psychological stress tests.31 George Lardner Jr. of the Washington Post, 2/11/77, then crafted a story strongly critical of Sprague’s proposed procedures: Sharp objections have been raised to the Assassination Committee’s proposed purchases and investigating techniques. With Downing still chairman of the committee staff recently sought to buy five suction cup devices that are used to tape-record telephone conversations.

Some of the proposed investigative techniques have stirred objections. One is the use of hidden electronic transmitters to secretly record the remarks of potential witnesses; this is a thoroughly bad proposal that if implemented would invade the constitutional rights of the subject of the inquiry. The committee also wants to buy lie detector machines and stress evaluators … this latter smacks of mere gimmickry, unless a need for these devices is shown. 32 Sprague refused to resign and enlisted Rep. Tip O’Neill’s support in the ensuing power struggle. When the HSCA staff and the Congress backed Sprague, HSCA Chair Rep. Henry Gonzalez then took the unusual step of quitting. During the struggle Sprague was proposing a staff of 200, a yearly budget of $6.5 million and issuing subpoenas to the CIA. The CIA stipulated that HSCA staff must comply with a policy of confidentiality which precluded them telling anything to Sprague. Some other mass media outlets then attacked Sprague. Meanwhile, the attorney for retired Vice-Admiral Burkley, President Kennedy’s personal physician, contacted Sprague to grant an interview. Although Burkley was present at Parkland Hospital, and signed the death certificate of President Kennedy in Dallas, the Warren Commission had never called him as a witness. Burkley was indicating that others besides Oswald must have been involved, but Sprague never got the opportunity to pursue the interview. Sprague, upset with the political and media attacks, which paralleled those endured by Garrison, instructed the HSCA PR man, an experienced reporter, to contact the press around the nation and clarify the nature of the inquiry. Inexplicably, not one newspaper in the country contacted Sprague to get more information. Practically, all the Cabinet members of President Kennedy’s administration, along with Director J. Edgar Hoover of the FBI and Chief James Rowley of the Secret Service, whose duty it was to protect the life of the President, testified that to their knowledge there was no sign of any conspiracy. To say now that these people, as well as the Commission, suppressed, neglected to unearth, or overlooked evidence of a conspiracy would be an indictment of the entire government of the United States. The sketchy Dutch journalist Willen Oltmans, who had reported on the assassination for years, told the HSCA", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:220:640b04f5ea86", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 514, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 221, "text": "Chief James Rowley of the Secret Service, whose duty it was to protect the life of the President, testified that to their knowledge there was no sign of any conspiracy. To say now that these people, as well as the Commission, suppressed, neglected to unearth, or overlooked evidence of a conspiracy would be an indictment of the entire government of the United States. The sketchy Dutch journalist Willen Oltmans, who had reported on the assassination for years, told the HSCA that he was shocked when he met again with George de Mohrenschildt in Dallas, in February of 1977. Normally confident and fit, de Mohrenschildt was “nervous, trembling, and very, very scared.” De Mohrenschildt confessed or dissembled, “I feel responsible for the behavior of Lee Harvey Oswald.” He admitted being the liaison between H.L. Hunt (oilman), anti-Castro Cubans, and elements of the FBI and CIA. After de Mohrenschildt begged to leave the country, Oltmans flew with him to Holland and Belgium. In less than a week the enigmatic de Mohrenschildt fled from Oltmans back to the U.S. A few weeks later he supposedly committed suicide just hours before HSCA investigator Gaeton Fonzi was to interview him. Two days after de Mohrenschildt’s death, CBS briefly covered his role along with Oltmans’ testimony to the HSCA. CBS reporter, Jim McManus, reported that Oltmans spent more than two hours answering committee questions behind closed doors and repeated his claim that de Mohrenschildt, a one-time friend of Lee Harvey Oswald, was part of a conspiracy to murder President Kennedy. Oltmans claimed that “de Mohrenschildt told me in Dallas on the 23rd of February of this year that Oswald acted at his instructions and that de Mohrenschildt and Oswald discussed the Kennedy assassination from A to Z, and that he knew that Oswald was going to kill Kennedy sooner or later.” Oltmans claimed, “That there were four Kennedy assassins, and he gave the committee a picture of a Cuban as possibly one of the four, but he declined to give the name publicly.” Oltmans claimed in their talk last month that de Mohrenschildt also mentioned the involvement of an anti-Castro Cuban, “Loran Hall was offered in the office of Lester Logue, with five or six people present, $50, 000 to take part in the assassination of President Kennedy.”33 CBS then ran a 1968 Oltmans interview with de Mohrenschildt where he denied the involvement of Texan oil money in the assassination. De Mohrenschildt also purportedly said that “Oswald was a lunatic who killed President Kennedy.” Oltmans claimed that de Mohrenschildt simply changed his story. De Mohrenschildt’s lawyer told CBS’s Eric Enberg that he was present in Dallas when Oltmans talked with his client. Rather than examining de Mohrenschildt’s fears, strange behavior, ominous possible involvement, changed statements and suicide, CBS highlighted de Mohrenschildt’s statements nine years earlier. When later questioned by researcher Jerry Policoff, Oltmans threatened “You had", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:221:84e4f019312d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 515, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 222, "text": "money in the assassination.

When later questioned by researcher Jerry Policoff, Oltmans threatened “You had better watch out or you will get hurt.” Policoff maintains that Oltmans acted like a spook rather than a journalist. Remarkably, de Mohrenschildt’s wife, Jeanne, granted an interview to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram 5/11/78 , and said that she did not think that her husband committed suicide. She thought Oswald was a U.S. intelligence agent, possibly CIA, and she was convinced that he did not kill President Kennedy. “They may get to me too but I’m not afraid … it’s about time that somebody looked into this thing.”34 Bill O’Reilly, then a reporter for WFAA-TV Dallas, briefly explored the relationship of the CIA and Lee Harvey Oswald, 4/11/77, with the help of his old friend Gaeton Fonzi, now a HSCA staffer. He reported that a “recently declassified document, now in the hands of a writer, indicates that Oswald was employed by the CIA possibly in 1962, and although it may be a coincidence, Oswald’s tax return was not made public.” In a related matter, Mrs. Jeanne de Mohrenschildt, wife of the late George de Mohrenschildt, told O’Reilly that she and her husband were good friends with a Dallas CIA agent named J. Walton Moore, and that Moore told George de Mohrenschildt that Lee Harvey Oswald was OK to recommend for a job. When O’Reilly called Moore who had no comment, CIA headquarters told O’Reilly that they were “astonished” by Mrs. de Mohrenschildt’s comments. 35 Years later, when O’Reilly got famous with FOX network, he adopted the lone nut scenario on the assassination. One, as a prosecutor, I have never wiretapped and never secretly recorded any conversation with anybody. I wanted to obtain recording equipment for the purpose of our people in the field interviewing and getting permission to tape record for the purpose of accuracy. If the person said no, we would not record it. The record will show that’s exactly how we used them. Three or four weeks after we made that request to congress, stories were carried in the Los Angeles Times, and the Post, and particularly by Burnham [NYT] that I’d bought this recording equipment to surreptitiously record what witnesses are going to say.

Robert Blakey, a law professor at Cornell University, and a specialist in organized crime who had served from 1960-1964 in the Justice Department, replaced him. At the press conference announcing his appointment Blakey declared, “The purpose of this news conference is to announce there will not be any more news conferences.” He then quoted former Republican Presidential candidate Tom Dewey: Blakey then required his staff to sign agreements, subject to a $5000 penalty if they disclosed anything. He asserted that he would follow a strategy of voluntary cooperation with the CIA. Meanwhile, the CIA brought former agent George Joannides, a former Helms man, out of retirement to work as the CIA liaison to the HSCA. Blakey was unaware that Joannides ran psychological warfare operations in 1963 with anti-Castro Cubans, including the revolutionary Student Directorate (DRE), heavily funded by the CIA, which had regular contact with Oswald. HSCA Assistant Chief Counsel. Robert Tannenbaum, who quit in frustration, summarized the process. We were not interested in receiving documents that were redacted. We were only interested in seeing who questioned a witness, what evidence they received and what they did … why couldn’t Congress get that material from the executive branch? There is no reason for the executive branch intelligence agencies to clear members of Congress. That’s preposterous… Tannenbaum observed, [The sixth floor window] is open maybe $1 2 \"$ and an opaque wall of maybe 4 ft. where the window starts. At best you could just see a partial of a shooter’s face, if in fact someone was shooting.… How did the Dallas police, at 12 : 48 pm , just about 18 minutes after the assassination, get the description of someone who was in that window? Those who were subpoenaed who were lying to the committee, who were in the government, and not doing the right thing, we needed to hold them in contempt, and or charge perjury. That required a vote of the committee, a vote of the House of Representatives and a submission to the U.S. Attorney’s office. They weren’t prepared to do that. Because they really didn’t work to find out the truth publicly.38 I think that the report, to those who have studied it closely, has collapsed like a house of cards … I frankly believe that we have shown that the John F.

Kennedy assassination was snuffed out before it even began, and that the fatal mistake the Warren Commission made was not to use its own investigators, but instead to rely on the CIA and FBI personnel, which played directly into the hands of senior intelligence officials who directed the cover-up.39 Disinformation played a role in shaping the HSCA as well as creating obstacles for its investigators. Gaeton Fonzi, formerly a reporter with the Philadelphia Magazine before working as a Senate and HSCA researcher, revealed the source of false leads that Senator Schweiker had asked him to pursue in 1975. That source was Clare Booth Luce, the widow of the founder of Time, Inc., who had been a member of Congress and a former CIA contract agent, and then served as a board member of the Association of Retired Intelligence Officers. Fonzi also had his notes for a key witness, CIA asset Antonio Veciana, stolen and leaked by someone to reporter Jack Anderson. Anderson’s column in the Washington Post referred to “a mysterious Mr. X” but described him in such detail that Veciana’s life might have been put in danger. It had a chilling effect on Veciana’s testimony as well as other actual and potential witnesses. In Anderson’s second column he detailed “Mr. X’s” relationship with “Morris” Bishop, (instead of Maurice) the precise misspelling of Bishop’s first name used in Fonzi’s notes. Anderson seemingly had somehow gotten copies of those notes. Fonzi and many other HSCA investigators were convinced that Maurice Bishop was a pseudonym for David Phillips, CIA Chief of Western Hemisphere. The L.A. Times 9/18/77 story “Ex-CIA official Denies Any Oswald Link to Agency” covered a spirited debate between David Phillips and Mark Lane hosted by the University of Southern California. Reporter Myrna Oliver noted Phillips claimed he “felt like an insect pierced and mounted on a pin for public display” as the latest ‘spook’ suspected of trying to cover-up the assassination. Specifically doubted CIA reports that Oswald had contacted the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, then under Phillips’ CIA eye, to ask for messages. He said FBI agents who questioned Oswald after Kennedy was shot in Dallas listened to the tapes the CIA claimed proved that Oswald called the Soviets; Lane said the FBI determined the taped voice was not Oswald’s.

Walter Elder, deputy to former CIA director McCone and the principal Agency liaison to the Church committee, argued that the committee lacked jurisdiction because there had been no misuse of journalists by the CIA; the relationships had been voluntary. According to colleagues on the staff of the Senate inquiry, both Bader and Aaron were disturbed by the information contained in CIA files about journalists; they urged that further investigation be undertaken…Bader’s investigation was conducted under unusually difficult conditions. His first request for specific information on the use of journalists was turned down by the CIA on grounds that there had been no abuse of authority and that current intelligence operation might be compromised. Senators Walter Huddleston, Howard Baker, Gary Hart, Walter Mondale and Charles Matthias … shared Bader’s distress at the CIA’s reaction. In a series of phone calls and meetings with CIA director George Bush and other agency officials, the senators insisted that the committee staff be provided information about the scope of CIA-press activities. Finally, Bush agreed to a search of the files and have those records pulled which deal with operations where journalists had been used. But the raw files could not be made available to Bader or the committee, Bush insisted instead, the director decided, his deputies would condense the material into one paragraph summaries describing in the most general terms the activities of each individual journalist. Most important Bush, decreed the names of journalists and of the news organizations with which they were affiliated would be omitted from the summaries. The discussion … grew heated. The committee’s representatives said they could not honor their mandate-to determine if the CIA had abused it authority – without further information. The CIA maintained it could not protect its legitimate intelligence operations or its employees if further disclosures were made to the committee. Many of the journalists were contract employees of the Agency, Bush said at one point, and the CIA was no less obligated to them than to any other agents. Finally, a highly unusual agreement was hammered out: Bader and Miller would be permitted to examine “sanitized” versions of the full files of twenty-five journalists selected from the summaries; but the names of the journalists and the news organizations which", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:225:04e4c4768284", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 519, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 226, "text": "or its employees if further disclosures were made to the committee.

Church and Tower would be permitted to examine the unsanitized version of five of the twenty-five… The whole deal was contingent on an agreement that Bader, Miller, Tower or Church would not reveal the contents of the files to other members of the committee or staff… The findings of the Senate committee’s inquiry into the use of journalists were deliberately buried from the full membership of the committee, from the Senate and from the public.… Bader’s findings on the subject were never discussed with the full committee, even in executive session.… Colby’s misleading public statements about the use of journalists were repeated without serious contradiction or elaboration… Assembling the summaries was difficult, according to CIA officials who supervised the job. There were no “journalist files” per se and information had to be collected from divergent sources that reflect the highly compartmentalized character of the CIA.… After several weeks Bader began receiving summaries, which numbered over four hundred by the time they said it had completed searching its files.… We gave them a broad, representative picture, said one Agency official, “We never pretended it was a total description of the range of activities over 25 years, or of the number of journalists who have done things for us.” A relatively small number of foreign journalists… Bader and others to whom he described the contents of the summaries immediately reached some general conclusions: the sheer number of covert relationships with journalists was far greater than the CIA had ever hinted: and the Agency’s use of reporters and news executives was an intelligence asset of the first magnitude. Reporters had been involved in almost every imaginable kind of operation. 41 In 1977 ABC aired “The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald” produced by Lawrence Schiller, FBI asset and Jack Ruby’s business manager. The program was generally supportive of the Warren Commission findings, though some hints were given that Oswald could have been part of a conspiracy composed of the Mafia and some intelligence agents.

The San Francisco Chronicle, 9/12/78, which ran a provocative piece by Warren Hinkle revealed a statement by CIA finance officer, Jim Wilcott, that “CIA people killed Kennedy.” Wilcot testified to the House Select Committee on Assassinations: It was common knowledge in the Tokyo station that Oswald worked for the agency.… He testified that he overheard CIA agents say “agency people” had Kennedy murdered because the President had reneged on a “secret agreement” with former CIA director Allen Dulles to militarily support the CIA-backed 1961 invasion of Cuba.… “CIA people killed Kennedy.” 43 In December as the HSCA was searching for more funding, Priscilla Johnson McMillan, who was a witting CIA asset, worked the interview circuit to promote her book Marina and Lee, which she had been working on for years. On Tom Snyder’s TV show she reiterated, “It’s hard for people to accept the idea that one person who is not so different from themselves, went off and did a thing like that. It threatens people’s sense of order about history … when one man can step up there and nullify the will of an entire country, it makes life seem meaningless and without order, and I think conspiracy theorists want to give life an order and coherence that it lacks.” Gallery, 4/78, ran Willem Oltmans new assertion that General Donald Donaldson, a Bulgarian émigré, claimed that J. Edgar Hoover, Allen Dulles and Richard Nixon conspired in the assassination. Oltmans interviewed George de Mohrenschildt and his wife in 1967 for Dutch television station NOS, and CBS did the camera work. This 40-minute film mysteriously disappeared from NOS files in 1975. In 1977 a depressed de Mohrenschildt revealed that “he felt responsible for Oswald’s role. He wanted to confess” but was receiving death threats.

Donaldson advised Oltmans to meet with President Carter, and 8/29/77 he met with a presidential lawyer. Soon thereafter, Oltmans supposedly confronted Donaldson, who balked, and supposedly threatened to shoot him if he released any information. Oltmans recounted Donaldson’s “assertions” on ABC TV’s Good Morning America 9/8/77, but never again heard from Donaldson. As public revelations of the CIA mounted, the New York Times ran a three-part series “Wordwide Propaganda Network Built by the CIA,” 12/25/77 to 12/27/77, by John Crewdson and Joseph Treaster. They asserted fewer media-CIA connections than Carl Bernstein did in his Rolling Stone article but revealed new examples and tactics. They noted that, “The CIA had a formal operation known as KMFORGET in which stories planted by the agency in one country would be clipped and mailed to media in other countries, and such efforts enhanced the likelihood that the stories would be seen by an American correspondent and transmitted home” [blowback or domestic fallout] This “gray propaganda” was used to circumvent a government ban [from the 1970s-2013] on using published materials from U.S. government agencies created for foreign audiences being aimed at America. Dick Russell’s next report explored the career and connections of Antonio Veciana, a high level anti-Cuban activist who worked with U.S. intelligence agent “Maurice Bishop.” Bishop and Veciana formed Alpha 66, the militant anti-Castro group, and once Veciana allegedly met with Bishop and Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas. A year after the assassination Veciana asserted that Bishop offered him money if Veciana’s cousin, a Cuban intelligence agent, would say that he had met with Oswald. Bishop later dropped the plan. Veciana continued to work with Bishop in Puerto Rico, Bolivia and Chile. Veciana was later shot in the head – but he survived. In 1971 Bishop had started a plot to assassinate Castro on a visit to Chile but the plan never materialized. Russell hoped that the HSCA could identify Bishop (who we now know is David Phillips).44 Reader’s Digest managing editor William Charles Ouster decided to examine the enigmatic Oswald. Digest editors had long been close with J. Edgar Hoover and the CIA, and Nelson Rockefeller’s brother Lawrence sat on their board.

One defector, Yuri Nosenko, had maintained that Oswald had no ties to Soviet intelligence, but after a long and harsh interrogation by James Angleton (CIA Counter Intel) he changed his mind. Epstein cited confidential, unnamed sources and classified materials stating that Nosenko was a double agent who assisted Oswald. Epstein later revealed that his source was CIA Counterintelligence Chief James Angleton. His book, Legend: The Secret World of Lee Harvey Oswald, which portrayed Oswald as a Soviet Agent, came out in 1978.45 In November of 1978 the Dallas Morning News ran a three-page lead story by Earl Golz, revealing that an amateur cameraman, Charles Bronson, had shot film of the Texas School Book Depository six minutes before the assassination. The FBI Dallas office viewed the film in 1963 and reported that it “was not sufficiently clear” and that it “failed to show the building from which the shots were fired,” thus it languished in obscurity. When the footage was declassified through the FOIA, the Dallas Morning News obtained it.46 HSCA Senior staff members thought they saw movement in more than one window on the sixth floor. The film footage was given to HSCA photographic research expert Robert Groden who observed, “The fact that there is movement in two windows that are separated by a good eight feet indicates beyond question that there was more than one person up there.” Solid reporting on the declassified Bronson film also can be seen in the Dallas Times Herald 11/27/78. The FBI Dallas office suppressed the frames from being seen by the FBI headquarters, the Warren Commission, or as the Secret Service.47 The Fort Worth Star-Telegram continued its support for reporter Jim Marrs with his article, 10/22/78, about Earlene Roberts. Roberts had actually named two Dallas police officers that stopped in front of Oswald’s rooming house and honked twice, while he was in his room after the assassination. Those policemen were never called to testify by the Warren Commission. The small right-wing newspaper, Spotlight, carried a revelation from Victor Marchetti, the former Executive Assistant to the Deputy Director of the CIA. Marchetti said that he had seen an internal memo from James Angleton, head of CIA Counterintelligence, to CIA Director Richard Helms stating that CIA officer E. Howard Hunt was in Dallas the day President Kennedy was assassinated. Hunt sued for libel, but ultimately lost on appeal in 1984. More on this case later.

Clare Booth Luce, the activist wife of Henry Luce, resurfaced and this time told the HSCA that she was called late on the night of the assassination from an Anti-Castro Cuban who knew Oswald to be a communist who made several trips to Mexico City. Oswald was to have returned from Mexico City with an ample supply of money, and boasted that he was “a crack marksman and could shoot anybody – including the President or the Secretary of the Navy.” Lastly, her alleged caller told her, “There is a Cuban Communist assassination team at large, and Oswald was their hired gun.” The HSCA referred to this as “unsubstantiated allegations.” This seems merely a new spin on old disinformation.48 On 11/30/78 the New York Times ran an op-ed by Anthony Lewis which accused leading critic Mark Lane, recently returned from Jonestown, Guyana, of being a “ghoul … pitchman … creature … [who profited from] assassination bumper stickers…” Lewis called for “talk shows hosts and editors” to “refuse to permit Lane to be heard. It is time for the decent people of the United States to tune out Mark Lane.” Lewis ironically, had taught at Columbia University School of Journalism, and since 1982 has held the James Madison chair in First Amendment Issues. Johnny Powell, an inmate in the county jail at the time of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, recently told the Dallas Morning News he and others in his cell watched two men with a rifle in the 6th floor window of the TSBD across the street. When he looked the men were “fooling with” a scope on the rifle.… The authorities did not question Powell and his fellow inmates… David Belin, an assistant counsel for the Warren Commission tried to intimidate him into testifying the one man he was able to see didn’t have the light-colored hair he insisted he did have… ‘Belin and I almost had a fight in the interview room over the color of, the man’s hair.… He wanted me to tell him the man was dark-headed, and I wouldn’t do it.51 Congressman Richardson Preyer expressed frustration to this author that Ruby’s calls to various crime figures in the weeks and days leading up to the assassination were never thoroughly investigated.

He said that “the HSCA needed at least six more months to pursue the necessary leads and that the CIA and the military did not cooperate fully,” but Congress denied them additional funding to fulfill their mandate to conduct a “full and complete investigation.” 52 Meanwhile, unknown to Congressman Preyer and many others on the HSCA, the investigators were being directed by HSCA Chief Counsel Blakey to restrict themselves to “issues we can answer.… Reality is irrelevant here – this is Washington.… It will take too much time.” HSCA staffer Edwin Lopez provided some context: Young HSCA staff investigators Dan Hardaway and Edwin Lopez repeatedly complained to Blakey that CIA liaison George Joannides was hiding evidence of “a conspiracy involving the CIA in the assassination.” Meanwhile, in testimony to the HSCA David Phillips spread stories tying Oswald to Castro. Phillips was so nervous that he had “three or four cigarettes going at once.”53 Regis Blahut, a liaison officer of the CIA, was arrested in June 1978 for breaking into the safe of the House Assassination Committee and tampering with the autopsy photographs. Blahut admitted his involvement and noted cryptically “There’s other things involved that are detrimental to other things.” The CIA incredibly claimed that Blahut acted out of “mere curiosity.” Although Blahut was fired, most HSCA committee staffers felt that “curiosity” was not consistent with the way the evidence should have been handled. While the investigators from the FBI, CIA, Washington D.C. police, and Committee Chief Counsel Blakey knew about this break-in prior to the summer of 1979, the HSCA members and researchers did not. A more probing set of questions regarding the autopsy X-rays was not asked because by the time researchers could view these pictures the investigation was over. This incident was never adequately investigated. When the HSCA Report was being written Chief Counsel Robert Blakey hired Richard Billings of Time-Life to assist him. Notably, Billings was also the son-in-law of C.D. Jackson – ”Henry Luce’s personal emissary to the CIA” according to Washington Post investigative reporter Carl Bernstein. Recall that Billings had also been a member of the failed Bayo-Pawley Mission to Cuba in September of 1963 along with mafia and CIA-connected operatives, to smuggle Soviet colonels into the U.S. Although William Pawley committed suicide prior to being interviewed by HSCA staffer Gaeton Fonzi, nothing regarding the Bayo-Pawley mission was mentioned in the HSCA Report. Blakey in his introduction to the HSCA Report noted, “Realizing that there would be an opportunity for others to fill in the details – that there might be indictments and trials as a result of future investigation –", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:231:cfe46c574b5a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 525, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 232, "text": "in September of 1963 along with mafia and CIA-connected operatives, to smuggle Soviet colonels into the U.S. Although William Pawley committed suicide prior to being interviewed by HSCA staffer Gaeton Fonzi, nothing regarding the Bayo-Pawley mission was mentioned in the HSCA Report. Blakey in his introduction to the HSCA Report noted, “Realizing that there would be an opportunity for others to fill in the details – that there might be indictments and trials as a result of future investigation – we decided to present an understated case.” Let’s ponder some of the sobering facts determined by the HSCA “understated” case as seen by reporter Jim Marrs: The Dallas police withheld from the Warren Commission relevant information about Ruby’s entry to the Police basement when Oswald was shot. The Secret Service was deficient in performing its duties in connection with the assassination. The FBI; performed with varying degrees of competency and failed to investigate adequately the possibility of conspiracy. The CIA lied to the Warren Commission, the HSCA, and the ARRB regarding Joannides connection to DRE. The CIA violated its own charter and ran a covert operation to subvert the HSCA – an outrageous breach of the agency’s charter and the laws of our country.” Staff attorneys Dan Hardaway and Edwin Lopez revealed that after Joannides assumed the role of CIA liaison to the HSCA that access to CIA documents was tightly controlled, the process was slowed down, they were not able to get access to as many people, and many of the CIA files were then expurgated. Could it have been some other malcontent who Mr. Oswald met casually? Could not as much as three or four societal outcasts with no ties to any organization have developed in some spontaneous way a common determination to express their alienation in the killing of President Kennedy? Is it possible that two persons acting independently attempted to shoot the President at the same time? Newsweek claimed it was a “Rush to Judgment.” No new evidence generated by the HSCA was discussed except for the acoustical evidence of a police Dictaphone belt. “But the trail from there was old and cold … and neither speculation nor science nor the committee itself could point the way ahead.… The failure of the committee was precisely that it cried conspiracy with so much haste, so little deliberation – and so such scantly guidance for any new attempt to pick up the pieces.” Newsweek carefully quoted the two HSCA committeemen who questioned the 5-2-majority opinion “if two robbers bursting through separate doors into the same bank at the same time they are probably in cahoots.” Ranking Republican Sam Devine argued, “that connecting two gunmen in a crowd of 10,000 people was an assumption based upon an assumption.” The New York Times initially buried their story on page 37 –“experts say that second gunman almost certainly shot at Kennedy.”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:232:15f4b42d67c8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 526, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 233, "text": "to pick up the pieces.” Newsweek carefully quoted the two HSCA committeemen who questioned the 5-2-majority opinion “if two robbers bursting through separate doors into the same bank at the same time they are probably in cahoots.” Ranking Republican Sam Devine argued, “that connecting two gunmen in a crowd of 10,000 people was an assumption based upon an assumption.” The New York Times initially buried their story on page 37 –“experts say that second gunman almost certainly shot at Kennedy.” The editors similarly suggested a “coincidence theory” of history, that if there were a shot from the grassy knoll, perhaps “two independent assassins pulled their triggers in the self-same second.” The HSCA was “more interested in inflaming than informing.” The New York Times did print researcher Jim Lesar’s letter, chiding that the evidence was stronger than the New York Times editorial, which had been written by “two lone nuts.” Time, 1/15/79 , spent just three paragraphs on the “unexpected” and “bewildering” conclusions of the HSCA. The challenges of this brief, under-funded Congressional Committee were unmentioned, and few of its findings were revealed. No mention was made concerning fruitful lines of inquiry. “[The Report] said it did not know who might have conspired with Lee Harvey Oswald in the shooting, but it specifically excluded such familiar scapegoats as the FBI, the CIA, the Secret Service, the Soviet government, the Cuban government, all anti-Castro Cuban groups, and the Mafia.” After the HSCA report was released, Time 7/30/79 , claimed that “The committee’s conclusion appears to have outstripped its evidence.” Although eight of twelve HSCA members urged the Justice Department to continue the investigation, the most vocal critic on the HSCA, Harold Sawyer, was the only Congressman quoted – “supposition upon supposition upon supposition.… I’d have put it in the circular file.” The L.A. Times 7/17/79, relied on an AP report “Panel Sees Plot in Kennedy’s Death” subtitled “Probe Finds Possible Mob Involvement.” Mafiosi Sam Giancana and Carlos Marcello were “cited by the panel as the most likely family bosses of organized crime to have participated in such a unilateral assassination plan.” They noted that the panel said that the President “was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.… The committee also was reported to have concluded that both the Warren Commission and the FBI performed inadequately in exploring the possibility of a conspiracy in Kennedy’s death.” The brief article concluded with HSCA Chief Commission Counsel G. Robert Blakey “has firmly supported the conspiracy theory.… There were two assassins there, I believe it is based on evidence and I think you would too if you saw the evidence I saw.” The following day, the L.A. Times story by Ronald Ostrow focused on the tenuous nature of the evidence, four of the twelve dissenting HSCA members, and possible mafia connections. HSCA Chief Carl Stokes “Admits conspiracy evidence is less than clear and convincing.”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:233:e05e23d1a8f7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 527, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 234, "text": "HSCA Chief Commission Counsel G.

HSCA Chief Carl Stokes “Admits conspiracy evidence is less than clear and convincing.” Richardson Preyer, chairman of the HSCA, conceded that the report “left some major questions unanswered.” He admonished, “But the more the nation knows about these assassinations, the better. Truth does make us free.” In “Conspiracies End” (9/22/79), he started by commending the HSCA for “an inquiry conducted with due thoroughness and skepticism,” yet asserted that it has “some preposterous claims,” and “in the end the same desperate grasping at the straws of conspiracy [as with the Martin Luther King case].” Bethell viewed Congressman Sawyer’s rebuttal to the acoustical evidence as “devastating.” He then pleaded for the press to bury the HSCA report. Then, heaven help us, we have the Lee Harvey Oswald-David Ferrie connection, dredged up from Garrison’s investigation. There never was any credible evidence that Oswald even knew Ferrie… but the committee seems hypnotized by the fact that Ferrie knew Carlos Marcello, the Louisiana tomato salesman and reputed Mafia boss. Years ago, when Jim Garrison came out with his assorted linkages and called them a conspiracy, the heavy artillery of the press pounded away at the eccentric DA – with some justice, as I ruefully noted at the time from my precarious vantage point in his office. Where is that artillery today…?55 The Nation responded (12/22/79) to the HSCA by mocking official, journalistic and citizen efforts. “Conspiracies Unlimited – The Assassination Circus” by Frank Donner was more psychological speculation of Oswald and James Earl Ray than a forensic update. Donner condemned some useless and misleading research, yet chose to view the new information as merely “wispy leads.” He admonished – “Is it not time to abandon the escapism, media hustle and radical chic of political conspiraphobia and face the desperate challenge of organizing a left movement in this country?” A 50-year secrecy lid on testimony, reports and other documents generated by the House Assassinations Committee has private researchers and historians fuming.… An estimated 800 boxes of files – much of it testimony in executive session – has been restricted from public access and are not accessible by the Freedom of Information Act.… G. Robert Blakey, who was Chief Counsel to the HSCA said he is “sure the critics are uptight … this followed the normal rules of the house” The dean of assassination researchers, Harold Weisberg … said “the only reason they chose to do it (restrict material) was so they could hide it.” Also sealed for 50 years", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:234:74438695e904", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 528, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 235, "text": "of it testimony in executive session – has been restricted from public access and are not accessible by the Freedom of Information Act.… G.

Very little of the contents of the Fritz interview by the committee was released … Fritz told the Warren Commission he kept no notes during the interrogation of Oswald.… However, U.S. Postal inspector H.D. Holmes, present during some of the Oswald interrogation, told the Warren Commission he heard Oswald tell Fritz, “You took the notes, just read them, if you want to refresh your memory.” John Kinas, legislative aide to Rep. Floyd Fithian, D-Ind., a committee member stated “I am really surprised at that (sealing of all committee files)…” Remarkably, the most extensive coverage of the House Select Committee Report (HSCR), as well as critique and conjecture regarding the role of the U.S. government, came from the L.A. Free Press. The independent weekly, published by Art Kunkin, devoted an entire issue to exploring conspiracies and cover-ups regarding the assassinations of President Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Dr. Martin Luther King. The mainstream media avoided any documentary overview similar to that which CBS aired to “illustrate” the Warren Report. In sum, the brief post-Watergate phase of independent journalism barely changed the coverage of the assassination. The leaked copy of the Zapruder film afforded a cautious ABC in 1975 the chance to air it on Goodnight America. The death of the feared J. Edgar Hoover seemingly enabled some mainstream sources to explore the FBI connections to the assassination and cover-ups as well as a call for a new investigation. The Congressional investigation of CIA activities seemed to catalyze mass media cooperation to limit congress as well as media coverage of national security issues, in part to counter the “neo-McCarthyism” claims from some in the press. CBS cooperated with the CIA on their assassination series, and soon thereafter fired experienced reporter Daniel Schorr for leaking the classified Congressional Intelligence Report on CIA activities – the Pike Report. The New York Times, the Washington Post, and to a lesser extent the LA Times, then viciously attacked the initial HSCA counsel Richard Sprague, who had started an aggressive investigation. The San Francisco Chronicle and the Dallas Morning News ran a few investigative pieces during the HSCA hearings but most of the media, alternative, and mainstream, waited for the final report.

The San Francisco Chronicle and the Dallas Morning News ran a few investigative pieces during the HSCA hearings but most of the media, alternative, and mainstream, waited for the final report. Despite debilitating constraints, the House Select Committee Report still broke considerable new ground, yet the mass media generally elected not to pursue the numerous vital new leads. The New York Times, Time, Newsweek, the Washington Post and the L.A. Times denigrated even these cautious findings. They even suggested a “coincidence theory,” with two independent assassins firing at the same time. Fifteen years after the assassination, questioning the legitimacy of the political institutions remained off limits during the Cold War. Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu sees the influences of the market, political leaders, and the lack of time and information, as causing journalism to create “a vision [which] is at once dehistoricized and dehistoricizing, fragmented and fragmenting.” Further, some media confusion is “struck in all innocence and all the more effective for being unconscious.… There is a sense in which this can only be done because the people who practice this violence are themselves victims of the violence they practice, and this is where we get the false science of the half-educated that likes to give the appearance of scientific ratification to the institution of common sense.”56 The American press, to it discredits, has generally played down the achievements of the Assassination Committee or brushed its conclusions aside. This lethargy may stem in part from the fact thatsixteen years ago – there was no serious attempt at investigative reporting of the Kennedy assassination… The alternative press, weaker than in the previous decade, seemingly wanted to build a new progressive movement rather than pursue the assassination. The New Republic called for the press to criticize even the cautious House Select Committee Report (HSCR.) The vigilant Village Voice, and to a lesser extent the L.A. Free Press, Spotlight, Harper’s and Gallery, pushed to pursue the new leads. A few assassination researchers ran radio shows including George Michael Evica on WWUH in Connecticut, and Mae Brussell with “Dialogue: Conspiracy” on KAZU-FM in California.

Perhaps in part they re-T flected a national desire for a calmer time and an executive branch more resistant to declassification. Except for the 25^(th) year commemorative coverage, the Reagan-Bush era helped the case drift quietly into history. The CIA excesses revealed in the 1970’s pushed Congress to enact the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). The Reagan-Bush administration resisted these reforms and appointed former spy, financier, and media mogul William Casey to head the CIA. Casey controlled Cap Cities, which owned ABC as well as a number of newspapers. Casey’s OSS experience with propaganda and disinformation could be targeted against America despite Reagan’s executive order #12333 which prohibited this.1 A few print journalists from major media outlets had steadily developed leads; maybe the most effective during this period was Earl Golz of the Dallas Morning News. Golz constantly fought with his editors to continue his investigation. In the early 1970s Golz published one of his stories in the Village Voice as leverage against his editors. “I kind of blackmailed them to run it.” By 1979, however, his managing editor saw Golz’s reporting as a crusade, which needed to be set aside. I am increasingly bothered by the amount of time and energy being devoted to further investigation of the JFK theories. The investigation of assassination theories, I fear, had become something of a personal crusade on your part. A crusade which consumes great amounts of your time but produced virtually nothing that this newspaper can or will use. If you please, I think it’s time your energies will be more immediately productive. Similarly, Peter Kihss of the New York Times wrote numerous critical articles on the Kennedy assassination, but usually they were not printed. Inside The Times Kihss was dubbed “Crazy Peter” and this mocking atmosphere contributed to his resignation. Jim Marrs, as a reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram was told “not to write any more about the Kennedy assassination as it was upsetting people at the Petroleum Club.”2 The Washington Post perspective on the role of the CIA and the assassination had not been modified even two years after the HSCR was released. Anthony Summers had completed a comprehensive book on the assassination, Conspiracy, which incorporated HSCA findings and developed some of the leads regarding the link between CIA officer David Phillips and Maurice Bishop. Summers called the Washington Post editor, Ben Bradlee to alert him to the Phillips-Bishop material.

A few weeks later Post reporter David Lee was assigned to the Phillips-Bishop leads but was admonished by his editor that he should demolish the story. Lee proceeded to develop the story and actually confirmed what Summers had written. Lee’s probe, however, was never printed. Around this time Summers presented his findings to an eclectic social gathering hosted by Norman Mailer. Summers inadvertently critiqued the denigrating introduction to the new Bantam publication of the HSCR, by New York Times editor Tom Wicker. Unknown to Summers, Wicker was at the party, and confessed that he was under a deadline and didn’t have the time to read all of the material he needed. Wicker then promised to read Summers’ book on his vacation and then they would get together to talk about it. But he never called Summers, and never returned Summers’ calls. After 18 months, Summers stopped calling.3 The Gallery, 3/81, printed another provocative piece by Dick Russell “The Man who had a Contract to Kill Lee Harvey Oswald before the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy.” We learn of double agent Richard Case Nagell, who was trailing Oswald in late 1963 for the KGB to try and stop an assassination attempt on President Kennedy. Nagell, unclear as to whether the CIA or KGB had ordered him to shoot Oswald, and unwilling to live abroad away from his family, placed himself in federal custody in El Paso (He shot a gun into the ceiling of a bank and sat down to be arrested). While there, two FBI agents as well as Secret Service agents visited him. Nagell was released from Leavenworth Penitentiary April 1968, but was never questioned by the HSCA.4 President Ronald Reagan confronted the press with the most widespread effort to restrict information in our peace-time history. Presidential Executive Order 12356 on classification reversed a 25-year trend toward making government information more accessible. Agencies now classified at the highest level when “in doubt.” The principle of declassification after 20 years was reversed, and FOIA requests were delayed. The American Society of Newspaper Editors characterized Reagan’s orders as “peacetime censorship of a scope unparalleled in this country since the adoption of the Bill of Rights.”5 Mass media and intellectual coverage of the assassination disappeared for a few years until it was explored by Christopher Lasch in his story “The Life of Kennedy’s Death,” Harper’s 10/83.

Lasch asserted that while many liberals have attributed the assassination to a “climate of hatred,” and that the mainstream press likewise stayed in a “psychiatric mode,” concentrating on what the assassin’s action revealed about the American character, rather than reviewing the evidence. …This pseudo-introspection did not address the still unanswered questions about the location of the shots that killed the President, the nature of his wounds, or the special circumstances that might have led to the shooting. Instead it addressed the pseudo-question, even if one accepted its dubious premise that Oswald acted alone, on the social meaning of his crime. …It replied to a popular speculation about conspiracy with its own kind of speculation about conspiracy mentality, which reached a climax in the report of the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, issued in October of 1969. Like the Warren Report, Assassination and Political Violence began by assuming Oswald’s guilt and went on to build an elaborate structure of speculation on this shaky premise. In the section one the “Psychology a presidential assassins” the commission found a common pattern of family disruption … hostility toward mother and authority figures … loners. Lasch disputed a widespread belief by “liberal intellectuals” who “dismiss the conspiratorial view of history as an irrational view held only by a naïve and untutored minds.” He included a Gallup poll which showed “opinion in the case of the Kennedy assassination is basically the same up and down the socioeconomic scale, with no more than one person in seven in any demographic group holding onto the belief that Oswald acted alone.” 6 He claimed, “The most remarkable feature surrounding the assassination is not the abundance of conspiracy theories, but the rejection of conspiracies by the ‘best and brightest.” While uncritical of President Johnson’s role, he lambasted Garrison for his “rhetorical exaggerations and his unsubstantiated charges against Johnson.” Lasch portrayed the left as spreading “wild and wishful theories … the CIA, the FBI, Texas oilman, the radical right, Lyndon Johnson and international bankers.” What we know of the assassination suggests that Kennedy was the victim of bungling intervention in this case by the misguided effort to get rid of Castro-encouraged by the dream of Imperial greatness and unlimited power.

John F. Kennedy was killed, in all likelihood not by a sick society or some supposedly archetypal, resentful common man but a political conspiracy his own actions may have helped set in motion. The mythology of his death can no longer prop up the mythology of his life. The Wall Street Journal covered the 20th anniversary (11/22/83) of the assassination with Edward Epstein’s story, “Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald.” Formerly a critic of the Warren Commission, who worked closely with CIA counterintelligence Chief James Angleton, he had became a purveyor of the Oswald-as-Communist dupe perspective. Epstein omitted almost all of Oswald’s connections to the FBI, military intelligence, and the CIA in a manner that would have made Angleton proud. Critics were characterized as “excessively fascinated; if not entirely blinded … buffs.” Oswald was linked to the Soviet downing of U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers; however, Oswald’s top-secret clearance at Atsugi, Japan, where he worked as a radar operator was unmentioned. The sole CIA officer Oswald was to have met was George de Mohrenschildt but only as a “friend” to debrief him. Epstein treated questions raised by the HSCA as irrelevant. WSJ even sketched Oswald with a hammer and sickle behind his head.7 In 1984 the populist conservative Liberty Lobby and their weekly newspaper, the Spotlight, won their appeal regarding the statement by CIA officer Victor Marchetti that a CIA memo indicated that CIA agent E. Howard Hunt was in Dallas the day of the assassination. During the appeal lawyer Mark Lane revealed testimony from CIA operative Marita Lorenz that Watergate burglar Hunt was working with Jack Ruby and Frank Sturgis in November 1963, and was allegedly the paymaster for the assassination. Although these revelations could have opened up the Watergate trial as well as the assassination of President Kennedy, the mass media did not explore them.8 Attorney Mark Lane could not even find a publisher for his book about the trial, Plausible Denial, until independent publisher Thunders Mouth Press agreed years later. The relentless Penn Jones broadened his investigation with a piece “Disappearing Witnesses” published in the tiny alternative magazine The Rebel in January 1984. He noted more than 100 murders, suicides and mysterious deaths – the strange fate of those who saw or knew about the assassination of President Kennedy. Reagan’s Director of the CIA, William Casey, in May 1986 increased pressure on the media by reinterpreting the 1917 Espionage Act.

Washington Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee admitted that the Post had withheld information from more than a dozen stories so far this year “for reasons of national security.”9 On the twenty-fifth anniversary of the assassination of John Kennedy the broadcast media aired several new programs which reached a wider share of the public than at any time since 1963. The new television documentaries included CBS’s “Four Days in November,” “The Kwitny Report” aired over selected PBS stations, “America Exposé: Who Murdered JFK?” (Narrated by Jack Anderson) over FOX Network, PBS’s NOVA ran “Who Shot President Kennedy” narrated by Walter Cronkite, Viewpoint 88: “The Men who killed JFK” produced by Nigel Turner for British Central Television, and “The Killing of JFK: A Conspiracy of the Mob?” developed by Geraldo Rivera and aired on NBC. Significant new information was revealed, along with the recycling of several discredited theories. Dan Rather hosted the two-hour documentary, “Four Days in November,” and noted that this “hastily prepared biography … make(s) no comment on the past, we only bring it back,” without lamenting the lost opportunity to clarify festering concerns. This piece was part paean to the power of television as a national narcotic: “Hour after hour, day after day, from murder to burial, the flow of images and pictures calmed the panic. Someone has said that those four days marked the coming of the age of television.” CBS never contrasted the precise care, custom, and reverence in the burial of President Kennedy with either his lack of protection in life, or the confused process of examining his assassination. CBS did show the Zapruder film, but chose not to analyze it regarding location or number of shots or wounds. Rather avowed that “(back in 1963) it [the Zapruder film] was not shown for ‘legal reasons’.” This documentary served to legitimate the reporters efforts based on past public discourse. Sociologists refer to this as rhetorical legitimation, whereby narratives beget authority, which begets memories, which beget more narratives, which beget more authority, and so on.

Former CBS producer Robert Richter produced and directed it and former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite narrated. This oft-shown program attempted to reconcile critical research with the HSCA version, yet clarity was sometimes sacrificed for brevity and bias. Oswald’s presence on the sixth floor at the time of the assassination was assumed since he worked there that morning. No mention was made of witnesses Eddie Piper and Carolyn Arnold who saw Oswald other places after noon, or of Bonnie Ray Williams, the TSBD employee who testified that Oswald left the sixth floor at about 12:20 and he saw no one there. Witnesses Ruby Henderson, Carolyn Walther, Arnold Rowland and prisoner John Powell have stated that either a person with a dark complexion was in the “sniper’s nest” or two people were there. No mention was made of the Dallas police reports of a German-Mauser rifle being found first. Cronkite said that Oswald’s palm print was later found on the Manlicher-Carcano rifle, not mentioning that the palm print was actually found three days later – according to FBI agent Vincent Drain who had stated this to author Henry Hurt in 1984.10 Cronkite asserted that “cartridges and fragments from the presidential limousine were all ballistically traced to Oswald’s rifle.” According to HSCA studies, Connally’s’ wrist fragment contained 850% more copper, 2400% more sodium and 1100% more chlorine than Bullet 399, the so-called magic bullet. NOVA neglected to note this. No mention was made of Oswald’s testing negative in a paraffin test of his face – indicating he probably did not fire a rifle that day. NOVA attempted to defend the single-bullet theory with a computer model of Dealey Plaza. The first shot, which missed according to the Warren Commission and the HSCA, somehow occurred earlier than Zapruder frame 169, but no rationale was given. NOVA speculated that if the President was leaning forward and Governor Connally was turning to his right, as he said he was, then the angle lines up with the sixth floor. This assumes that: 1) Kennedy and Connally were sitting further apart than pictures and the Zapruder film indicate; 2) that Connally turns and returns to facing forward in less than 1/8 of a second after he is hit; and 3) that Connally moves backwards in order to move to the right. Thus Cronkite declared that the “single-bullet theory can’t be ruled out.” NOVA failed to mention that more grains of the “magic bullet” were found in Connally’s body than were lost from the bullet. Next NOVA explored the hypothesis of David Lifton,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:242:83e775d538a2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 536, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 243, "text": "pictures and the Zapruder film indicate; 2) that Connally turns and returns to facing forward in less than 1/8 of a second after he is hit; and 3) that Connally moves backwards in order to move to the right.

Next NOVA explored the hypothesis of David Lifton, that the wounds of the President were altered. Four of the doctors at Parkland – McClelland, Peters, Jenkins and Dulaney, went to the National Archives to view for the first time (off-camera) the autopsy pictures. Dr. Dulaney though worked only on Governor Connally. Although Dulaney’s role was not clarified by NOVA, he commented that, “I don’t see any evidence of any alteration of his wound in these pictures from what I saw in the Emergency Room.” Dr. McClelland was not asked to explain his Warren Commission testimony about the head wound exposing the cerebellum, which he noted at Parkland to be partially “blasted out.” In a documentary developed by KRON-TV San Francisco, 11/18/88, McClelland stated, “a portion of the cerebellum fell onto the table as we were doing the tracheotomy.” Curiously, on NOVA, McClelland commented that examining the head wound was “not the appropriate thing to do at the time.” Drs. Peters and Jenkins both stated that they could have been mistaken about the cerebellum during a time of urgency. Although McClelland, Peters, and Jenkins had all previously stated their belief that the wound in the back of the head was one of exit, NOVA chose not to ask the doctors whether the wound was one of entrance or exit. NOVA then chose to use an old film clip in which Dr. John Lattimer fired at a skull filled with white paint that supposedly showed that a shot from the back could snap the head backwards. Critics have long contended that this research is useless since the skull was not attached to a human body wearing a rigid back brace, which President Kennedy was wearing. NOVA neglected to note these objections. Cronkite finally did concede that he understood why this case had become a “national obsession.” He called for “a new rifle test, a new acoustics test, an examination of the brain if it is ever found, an analysis for traces of blood on the bullet … but the ultimate solution to the mystery may lie outside the domain of science.”11 “The Kennedy Report” special, by Jonathan Kwitny, viewed the Warren Commission as “hopelessly inconclusive” and briefly explored a range of theories, before focusing on organized crime boss Carlos Marcello. Kwitny rejected motives for the CIA or for Castro.

Kwitny rejected motives for the CIA or for Castro. HSCA investigator Edwin Lopez stated that after studying the CIA surveillance photographs purported to be of Oswald visiting the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City that they were not pictures of Oswald. This supported FBI director J. Edgar Hoover’s memo that someone impersonated Oswald at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City. Kwitny observed that this pointed to a conspiracy, but he then drifted from the role of the CIA to a focus on Carlos Marcello. He explored Marcello’s links to Dallas mob boss Joseph Civello through the testimony of Joseph Nellis, a former assistant council from the Kefauver Senate Committee on organized crime. Kwitny also revealed a videotaped conversation between journalist Dan Moldea and Jimmy Hoffa Jr. in which Hoffa confirmed that his dad knew Jack Ruby and was close to Marcello.12 I could never buy an idea that Lee did not like or want to kill President Kennedy. Everything that I learned about President Kennedy was good through Lee. (Marina no longer claimed that the rifle shown for her by the Warren Commission was Oswald’s) … someone could plant the rifle … I had been used by the Warren Commission … that investigated so dishonestly sometimes to make Lee a guilty party … I was very easy to mold at the time … young, immature and naïve … he [Oswald] was working for the government, and he was just simply infiltrating groups. He was doing what he was told to do.… He was implicated in the plot. Anderson showed videotaped interviews with three witnesses who claimed to have seen Oswald with Ruby. Carousel Club waitress Esther Ann Marsh, Dallas attorney Carroll Jarnagin, and Madeline Brown, who claimed to be LBJ’s longtime mistress, all said they saw Oswald and Ruby together, just weeks prior to the assassination. Anderson interviewed Dallas Policeman Malcolm Summers, who testified that he ran up the grassy knoll after the assassination, the direction from where he thought at least one shot had been fired. He then encountered someone who appeared to be concealing a rifle under his coat. This person showed Secret Service credentials and told Summers to back off. Investigators were later informed by the Secret Service that none of their agents were assigned to Dealey Plaza 11/22. Retired Dallas Policeman Billy Grammer stated that he received a telephone warning Saturday, that Oswald would be killed the next day.

Grammer thought that the call came from Jack Ruby, although he was not certain. Grammer stated that the caller seemed to be aware of the plans to transfer Oswald to the Dallas County Jail, knew about the decoy vehicle, and the time of the transfer. The program included re-enactments of CIA-Mafia-Cuban exiles attempts to assassinate Castro, the mysterious killings of Sam Giancana and Johnny Roselli, and the wild drinking party at Pat Kirkwood’s Cellar Door nightclub the night prior to the assassination with nine Secret Service men present. Kirkwood suggested that Ruby might have sent some of his strippers over that night. Anderson also showed a videotaped interview with Dr. Victor Weiss, head of Psychiatry at East Louisiana State Hospital, who examined Rose Cheramie, the injured prostitute who had warned that JFK would be killed 11/22/63. Weiss stated that Cheramie was certain and that “the word was out in the New Orleans underworld” about a contract on Kennedy. Anderson continued to rely exclusively on Johnny Roselli’s story that Castro retaliated for the U.S. attempts on his life by using Santos Trafficante to coordinate the assassination. Just one of Oswald’s ties to American intelligence was explored; however, since Oswald’s uncle was the numbers runner for Carlos Marcello, Oswald was again portrayed a mob pawn.13 Mark Lane cast some doubts regarding Ruby’s access to the transfer of Oswald and the complicity of the Dallas Police Department. Jim Leavelle, Dallas Police Captain, recalls numerous phone death threats for Oswald but viewed them merely as threats. Notably, Leavelle’s fellow employee, Bill Grammer, again stated that one of the threats he heard was definitely Ruby’s – since he knew Ruby, and claimed to have recognized the voice. Seth Kantor described his encounter with Ruby in Parkland Hospital, just after JFK was shot, which contradicted the statements of Jerry Coley of the Dallas Morning News, who claimed that Ruby stayed at the newspaper. A small clip of Ruby stating there was “a complete conspiracy against me” was shown, but no mention was made of Ruby’s nine meetings with the FBI, his pleadings to Chief Justice Earl Warren to be transferred from Dallas to Washington because he feared for his life, his numerous Mafia connections or his televised prison statements asserting that “people in high places” were involved. Paul O’Connor, a Navy medical technician at Bethesda stated that he found the body in a body bag, and that was not the rubber sheet in which Kennedy left Dallas.

O’Connor insisted that the body arrived 15 to 20 minutes prior to the ambulance carrying the bronze coffin from Andrews Air Force Base, and that it was in a cheap shipping casket. Dennis David said that the body arrived in a black ambulance “like a hearse,” and the President’s body was in “just a gray casket … a metal shipping casket … not the bronze casket.”14 In 1988 Washington Post reporter George Lardner recycled a rationale echoed by many reporters, “We Evaded the Truth Then, And Now It Can’t Be Found Out.” The NOVA program “Who Shot President Kennedy” also concluded that we will probably never know the truth. This rationale justifies no further investigation, which leads to a self-fulfilling prophesy. Newsweek, 11/28/88, in its one-page piece for the 25th anniversary of the assassination pondered in “The Kennedy Conundrum: Still too many questions – and too many answers.” Mafia “conspiracy” theorists were mentioned and critiqued by asking simply: 1) Why would Oswald be used?; 2) Why would a $21.00 mail order rifle be used?; and 3) How could Ruby be induced to murder Oswald in full view of cops and cameras? The Zapruder film, they contended for the first time, “proved” that Oswald did not have time to fire the shots, which hit Kennedy and Connally.15 The controversial British Central Independent Television series, The Men Who Killed Kennedy, produced by Nigel Turner, was briefly mentioned in the American media. It aired in more than twenty countries, though it would be three years before a re-edited version was shown in America, on The History Channel and A&E. In one segment, reporter Steve Rivele relied on information from two convicted French drug smugglers, Christian David and Michel Nicoli, who claimed to have cooperated with U.S. Mafiosi. Despite this conjecture, the documentary revealed some significant interviews. Dealey Plaza witness Gordon Arnold, who was on the grassy knoll next to the picket fence at the time of the assassination, stated that shots came from behind him. Newsweek saw the documentary as “a miniscule corner of a puzzle that never seems to come together – and which, like any one of a hundred such details, can seduce the most rational observer into obsession.”16 Geraldo Rivera’s programs, 11/21 and 11/22, focused on organized crime and extended the previous interviews with LBJ’s mistress Madeline Brown, Esther Ann Marsh, and Governor and Mrs. Connally.

Rivera read a letter from LBJ’s estate attorney, recently published in People Magazine, stating that the Johnson estate would continue to support Brown, as was LBJ’s desire. Brown asserted that in addition to seeing Oswald and Ruby together in Dallas, she had a vague impression that Lyndon Johnson knew President Kennedy would be killed. In Geraldo’s other interview Dallas waitress Esther Ann Marsh claimed that she saw Oswald and Ruby together numerous time at the Carousel Club. She believed that Ruby was involved with the mob. Governor Connally reconfirmed his belief that he was not hit by the shot that hit President Kennedy.17 Life’s December 1988 cover story, “Why We Still Care” by Lisa Grunwald, characterized the assassination as an “American obsession” prolonged by “buffs.” The Warren Report and the actions of Life regarding the Zapruder film were again defended. Grunwald psychologized that “people want to give meaning to a random event even like the assassination.” The first copies of this magazine, published two weeks after John F. Kennedy’s killing, sold out immediately as a grieving America, seeking a memoir of its sadness, turned to Life… We believe this account to be richer than any anniversary review could be. We have reprinted our original for the 100 million Americans who are too young to remember, and for those too old to forget – the assassination of a President. This replay of mind-numbing sadness, which chose to ignore the HSCA and all of the new leads, was endorsed by Forbes “In the November Life some of the most vividly famous photographs of the instant and stunning aftermath…” (12/5/88) The validation of Time-Life was repeated in the CBS-Washington Post series on the assassination, which included a montage of some of the best-known photos of the assassination, most of them from Life magazine. Nevertheless, in 1988 President Reagan abolished the Fairness Doctrine as a favor to broadcast media elites who supported his election. FCC Chairman Mark Fowler mocked critics’ concerns about diminished democracy – “Television is just another appliance – a toaster with pictures.” They rationalized that the rapid rise of cable TV satisfied the Supreme Court’s apparent concern for diverse sources of information. Broadcasters recognized no obligation to air views other than their own. The Reagan administration embraced some strategies to spin the media which they called “perception management.” For example, CIA disinformation specialist Walter Raymond Jr. was shifted from the CIA to the NSC to coordinate “public diplomacy,” targeting the foreign and U.S. press as well as Congress, to sell administration policies.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:247:d18c8904b942", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 541, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 248, "text": "They rationalized that the rapid rise of cable TV satisfied the Supreme Court’s apparent concern for diverse sources of information.

When Newsweek reporter Robert Parry confronted one of Reagan’s public diplomacy people about Iran-Contra, he was told to back down or “We will controversialize you.”18 Journalist and author Andrew Kreig asserts that middle management worried about government retribution and costs. However, “the more insidious problem as media conglomerates and their debt grew in the 1980’s was that the media’s ownership increasingly overlapped with government leadership and the higher-ups who controlled the news organizations and government”19 Professor Jerry Rose published and edited The Third Decade: A Journal of Research on the John F. Kennedy Assassination. Researcher Mae Brussell cancelled her weekly radio show due to numerous death threats. After the brief round of solid reporting for the 25th commemoration academe, government, and the media appeared content to let the case drift into history, until Oliver Stone jolted the country with his film JFK. While the mass media greeted the findings of the 1979 HSCRwith indifference and disdain, the film JFK (1991) provokedsome good reporting as well as vitriolic debate and hyperbole. The movie, and even the idea of the movie, was viciously attacked by much of the mainstream media, primarily by journalists active at the time of the assassination. Oliver Stone was mocked as a historian. However, many younger journalists and film critics disagreed, and more than 15 million Americans saw the movie. JFK generated a deep groundswell of political pressure to release the remaining classified documents. It became the first American movie to lead directly to a law, (Senate J.R 282 HJR 454) which created the Assassination Records and Review Board. The ARRB ultimately declassified close to five-million pages of government documents, which the public and Congress had not seen. In early May of 1991, Oliver Stone had just started filming JFK in Dallas, yet a litany of derisive mass media criticism had already been hurled against it. Jon Margolis, a syndicated columnist for the Chicago Tribune, warned that JFK would prove an insult to intelligence and “decency.” In “JFK Movie and Book Attempt to Rewrite History,” 5/14/91; Margolis claimed, “There is a point at which intellectual myopia becomes morally repugnant. Mr. Stone’s new movie proves that he has passed that point. But then so has [producer] Time-Warner and so will anyone who pays American money to see the film.” How Margolis could give this warning without seeing a screenplay remains unclear.

But then so has [producer] Time-Warner and so will anyone who pays American money to see the film.” How Margolis could give this warning without seeing a screenplay remains unclear. Reporters from the Boston Globe, Boston Herald, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, and Time magazine and several other outlets were known to have been prowling around the JFK set looking for angles.1 George Lardner’s, 5/19/91, Washington Post review of Stone’s movie, “On the Set: Dallas in Wonderland” viewed the Garrison investigation as “zany” and a “fraud.” This lengthy and disingenuous review was published six months prior to the release of JFK and was based on a leaked or stolen first draft of the movie (ultimately there were six versions). Lardner wrote that HSCA “may have” heard testimony linking Oswald with Ferrie with the CIA, yet since he had covered the HSCA he should have known that they found this testimony convincing. Then he imaginatively asserted that the HSCA “may also have” heard no such thing. Lardner discarded the Dallas Police treatment of the so-called “three tramps,” who were arrested in the railroad yard just north of Dealey Plaza, (where more than one-third of the eyewitnesses believed shots came from) – but were not questioned at all. Lardner said that even if the police had taken their names, those who believe a conspiracy occurred “would just insist the men had lied about who they were.” He mocked the stolen first-draft version of the screenplay for arguing that as many as five or six shots were fired. “Is this the Kennedy assassination or the Charge of the Light Brigade?” However, the House Select Committee Report stated that, “Six sequences of impulses were initially identified as having been transmitted over channel 1 [of the police radio]. Thus they warrant further analysis.” Lardner elected not to pursue this conundrum, but belatedly acknowledged “that a probable conspiracy took place.” Oliver Stone’s response to the Washington Post was heavily edited.2 In June 1991, ostensibly clarifying a major foreign policy contention in JFK, Lardner wrote in the Washington Post that after the assassination National Security Action Memorandum, NSAM 273 merely continued NSAM 263 and “ordered the withdrawal of 1000 troops [from Vietnam] to be carried out.” It did not, since only a couple-hundred non-combat individuals were withdrawn by the end of the year. Time’s story By Richard Zoglin, 7/1/91, “More Shots in Dealey Plaza” portrays Stone’s version of events as “near the far out fringe,” which has “outraged” experts on the assassination. David Belin, former counsel to the Warren Commission and the Rockefeller Commission predictably called the partial script, “A bunch of hokum.” Stone was accused", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:249:3b434f910520", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 543, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 250, "text": "withdrawal of 1000 troops [from Vietnam] to be carried out.” It did not, since only a couple-hundred non-combat individuals were withdrawn by the end of the year.

David Belin, former counsel to the Warren Commission and the Rockefeller Commission predictably called the partial script, “A bunch of hokum.” Stone was accused of trying to block the production of a rival movie on the assassination, Libra, which Stone refuted in a letter to Time. Stone was quoted as trying to pay “homage” to President Kennedy, yet Zoglin claimed it “may wind up doing more harm than homage.” Esquire’s “The Shooting of JFK” (12/91) by Robert Sam Anson presented a raw, lengthy, unflattering critique, to which Oliver Stone responded. Anson started by quoting Stone: “What is history, who the fuck knows,” and “you call yourselves journalists? You have become Winston Smith [1984].… You just invent history … learn honesty.” Regarding the film JFK, “Stone has given as well as he has gotten,” while Stone saw those who challenged the film with controversy as trying to “maximize negative advance impact…” Anson saw Stone as seduced by Garrison, while Stone claims Anson’s old perspectives were inaccurate and were merely character assassination of Garrison. Anson discounted Colonel Fletcher Prouty as an “aide,” whereas Stone used Prouty, chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs, as a consultant. Stone asserted he was often misquoted, that he never tried to block Libra, that actor Kevin Costner helped with the script, that Madeline Brown was misquoted, and that he tried to understand history. Anson revealed the on-set arguments between Major John Newman and Colonel Fletcher Prouty, (the two men providing the basis of Mr. X) yet seemed to gloss over their areas of agreement. Anson provided more context and insider access to researchers than other articles during the period, yet his clever piece cut some corners on evidence, perhaps in part due to CIA-friendly source Gus Russo. The L.A. Times (12/15/91) story, “Opinion-The Political Rorschach Test” by Jefferson Morley, started, “How we make sense of the assassination of John F. Kennedy is directly related to how we make sense of public life.” He reminded us that every poll taken “over the last quarter century has shown between 60%80% of the public favoring conspiratorial explanation.” This supportive overview concluded, “The crime of the century remains unresolved less because we don’t know who fired the fatal shots than because there is no agreement whether the story of the Kennedy assassination should be invested with confidence in our national institutions or with fears of conspiratorial power.” James O’Byrne’s piece in the Times-Picayune “The Garrison Probe: The Story Hollywood Won’t Tell” lionized Clay Shaw and condemned Garrison as a “megalomaniac’” While Garrison’s procedural", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:250:7575cb576c6e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 544, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 251, "text": "the public favoring conspiratorial explanation.” This supportive overview concluded, “The crime of the century remains unresolved less because we don’t know who fired the fatal shots than because there is no agreement whether the story of the Kennedy assassination should be invested with confidence in our national institutions or with fears of conspiratorial power.” James O’Byrne’s piece in the Times-Picayune “The Garrison Probe: The Story Hollywood Won’t Tell” lionized Clay Shaw and condemned Garrison as a “megalomaniac’” While Garrison’s procedural challenges and mistakes got highlighted, none of Garrison’s useful leads or evidence got mentioned. O’Byrne denied that Clay Bertrand was Clay Shaw, he omitted Shaw’s ties to Oswald, as well as witness Perry Russo’s claims about pressure and bribery. O’Byrne closed by quoting one of Shaw’s friends claiming Garrison’s “cynicism was appalling.” (12/15/91) The New York Times Tom Wicker slammed JFK, 12/15/91, “Does JFK Conspire Against Reason. Oliver Stone transforms a discredited theory into the sole explanation for the assassination.” Wicker trotted out the discredited NBC broadcast, 6/19/67, by Walter Sheridan to claim Garrison threatened and bribed witnesses, and claimed “even by other conspiracy believers, [it was] a travesty of legal process.” Wicker ridiculed the notion that Kennedy may have been seen as “soft on communism” by “anyone active in Washington at that time. JFK may prove persuasive to audiences with little knowledge of events presented.” Wicker bristled at Stone’s assertions that the media were “paid off journalistic hacks” but sidestepped any discussion of the media’s performance. Stone’s “wild assertions … to propagate the one true faith – even though that faith … would be contemptuous of the very constitutional government Mr. Stone’s film purports to uphold.” Let me further suggest that the media itself is part of the problem and seems to resent it when an artist tries to interpret a history that Newsmen have failed to explain. From day one, the American media (in contrast to the foreign media) never looked for an honest motive in President Kennedy’s killing and accepted the cover story of Lee Harvey Oswald as lone assassin put out by government officials and reinforced by the appointed Warren Commission, which allowed the intelligence agencies to disclose files and investigate leads at their discretion. Mr. Wicker ignored the illegitimacy of Operation Mongoose, back-channel negotiations with Castro, and major defense cuts. Stone asserted that Wicker “ignores the fractious history of conflict with the Joint Chiefs over Laos and Vietnam, which is described in a new book by Major John Newman, JFK and Vietnam, and which was sent by my associates to Mr. Wicker in hopes that he would accept a fresh perspective.” Perhaps the nastiest and most contentious exchanges appeared in the Washington Post 12/24/91 piece by Gerald Ford and David Belin, which generated responses by Oliver Stone, Fletcher Prouty, Donald Squires, Jamie Aparisi, Cyril Wecht, and Harold Weisberg.

Ford and Belin blame the media for sensationalism, and claim that the commercial production of JFK and The Men Who Killed Kennedy use Hitler’s method of “the big lie.” “False charges of this kind are a desecration of the memory of President Kennedy, a desecration to the memory of Earl Warren and a fraudulent misrepresentation of the truth to the American public. “They ironically closed, if the press were ever to approach this with the kind of diligence and with the kind of fairness that the American people have a right to expect, then the over whelming majority of Americans will not only eventually understand the truth but will also understand the techniques of perpetuation of the big lie so the kind of deceptive techniques used by the producer of JFK and the A&E series The Men Who Killed Kennedy will be exposed to all to see…” Evidence: While the “Official” autopsy photos and x-rays do show that all shots came from the rear, the 26 trained medical personnel – doctors, nurses, technicians – who treated the president at Parkland Hospital testified to the Warren Commission that they saw an exit type wound in the head, a wound that is inconsistent with the photos and x-rays. Neither the Warren Commission nor the HSCA showed the photos and x-rays to the Dallas doctors. Until that happens, the medical evidence proves absolutely nothing. Evidence: Warren Commission counsel Joseph A. Ball questioned Brennan and found several reasons to doubt his credibility. Brennan’s account had several glaring inaccuracies with respect to the gunman’s clothing and his shooting position. Brennan could not identify Oswald as the gunman when he first viewed the police lineup. Two months later, Brennan repeated to the FBI that he wasn’t able to identify Oswald at the lineup. But in March 1964 Brennan told the Warren Commission that he could have identified Oswald as the gunman but he lied to protect himself and his family. Evidence: There is no chain of evidence for the four cartridge cases found at the scene. Both policemen who handled them marked them with their initials, but neither could identify the cases as the ones they turned in when they testified to the Warren Commission – they couldn’t find their initials. Furthermore, the cartridge cases-two Western-Winchester and two Remington-Peters – don’t match the bullets – three Western – Winchester, one Remington-Peters recovered from Tippit’s body.

All of Ford and Belin’s “evidence” comes from the Commission Volumes and Report – they ignored all the Commission Documents (not published in the volumes), all of the evidence turned up by the Garrison investigation, the 1975 Senate Intelligence Committee hearings, (the Church Committee) the House Select Committee on Assassinations investigation, and all of the evidence brought to light over the years by private researchers and scholars through the Freedom of Information Act. Jonathan Kwitny’s story in the Wall Street Journal “A Better Conspiracy Theory than Oliver Stone’s” pointed toward the mafia. He focused on Carlos Marcello’s connections to Banister and Ferrie and castigated Garrison for not meeting with Marcello. Kwitny neglects all links to the CIA, military, FBI and the Secret Service. He omitted Garrison’s theory that the mafia was involved but, “at a lower level” in the assassination – probably through Ruby. Kwitny concluded that Stone has “sadly muddied the waters.” The Chicago Sun-Times claimed JFK was “widely inaccurate … propaganda” in its op-ed, “Stone’s film Trashes Facts, dishonors JFK.” The L.A. Times ran Warren Commission staffer Richard Mosk’s screed “The Plot to Assassinate the Warren Commission.” Mosk defended the Warren Commission as finding “overwhelming evidence” and proclaimed the movie moguls were “after a fast buck to portray fiction as fact.” Stone responded a week later, 1/16/92 , with a measured defense “JFK is not irresponsible – choosing to ignore the evidence is.” Stone clarified the time frame for the shooting, the “neuromuscular reaction,” the 26 witnesses in Parkland Hospital who saw an exit wound in the rear of the President’s head, the inconclusive results of the Neutron activation analysis, the HSCA audio studies, as well as Kennedy’s changing foreign policy. Z magazine editor Michal Albert relented somewhat from his instrumentalist take on the JFK assassination a month earlier. In “JFK and U.S.” he claimed that Kennedy was “not a good guy and would not have turned history on its head” but argued that JFK raises some useful questions. Kennedy was described as arguably “the best friend of the military industrial complex,” and that efforts to coerce Kennedy were not used first by the establishment.

When compelling new assassination research is developed in documentary form, it generally goes unreported by the mainstream and alternative media. British filmmaker Nigel Turner’s documentary series, The Men Who Killed Kennedy (The History Channel and Arts and Entertainment) unearthed critical aspects of the case. Major American networks still have not aired this series, which ran interviews with a number of witnesses who had not been seen before on American television. These included: Paul O’Connor, the naval medical assistant who saw Kennedy’s body in the autopsy room, stated that Kennedy’s brain was blown out. He also observed that in the autopsy room Admiral Murphy prevented Commander Humes from tracing the trajectory of the wound in President Kennedy’s back during the autopsy. ABC’s Nightline, 11/22/91, took a look at Oswald’s newly released KGB files and concluded that “the lone nut” assassin of President Kennedy “genuinely defected” to the Soviet Union. While dozens of Oswald’s fellow Marines could have been interviewed, Mack Osborne alone was questioned. He stated as he had to the Warren Commission, “I’m totally convinced Oswald meant his defection.” Witting CIA asset Priscilla Johnson McMillan was recycled as an expert reporter, and predictably noted that Oswald was an unstable misfit in the Soviet Union. Daniel Schorr psychologized, “He did it as a self-motivated individual – not as part of a conspiracy, but only as a conspiracy of a diseased mind.” WCAP radio reporter Woody Woodland in Lowell, Massachusetts, had interviewed top JFK aide Dave Powers. After the interview Woodland asked Powers what he thought of JFK. Powers said “[the movie] got it right … we were driving into an ambush … they were shooting from the front, from behind that fence.” Woodland noted that Powers did not say that to the Warren Commission. Powers revealed that, “No, we were told not to by the FBI.”4 Similarly, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. in WSJ, 1/10/92, saw Oliver Stone’s film as “indefensible, “paranoid” and “hopelessly loyal to … fantasy – and their fantasies hopelessly abuse the truth.” WSJ, 1/28/92 printed Joseph Califano Jr’s letter to Rep.

Louis Stokes “ A Concoction of Lies and Distortions,” the LBJ aide saw Stone’s film as ”disgraceful,” and that Johnson thought Castro was responsible and that Oswald didn’t act alone. He ended though by calling for a release of all HSCA files. In early 1992, JFK became very popular at the box office, despite getting as many scathing reviews as Jim Garrison’s investigation. Stone responded to the numerous attacks in the New York Times and the Washington Post, by declaring “History may be too important to leave to newsmen.” In a speech to the National Press Club (1/15/92) in Washington, he objected passionately and lucidly to the settled version of history “…lest one call down the venom of leading journalists from around the country.” Criticism of the film mainly came from older journalists on the right and left. Roger Ebert provided some context – “Thank God for President Bush’s stomach flu. It gave the op-ed pundits something to write about other than Oliver Stone’s JFK. Never in my years as a newsperson have I seen one subject pummeled so mercilessly and hopelessly as this movie which questions the official wisdom on the assassination of Kennedy. Saddam Hussein did not receive half the vituperation the op-ed crowd has aimed at JFK…” Oliver Stone observed. Some journalists of the 60’s are self-appointed Keepers of the Flame. They talk about this history and fight savagely those who would question it. But confronted with the Crime of the Century, with no motive and hardly any alleged perpetrators, they stand mute … what I have tried to do with this movie is to open a stall in the marketplace of ideas and offer a version of what might have happened… The Village Voice boldly ran “JFK: How the Media Assassinated the Real Story” “by Robert Hennely and Jerry Policoff. The article synthesized the role of Time-Life, the New York Times, and CBS, and explored “the media on the media.” BBC reporter Anthony Summers noted, “In 1981, I went to Dallas … knocking on doors of witnesses. My preamble would be “I’m sure you spoke to everyone back in 1963” and the response would be, “No. Where have you been all these years?” The media and, in some cases, law enforcement had not spoken to them.

Helen Thomas, UPI correspondent, and the unofficial dean of the White House press corps lamented, “We were all remiss, period.” Historian Arthur Schlesinger observed, “It does seem apparent that a lot of loose trails would have been picked up by a more alert press.” Earl Golz, an investigative reporter for the Dallas Morning News recalled, “I had continuous fights with my editors. Many of them were reporters back in 1963, who were spoon-fed by the FBI.” Bill O’Reilly, then anchor of Inside Edition, announced, 2/5/92, that sealed documents from the HSCA revealed that the CIA lied when they denied a link between Oswald and the CIA, and that the CIA had “agents infiltrating Jim Garrison’s investigation.” The New York Times, the Washington Post and the Boston Globe wouldn’t even assign a reporter to look into this discovery. They said, “sorry, we’ll pass.” Author Lisa Pease clarified some of the context for covering the assassinations. Ralph McGehee, a former CIA operative who eventually quit the Agency in disgust over the operations he had learned about during his 25 year career there, obtained a document from 1991 regarding the operations of the CIA’s Public Affairs Office (PAO): PAO now has relationships with reporters from every major wire service, newspaper, news weekly, and television network in the nation. This helped turn some “intelligence failure” stories into “intelligence success” stories.… In many instances, we have persuaded reporters to postpone, change, hold or even scrap stories.” The dominant establishment voice defending the work of the Warren Commission became author Gerald Posner. His 1993 book, Case Closed, was riddled with dozens of errors; nonetheless, the mainstream media offered him dozens of interviews to promote his book. The New York Times and the Washington Post devoted 30 stories or references to Case Closed, often as “definitive” or the “gold standard.” CBS’s 48 Hours developed another “documentary,” moderated by Dan Rather, coinciding with the release of JFK. The omission of established facts and data as well as the selection of experts interviewed was again remarkable. Oswald’s connections to Shaw and de Mohrenschildt, and the connections of these men to the CIA, went unmentioned. The evidence concerning initially reporting the German Mauser rifle, as well as the timing of finding the palm print on the Mannlicher-Carcano (at the morgue) was omitted. The view from the TSBD was reported as unobstructed, forgetting the existence of a live-oak tree obscuring the line of sight until the last split second. Reporter Erin Moriarity asserted, “The answer as to why Oswald was on that sixth floor window is a secret he will take to his grave.” But Oswald’s location", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:256:dac1c715cab8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 550, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 257, "text": "evidence concerning initially reporting the German Mauser rifle, as well as the timing of finding the palm print on the Mannlicher-Carcano (at the morgue) was omitted.

Reporter Erin Moriarity asserted, “The answer as to why Oswald was on that sixth floor window is a secret he will take to his grave.” But Oswald’s location was an implied fact, which has never been proven. Guy Banister and David Ferrie were described as having ties to the Mafia and the anti-Castro movement; however, their ties to the FBI, CIA and the ONI were omitted. Oswald’s alleged trip to Mexico City, supposedly to later visit Cuba, a trip which was never proven by the HSCA, was reported by Rather as fact. Rather claimed that the “physical evidence is solid,” while not mentioning the contradictory evidence involving Kennedy’s back wound, the weight and shape of CE 399, or the quality of the rifle. No attempt was made to analyze the autopsy pictures or X-rays, or to interview witnesses to determine the number and location of the shots. Again, no mention was made of the fact that the bullets in Tippit’s body did not match Oswald’s pistol. Moriarity mistakenly reported that Oswald “was also the only employee reported missing from the Texas School Book Depository – and that’s when Lee Harvey Oswald became the first and only suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.” Actually a number of employees were missing from the Texas School Book Depository and Oswald was neither the first nor the only suspect arrested. Although the stated CBS standard was that “facts, hard evidence must be the guide,” even the Warren Commission Report evidence was neglected in declaring, “Oswald learned Russian on his own.” (evidence showed that he was taught Russian during his Marine service) CBS continued to maintain that “no credible evidence ties Oswald to the FBI” and “no one firmly established the link between Oswald and Ruby.” CBS claimed that conspiracy theories fell into just three categories –CIA, Mafia, and Cuba. They omitted theories involving the FBI, Texas oilmen, rightwing militants, the military, and Lyndon Johnson. CBS then elected to ask two former Directors of the CIA, Richard Helms and Bill Colby, to give their opinions. Their responses were predictable denials of government involvement. Henry Wade, the Dallas D.A. at the time of the assassination and a former FBI operative, again flatly stated that there “was no question as to Oswald’s guilt.” Oliver Stone took his few minutes to clarify his critique. He quickly attacked the press for not following up on the leads generated by the HSCA.

Rather responded by stating that CBS had done a number of documentaries on this subject – predictably he never mentioned that they all supported the lone-gunman theory and the single-bullet theory of the Warren Commission. The program conveniently concluded: We do know a lot – and there is much to support the Warren Commission’s conclusions. But unanswered questions also abound. Not all of the conspiracy theories are ridiculous. And, however disturbing, conspiracy theories are also comforting in a way – that is one reason they thrive. They explained the unexplainable, and neatly tied up the loose ends. But a reporter should not take refuge there; facts, hard evidence, these are the journalist’s guide. For nearly thirty years now, we have independently looked for plotters and accomplices in the shadows behind Lee Harvey Oswald. So far we have not found them. What we do know is that uncertainty, all of the lingering doubts, may be as difficult for America to accept as the assassination itself…5 The movie stirred dialogue and bolstered the critics of the Warren Commission. PBS News Hour anchor Robin McNeil legitimized the critics in an interview for the documentary Beyond JFK (1992), when he observed, “There is a predisposition of the mainstream press still to believe that it all works, the system works, only the crazies on the fringes said it doesn’t. These two views are converging, based on evidence, which has brought them together.”6 On that documentary Tom Wicker, then an editor for the New York Times viewed JFK as “propaganda” which “weakens respect for institutions.” This echoes his past statements in the New York Times and in the introduction of the Bantam version of the HSCA Final Report. He continued to claim that “chance and circumstance” conspired against Kennedy, and that Garrison engaged in “a frivolous prosecution.” The iconic former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite responded similarly. He reiterated his belief in the “lone gunman” and opined, “It’s too Machiavellian to be a conspiracy.”7 In a hysterical stampede, even for the media herd, scores of journalists have taken time off from their regular occupation … to launch an offensive against what is clearly perceived as a major threat to the republic: a movie maker named Oliver Stone.… Stone’s crime was not that his movie presents a myth, but that he has the audacity and power to challenge the myths of his critics.… Stone has accomplished something truly remarkable that goes beyond the specific facts of the Kennedy killing … his underlying story tells a grim truth … a parable of the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:258:ad2f306824d4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 552, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 259, "text": "their regular occupation … to launch an offensive against what is clearly perceived as a major threat to the republic: a movie maker named Oliver Stone.… Stone’s crime was not that his movie presents a myth, but that he has the audacity and power to challenge the myths of his critics.… Stone has accomplished something truly remarkable that goes beyond the specific facts of the Kennedy killing … his underlying story tells a grim truth … a parable of the subsequent thirty years. By accepting the tyranny of the known, the media inevitably rely on official version of the truth, seldom asking the government to prove its case, while demanding the critics of the official version the most exacting tests of evidence, In the end, David Ferrie in the movie probably said it right, “The fucking shooters don’t even know who killed JFK.” Erwin Knoll, editor of, The Progressive, (3/92) viewed JFK as “manipulative … a mélange of fact and fiction.” Knoll contended that the Warren Commission did a “hasty, slipshod job” but he also “despises” Stone for playing on the gullibility of the public. Author Michael Parenti had repeatedly tried to interest Knoll in new research but to no avail. Parenti noted that Knoll admitted that he had not read the new research, yet he continued to dismiss conspiracy charges. In early 1992, Dr. Charles Crenshaw, a Parkland surgeon who had tried to revive President Kennedy, revealed in his book, JFK: Conspiracy of Silence, that the wounds clearly indicated shots from the front. Crenshaw had been given an edict of secrecy by the director of the emergency room and he feared for his job and his life.8 The book quickly became a best seller. Broadcast and print media covered the story with the ABC-TV show 20/20 reaching 19 million homes. A few days after Dr. Crenshaw’s initial interviews, the Dallas Morning News printed an interview with the Director of the Dallas-based FBI “Buck” Revell, a Hoover protégé, who had worked directly under FBI Director William Sessions in Washington as the third in command. Revell contended: The documentation does not show that the doctor [Crenshaw] was involved in any way. I’m very dubious as to his motivations and whether or not he has any factual information to add to the investigation.… Until the FBI can examine Dr. Crenshaw’s theory as set out in his new book and national television appearances, the FBI will not interview him. The prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association responded to Dr. Crenshaw’s book by holding a national press conference, 5/19/92, to trumpet an article in its upcoming issue. The editor of JAMA Dr. Charles Lundberg, who stood behind a podium with an AMA seal, (although he later admitted he was speaking only for himself), claimed, The press conference was widely attended and uncritically reported by the mass media.

The editor of JAMA Dr. Charles Lundberg, who stood behind a podium with an AMA seal, (although he later admitted he was speaking only for himself), claimed, The press conference was widely attended and uncritically reported by the mass media. A muted response came from the New York Times medical editor, Lawrence Altman, 5/20/92 , and 5/26/92 , who clarified that Dr. Crenshaw was indeed in Trauma Room 1 and tending to President Kennedy, according to Drs. Baxter and McClelland. Only after Dr. Crenshaw legally sought to defend his reputation was it determined that Dr. George Lundberg was not an expert on the case, and he had not even read Dr. Crenshaw’s book. Peer review, which was the norm at JAMA, did not occur for this article according to its author, Dennis Breo. Breo never even interviewed Crenshaw, and Lundberg was aware of this. Although numerous letters were written to JAMA to correct aspects of the article, few were printed and no retractions were made, “according to policy.” Lundburg was later fired for politicizing JAMA. In addition to errors of omission, there were errors of commission. A New York Times editorial again maintained that all of the discrepancies regarding the nature of President Kennedy’s wounds had been ended. Reporters George Lardner and David Brown of the Washington Post wrote that the JAMA interviews clarified, “the loose ends that have perplexed and inspired conspiracies for years.” Knight-Ridder columnist Sandy Grady described the pathologist’s statements as definitive. Bethesda autopsy doctors Humes and Boswell told JAMA that one bullet hit JFK in the back of the neck, exited the throat and then hit Governor Connally – the so-called “magic bullet.” How could this be known if the pathologists did not dissect the neck or in any way trace its path through the body? The throat wound was not examined, since it was thought to be a tracheotomy (a surgical incision of the respiratory tract to create a breathing hole). The following morning, after learning from the doctors in Dallas that the tracheotomy had been done over a bullet wound, the Bethesda doctors decided that this was an exit wound. Four areas of evidence contradict this supposition. Dr. Boswell’s autopsy diagram, which was signed by Admiral Burkley, the President’s private physician, shows the wound to be in the back, not the neck. Secondly, the death certificate signed by Admiral Burkley placed the entry wound to the right of the third thoracic vertebra about six inches lower than where Humes and Boswell now locate it. Dr. John Ebersole, the attending radiologist during the autopsy and other military medical personnel in the autopsy room confirmed that location. Further, the bullet hole in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:260:d9b6722b5533", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 554, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 261, "text": "diagram, which was signed by Admiral Burkley, the President’s private physician, shows the wound to be in the back, not the neck.

Dr. John Ebersole, the attending radiologist during the autopsy and other military medical personnel in the autopsy room confirmed that location. Further, the bullet hole in the president’s coat and shirt is well below the shoulder! Critics have long argued that these changes enable the location of the wounds to be consistent with shots from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. Also perplexing is Dr. Humes’ reversal on the single-bullet theory, which contradicts what he and Dr. Boswell originally told the Warren Commission.9 By June 1992, Dr. Crenshaw’s book was no longer on the bestseller list. That month two Navy technicians, Jerrol Custer and Floyd Riebe, who had taken autopsy photos and X-rays at Bethesda Naval Hospital, held a press conference. They confirmed their earlier statements that the photos and X-rays sent to the Warren Commission were not the ones they had taken. Though the mass and alternative media were repeatedly contacted, the press conference received minimal coverage. The media also afforded scant coverage to the June 17, 1992, press conference where Dr. Cyril Wecht, the former Chairman of American Forensic Pathologists, and a former HSCA forensic pathologist, discredited the JAMA article word for word. Later that year, PBS chose to highlight mafia hearsay rather than explore the forensic evidence. Frontline, 11/17/92, broadcast “JFK, Hoffa and the Mob,” which focused on Frank Ragano, the former lawyer for Jimmy Hoffa and Santo Trafficante. Ragano, the intermediary between Hoffa and Trafficante, argued that his two clients, as well as Mafioso Carlos Marcello all hated and were threatened by the Kennedys. On the day of the assassination, Ragano alleged that Trafficante boasted of Kennedy’s death over drinks, purportedly asserting “We got him today.” Years later, on his deathbed, Trafficante supposedly told him that, “Carlos fucked up – he should have gotten rid of Bobby instead.” HSCA Chief Counsel Robert Blakey concurred that Marcello and Trafficante were “likely behind the assassination.” Ragano then alleged that he had a conversation with Jim Garrison in 1969 where Garrison spoke of Marcello being his man (ally). He claimed that Garrison’s case was self-serving and that Garrison was trying to protect the mob. Only at the end of the program did viewers learn that Ragano, at 69, was facing three years in prison for his second tax evasion conviction.10 Nonetheless, Frontline viewed his allegations as atonement rather than opportunism. The program made no effort to explain the roles of the CIA, FBI, and the military, Secret Service, Lyndon Johnson, Texas oilmen or the Warren Commission.

The program made no effort to explain the roles of the CIA, FBI, and the military, Secret Service, Lyndon Johnson, Texas oilmen or the Warren Commission. The insinuation was that the mob completely controlled them all – as well as Congress, the mass media and the National Archives. This program was aired again on PBS, 3/22/94. Edward Jay Epstein concocted a screed about Garrison’s investigation “Shots in the Dark,” for The New Yorker, 11/30/92. Garrison was portrayed as “McCarthyite” and “delusional.” Garrison’s mistakes with the mass media, pursuing evidence and open theorizing were all duly noted – yet no new information or promising leads found their way into the nine-page story. Epstein characterized the trial by quoting the New York Times, “one of the most disgraceful chapters in the history of American jurisprudence.” Perhaps the most significant story run by a major mass-media outlet on the 29th anniversary of the assassination was a front-page story in the Houston Post by Mary and Ray Lafontaine regarding Oswald’s ID card. The card was military ID, form DD1175, found along with a phony Selective Service card, was discovered in Oswald’s wallet. Loose ends still exist beyond the inconsistencies of the card having a picture of Oswald without a Marine-style haircut, and the card was not laminated. The Marine Corps’ response to an FOIA noted: the negative and one print of the photograph taken for the card should be retained in the permanent file of the recipient. However, Oswald’s photo was not retained – at least not by the Marine Corps. On October 10, 1963, the CIA in Mexico City had cabled the Office of Navy Intelligence, requesting the Navy’s most recent pictures of Lee Harvey Oswald. ONI never sent the picture, but after the assassination of President Kennedy, it produced an envelope addressed to the CIA and containing Oswald’s 1956 induction photo. Another loose end was the role of the FBI in the Oswald Defense card affair. FBI special agent Manning Clements had underestimated the significance of the Defense ID in his report to the Warren Commission by omitting not only the fact that it had the picture, but that is was the same Oswald picture as on the phony A.J. Hidell Selective Service card. But the Bureau also misled (or cooperated with) the Commission by mishandling another copy of the same Oswald photograph. The letter appeared in the Warren Report and Evidence volumes as Exhibit 2892 and was labeled (from data provided by the FBI) “Photo taken in Minsk.” This photo was identical to the “Hidell” and DOD photo, and even showed a white", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:262:24528f9a7214", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 556, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 263, "text": "had the picture, but that is was the same Oswald picture as on the phony A.J.

The Minsk connection – the fact that Oswald’s trip to Russia occurred after the issuance of the DOD card – was not evident to the Warren Commission, which felt confident enough to include the “Minsk” photo among its exhibits. The most benign explanation for the misstep on the part of the Warren Commission investigators is that the FBI withheld the Defense card from their direct examination. The surge of concern generated by the movie JFK led to the 1992 Congressional resolutions to release the remaining documents. Jim Garrison, as with Clarence Darrow at the Scopes Trial, lost the case but ultimately won the battle for hearts and minds. For the first time in our history, a movie caused Congress to pass a law requiring that government tell the truth. The “Assassination Materials Disclosure Act,” often referred to as the “JFK Records Act,” mandated the collection of all records and generated remarkable revelations, though it was constrained from the outset. Tax records were exempted from declassification. The procedures to review evidence developed by citizen investigators were not specified. The Review Board was to have a life of only two years. It seems fair to question whether any commission or political body can be the proper forum for a homicide investigation, yet about four million pages were released which the public had not seen. Three decades after the assassination, the coverage from some mass media outlets had changed more in form than content. U.S. News & World Report (6/6/93) sought to dispel the issue of a puff of smoke on the knoll as reported by railroad workers after the assassination. They printed portions of Gerald Posner’s Case Closed, “because modern ammunition is smokeless, it seldom creates even a wisp of smoke.” This can be disproved by observation at a rifle range, and years earlier HSCA noted “modern weapons do in fact emit smoke when fired.”12 In July 1993, the Washington Post, CBS, and Newsweek embarked on a joint investigation of the JFK assassination. The reporters included: Walter Pincus (a history of CIA cooperation), George Lardner, and Anne Eisele of the Washington Post; the news staff at CBS; and Anne Underwood, Evan Thomas, Melinda Wu and Adam Wolfberg of Newsweek. Lardner and Pincus relied on the questionable testimony of Oleg Nechiporenko, an ex-KGB agent stationed at", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:263:a59a09f3cd3d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 557, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 264, "text": "noted “modern weapons do in fact emit smoke when fired.”12 In July 1993, the Washington Post, CBS, and Newsweek embarked on a joint investigation of the JFK assassination. The reporters included: Walter Pincus (a history of CIA cooperation), George Lardner, and Anne Eisele of the Washington Post; the news staff at CBS; and Anne Underwood, Evan Thomas, Melinda Wu and Adam Wolfberg of Newsweek. Lardner and Pincus relied on the questionable testimony of Oleg Nechiporenko, an ex-KGB agent stationed at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City. It is hard to reconcile the calm demeanor of Oswald (if it was Oswald) at the Cuban Embassy, as reported by HSCA researchers Ed Lopez and Dan Hardaway, with the “nervous,” “trembling,” “extremely agitated” Oswald depicted by Nechiporenko and his colleagues Kostikov and Pavel Yatskov. Recall that Oswald was calm in the Dallas police station. As psychologists know, when children discover vital flaws in their parents for the first time, they often begin searching frantically for other imperfections. Americans have now come to adopt the Old World proclivity to look for wheels within wheels, viewing government officials as guilty until proven innocent with a fervor that would have grieved Thomas Paine … [however] even the staunchest supporters of the Warren Commission’s lone-gunman verdict must concede that thousands of details we have learned about the murder seem to radiate conspiracy … New and vital evidence shows that Lyndon Johnson, J Edgar Hoover, Robert Kennedy, Nicholas Katzenbach, and others, feared an unfettered investigation … would lead in a dangerous direction.… The effect was to purchase short term political calm at the price of thirty years of doubt, not only about John Kennedy’s murder, but about the integrity and purpose of American government. Thirty years later, if we can wring any moral out of John Kennedy’s murder, it is that in the long reach of American history, the rewards of full disclosure tower over its immediate perils. “The Real Cover-up,” the article by Evan Thomas, admits agencies “safeguarded their own agendas.” A “hysterical public” would demand revenge, so “with remarkable speed and unanimity, officials at the top levels of government decided that they must convince the public that the president’s death was the work of a madman, not of some communist plot.” Some specifics regarding the CIA-mafia assassination plots against Castro were revealed, while Castro’s threats to retaliate were highlighted. Notably, Oswald’s purported visit to the Soviet Embassy in September of 1963, including a purported visit with senior KGB agent Kostikov, was reported as fact – completely disregarding the HSCA findings. Newsweek still viewed Jack Ruby’s murder of Oswald as an unplanned crime of passion. They continued to claim that Ruby, “left his beloved dog Sheba in his car on the 24th, something he would never have done if he were planning to kill Oswald, for he would have been separated from his beloved animal while in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:264:5b6d47b0128d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 558, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 265, "text": "Embassy in September of 1963, including a purported visit with senior KGB agent Kostikov, was reported as fact – completely disregarding the HSCA findings.

The Mexico City mystery was discussed without drawing upon the HSCA “Lopez Report” (on Oswald in Mexico City) or HSCA researcher Gaeton Fonzi’s book The Last Investigation. On the thirtieth anniversary of the assassination the Associated Press ran a number of pieces, all of which continued to faithfully support the Warren Commission’s version. Reporter John Diamond contended “Facts haven’t changed much in 30 years” and proclaimed that research has only, “…tended to support the single-gunman case by disproving various conspiracy allegations; or add tantalizing detail – but no solid scenario – to those pursuing the conspiracy case.” The AP ran a one-page pictorial description of the assassination including Dealey Plaza, wounds, the rifle, etc, which again totally defended the Warren Report. Polling data determining American attitudes toward a cover-up or conspiracy showed 78% of the American public thought a cover-up had occurred, and 55% thought the CIA was responsible. Reporter Howard Goldberg attributed this to a distrust of government, a sloppy Warren Commission investigation, a lack of hard evidence and “a desire to close the wound to the national psyche.” The CBS News program for the 30th anniversary of the assassination, “Who killed JFK?” uncritically focused on Oswald. Oswald visited Marina on weekends at a home owned by Michael Paine, for two months prior to the assassination. When Paine was interviewed by the FBI he stated “I went one afternoon to pick Oswald up, went upstairs, and I think the first thing he did, practically, was pick up this photograph of himself, 8 by 10, holding his rifle there and some papers.… I suppose he was looking for a big revolution…” As author Stewart Galanor recounts, Paine had kept this information to himself for thirty years. If he were telling the truth, then he lied under oath to the Warren Commission when he said, “I didn’t know prior to the assassination that he had a rifle.” Michael Paine further undermined his credibility in the CBS interview by stating, “at the police station when I saw him (Oswald) later on that night (11/22) he was proud of what he had done, he thought he would be recognized as somebody who did something.” However, Paine told the Warren Commission that he never saw or spoke to Oswald at the police station, and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:265:d9382c1d9191", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 559, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 266, "text": "Commission when he said, “I didn’t know prior to the assassination that he had a rifle.” Michael Paine further undermined his credibility in the CBS interview by stating, “at the police station when I saw him (Oswald) later on that night (11/22) he was proud of what he had done, he thought he would be recognized as somebody who did something.” However, Paine told the Warren Commission that he never saw or spoke to Oswald at the police station, and recalled that Oswald emphatically denied that he shot anyone. These new links to the Mannlicher-Carcano went unchallenged by CBS. Years later, privately, CBS anchorman Dan Rather admitted to HSCA Deputy Chief Counsel Bob Tannenbaum, “We really blew it on the Kennedy assassination.”13 PBS ran a program, “Who was Lee Harvey Oswald?” which claimed that he was an emotionally unbalanced nut who shot the president. The findings of the HSCA were ignored in order to highlight Priscilla McMillan Johnson, Ruth and Michael Paine, Ed Epstein, Ed Butler (INCA), Dan Rather, Richard Helms, Rosemary James, Max Holland, Vincent Bugliosi, and portions of the 1967 CBS special. Recall the CIA connections of Johnson, the Paines, Epstein, Holland, Butler and Helms. In March 1995, Nigel Turner produced another program in The Men Who Killed Kennedy series, which aired on The History Channel. Promising new leads were generated in the areas of doctoring autopsy photos, Colonel Daniel Marvin’s assertions of CIA-military complicity, as well as new documents on Project Freedom, the violent anti-Castro actions overseen by Robert Kennedy. In the Wall Street Journal, 4/1/95 , television reviewer Dorothy Rabinowitz nonetheless derided the documentary as “anti-government drivel … (from) the more deluded quarters of the lunatic fringe.” Assassination researchers were referred to as an “army of retirees, students, assorted obsessives and similarly qualified sleuths.” Rabinowitz never got around to refuting or exploring anything in the documentary, nor have any other mass media or alternative outlets. In early April 1995, the Washington Post, after five months of vetting, printed a probing piece by editor Jefferson Morley, “The Oswald File: Tales of the Routing Slips,” on the op-ed pages. He highlighted the research of historian Dr. John Newman, a 20-year veteran of U.S. Army Intelligence. Declassified CIA documents revealed that in 1963 senior officials at CIA headquarters in Langley elected to claim to their subordinates in Mexico City, including Chief of Station Winston Scott that they had not learned anything new about Oswald in the last year and a half. “Just days earlier though, two CIA counterintelligence offices had received an FBI report on Oswald’s recent pro-Castro activities, according to the routing slips. The CIA had also received FBI reports on Oswald in September 1963 and in August 1962…” The CIA claimed that the cable 10/3/63 focused “only on the status of Oswald’s citizenship.” Yet retired CIA officer, Jane Roman, in an interview with Morley and Newman, saw", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:266:7b8606a17c04", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 560, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 267, "text": "learned anything new about Oswald in the last year and a half. “Just days earlier though, two CIA counterintelligence offices had received an FBI report on Oswald’s recent pro-Castro activities, according to the routing slips.

His book was widely embraced by the mass media. Mailer myopically explored “Why did Oswald Choose Kennedy?” in Parade magazine, 5/14/95, by focusing on “Would Oswald pushed to the extreme, have the soul of a killer?” Contradictory or new evidence in the case was seen as “impenetrable” or unable to “answer the mystery.” One would not be surprised that there was indeed another shot; it was not necessarily fired by a conspirator of Oswald’s. Such a gun could have belonged to a conspirator working for a group unattached to Lee Harvey. It is not inconceivable that two gunman with wholly separate purposes both fired in the same lacerated few seconds of time.” The Washington Post chose novelist Joseph Finder to review the book. The novel method of a novelist analyzing a novelist regarding a homicide led to a strongly supportive review. Finder noted that Mailer did unearth new evidence from KGB documents in the former Soviet Union, but that he also relied heavily on Warren Commission material as well as material from Priscilla Johnson McMillan. Once again, McMillan was not identified as a “witting” CIA asset. Mailer was rightly credited with clarifying the source of material [ J.J. Angleton] given to author Edward Epstein for Epstein’s book Legend (1978) on Oswald – CIA sources back then suggested a KGB link to Oswald. Mailer’s KGB documents show that Oswald was suspected of being a U.S. intelligence agent. Finder nonetheless viewed that “Oswald’s life is a maddening warren of false leads, blind alleys, counterfeit identities… feeding the conspiracy theories that even now would deny him credit for his great claim", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:267:c4a8e081f7dd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 561, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 268, "text": "rightly credited with clarifying the source of material [ J.J.

Finder nonetheless viewed that “Oswald’s life is a maddening warren of false leads, blind alleys, counterfeit identities… feeding the conspiracy theories that even now would deny him credit for his great claim to celebrity.” He disregarded the documented information on Oswald, which was cogently discussed by Jefferson Morley in the Post just one week earlier. The New York Times review, 4/30/95 , by Thomas Powers, author of friendly biography of Richard Helms, strongly supported Mailer’s conclusion. Only Mailer’s notion of a kinder, more humanized lone nut was rejected, as Powers concluded, “It was an insect that brought Kennedy down…” Oswald’s Tale made the “Top Ten Books of the Year” list in the Dallas Morning News. The man who changed us all put a rifle to his shoulder that day in Dallas in November1963, looked through the rifle’s telescopic site, centered its crosshairs and squeezed the trigger. Most accounts agree on that much at least. Who killed John Kennedy? To say it was Lee Harvey Oswald begs the question. Who was Lee Harvey Oswald? You would have to be a great novelist to write that story. Well, a great novelist has. Dan Rather began his interview with Mailer by asking how history would view the “four dark days in Dallas.” Mailer saw it as a spiritual disaster, which created an American obsession. Rather noted “he spent part of his life and CBS’s money trying to prove that Oswald was not the assassin of John Kennedy but came to the conclusion the evidence and best testimony points to him as the assassin. Mailer agreed. Rather asserted “nobody who hasn’t been to the (TSBD) window can fully realize what a comparatively easy shot [it was] … particularly from that angle and distance, Mailer again agreed. Neither the quality of the rifle nor the FBI or CBS’s rifle tests would deter Mailer’s tale. Instead of following up on the notable interview Jack Anderson had with Marina for his 1988 documentary, where she stated that she was used by the Warren Commission and that Lee was innocent, Mailer psychologized that what haunted Marina was her crumbling marriage and her rejection of Lee sexually. Marina had told Anderson that Lee was working for the government by infiltrating groups, that Lee liked President Kennedy, that the rifle was not his, and that he was doing what he was told to do. Mailer then claimed that Marina felt her rejection of Lee the night before left him thinking that there was nothing left of the marriage, and this led to the assassination. “If there was a great night of love", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:268:86a11e33024e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 562, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 269, "text": "and her rejection of Lee sexually.

Mailer closed by proclaiming that Oswald “did more to change American inner life than any other individual.”16 After a decade of trying, Oprah finally got Marina Oswald to appear for a lengthy interview. Marina changed her mind in 1983 regarding her former husband’s guilt, based on “understanding the facts better” and repeated much of the statement she gave to Jack Anderson. Mary Lafontaine revealed the record on Oswald’s Dallas cellmate John Elrod, based on the declassification of 1992 Dallas P.D. files. Though officially denied, Elrod seemingly ran guns with Jack Ruby, as did Oswald. LaFontaine contended: In a week prior to the assassination, on November 14, a National Guard Armory was burglarized in Texas. On November 16, just 2 days later, Lee Harvey Oswald met with the FBI in Dallas. The following day a Teletype went out warning that President Kennedy might be assassinated in Dallas later that week … on November 18… two men were arrested with a carload of guns. One of them worked for Jack Ruby. It was one of those men that Oswald identified in his cell. Despite legal constraints, the Assassination Records and Review Board made significant progress, but with only 27 researchers and a two-year life span, many agencies delayed the process and stalled until the Board was disbanded. By 1996, according to the ARRB “the FBI created considerable delays,” and the Secret Service, “has yet to undertake a thorough search of all of its holdings.” The DEA “seems to understand that they have no obligation to the ARRB,” however, the “extent of cooperation may be unknowable because of some current record destruction.” The U.S. Customs Service failed to initiate a search of records until June of 1995, and due to “their general record destruction policy and poorly labeled storage boxes “Customs officials are not optimistic.” The CIA has released almost 300,000 pages of documents but 50,000 pages of documents and lengthy redactions remain. The Department of Defense had not complied with the JFK Records Act by the beginning of 1996. NSA compliance was minimal, merely transferring mainly unclassified press reports and requests for postponement. The ARRB publicly admitted that it couldn’t finish its job, and that it had been difficult to get the press interested in their work.

The ARRB publicly admitted that it couldn’t finish its job, and that it had been difficult to get the press interested in their work. The ARRB declassifications spurred releases of Cuban secret files on the assassination. In December 1995 a select group of Cuban officials and U.S. researchers, including a member of the ARRB, met in the Bahamas to review the documents. Cuban intelligence had penetrated a number of U.S.-based anti-Cuban groups. Cuban General Fabian Escalante, former Chief of the G-2 intelligence agency, had headed an official investigation of the JFK assassination since 1992 and determined that one of the objectives of the assassination was to blame Cuba. General Escalante had two informants that said “Maurice Bishop” was David Phillips. Escalante revealed that a captured Cuban exile leader, Tony Cuesta, named two other exiles associated with the JFK assassination, Eladio Del Valle and Hermino Diaz Garcia. Recall that Del Valle was murdered the same night in 1967 that David Ferrie supposedly committed suicide. Cuban UN Ambassador David Lachuga argued that when word of the secret talks with Cuba leaked out, it sparked the assassination conspiracy. Reporter Dick Russell explored these revelations in High Times (8/96), as well as naming CIA-Oswald connections through Desmond FitzGerald, David Phillips, Henry Hecksher, Colonel William Bishop and Richard Case Nagell. Phillips was in charge of CIA anti-Castro operations in Mexico in 1963, as well as penetrating the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPPC) in the U.S. Oswald’s activities were closely followed by Desmond FitzGerald’s CIA Special Affairs staff. Richard Case Nagell, a CIA double agent, claimed that he warned FitzGerald, 8/27/63, about an assassination plot against Kennedy. Nagell worked with CIA agent Henry Hecksher, who was a special assistant to FitzGerald. Russell interviewed Colonel Bishop who said that he worked under CIA officer Desmond FitzGerald and that he was aware of a plot to assassinate President Kennedy. Bishop stated that he covertly raised funds for the Alpha 66 (anti-Castro Cubans) through mafia contacts including Jimmy Hoffa, and wealthy anti-Communist types in Dallas. One anti-Castro Cuban, Felipe Vidal Santiago, told Cuban intelligence after his arrest that he had a relationship with Colonel Bishop. Santiago said that Bishop drove him to Dallas to spend four days raising money for re-taking the island. Vidal Santiago was also a close friend of CIA contact, and Miami mobster, John Marino. As new documents regarding the Warren Commission’s descriptive relocation of the bullet wound in President Kennedy’s back surfaced in July of 1997, mass media coverage was mostly decontextualized. Gerald Ford suggested that the panel change its initial description “a bullet entered", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:270:fe97b3117c69", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 564, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 271, "text": "had a relationship with Colonel Bishop.

As new documents regarding the Warren Commission’s descriptive relocation of the bullet wound in President Kennedy’s back surfaced in July of 1997, mass media coverage was mostly decontextualized. Gerald Ford suggested that the panel change its initial description “a bullet entered his back at a point slightly below the shoulder to the right of the spine” to read “a bullet had entered the back of his neck slightly to the right of the spine.” The final report said “a bullet had entered the base of the back of his neck slightly to the right of the spine.” Recall that these descriptions varied markedly with the location of the third thoracic vertebrae, 53/4 inches below the base of the neck, indicated by the signed death certificate, the autopsy report, and the holes in both Kennedy’s shirt and coat. Critics have long contended that the change in location was necessary to accommodate a downward trajectory from the sixth floor of the TSBD and still have the throat wound be “presumably of exit.” The Associated Press report by Mike Feinsilber, 7/3/97 , asserted that Gerald Ford “changed – ever so slightly – the Warren Commission’s key sentence on where the bullet entered John Kennedy’s body. The effect of Ford’s change was to strengthen the Warren Commission’s conclusion that a single bullet passed through Kennedy and severely wounded Governor Connally.” Gerald Ford, the only remaining member of the Warren Commission, declared, “My changes had nothing to do with a conspiracy theory.… My changes were only an attempt to be more precise.” No critics were quoted in some AP versions, in others, an obscure and unpublished assassination “researcher,” Robert Morningstar, was quoted for one unsupported sentence, “This is the most significant lie in the whole Warren Commission report.” No context was provided from the evidentiary record regarding the location of the back wound. The New York Times buried the story, 7/3/97 , on page A-19, and edited the already brief AP version down to four inches. While essential background evidence regarding the location of the wound in the back was unmentioned, the article opines that Ford’s, “editing was seized upon by conspiracy theorists who reject the commission’s conclusion that Mr. Oswald had acted alone.” Lardner, though, neglected the evidence on the location of the wound, which made Weisberg’s statement appear to be merely opinion. The article then changed the subject: “Weisberg and others have long maintained that the wound in the front of Kennedy’s neck was an entry wound, not an exit wound.” Lardner attacked the possibility of a shooter from the front by quoting from the HSCA, which held “by an 8 to 1 vote", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:271:8ef0e75f6fe4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 565, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 272, "text": "commission’s conclusion that Mr. Oswald had acted alone.” Lardner, though, neglected the evidence on the location of the wound, which made Weisberg’s statement appear to be merely opinion.

One Hell of a Gamble (1997), a respected scholarly work on the Cuban Missile Crisis by Timothy Naftali and Alexander Fursenko, revealed a remarkable communication between Robert Kennedy and the Soviets after the assassination, based on secret documents from a number of Soviet agencies. RFK sent his trusted friend Bill Walton to the Soviet Union to meet with George Bolshakov, a Soviet agent formerly stationed in Washington. Walton told Bolshakov that Bobby and Jackie believed that the president was killed by a large political conspiracy coordinated by U.S, not foreign opponents, and that Johnson was perceived as more pro-business than JFK and “incapable of realizing Kennedy’s unfinished plans.”17 When the ARRB issued its Final Report at the end of September 1998, the AP led its story with a quote from the Report that the U.S. government “needlessly and wastefully” withheld records on the JFK Assassination, “Causing Americans to mistrust their government.” Contradictory quotes characterize the dispatch. Gerald Posner avowed that the Board provided “documents that help fill in the details of this horrible event,” while James Lesar submitted that, “there is physical, medical, and ballistics evidence that leads you to conclude that one person could not have fired all the shots.” By the beginning of 1998 the ARRB had reviewed and released thousands of CIA documents on Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of President Kennedy, hundreds of HSCA records on Oswald in Mexico City, thousands of FBI assassination files, hundreds of private and local records and the records of Jim Garrison.

So even four decades later when some of the basic evidence was finally released, the New York Times still withheld “all the news that is fit to print.” Doesn’t show any mob involvement, it doesn’t show Oswald having any link to the CIA … [the Report said] exactly what I have said five years ago in my book, that the FBI and CIA had a massive cover up, not of an assassination, but trying to cover up their own bureaucratic reputations. And in doing so, they didn’t serve the Warren Commission correctly, nor serve history, and they laid the groundwork for a lot of conspiracy speculation. What the Board did that was stunning was to re-interview the doctors, and go down the chain of evidence and give us this raw material … these new interviews and depositions show conclusively that the autopsy was faked, and that the photography was false … Gerald Posner has never done his homework in this case; he doesn’t understand the evidence. The photographer who took the photographs of the brain says those are not his pictures; the photographs of the body are stated by the person who developed them not to be the pictures that she developed; all of the doctors, all of the medical witnesses have insisted that the wounds are not in the correct place. There were a number of brave, courageous residents of the city, longtime residents of Texas , who had the courage to speak truth to power – in the face of threats and intimidation.… This is hallowed ground – and the people of the country know it.… That day in Dallas … when their government of the United States executed its own President – when that happened we as a nation lost our code of honor – lost our sense of honor – that can only be restored when the government of the United States … tells us the truth, including their role in the murder – when that day comes, for the first moment, honor will be restored to this nation.

A new peer-reviewed article in Science and Justice, a quarterly publication of Britain’s Forensic Science Society, says the NAS panel’s study was seriously flawed. It says the panel failed to take into account the words of a Dallas patrolman that show the gun like noises occurred “at the exact instant that John F. Kennedy was assassinated.” The author of the article, D.B. Thomas, a government scientist and JFK assassination researcher, said it was more than 96% certain that there was a shot from the grassy knoll … in addition to three sound bursts from the Book depository window… G. Robert Blakely, former chief counsel of the House Assassinations Committee, said the NAS panel’s study always bothered him because it dismissed all four putative shots as random noise… we thought there was a 95% chance it was a shot. He puts it at 96.3% , either way that’s “beyond reasonable doubt.” The sounds of assassination were recorded at Dallas police headquarters when a motorcycle patrolman inadvertently left his microphone switch in the “on” position, deluging his transmitting channel with what seemed to be motorcycle noise. Using sophisticated techniques, a team of scientists enlisted by the HSCA filtered out the noise and came up with “audible events” within a ten second frame that it believed to be gunfire… the NAS panel assigned to conduct further studies after the committee closed down, said in 1982 that the noises on the tape previously identified as gunshots “were recorded about one minute after the president was shot…” The NAS experts made several errors, Thomas said “…they ignored a much clearer instance of cross talk when police Sgt. A.Q. Bellah can be heard on both channels asking, “you want me to hold this traffic on Stemmons until we find out something or let it go?… when Bellah’s words are used to line up the two channels, Thomas found the gunshot sounds occur at the exact instant that John F. Kennedy was assassinated…” Other important evidence steadily emerged, mainly in the alternative media, and continued to confront stiff resistance. In April 2001, the weekly Miami New Times published an article by Jefferson Morley on CIA agent George Joannides, the agent in charge of DRE in Miami in the early 1960’s, which actively portrayed Oswald as pro-Castro. Joannides then served as the CIA liaison to the HSCA (1977-1979) where he blocked significant portions of the investigation.

As the national newspaper of record the New York Times influences the agendas of most news outlets large and small. For the 40th year after the assassination, the New York Times merely reprinted its early assassination coverage in its book Four Days in November, with a laudatory introduction by Tom Wicker. Not one question critical of the Warren Report was raised. The ABC 40th year special report declared that “In all these years there has not been a single piece of credible evidence to prove a conspiracy.” Historian Robert Dalleck recycled a common mass media rationale by psychologizing to ABC anchor Peter Jennings that, “it’s very difficult for them [the public] to accept the idea that someone as inconsequential as Oswald could have killed someone as consequential as Kennedy.” Author William Manchester concurred in conclusion, “If you put the murdered president on one side of the scale and that wretched waif, Oswald on the other, it doesn’t balance. You want to add some weight to Oswald. It would invest the president’s death with meaning.… A conspiracy would do the job nicely.” Critics, again, were not given a chance to respond. In November 2003, The History Channel aired the ninth episode in The Men Who Killed Kennedy series, “The Guilty Men.” This segment directly implicated former President Johnson, and generated protests from Lady Bird Johnson, Bill Moyers, ex-President Jimmy Carter, Jack Valenti (former LBJ aide) and ex-President and former Warren Commissioner, Gerald Ford. This group formally complained of libel to the History Channel. They then threatened to sue the A&E Company, the owner of The History Channel. The History Channel responded, 4/7/04_(.) , with a program entitled, “The Guilty Men: A Historical Review.” The panelists, Robert Dalleck, Stanley Kutler, and Thomas Suzrue all argued that the documentary was not credible and should not have aired. Notably though, Barr McClelland, author and key interview in this controversial segment of “The Guilty Men,” was not interviewed, and neither was the producer/director of the series, Nigel Turner. The History Channel then issued a statement saying, in part, “that they recognize that ‘The Guilty Men’ failed to offer viewers context and perspective, and fell short of the high standards that the network sets for itself.” The History Channel apologized to Mrs. Johnson and its viewers, and then permanently withdrew the three newest segments by Turner.

As published authors of divergent views on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, we urge the Central Intelligence letter of the 1992 JFK Assassination Records Act by releasing all relevant records on the activities of a career CIA operations officer named George E. Joannides, who died in 1990. Joannides’s service to the U.S. government is a matter of public record and is relevant to the Kennedy assassination story. In November 1963, Joannides served as the chief of the Psychological Warfare branch in the CIA’s Miami station. In 1978, he served as the CIA’s liaison to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). The records concerning George Joannides meet the legal definition of “assassination-related” JFK records that must be “immediately” released under the JFK Records Act. They are assassination-related because of contacts between accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and a CIA-sponsored Cuban student group that Joannides guided and monitored in August 1963. The imperative of disclosure is heightened by the fact that the CIA has in the past, failed to disclose George Joannides activities. In 1978, Joannides was called out of retirement to serve as the agency’s liaison to the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The agency did not reveal to the Congress his role in the events of 1963, compromising the committee’s investigation. In 1998, the Agency again responded inaccurately to public inquiries about Joannides. The Agency’s Historic Review Office informed the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (AARB) that it was unable to identify the case officer for the DRE in 1963. The ARRB staff, on its own, located records confirming that Joannides had been the case officer. Sometimes a new facet of the case will be explored by the media but it will lack evidentiary and political context, so that the public may misinterpret or underestimate its importance. The Reader’s Digest article March 2005 by Jefferson Morley “The JFK Murder- Can New Technologies Finally Crack the Case?,” illustrates this. He explained that new sound preservation techniques which if applied to the open police dictabelt could reveal the number of shots fired. U.S. DOE scientists Carl Harber and Vitaly Fadegev were encouraged by an archival panel to explore whether their confocal microscope could coax new findings from the old and cracking “Dictabelt No. 10,” which the HSCA determined revealed four, not three shots. Morley probably knows the case better than any mainstream media reporter, yet no mention was made regarding the possible role of anti-Kennedy forces in the government – an area that Morley has been effectively writing about for years.

Mother Jones, December 2008, wistfully speculated on the Democrats’ dilemma and in a list of “what ifs” included, “if only Oswald would have missed … if only James Earl Ray and Sirhan Sirhan would have missed…” In February of 2006, The Nation published a piece by contributing editor Max Holland, “The JFK Lawyer’s Conspiracy,” which was also run on the official CIA website. Holland claimed that four lawyers, Mark Lane, Jim Garrison, Senator Gary Hart and Robert Blakey, conspired to put “the Warren Report into undeserved disrepute.” Lane was smeared as dishonest and a KGB dupe, Garrison’s trial was characterized as a “legal farce,” and the allegation of a lawyer’s conspiracy was unproven nonsense. An incensed Lane responded to The Nation with a lengthy, scathing letter. It began with a CIA document classified “Top Secret,” How do I know that? A decade after the assassination of President Kennedy, with the assistance of the ACLU, I won a precedent – setting lawsuit in the United States District Court in Washington, D.C. brought pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. The court ordered the police and spy organizations to provide to me many long-suppressed documents. The CIA document stated that it was deeply troubled by my work in questioning the conclusions of the Warren Commission. The CIA had concluded that my book, Rush to Judgment, was difficult to answer; indeed, after a careful and thorough analysis of that work by CIA experts, the CIA complained that almost half of the American people agreed with me and that “Doubtless polls abroad would show similar, or possibly more adverse, results.” This, “trend of opinion,” the CIA stated, “is a matter of concern” to “our organization.” Therefore, the CIA concluded, steps must be taken. The CIA directed that methods of attacking me should be discussed with “liaison and friendly elite contacts (especially politicians and editors),” instructing them that “further speculative discussion only plays into the hands of the opposition.” The CIA stressed that their assets in the media should “Point out also that parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists.” Further, their media contacts should “use their influence to discourage” what the CIA referred to as “unfounded and irresponsible speculation,” Rush to Judgment, then the New York Times number one best-selling book, contained no speculation. The CIA in its report instructed book reviewers and magazines that contained feature articles how to deal with me and others who raised doubts about the validity of the Warren Report.

The CIA in its report instructed book reviewers and magazines that contained feature articles how to deal with me and others who raised doubts about the validity of the Warren Report. Magazines should, the CIA stated, “employ propaganda assets to answer and refute the attacks of the critics,” adding that “feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose.” The CIA instructed its media assets that “because of the standing of the members of the Warren Commission, efforts to impugn their rectitude and wisdom tend to cast doubt on the whole leadership of American society.” The CIA was referring to such distinguished gentlemen as Allen Dulles, the former director of the CIA; President Kennedy had fired Dulles from that position for having lied to him about the Bay of Pigs tragedy. Dulles was then appointed by Lyndon Johnson to the Warren Commission to tell the American people the truth about the assassination. The purpose of the CIA was not in doubt. The CIA stated: “The aim of this dispatch is to provide material for countering and discrediting the claims” of those who doubted the Warren Report. The CIA stated that “background information” about me and others “is supplied in a classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments.” With this background we now turn to the article by Max Holland published by The Nation in its February 20, 2006 issue. It states that there was a “JFK Lawyers’ Conspiracy” among four lawyers, Sen. Gary Hart, Professor Robert Blakey, Jim Garrison the former District Attorney of New Orleans and later a state judge in Louisiana, and me. Before I wrote Rush to Judgment I had never met any of the other three “co-conspirators.” I still have not had the pleasure of meeting Sen. Hart, and I know of no work that he has done in this area. I met Prof. Blakey only once; he had been appointed chief counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations and at that meeting I told him that I was disappointed in his approach and methods. Not much of a lawyer’s conspiracy. Each of the other statements as to alleged fact are false and defamatory. Mr. Holland states that I am not scrupulous, that I am dishonest and that I spread innuendo about the sinister delay on the Warren Commission investigation, an assertion not made by me but fabricated in its entirety by Mr. Holland.

Mr. Holland states that the KGB was secretly funding my work with a payment of ^(ω)$12, 500 (in 2005 dollars).” It was a secret all right. It never happened. Mr. Holland’s statement is an outright lie. Neither the KGB nor any person or organization associated with it ever made any contribution to my work. No one ever made a sizable contribution with the exception of Corliss Lamont who contributed enough for me to fly one time from New York to Dallas to interview eye-witnesses. The second largest contribution was $50, 000 given to me by Woody Allen. Have Corliss and Woody now joined Mr. Holland’s fanciful conspiracy? Funds for the work of the Citizens Committee of Inquiry were raised by me. I lectured each night for more than a year in a Manhattan theatre. The New York Times referred to the very well-attended talks as one of the longest running performances off Broadway. That was not a secret. I am surprised that Mr. Holland never came across that information, especially since he refers to what he calls “The Speech” in his diatribe. Am I being unfair when I suggest a connection between Mr. Holland and the CIA? Here is the “CIA?” here is the “CIA” game plan:” fabricate a disinformation story. Hand it to a reporter with some liberal credentials; for example, a contributing editor to The Nation.

Then the CIA can quote the reporter and state,” according to…” Mr. Holland writes regularly for the official CIA website. He publishes information there that he has been given by the CIA. The CIA, on its official website, then states “According to Holland…” If you would like to look into this matter of disinformation laundering enter into your computer – “CIA Gov. ⁺ Max Holland.” You will find on the first page alone numerous articles by Mr. Holland supporting and defending the CIA and attacking those who dare to disagree as well as CIA statements attributing the information to Mr. Holland.

An old associate of mine, Adlai Stevenson, once stated to his political opponent, a man known as a stranger to the truth; – “if you stop telling lies about me I will stop telling the truth about you.” I was prepared to adopt that attitude here. But I cannot. Your publication has defamed a good friend, Jim Garrison, after he had died and could not defend himself against demonstrably false charges. To mitigate damages I require that you repudiate the article and apologize for publishing it. That you publish this letter as an unedited article in your next issue. That you did not publish a reply by Mr. Holland in which he adds to the defamation and the damage he has done, a method you have employed in the past. That you provide to me the mailing addresses of your contributing editors and members of your editorial board so that I may send this letter to them. I am confident that Gore Vidal and Bob Borosage, Tom Hayden and Marcus Raskin, all of whom I know, and many others such as Molly Ivin’s, John Leonard and Lani Guinier who I do not know but who I respect and admire, would be interested in the practices of The Nation. In addition, I suggest that ethical journalism requires that in the future you fully identify your writers so that your readers may make an informed judgment about their potential bias. If you have a genuine interest in the facts regarding the assassination you should know that the House Select Committee on Assassinations (the United States Congress) concluded that probably a conspiracy was responsible for the murder and that, therefore, the Warren Report that Mr. Holland defends so aggressively, is probably wrong. In addition, the only jury to consider this question decided in a trial held in the United States District Court in a defamation case that the newspaper did not defame E. Howard Hunt when it suggested that Hunt and the CIA had killed the president. The forewoman of the jury stated that the evidence proved that the CIA had been responsible for the assassination.

Meyer was a CIA agent whose wife had an affair with JFK, later she was murdered, a case that has never been solved. Next his father connected to Meyer’s name, the name of Bill Harvey, another CIA agent; also connected to Meyer’s name was David Morales, yet another CIA man, and a well-known particularly vicious black–op specialist. And then his father connected to Morales name with a line, the framed words “French Gunman Grassy Knoll. “…By the time he handed me the paper I was in a state of shock, Saint says. “His whole life … he always professed to not know anything about it.” Later that week, E. Howard also gave Saint two sheets of paper that contained a fuller narrative. It starts out with LBJ again, connecting him to Cord Meyer, then goes on: “Cord Meyer discusses a plot with [David] Phillips who brings in William Harvey and Antonio Veciana. He meets with Oswald in Mexico City… Then Veciana meets with Frank Sturgis in Miami and enlists David Morales in anticipation of killing JFK there. But LBJ changes the itinerary to Dallas, citing personal reasons…” E. Howard goes on to describe his own involvement. It revolves around a meeting he claims he attended in 1963, with Morales and Sturgis. It takes place in a Miami hotel room … Morales leaves the room, at which point Sturgis makes reference to the “Big Event” and asks E. Howard. E. Howard, “incredulous” says to Sturgis “you seem to have everything you need why do you need me?… “There is no way to confirm Hunt’s allegation – all but one of the co-conspirators he named are long gone.

A strongly supportive piece came from the Wall Street Journal, 5/20/07 , written by Max Holland, a long supporter of the Warren Commission, and in 2001 the first author working outside the government to receive a Studies in Intelligence Award from the CIA.19 A supportive Atlantic review was written by Thomas Mallon, another supporter of the Warren Commission. The L.A. Times review by Jim Newton effused, “It is a book for the ages.” The PBS American Experience series aired “Oswald’s Ghost,” 1/14/08, which briefly explored the impact of the assassination on American culture, while reweaving the “lone nut” theory. Remarkably, after 44 years of citizen and government efforts, not one shred of contradictory evidence was examined. This piece stopped with the Church Committee and never even mentioned the HSCA or the AARB. Of the eleven interviews, four discussed the sociological and political context; five supported the Warren Commission, while two opposed it. The Warren Report advocates, who were given long stretches to narrate, included: Priscilla Johnson McMillan; Edward Epstein; Hugh Aynesworth; Dan Rather; and the late Norman Mailer. Epstein asserted, “Most of the public thought Oswald was guilty but there was a possibility he didn’t do it alone … the evidence even at the beginning was persuasive, if not overwhelming…” Dan Rather, whose views have evolved on the case, assessed the lack of media coverage of the Warren Commission hearings, “I think the attitude of the country was we need to know what happened but we need to move on. Unity is important in an event like this, so let’s give the government the benefit of even very serious doubt.” Two noted early critics of the Warren Report, Mark Lane and Josiah Thompson shared their perspectives, but were not given time to explore evidence. After Oswald’s Ghost recreated a chronology of events similar to the Warren Report, it visually portrayed the early critical books as swirling down a black hole. Aynesworth and Epstein narrate a misleading rendition of the Garrison investigation. Aynesworth mentioned the Sodium Pentothal session, conducted by Dr. Esmond Fatter on Perry Russo, by again rearranging the time sequence to make it appear that Fatter was influencing Russo. This was used by Clay Shaw’s defense team, of which Aynesworth was an active member; a relationship unmentioned in the film.

Edward Epstein was undeterred in summarily proclaiming “not a shred of evidence has come out which would indicate what the conspiracy was. After forty years none of the theories pan out.” Historian Robert Dalleck psychologized, “People are comforted by the idea, I think, that human affairs are not the product of random events – there’s some larger force at work here.” Novelist Norman Mailer divined that Oswald had the motive and capability. He seemed to have forgotten that Oswald claimed that he was a “patsy.” Even the Warren Commission could not “ascribe any motive or group of motives.” 20 Bold reporters and editors have wanted to work this story, yet business and political pressures have increasingly stifled journalism. Jim Hougan, former Washington editor for Harper’s, revealed some decision-making by the CBS show 60 Minutes. Hougan had been under contract with CBS to pitch stories for Mike Wallace. He was convinced that the acoustical study by Dr. Don Thomas virtually proved that there had been a conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination, and went to New York to pitch the story. He openly pondered, “Whether this story is too important to cover at this late date.” Mike seemed convinced by it and thought the story was something we should pursue. But first it had to go through Phil Sheffler who was a senior editor at 60 Minutes. I had worked with him in the past, he is a fine journalist and a very fine editor … but he is not much inclined to do any stories with a conspiracy angle. This had come up in the past. He said, “Hougan do you know any conspiracy stories which have not been adequately reported?” I thought about it, and said the Kennedy assassination. He said, “Funny you should bring that up because I probably know more about the Kennedy assassination than anyone else at CBS. I was astonished.… He said he was involved with the early efforts of CBS looking over the Zapruder film.… He said it was so obvious that at least two people firing in Dealey Plaza that day. I said oh – did I miss something? – Was that reported? He said you have to understand, that just because two people were firing in Dealey Plaza does not mean that it was a conspiracy. I didn’t know what to say – then I said well that’s true but its still kind of newsworthy and I don’t recall it coming out… In the end what did happen is Mike got back to me", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:283:db68936bea6a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 577, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 284, "text": "firing in Dealey Plaza that day.

One was they felt that science was at the heart of Don Thomas’s work. I said that wouldn’t be a problem since CBS routinely dramatizes science stories. Mike agreed … but he was concerned that the story might have an ambiguous result. I said that’s possible … but we know that there is a 96% certainly that the results will be less ambiguous [than now]. He said that’s true. What it meant is that 60 Minutes have only their own credibility to sell basically and if they get a story like this wrong they are completely destroyed. But if someone such as Howard Baker were to pitch the story then they can report, without fear of contradiction, that Howard Baker said A-B-C and they won’t get it wrong.21 Mass media mergers have heightened the importance of corporate profits, yet Wallace’s fear of being “completely destroyed” by a story of conspiracy that “everyone knows,” speaks volumes. Letting a scientist report findings on autopsy photos or x-rays would satisfy Wallace’s third party method. Don Hewitt, longtime Executive Producer of 60 Minutes, told Bill Moyers in the mid-1990s, “This is a bad year for journalism but a good year for journalists.” A good year in terms of high salaries. Washington Post, Oprah Winfrey, Reader’s Digest, the A&E Channel, and the History Channel, among others, covered new aspects of the case. Reporters need time, money, and most importantly, owners, publishers, executive editors or news directors who will take risks. However, since 2000, newspaper revenues have fallen by about half, causing cuts in staff, shrinking the news hole, and closing bureaus. Online divisions of legacy media are experimenting with models, as are new online outlets, but the transition remains uncertain for investigative reporting. Former Washington Post editor Ben Bagdikian sees core problems with journalism in America: 1) reliance on official sources; 2) fear of context; 3) a corporate bias concerning what is off-limits. Increasingly the corporate-owned media views Americans as consumers attracted by entertainment rather than citizens attracted by information.22 American journalism has adopted a one-sided notion of “objectivity” which emphasizes statements from people in power. Controversy is drained, so journalists are unlikely to antagonize the sources they are dependent upon. Context is often avoided since it risks partisanship, and in this case, the legitimacy of government and the media itself.

Controversy is drained, so journalists are unlikely to antagonize the sources they are dependent upon. Context is often avoided since it risks partisanship, and in this case, the legitimacy of government and the media itself. Bill Moyers observed that “objective journalism means describing the object being reporting on … as well as the big lie of people in power … freedom and freedom of communication were birth twins in the United States … neither has fared well in the absence of the other.”23 (Selling the Story) Carl Bernstein bluntly warned that the media “have abdicated our responsibility, and the consequence of our abdication is the spectacle and the triumph, of the idiot culture.”24 If journalists raise an issue that no one in power is debating, they are often accused of being ideological and unprofessional, which can jeopardize careers. This “sphere of legitimate controversy” has long constrained the press. Most reporters enter journalism with noble intentions, yet corporate profits have eroded journalistic norms and increasingly highlighted info-tainment. The ratio of P.R. specialists to journalists has changed from five to four in 1980 to seven to two today.25 Serious investigative journalism remains on the defensive in a media system which lacks clear standards of press accountability. Following the existing leads in this case can be perceived as delegitimizing the past press performance, as well as government. The incestuous relationship between the mass media and government continues in new forms. To most this case has become history, best left to the historians, to others it is a time-consuming endeavor on a very complicated case where reputations are risked and the leads are cold. Bill Moyers admonished that unprecedented secrecy and media cooperation with economic elites developed during the George W. Bush era. “Never has there been an administration so disciplined in secrecy, so precisely in lockstep in keeping information from people at large – in defiance of the Constitution.… Never has so powerful a media oligopoly … been so unabashed in reaching like Caesar for still more wealth and power. Never have hand and glove fitted together so comfortably to manipulate free political debate, new contempt for the idea of government itself and to trivialize the people’s need to know…”26 Sometimes distortions are subtler – using misleading headlines, burying the lead, and shoveling fog and confusion. After the 2000 election a consortium of news organizations explored voting in Florida.

The rapid rise of FOX Network contributed to unprecedented cooperation between a network and the Republican administration. Rupert Murdoch loathed the Kennedys. FOX News was run by the long-time top Republican strategist Roger Ailes, who framed the news daily to FOX reporters with talking points memos. Hardly “fair and balanced,” these memos are clearly partisan as well as very conservative. Digital journalism uses fewer reporters and uses speed as a significant part of the appeal. Former Washington Post executive producer Katherine Zaleski sees budget constraints for digital journalists impacting their patience for great journalism. There aren’t the resources to check everything, so transparency and trial and error have been seen as building trust. A change in culture and business needs is emerging which increasingly values truth. Some larger websites are transitioning to more copy editors, more fact checking, and building investigative units – after attracting resources and a following. David Talbot’s best-selling book, Brothers, about the relationship between RFK and JFK, was initially embraced by Hollywood. Lionsgate (producers of Mad Men) optioned the book and had “high hopes of making it into a mini-series … [but] they went to every network in Hollywood, and every network in Hollywood turned us down.” This confirmed Oliver Stone’s admonition to Talbot about Hollywood.28 Even the well-respected Columbia Journalism Review (May/June 2009) printed a literary retrospective of William Manchester’s The Death of a President, rather than wrestle with the evidence or the failures of the media. The author, Thomas Mallon, a self-described “implacable lone nutter,” extolled Manchester’s efforts which 40 years ago creatively supported Oswald’s guilt. Mallon highlighted some of Manchester’s vivid prose, which psychologized about Oswald motives, but he explored no new evidence. For him the Garrison investigation, the HSCA, the ARRB, new books, and dozens of conferences did not exist. Mallon shared his disdain for the “bilious bubbling up of scorn from the still feverish swamps of conspiracy theory.” This cleverly worded echo of new journalism – valued form over content. An aging Manchester supposedly told Mallon in 2002 that Oswald’s “Money Mad” mother had “defiantly uttered … you can’t say my son wasn’t a good shot.” CJR chose to reinforce “the sphere of legitimacy.” NPR Fresh Air guest-host Dave Davies, 10/28/13, interviewed former New York Times investigative reporter Philip Shenon about his new book, A Cruel and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:286:92c647f09ac6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 580, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 287, "text": "up of scorn from the still feverish swamps of conspiracy theory.” This cleverly worded echo of new journalism – valued form over content.

Shenon reviewed the shortcomings of the Warren Commission, J Edgar Hoover’s determination that Oswald was the assassin within two days after the assassination, the rushed autopsy, the FBI cover-up by agent Hosty, the lack of CIA effort to get to the truth, and the CIA’s withholding of plots to assassinate Castro. Shenon claimed that the “big question [was] as to whether Oswald was talking openly [in Mexico City] about his plan to kill President Kennedy.” He never got around to mentioning the findings of the HSCA, or the ARRB. Shenon asserted that the single-bullet theory was the most logical explanation of the wounds. He blamed RFK for withholding evidence rather than further question the cover-ups of the CIA, the Secret Service, the military, and LBJ. About two weeks later, NPR interviewed ARRB member Jeremy Gunn who clarified the cover-up by Dr. James Humes, who headed the autopsy, his atypical procedures and his destruction of his original notes. Gunn spoke of autopsy photographer Sandra Spencer, never questioned by the Warren Commission, who said that she did not recognize nor develop the autopsy photos in the National Archives. Further, the paper of the autopsy prints did not match the paper of the photos that Spencer took at the White House a few days earlier. Gunn believed that a conspiracy and a cover-up occurred but he never had a chance to develop his ideas in the brief segment. The lengthy New York Times Sunday Book Review by executive editor Jill Abramson vaguely concluded that there was some “kind of a void” at the center of the JFK mystery. “Many of the theories have been circulating for decades and have now found new life on the internet, in websites febrile with unfiltered and unhinged musings.”(11/13) The Washington Post review of professor Larry Sabato’s book, The Kennedy Half Century,(2013) was also filled with ad hominem attacks. “While the book’s first section is perfunctory, the second part, which deals with the assassination, is somewhat wearying and likely to interest only hardcore buffs – I realize there are many – who wallow in outraged speculation about who was behind Kennedy’s murder.” The New Yorker ran Adam Gopnik’s reflection on regicide and culture, while suggesting that “we will never know.” PBS Frontline 11/19/13 choose to rerun “Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald” a creative defense of the Warren Report, which", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:287:87dadbb96b4a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 581, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 288, "text": "“While the book’s first section is perfunctory, the second part, which deals with the assassination, is somewhat wearying and likely to interest only hardcore buffs – I realize there are many – who wallow in outraged speculation about who was behind Kennedy’s murder.” The New Yorker ran Adam Gopnik’s reflection on regicide and culture, while suggesting that “we will never know.” PBS Frontline 11/19/13 choose to rerun “Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald” a creative defense of the Warren Report, which never explored the findings of the HSCA, nor the five-million pages of declassified documents released through the ARRB. At the National Press Club forum on the JFK assassination 11/22/13, Dan Rather and his former CBS colleague Marvin Kalb still argued that Oswald alone was the assassin. Rather intoned “This is America. We love to doubt as well as to know. My belief is that beyond a reasonable doubt, there was one shooter and one gun.” George Orwell admonished that “thought corrupts language, [and] language can also corrupt thought.” Words help construct frames and spin, granting normality to the surreal. Cold War historian Colonel Fletcher Prouty argues that “the Secret Team” has shattered our democracy. “One of the greatest casualties of the Cold War has been the truth. At no time in the history of mankind has the general public been so misled and so betrayed, as it has by the work of the propaganda merchants of this century and their historians.” In this deception the CIA was violating its charter and targeting America with its propaganda operations. The young John Kennedy wrote Profiles in Courage to clarify perspectives for dignity in public service. As president he increasingly practiced what he preached. Ironically, after his death, the mass media generally contributed profiles in confusion and cowardice to the public discourse regarding his assassination. The response of the alternative press was varied. The Nation printed pieces by Alex Cockburn and Noam Chomsky, which viewed Kennedy as a Cold Warrior whose assassination did not change foreign policy. The New Republic continued to maintain that the new information was speculative and unconvincing. The journal Z viewed Kennedy as a Cold Warrior, who would not have Vietnamized the war. The Progressive strongly condemned JFK and Oliver Stone, and elected to avoid coverage of the ARRB and independent researchers. Mother Jones conceded that Oswald could have had confederates. The Village Voice along with online outlets Salon.com and Huffington Post sustained ongoing coverage. The lack of resources in the alternative media remains a major factor but this case also reveals the role of ideology in their decisions to not cover the new leads.

Let’s now recap the case in light of the massive declassifications, along with the work of some of the media and the citizenry. he role of the Secret Service in protecting the president, and in the investigation afterward still raises perplexing and troubling questions. The president had received numerous death threats in late 1963 and the Presidential motorcade actually had been cancelled in Chicago on November 2nd. Secret Service judgments and breaches of procedure strongly suggest security stripping; their actions after the as sassination indicate a cover-up. Secret Service connections to Allen Dull es and LBJ were strong. The Secret Service was a branch of the Treasury Department, then run by establishment Republican banker C. Douglas Dillon, whose father joined with the Dulles brothers in banking and trading with the Nazis. Allen, Foster and C. Douglas were close friends and political allies. Dillon, like Dulles, served in the OSS and often disagreed with JFK on banking, trade, tax and foreign policy. He had been John Foster Dulles’ ambassador to France from 1953-57, and Foster had convalesced at Dillon’s home in 1959. Allen had vacationed with Dillon in France. Dillon’s Chief Counsel, Acting Secretary of the Secret Service, Gaspard d’Andelot Belin, had responsibility for the Dallas trip. Belin’s family had also long been friends with Allen Dulles.1 Belin had also worked in military intelligence (OSS) with William Bundy and James Angleton, and later married Bundy’s sister.2 William Bundy was a senior Pentagon official and former CIA officer, who later edited the corporate elite Council on Foreign Relations journal Foreign Affairs; while his brother Mc-George served as a National Security advisor. William Bundy was married to the daughter of former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, and Secret Service Chief James Rowley was a close friend of Lyndon Johnson.3 The threat in Chicago to assassinate Kennedy seemingly involved four or five men, two were never caught and three were briefly detained. Thomas Vallee, a troubled ex-Marine, who like Oswald had worked with the U-2 program in Japan, and later trained anti-Castro Cubans, also had a job with a good view of the motorcade. Although Chicago police had followed Vallee for hours, he was arrested after the presidential motorcade was cancelled. He had an M-1 rifle and 3000 rounds of ammunition in his car. Chicago police Lieutenant Berkeley Moyland investigated Vallee and then informed the Secret Service about him. He was told that the Secret Service would take care of things. Moyland soon joined Vallee for lunch and engaged him in conversation – clarifying the serious consequences of talking as he had.

Moyland soon joined Vallee for lunch and engaged him in conversation – clarifying the serious consequences of talking as he had. Moyland then informed the Secret Service about Vallee and was told that the Secret Service would take care of things. The FBI had alerted the Chicago police but would not share information with them.4 One of the Chicago officers arresting Vallee was Daniel Groth, who six years later commanded the police squad that killed Black Panthers Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. Groth stated under oath that he followed an FBI request regarding the Panthers. Northern Illinois University Professor Dan Stern determined that Stern worked in counterintelligence, probably with the CIA.5 Vallee, like Oswald, claimed that he was framed.6 Author James Douglass interviewed Secret Service agent Abraham Bolden and unearthed part of the process used to bury the information on this plot. “Secret Service agents were told to prepare no documents on their own. Following [SAIC] Martineau’s orders the Chicago agents’ dictated oral reports to the office’s top secretary … then turned in their notebooks. Secret Service Chief James J. Rowley had phoned Martineau from Washington, asking that the Chicago office use a special COS (Central Office Secret) file number for the case – a process which sequestered the Chicago plot documents, making their subterranean existence deniable by the government. SAIC Maurice Martineau, who once had declared that “The bastard [ JFK] should be killed”, gave his agents orders about the Chicago threat, “Don’t talk to anyone about it.”7 Former Secret Service agent Abraham Bolden disregarded orders from Martineau to never talk about the Chicago threat. Months later he tried to talk to Warren Commission staffers, but he was arrested the next day by fellow agents. He was accused of trying to sell Secret Service files to a counterfeiter. One of Bolden’s accusers worked for Sam DeStefano, an associate of Richard Cain, the chief investigator in the Cook County/Chicago Sheriff ’s office. Cain worked with Johnny Roselli and Santos Trafficante on the CIA-mafia plots. Bolden was sentenced to six years, although his primary accuser Joseph Spagnoli, later admitted to committing perjury.8 Bolden’s judge actually told the jury before their deliberations that Bolden was guilty. Even after that misconduct resulted in a mistrial, the same judge was allowed to conduct Bolden’s second trial. The result was another conviction, and Bolden has been fighting to clear his name ever since.

Douglass speculated that “If Kennedy had been murdered in Chicago on the day after Diem’s and Nhu’s murder in Saigon, the juxtaposition of events would have created the perfect formula to be spoon-fed to the public: Kennedy murdered Diem, and got what he deserved.”10 Twelve days after the assassination, article appeared in the Chicago Daily News and the Chicago American on Vallee’s arrest which characterized him as gun-toting malcontent who expressed violent anti-Kennedy views. The anonymous police detectives and federal agents who informed the media after the assassination of Vallee’s arrest in Chicago did not mention the Secret Service detention and questioning of the two suspected plotters.11 Recall the warnings from the Miami police regarding the threats from right-wing extremist Joseph Milteer, 11/9/63, proclaiming that Kennedy would be assassinated “from an office building with a high power rifle … it’s in the works. They will pick up somebody … just to throw the public off.” The taped threats were forwarded to the Secret Service and the FBI but the case was quickly closed, and Milteer was not arrested.12 The Secret Service stated to the Warren Commission that Milteer was not put under surveillance because they lacked the manpower.13 The Secret Service informed Tampa Police Chief J. P. Mullins of a plot to murder Kennedy during his trip to Tampa the next day. Mullins advised the President to cancel his visit but JFK decided to proceed anyway. The threat included at least two men; one was “a slender white male, 20^(″) with a “high power rifle … shooting from a window in a tall building.” Tampa police were positioned “at every overpass with rifles on alert.” Author Lamar Waldron notes that Secret Service agent Sam Kinney said that he heard that organized crime was behind the threat. This was the center of Mafioso Santos Trafficante’s territory. Chief Mullins and the Secret Service did not know anything about the connections of the two suspects. This attempt to assassinate the President in Tampa was withheld from the Warren Commission and the HSCA. Waldron alerted the ARRB, 11/24/94. “According to the Review Board’s Final Report … January 1995, the Secret Service destroyed Presidential survey reports for some of President Kennedy’s trips in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:291:1038dab65697", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 585, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 292, "text": "heard that organized crime was behind the threat.

The day after the president was assassinated, the Tampa Tribune ran a short story that Tampa officers had been “warned about a young man who had threatened to kill the president during his trip.” Note the similar scenarios with the plots in Chicago, Tampa, and Dallas. Incredibly, the Secret Service responded to the rising number of serious threats by reducing their protection in Dallas. Bobby Kennedy did not trust the Secret Service and had plans to take responsibility for presidential protection. The Secret Service action in Dallas violated numerous standard policies. • Advance publication of an insecure route was in the Dallas newspapers. • The motorcade route was re-directed to include a turn of 120 degrees. • No protective military assistance was used. • There was no coverage of open windows, manholes or sewers. • There was no coverage of roofs. • Motorcade vehicles were in an atypical sequence. Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry testified to the Warren Commission that he was instructed by Secret Service agent Winston Lawson not to station four motorcycle police on either side of the presidential limousine – but rather place two on either side but at the back fender. Lawson, an army reserve officer, denied this, yet numerous other reports from Dallas police confirmed that Lawson redeployed the side escorts.17 The Secret Service alteration of the original Dallas Police Department motorcycle deployment plan prevented the use of maximum possible security precautions.… Surprisingly, the security measure used in the prior motorcades during the same Texas visit [11/21/63] shows that the deployment of motorcycles in Dallas by the Secret Service may have been uniquely insecure … [The Secret Service] defined and supervised the functions of the Dallas police during Kennedy’s visit [to Dallas].18 The night before the assassination, many in the President’s Secret Service entourage drank at The Cellar night club, owned by Pat Kirkwood, an acquaintance of Jack Ruby. Kirkwood’s father was a close associate of Ruby and Lewis McWillie, who worked for Santos Trafficante. However, none of the Vice-President’s Secret Service detail went to the Cellar that night.

As the presidential limousine started to leave the Dallas airport, Secret Service agent Don Lawton was ordered off the rear of the car by Shift Leader of the White House Service Detail, Emory Roberts. Footage aired on the History Channel in 2003, shows Lawton gesturing “What’s going on?” After Kennedy was assassinated, Roberts remarkably ordered his superior SAIC Roy Kellerman “You stay with Kennedy. I’m going to Johnson.”19 While the Warren Commission and the HSCA blamed JFK for cutting security, by law the President cannot tell the Secret Service what to do. Author Vince Palamara, who has interviewed more than 70 Secret Service agents, writes “President Kennedy understood about protection and never interfered with Secret Service protection protocols.” Secret Service Agent Floyd Boring ASAIC White House Detail has written that President Kennedy “was very cooperative with the Secret Service.”20 Agent Clint Hill wrote that he had “never heard the president ever question procedural recommendations by his Secret Service Detail.”21 Boring was in charge of the Dallas trip, although he stayed in Washington. Boring appears to have approved the Trade Mart site for the President’s speech against the security advice of JFK’s aides Jerry Bruno and Ken O’Donnell. He was aided by Dallas police and Winston Lawson, (a member of the Army Intelligence reserve), Advance Agent David Grant, and Forrest Sorrels, Special Agent in Charge Dallas. Boring also told agent Clint Hill to not ride on the rear of the presidential limousine.22 After 11/8/63 , Advance Agent Grant was a key planner of changes in the motorcade route, when it was altered to turn off of Main Street. This included planning an unnecessary 120-degree turn in front of the Texas School Book Depository, although Secret Service regulations prohibit turns of more than 90 degrees. Films taken at the time show that when the first shot rang out the brake on the presidential limousine came on. Sixty witnesses, including eight policemen, two presidential aides, and Governor Connally, have testified or publicly stated that the presidential limousine failed to accelerate until after the fatal shot. Former CIA agent Colonel John Stockwell recalled that when he received training in a “bang and burn” course, he was drilled to react to a situation with bullets flying, “You mash down on the gas and get the hell out of the area.” Secret Service actions, before and during the assassination, foreshadow their actions after the assassination regarding evidence, witnesses, and procedures. After the assassination several witnesses stated that they had seen or encountered Secret Service agents behind the stockade fence atop the grassy knoll.

After the assassination several witnesses stated that they had seen or encountered Secret Service agents behind the stockade fence atop the grassy knoll. The Secret Service maintains that none of its agents were stationed in Dealey Plaza.23 Witness Jean Hill said that she ran up the grassy knoll and behind the stockade fence when she encountered men who identified themselves as Secret Service. Deputy Constable Seymour Weitzman also stated to the Warren Commission that he encountered Secret Service agents behind the short wall adjacent to the stockade fence.26 Dallas Policeman Malcolm Summers also ran up the grassy knoll, and he too encountered someone who identified himself as Secret Service and told Summers to back off. Colonel Robert Jones testified to the HSCA that “our people were under the control and supervision of the Secret Service. We never assumed responsibility for the President’s protection.… We provided a small force … I would estimate between eight and twelve during the President’s visit to San Antonio, Texas and then on the following day, on his visit to Dallas, the regions also provided additional people to assist, that are additional people from Region 2… [ James W. Powell] was a captain and also wore civilian clothes and was assigned to Region 2 of the 112 MI Group.… Yes he was [on duty that day]” About an hour and a half after the assassination, recall that Secret Service agents forcibly took the president’s body and casket to Bethesda. Dallas County Medical Examiner Dr. Earl Rose and Judge T. Ward argued that Texas law required an autopsy in Texas. Dr. Crenshaw the surgeon who struggled to save the President in trauma room 1, recalls Secret Service SAIC Roy Kellerman declaring “We are taking President Kennedy back to the capital.” Dr. Rose argued, “You are not taking the body anywhere, there’s a law here, we’re going to enforce it.” Another Secret Service agent screamed “Goddammit, get your ass out of the way before you get hurt” while another yelled “We’re taking the body now.”28 They were pushed to the wall at gunpoint, and the Secret Service took Kennedy’s body to Washington. On orders from LBJ, the Secret Service flew the presidential limousine to Washington and assisted the FBI in inspecting it. Then the limousine was scrubbed, washing away traces of blood, bones and bullets, and the windshield was replaced. Deputy Secret Service Chief Paul Paterni and ASAIC Floyd Boring oversaw the limousine inspection at the White House garage where the vehicle damage was “noted.” The windshield hole became a “crack” and the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:294:af330d9bd05b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 588, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 295, "text": "and the Secret Service took Kennedy’s body to Washington.

Deputy Secret Service Chief Paul Paterni and ASAIC Floyd Boring oversaw the limousine inspection at the White House garage where the vehicle damage was “noted.” The windshield hole became a “crack” and the dented chrome was seen as insignificant. When the limousine was then driven from Dearborn to Cincinnati to replace the chrome molding strip which was damaged in the shooting, the driver Carl Renan noticed a “primary strike” on the molding strip. Renan, head of security for Ford Motor Company Dearborn, was told by the Secret Service to “keep his mouth shut.”29 Recall that Secret Service Agent Elmer Moore confessed in 1970 that he had “leaned on Dr. Perry” to cease describing the wound in Kennedy’s throat as one of entrance. Moore told graduate student James Gochenaur that the Secret Service had to investigate the assassination in a predetermined way or face repercussions. Moore also mentioned that at times he saw JFK as a “traitor” regarding the Cold War.31 Recall the role of the Secret Service in supplying a second, edited version of the Zapruder film to the NPIC lab from the Hawkeye Works lab, after viewing the first version with NPIC Information Officer Dino Brugioni. It was Secret Service agent “Bill Smith,” who along with NPIC Deputy Director USN Captain Pierre Sands, ordered NPIC employees to swear to secrecy what they had seen. The Secret Service conducted twenty-four interviews with Parkland doctors, nurses and orderlies, yet none of these interviews appeared in the Warren Commission Hearings and Exhibits (Six FBI interviews were not included either). The Secret Service is also alleged to have confiscated original recordings of the Parkland Memorial press conference where Dr. Perry stated repeatedly that the throat wound was an entrance wound. Dallas KLIF news director, Joe Long, told this to Marvin Garson editor of the S.F. Express Times. Recall CIA asset Gordon McLendon owned KLIF.32 Recall the superficial Secret Service investigation of Oswald’s activities in New Orleans out of Guy Banister’s office on Camp Street. The Secret Service claimed to the Warren Commission that their extensive investigation found no links between Oswald and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and Banister’s office. Banister’s secretary, Delphine Roberts, was not interviewed, although she later admitted that Oswald used a room on the third floor and that Oswald met a number of times with Guy Banister. If the Secret Service had chosen to walk 50 feet from their New Orleans office to Banister’s office they would have found “Fair Play for Cuba” leaflets in Banister’s office.

Assistant to the Special Agent in charge (ATSAIC) Emory Roberts, who ordered agent Donald Lawson to not ride on the rear of the presidential limousine, was given a Special Service award by the Treasury Department in 1968, was made LBJ’s receptionist, and in 1969 was promoted to the Inspector of Secret Service headquarters.33 Former Secret Service Chief U.E. Baughman observed in his book Secret Service Chief, “I only know that far too many men around our Presidents are quite willing, if it will benefit them, to let the Chief Executive put his life on the line. Some Secret Service agents were frustrated being relegated to “butlers” and “errand boys,” while some on the White House Detail were upset with JFK’s private life. Further, most of the core of southern born agents disliked the president’s stands on civil rights and his rumored plans to merge the FBI with the Secret Service.”35 Secret Service actions before the assassination constitute security stripping, while their actions afterward constitute a pattern of cover-up. These actions constitute “security stripping” the assassination, before and after, along with a creative pattern of cover-up. Secret Service imposters could have gotten identification from the CIA, which sometimes did this type of false credential printing. A CIA memorandum, 5/8/73 , from Sidney Gottlieb of the Technical Service Division confirmed that TSD had “furnished” the Secret Services with a range of passes as well as a “secure ID photo system.”37 Secret Service Chief James Rowley participated in the protection of the presidential limousine, the cleaning and reconstruction of it after the assassination, and the ordering of removal of Kennedy’s body from Parkland Hospital before a possible autopsy. When President Johnson returned to Andrews Air Force Base from Dallas, Rowley was the first person he talked with.38 When Warren Commission junior counsel Arlen Specter asked the Secret Service for the video tapes and transcripts of the press conference with Dr. Malcolm Perry the day of the assassination, Rowley wrote back that “After a review … no video tape or transcript can be found of a television interview with Dr. Malcolm Perry.” Years later the ARRB found a transcript of that press conference which was stamped “Received U.S. Secret Service 1963 Nov 26 AM 11:40, Officer of the Chief.” Rowley had lied, he had Perry’s statement that there was an entrance wound from the front of the neck, before the Warren Commission had started.

The Secret Service claimed that it destroyed the presidential protection survey reports for twenty-three of President Kennedy’s trips in fall of 1963, “by mistake” – four months after the ARRB had begun its work.42 The JFK Act specifically forbids the destruction of any documents, and public hearings were considered. The Warren Commission tried unsuccessfully to get some Secret Service records related to the assassination from Douglas Dillon. Dillon then appealed to his old Wall Street friend John McCloy, and even to President Johnson to not be grilled by the committee. When he did appear in the final weeks of the Committee, he was given a superficial examination, and allowed to advocate for a larger budget. Allen Dulles helped Dillon place the false story – that JFK preferred his Secret Service guards to ride behind him – into the Warren Commission Report.43 Dillon even claimed that “it was not the practice of the Secret Service to make surveys or checks of buildings along the route of a Presidential motorcade.” President Johnson later turned to this trusted pillar of the Eastern Establishment, Dillon 11/22/64, to chair the Dillon Committee – to give recommendations about the Warren Report, it’s release and distribution, monitoring the TV control room, and accommodations for the Secret Service reviewing the CIA and foreign press. Years later President Ford turned to Dillon to serve on the Rockefeller Commission to reexamine the Warren Commission; not surprisingly, they confirmed its findings. ee Harvey Oswald’s life confronts us with the classic maze of mirrors.

Portions of Oswald’s career in military intelligence and his relationships with the CIA, FBI and INS have been systematically suppressed or destroyed by these agencies as well as the Justice Department. Foreshadowing the challenges, recall the memos from J. Edgar Hoover as well as Asst. Attorney General Nicolas Katzenbach, 11/25/63, that “the public must be convinced that Oswald was the assassin and that he did not have confederates. When Oswald was arrested after the assassination, he was carrying an address book with the name of FBI Agent James Hosty of the Dallas Bureau office. When the FBI gave the Warren Commission a list of the contents of Oswald’s address book, it had omitted Special Agent Hosty’s number. The FBI rationalized that the omission had been made because the person who transcribed the list was only looking into “lead information,” Oswald was also carrying a military I.D. card.1 FBI agents were ordered by William Sullivan of FBI Counterintelligence, to not cooperate with the Dallas Police and the investigation less than four hours after Oswald was arrested The FBI did not fully cooperate with the Warren Commission. Sullivan was also the FBI liaison to the National Security Council2 and to the U.S. Intelligence Board, the top agency which supervises foreign intelligence.3 Sullivan had been good friends with CIA Chief of Counterintelligence James Angleton and CIA Mexico City Chief Win Scott, whom he directed during WWII. In a secret session of the Warren Commission on January 22, 1964, Waggoner Carr, the Attorney General of Texas, stated that evidence he had acquired from Allan Sweatt, the chief of the criminal division of the Dallas Sheriff ’s office, indicated that Oswald had been employed by the FBI as a confidential agent, number S-172 or S-179, at $200 a month. The chief of the Dallas sheriff ’s division was never called to testify by the Warren Commission.4 The Warren Commission special counsel given the assignment of investigating charges that Oswald was a government agent was Texas Attorney General Leon Jaworski. Subsequently, Jaworski served as a director of the M.D. Anderson Fund, a CIA front which had been exposed in 1967.5 Jaworski found no links between Oswald and the government. Notably, a decade later, when President Nixon fired Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, he appointed Jaworski to replace him. Strong evidence shows that this was not Oswald’s only connection to the U.S. intelligence community. On the day of the assassination, according to the HSCR, the FBI asked the CIA for “any information” it had on Oswald. The CIA’s official response, according to the FBI was that “there is nothing in the CIA", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:298:20162fc367b2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 592, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 299, "text": "found no links between Oswald and the government.

On the day of the assassination, according to the HSCR, the FBI asked the CIA for “any information” it had on Oswald. The CIA’s official response, according to the FBI was that “there is nothing in the CIA file regarding Oswald other than material furnished to the CIA by the FBI and the Department of State.” This denial is part of a cover-up, as indicated by both the subsequently declassified and missing or destroyed documents. Years after the Warren Commission inquiry, newspapers reported that a woman at the Dallas Bureau office had received a threat by Oswald to blow up the FBI office. FBI Agent Hosty explained that this message was merely a warning to him to stop questioning Oswald’s wife. If the note was a threat, the FBI Dallas headquarters would normally place him immediately on the “dangerous character” list – but this was not done. What the note actually said will never be known for sure, since Hosty told the HSCA that his superior, Gordon Shanklin, ordered him to destroy the note after Oswald was shot, which he did.6 If the note indicated Oswald’s guilt or erratic behavior, why would it have been destroyed immediately? According to Hosty, he was initially assigned to cooperate fully with Dallas police during Oswald’s interrogation after the assassination, but within hours senior agents in FBI Counterintelligence instructed him to not cooperate with Dallas police regarding Oswald’s background.7 In a significant revelation, the HSCA disclosed an internal CIA memorandum dated 4/27/79, concerning Oswald’s 201 file, a routine file for persons considered to be of potential or counterintelligence significance. The memo notes that 37 documents, including 25 cables, were missing from Oswald’s file. The HSCA, however, accepted the CIA claim that those documents just happened to be checked out of the file on the day the memorandum was prepared. These 37 documents were never found for examination by the HSCA and their contents remain a mystery today.8 One CIA document viewed by HSCA referred to a “forged and backdated 201 file to be used in connection with political assassinations” – the ZR-Rifle Project.9 The extent to which the CIA double-files its records is classified information. Oswald’s first overseas assignment as a Marine was to Japan’s Atsugi Air Base, the CIA’s most secret base, where U-2 intelligence flights over China originated. Oswald’s anti-aircraft unit had the job of guarding the U-2 hanger, for which a highly classified security clearance was required. Oswald’s possible intelligence role at Atsugi might be confirmed by two CIA documents mentioned in the Warren Commission Report: CD 931, “Oswald’s access to information about the U-2,” and CD 692, “Reproduction", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:299:4711ea919d4b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 593, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 300, "text": "is classified information.

After spending only three days with his mother he traveled to the Soviet Union and defected. While in route to Russia, he flew to Helsinki, Finland at a time when no commercial flights were scheduled. To Embassy Consul Robert Snyder at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow he claimed his allegiance to the Soviet Union, announced that he would give them radar information, and was allowed to defect. Oswald appears to have been part of the “fake defector” program which infiltrated nine operatives into the Soviet Union during this period. Senator Richard Schweiker, Co-Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Subcommittee to investigate the JFK assassination determined that “The accused assassin was the product of a fake defector program run by the CIA.” The False Defector Program was run by the CIA and ONI from a facility in Nags Head, N.C. Tosh Plumlee (a longtime CIA asset) accidentally met Oswald again in Dallas in 1962 at a Cuban “safe house” where they both participated in a government-sanctioned gun running operation. In an interview with Dick Russell, Plumlee stated that “Oswald was military intelligence.”11 In a sworn affidavit Plumlee states that he met Oswald at “Illusory Warfare” training at Nags Head, NC in 1957, where Oswald was taking language courses.” Of the more than 50 letters he sent home during his time in the Soviet Union the CIA mail-intercept program contains only one. According to Victor Marchetti, staff officers in the Office of the Director, and an executive assistant to the Deputy Director “espionage missions were to be coordinated with the CIA…but the military often failed to do this…the tribalism that plagues the intelligence community is at its worst in the military intelligence agencies.”12 Recall that the Army “routinely” destroyed their files on Oswald in 1973. Oswald married a Russian woman and returned to the U.S. in June 1962. Spas Raikin, a former secretary of the CIA-backed American Friends of Bolshevik Nations, greeted them upon their return. The State Department approved Oswald’s return and authorized the American Embassy in Moscow to lend him $436 . In 1978, James A.

The State Department approved Oswald’s return and authorized the American Embassy in Moscow to lend him $436 . In 1978, James A. Wilcott, a former CIA finance officer, told the House Select Committee that Oswald had been recruited from the military by the CIA “with the express purpose of a double agent assignment in the USSR, and that he had received financial disbursements under an assigned cryptonym.”13 Wilcott’s wife Elsie, who also worked for the CIA, concurred. After quietly clarifying Oswald’s background, the Wilcotts received threatening calls, Jim was forced to resign from his job, and their tires were slashed. When Oswald returned to the U.S. he was debriefed by CIA officer Aldrin Anderson. The debriefing report was read by CIA officer Donald Deneselya and confirmed … in the 1993 Frontline program, “Who was Lee Harvey Oswald?”14 The Oswalds moved to Fort Worth, Texas, where Russian-born oil geologist Baron George de Mohrenschildt of the powerful Dallas Petroleum Club befriended them. De Mohrenschildt convinced the Oswalds to move to Dallas where he introduced them to the Russian émigré community. De Mohrenschildt’s good friend, J. Walton Moore, an agent in the CIA’s Domestic Contacts Division, “encouraged” George to befriend Oswald,15 and he did. He would never have contacted Oswald if Moore had not sanctioned it. De Mohrenschildt had previously worked with the Office of Strategic Services, as well as in Yugoslavia, representing the International Cooperation Administration, a well-known CIA front. He was accused by the Yugoslavian government of sketching military facilities.16 De Mohrenschildt had also been in Haiti where he was involved in a “government oriented” (Warren Commission language) business venture, where he hung out in an establishment frequented by intelligence agents.17 De Mohrenschildt visited with Oswald regularly, leading many to speculate whether de Mohrenschildt committed suicide or was murdered hours before an arranged meeting with Gaeton Fonzi, an investigator from the House Select Committee on Assassinations, in March 1977.18 De Mohrenschildt’s wife did not believe that her husband committed suicide, and she feared for her own life. She has confirmed that her husband worked in intelligence, that he was friendly with powerful oilmen like H.L. Hunt, Bob Kerr, Clint Murchison Sr., and D. Harold Byrd (owner of the Texas School Book Depository building), and that his closest friend was Dallas’ top CIA man J.

Howard Burris (aide to LBJ), and Vice-President Lyndon Johnson.20 The day after Kennedy was assassinated George H.W. Bush was briefed by the FBI on “the attitude of anti-Castro Cubans.” Bush was not yet a member of Congress, and supposedly not in the CIA, although his name was listed with Zapata Petroleum, which was a known CIA front organization. By November 1962, Oswald was also meeting with many of the wealthy and prominent “White” Russian community as well as retired Air Force Colonel Max Clark, who was chief security officer for General Dynamics in Fort Worth. It was around this time that de Mohrenschildt helped Oswald get a job at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall, which was under Pentagon contract to produce charts and maps for military use. Author Henry Hurt observed in Reasonable Doubt that, “part of the work appeared to be related to the top-secret U-2 missions, some of which were making flights over Cuba.” This job required a high security classification, to say the least, yet neither the Warren Commission nor the House Select Committee explored this area in depth.21 In Dallas, Texas Oswald had some very sophisticated photographic equipment, especially for a “stock boy” on a limited income. At his North Beckley Street apartment after the assassination the Dallas police found his expensive Minox camera, which has been referred to as a spy camera, two other cameras, two telescopes and a variety of film. Police also found several rolls of pictures taken with a Minox camera. These were released in 1978 after a Freedom of Information Act suit against the FBI. Although most of the released photos show scenes of Europe, five are of military facilities thought to be in Asia or Latin America.22 Police also found Oswald’s address book, which contains these notations on one page: Microdots are used in espionage to transmit and store information. Oswald spoke of micro-dotting to a fellow employee, Dennis Ofstein, who had also served in the army and had also studied Russian.23 He also spoke of Soviet military logistics, the Soviet MVD (roughly equivalent to the FBI) and the MVD headquarters at Minsk. 24 Shortly after Oswald moved to New Orleans in April of 1963, he got a job at the William B. Reily Co, a coffee company two blocks from Guy Banister’s office. Reily, an ardent anti-communist, supported Ed Butler’s INCA and Arcacha Smith’s Crusade for Free Cuba. A CIA memo indicates that the company had been of interest to the CIA since 1949, (CIA memo from M.D. Stevens dated 1/11/64).", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:302:7e2745c71b6d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 596, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 303, "text": "(roughly equivalent to the FBI) and the MVD headquarters at Minsk. 24 Shortly after Oswald moved to New Orleans in April of 1963, he got a job at the William B.

A CIA memo indicates that the company had been of interest to the CIA since 1949, (CIA memo from M.D. Stevens dated 1/11/64). In April 1963, de Mohrenschildt went to Haiti, stopping en route in Washington, D.C. to meet with a CIA agent and an Assistant Director of Army Intelligence. The HSCA learned that de Mohrenschildt had received a “substantial sum” of money shortly after the assassination, which was paid to his account in Haiti. Jacqueline Lancelot, who owned a Haitian restaurant frequented by intelligence types, reported that she learned from a source in a Haitian bank that $200, 000 to $250, 000 had been deposited into de Mohrenschildt’s account.25 Stockbroker Joseph Dyer told the HSCA that Haitian banker Clemard Charles met with de Mohrenschildt and the Assistant Director of the Office of Intelligence in the Army. Dorothy Matlock said that $200, 000 was put into de Mohrenschildt’s account at another bank as well. De Mohrenschildt had written a stack of letters to Vice-President Johnson regarding his business in Haiti. One letter from LBJ’s administrative assistant Walter Jenkins to de Mohrenschildt offered a meeting with Colonel Howard Burris, LBJ’s military aide, or LBJ himself. Some researchers posit that this business provided an alibi to get Oswald’s “babysitter” out of the country in November of 1963. Oswald’s actions with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans link him to various intelligence agencies. Warren Commission testimony exhibit #3120 demonstrates that Oswald was passing out pamphlets on the topic of “Crime against Cuba.” This was the fourth printing of a pamphlet, which was purchased by the CIA in its first edition.26 It appears that Oswald’s work with Guy Banister in New Orleans was with an operation that had links to the FBI, CIA and Military Intelligence. Joe Oster, a friend and employee of Banister, recalled that Banister sometimes got calls from J. Edgar Hoover, (NODA memo 9/30/68, DiEugenio p.104). The Banister files which were seized by the FBI, but not integrated into the subsequent investigations, included the following topics: American Central Intelligence Agency, Ammunition and Arms, Anti-Soviet Underground, B-70 Manned Bomber Force, Civil Rights Program of JFK, Dismantling of Ballistic Missile System, Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and International Trade Mart, among others. Jim Garrison’s chess partner, Jack Martin, who worked for Banister, a former FBI Special Agent in Charge for Chicago, told him that Oswald and David Ferrie met regularly with Banister. According to Victor Marchetti, a former Executive Assistant to the Deputy Director of the CIA, Ferrie was a CIA operative who", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:303:2d162a9c7e17", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 597, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 304, "text": "and Arms, Anti-Soviet Underground, B-70 Manned Bomber Force, Civil Rights Program of JFK, Dismantling of Ballistic Missile System, Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and International Trade Mart, among others. Jim Garrison’s chess partner, Jack Martin, who worked for Banister, a former FBI Special Agent in Charge for Chicago, told him that Oswald and David Ferrie met regularly with Banister. According to Victor Marchetti, a former Executive Assistant to the Deputy Director of the CIA, Ferrie was a CIA operative who also worked for Mafia kingpin Carlos Marcello. Ferrie mysteriously died of a “brain hemorrhage” on February 22, 1967, prior to being called as a witness by Garrison. Further, Banister’s office at 544 Camp Street in New Orleans was part of a military supply line along the Dallas-New Orleans-Miami corridor that provided arms and explosives for use against Castro’s Cuba.27 On August 2, 1963, the FBI, upon the order of JFK in an effort to stop the unending violations of the Neutrality Act by the CIA, arrested eleven people and seized more than a ton of dynamite, napalm and other devices at a resort area near Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, in a house loaned to newly-arrived Cuban refugees. The actual raid uncovered not only the ammunition described, but also a nearby un-described training camp at which the nine Cuban exiles and two Americans were arrested. Garrison speculated that the FBI deliberately concealed portions of the story from the American public so the Banister operation could continue. Garrison obtained more information in a supplementary report that the FBI had sent to U.S. Customs. One of the participants, a former CIA employee named Gorden Novel,28 stated that the Banister operation was on a mission to acquire combat ammunition. Ferrie assisted Banister and one of the leaders of the local CIA-related Cuban Revolutionary Front, among others. Novel (who subsequently fled New Orleans) and Ferrie drove from Banister’s office to the blimp air base at Houma, in southern Louisiana. They entered one of the explosives bunkers and removed the land mines and other ammunition. According to Novel, these were CIA weapons.29 It seems safe to say that Oswald was working closely with American intelligence in some capacity and was hardly the Communist he was portrayed to be. FBI agent. Oswald was separated from the other arrested men and brought into a private room where he talked with Special Agent John Quigley of the local FBI office. Later, this same Special Agent Quigley – contrary to standard Bureau procedure – burned the notes he had taken during this interview. Special treatment for a communist organizer seems inexplicable unless Oswald was actually working with Guy Banister, former FBI agent in charge in Chicago, who could have easily arranged it.30 Oswald also met with FBI agent Warren de Brueys in New Orleans, according to the HSCA testimony of FBI asset Orestes Pena.

The FBI was so concerned about Oswald’s relationship with de Brueys, that they destroyed Pena’s FBI files prior to the formation of the HSCA, (FBI teletype 1/15/76) ). A week later, Oswald was again leafleting in front of the International Trade Mart of New Orleans when a camera crew from NBC-affiliated television station WDSU arrived to film this inconsequential action. The next day someone arranged for him to participate in a radio debate on a WDSU in New Orleans on the subject of capitalism versus communism. Oswald portrayed himself as a Marxist debating Carlos Bringuier and George Butler, both of whom were linked to the OSS and CIA through INCA (Information Council of the Americas).31 Butler at times spoke of INCA contacts with CIA Deputy Director General Charles Cabell. A copy of the debate was forwarded to CIA headquarters.32 Bringuier was clearly more than an anti-communist activist. After Garrison interviewed him 2/1/67 , Bringuier immediately requested an interview with Hunter Leake of the New Orleans office of the CIA.33 Bringuier was active in DRE, which was supported and overseen by CIA agent George Joannides (more about him later). Suspiciously, less than a day after Oswald was murdered, copies of this taped debate were sent to members of Congress and the Associated Press as “proof” that a communist had killed the president. Oswald was also seen by a number of witnesses with New Orleans corporate businessman and CIA contact Clay Shaw in Clinton, Louisiana, along with David Ferrie in September 1963.34 Clay Shaw also met regularly with Guy Banister. It was Clay Shaw, AKA Clay Bertrand, who called attorney Dean Andrews to assist Oswald after his arrest in Dallas, according to New Orleans District Attorney Garrison. Shaw was close to the Stern family, which owned station WDSU, as well as Ed Butler, his associate in launching INCA. Former CIA Director Richard Helms finally revealed in 1977 that Clay Shaw, like George de Mohrenschildt, was a CIA operative in the Domestic Contract Division.35 Later in autumn of 1963, a leader of Alpha 66, (CIA-funded militant anti-Castro organization) Antonio Veciana, saw Oswald with a CIA officer he knew as “Maurice Bishop.” A number of sources have long claimed that “Bishop” was David Atlee Phillips, the Chief of CIA Western Hemisphere.

Veciana has no doubts, and neither did HSCA researcher Gaeton Fonzi, who researched this for over a year. Former CIA officer Frank Terpil admits knowing that Phillips was Bishop as well.36 Phillip’s role remains unclear, but after the assassination Phillips was given a major promotion. Terpil commented to former HSCA staffer Kelvin Walsh: “My private opinion is that JFK was done in by a conspiracy, likely including rogue American intelligence people.” Further, Oswald and Ferrie both worked out of Banister’s New Orleans detective office. When Banister was agent-in-charge of the Chicago FBI in the 1940s he employed an agent named Robert Maheu, (later to become a front man for Howard Hughes). Maheu, in the early 1960’s enlisted Sam Giancana, John Roselli and Santos Trafficante in the CIA-Mafia plots to kill Castro. According to the Senate Intelligence Report on Foreign Assassinations, Maheu’s firm, Robert Maheu and Associates, was used for domestic covert operations, jobs with which the CIA did not want their own personnel associated.37 In 1975, when Representative Don Edwards’ FBI Oversight Committee had held its hearing focusing on the FBI’s relationship to both Oswald and Jack Ruby, it made eight specific demands on the Bureau for information. The next day the FBI was let off of the hook when the Justice Department decided not to press charges for the destruction of the Oswald note to FBI agent Hosty. Former Attorney General under President George H.W. Bush, Richard Thornburgh, who was then chief of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, had decided not to prosecute. He later became an Attorney General under George H.W. Bush. The FBI conducted its investigation in an atmosphere of concern among senior Bureau officials that it would be criticized and its reputation tarnished. Rather than addressing its investigation to all significant circumstances, including all possibilities of conspiracy, the FBI investigation focused narrowly on Lee Harvey Oswald. Oswald’s uncle, Charles “Dutz” Murret was a former boxer and “bookie” with ties to Marcello. Oswald’s mother was a good friend with mob politician Clem Sehrt. Sehrt was determined by the HSCA to be a business associate of Marcello. Blakey chose to omit information supplied to him that Sehrt was also chairman of the Democratic regulars in New Orleans. 38 Scott’s notion of a “gray alliance” between mafia and intelligence sources, police departments and elements of corporate America provides a useful hypothesis. Banister, according to his former secretary, was working with David Ferrie to block the deportation of Marcello to Guatemala. In 1961 Marcello had offered anti-Castro Cuban Sergio Arcacha Smith financial support to overthrow Castro.41 The HSCA reiterated the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:306:20544ee09b04", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 600, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "9781634241885_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781634241885", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "9781634241885_cleaned", "chunk_index": 307, "text": "chose to omit information supplied to him that Sehrt was also chairman of the Democratic regulars in New Orleans. 38 Scott’s notion of a “gray alliance” between mafia and intelligence sources, police departments and elements of corporate America provides a useful hypothesis.

In 1961 Marcello had offered anti-Castro Cuban Sergio Arcacha Smith financial support to overthrow Castro.41 The HSCA reiterated the Warren Commission’s conclusions regarding Oswald’s lack of links to intelligence agencies. The background of HSCA Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey may be pertinent. Blakey had spent four years in the organized crime and racketeering section of the Kennedy Justice Department and was the principal consultant to Johnson’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. Inexplicably, when Rancho La Costa sued Penthouse magazine for libel, it was Blakey who provided an affidavit condemning the magazine’s charges of mob ownership, while conceding ignorance of the truth of the charges. Any questions concerning this support of a resort built by Teamster pension fund money were referred to Blakey’s attorney, Louis Nizer.42 Nizer, coincidentally, was the attorney who wrote the introduction to the Warren Commission Report and passionately defended its findings. Also, Blakey and Nizer were both attorneys for mobster Moe Dalitz. You cannot see the scoffing expression on the CIA technician’s face when questioned about cameras not working at the times of the alleged visits of Oswald to the embassies. You cannot see the smile that came on his face when he affirmed that he always had more than one working camera. You cannot see the sureness with when CIA personnel in Mexico told us they knew the Cuban embassy staff believed that Oswald was not the person who had approached them. You cannot see the increasing nervousness with which David Atlee Phillips lit up cigarettes as he was grilled on obvious lies told to the committee… The CIA refused to allow us [Dan Hardaway and Ed Lopez] to see the results of the photographic surveillance of the Soviet embassy in Mexico City during the periods that Oswald allegedly visited the embassy. [Are they still hiding methods and sources?]… The CIA had some double agents planted in the Cuban embassy but the CIA would not permit us to interview these double agents.44 Oswald, or an impersonator, was seemingly accompanied to Mexico City by William Gaudet, a CIA asset, who had worked with David Phillips in 1963. Phillips was CIA for Mexico City Chief of covert operations. The FBI suspected that he was “baby sitting” Oswald just before he left Mexico City. CIA documents released in 1997 show that the CIA thought it possible that an Oswald imposter was in Mexico City. The CIA Special Affairs staff (SAS) set up to direct a covert campaign to topple Castro, had an operational interest in", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:9781634241885_cleaned.txt:307:e84fca0c560d", "wtk_id": NaN}]
