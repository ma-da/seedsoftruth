oligodendrocytes a type of glial cell in the central nervous system including the brain and spinal cord After 10 daily doses of a QAC called cetylpyridinium chloride starting just five days after birth mice had reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes in their brains Typically oligodendrocytes keep developing from before birth into adulthood but the study suggests QACs may kill them The researchers also analyzed levels of the flame retardant metabolite or BDCIPP in children revealing those with the highest levels were more likely to experience adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes Toxic chemicals found in hand sanitizers and other disinfectants as well as household items like furniture and electronics could be harming brain development in children and future generations This includes QACs used widely in disinfecting agents and organophosphate flame retardants which are found in many household items Researchers at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio found QACs were damaging to oligodendrocytes a type of glial cell in the central nervous system including the brain and spinal cord while flame retardants increased the risk of neurodevelopmental problems Both chemical classes are widespread in the environment raising the risk of population wide health risks Hand sanitizer compound may harm brain development QACs or quats are a popular ingredient in hand sanitizers and disinfectant wipes Usage of both products has increased significantly in recent years Clorox increased production of its disinfectant wipes to 1 5 million packs per day during the pandemic while an industry trade group survey found 83 of households had used disinfectant wipes at least one time in the past week and 92 of consumers had used a cleaning disinfecting or sanitizing wipe Use of hand sanitizers also rose during the pandemic with usage as high as 25 times per day in children and more than nine times daily for adults You may also be exposed to QACs in a number of other common

researchers found the chemicals in the animals brain tissues just days after administering an oral dose Not only does this suggest that QACs cross the blood brain barrier but they may also cause damage to oligodendrocytes in the brain Oligodendrocytes play an important role in forming the myelin sheath a fatty layer that surrounds the axons of nerve cells This myelin sheath is essential for the fast transmission of electrical signals allowing for efficient communication within the nervous system Damage to oligodendrocytes which act similarly to insulation around electrical wires can lead to several neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis After 10 daily doses of a QAC called cetylpyridinium chloride starting just five days after birth the mice had reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes in their brains Study author Paul Tesar noted Loss of oligodendrocytes underlies multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases We now show that specific chemicals in consumer products can directly harm oligodendrocytes representing a previously unrecognized risk factor for neurological disease The scientists also tested QACs in brain organoids which are three dimensional cell cultures used as a model for studying brain development and disease mechanisms Similar damage was found Typically oligodendrocytes keep developing from before birth into adulthood but the study suggests QACs may kill them We found that oligodendrocytes but not other brain cells are surprisingly vulnerable to quaternary ammonium compounds and organophosphate flame retardants study author Erin Cohn said in a news release Understanding human exposure to these chemicals may help explain a missing link in how some neurological diseases arise QACs also linked to immune system respiratory and reproductive adverse effects When you use QAC containing products like cleansers disinfectants personal care items and more you can be exposed by ingesting the chemicals inhaling them or absorbing them through your skin Beyond damage to brain cells QACs are also linked to multiple adverse health outcomes including Dermal skin and respiratory effects Developmental and reproductive toxicity Disruption of metabolic function such as lipid homeostasis Impairment of mitochondrial function The National Pesticide Information Center states that children should not use antimicrobial wipes

disease in many settings and applications Meanwhile greater indoor usage is consistent with higher indoor exposure which is a concern given the recent discovery of adverse health outcomes in laboratory animals at relatively low ambient exposure concentrations Increased production and usage is anticipated to result in higher QAC concentrations in wastewater which is a pathway for broader environmental exposure and potential risks to biota This is especially concerning given that some environmental concentrations already exceed protective aquatic toxicity thresholds Flame retardants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders The Case Western Reserve University researchers also analyzed levels of BDCIPP in children Data from 1 763 children between the ages of 3 to 11 revealed that nearly all had BDCIPP in their urine However Science Alert reported Those with the highest levels were two and six times more likely than those with low exposure to experience adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such as motor dysfunction or requirements for educational assistance Past research also linked greater exposures to flame retardants during pregnancy with lower intelligence in the child Specifically for every 10 fold increase in prenatal exposure to another type of flame retardant polybrominated diphenyl ethers there was a 3 7 point decline in IQ test scores in children Past research has also demonstrated that children born to mothers with higher levels of flame retardant chemicals in their body had a 4 5 point average decrease in IQ while exposure in childhood is strongly associated with poor attention span reduced fine motor coordination and a decrease in cognitive ability Flame retardants may even change important processes including tryptophan metabolism in the placenta that can affect the developing brain Our findings suggest that more comprehensive scrutiny of the impacts of these common household chemicals on brain health is necessary

natural alternatives to replace toxic hand sanitizers noting The unintended exposure of children to hand sanitizers poses a high risk of potentially fatal complications Skin irritation dryness cracking peeling hypoglycemia apnea and acidosis are examples of unintended consequences of hand sanitizer The sanitizer reportedly kills normal microbial flora on hands which usually promotes innate immunity among children under 12 Children are more susceptible to the toxicity associated with the chemical constituents of marketed chemical based hand sanitizers however the studies to develop

2019 when a series of administrative rule changes were first proposed said Renee Dieperink a Hawaii educator and organizer with Hawaii For Informed Consent The changes were implemented in 2020 despite strong public opposition Dieperink explained that officials used a rule change procedure that allowed top political officials to change some aspects of vaccine policy without consulting the legislature As part of that change Hawaii added several vaccines to the list of required immunizations for K 12 including the HPV vaccine for both boys and girls starting in 7th grade The new rules extended vaccination requirements to daycares private schools and post secondary education Before 2020 medical exemptions required only a letter from a doctor which would exempt a child from all required vaccinations This exemption could also be extended to siblings or other family members because family history matters when it comes to medical issues Dieperink said in a video explaining the exemption process and the rule changes They also added requirements that made it more difficult to obtain a medical exemption With the rule change they gutted our medical exemption Haines said Now it s just a bare bones exemption Once the new laws took effect in 2020 physicians had to fill out a standard medical exemption form The form specifies that children can be exempted from a vaccine only if they have suffered a recognized injury from that vaccine or one of its ingredients Exemptions could not be extended to siblings even in cases of severe injury and death The exemptions are also time

claiming the COVID 19 vaccines were safe and effective for pregnant women Johnson chairman of the U S Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations requested the records in a subpoena sent in January to the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS The subpoena pertained to an investigation into internal COVID 19 vaccine safety communications According to the New York Post the

downplayed or unresolved during the pandemic For example I ve seen cases in my practice where patients developed symptoms like persistent fatigue or heart palpitations post vaccination yet struggled to get clear answers from authorities Missing records could hide similar signals undermining efforts to validate patient experiences or refine vaccine protocols Internal medicine physician Dr Clayton J Baker said Such records would likely be very damning to all CDC officials who perpetuated the false safe and effective narrative about the COVID 19 vaccines from 2021 until the present Given how damning any evidence of ignored or falsified safety signals would be I think it is highly likely that Biden era officials might try to destroy such records if they could Better to be accused of destruction of federal records than to be charged as an accessory to mass negligent homicide Baker said In an April 2023 presentation to the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices

key in combating the obesity epidemic Recent studies have identified a significant link between exposure to metal mixtures and the risk of childhood obesity emphasizing the importance of considering combined metal effects rather than individual metals alone Cobalt has been found to have a protective effect against obesity in children while metals like lead and cadmium increase the risk highlighting the complex interactions between different metals and obesity Adequate maternal levels of micronutrients such as selenium Se and folate help mitigate the adverse effects of toxic metal exposure on childhood obesity underscoring the role of maternal nutrition in child health A better understanding of the intricate relationship between metal exposure and obesity is important for developing more effective prevention and intervention strategies Childhood obesity a condition characterized by excessive body fat poses significant health risks to young individuals Children with obesity often experience a range of health issues that affect their physical and emotional well being Common complications include insulin resistance impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia all of which lead to more severe health complications if left unaddressed Recent research highlights the alarming rise in childhood obesity rates with studies indicating that worldwide more than 340 children and adolescents are affected Moreover the association between obesity and trace elements is becoming increasingly evident For instance elevated levels of copper Cu and decreased levels of essential minerals like zinc and Se have been observed in children with obesity Additionally the interplay between heavy metals and metabolic processes further complicates the obesity landscape indicating that metal exposure significantly contributes to the risk of developing obesity These findings underscore the urgent need to understand the environmental factors driving this epidemic Beyond the immediate health concerns childhood obesity is linked to long term consequences such as Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular diseases and psychological issues like low self esteem and depression These complications not only affect the quality of life during childhood but also set the stage for chronic health problems in adulthood The interplay between metals and obesity related metabolic dysfunctions exacerbates these risks making it necessary to address both dietary and environmental factors in prevention and treatment strategies Further understanding the relationship between heavy metal exposure and

uncover the underlying causes of childhood obesity and implement strategies that promote healthier futures for children worldwide Exploring the impact of metal exposure on health When discussing childhood obesity it s important to recognize the primary risk factors which include poor diet lack of physical activity environmental toxins and genetic predispositions However conventional treatments often focus on medications and even surgery which have significant drawbacks For instance medications prescribed for weight management in children lead to side effects such as gastrointestinal issues and mood changes These treatments don t address the root causes of childhood obesity leaving room for alternative approaches that consider environmental factors like metal exposure Further recent studies have highlighted the role of environmental pollutants particularly heavy metals in its development Metals such as lead cadmium and arsenic have been identified as obesogens substances that disrupt normal metabolic processes and promote weight gain These metals interfere with your body s hormonal balance affecting appetite regulation and fat storage Additionally exposure to these metals occurs through various sources including contaminated food water and air making it a widespread concern Understanding how these metals contribute to childhood obesity involves examining their impact on metabolic pathways Heavy metals mimic or block hormones that regulate metabolism leading to increased fat accumulation and altered energy balance For example lead exposure has been linked to insulin resistance a condition where your body s cells do not respond effectively to insulin resulting in higher blood sugar levels and increased fat storage This disruption in metabolic processes sets the stage for obesity especially in children who are still developing Adding to the complexity of the condition conventional diagnostic methods often rely on body mass index or BMI measurements which do not accurately reflect a child s health status BMI does not account for muscle mass bone density or the distribution of fat leading to misclassification of weight status Moreover the influence of environmental factors like metal exposure is not typically considered in standard diagnostic criteria often resulting in an incomplete understanding of the child s condition The complexity of diagnosing childhood obesity is further compounded by the variability in individual responses to metal exposure Genetic factors influence how a child s body processes and reacts to these metals making it difficult to establish a one size fits all diagnostic approach Additionally the lack of comprehensive screening for metal exposure in routine health assessments means that this contributor to obesity is often overlooked This gap in diagnosis underscores the need for more", "chunk_id":

further compounded by the variability in individual responses to metal exposure Genetic factors influence how a child s body processes and reacts to these metals making it difficult to establish a one size fits all diagnostic approach Additionally the lack of comprehensive screening for metal exposure in routine health assessments means that this contributor to obesity is often overlooked This gap in diagnosis underscores the need for more holistic approaches that integrate environmental assessments into the evaluation of childhood obesity Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us The impact of heavy metals on childhood obesity A recent study investigated the relationship between exposure to various metalloids and the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children aged 6 to 12 Researchers focused on 10 different metalloids analyzing their individual and combined effects on body weight To achieve this they measured the urinary levels of these metalloids in a sample of 143 children comprising 92 healthy controls and 51 cases of overweight and obesity The study population consisted of prepuberal children from Granada Spain who had lived in the study areas for at least six months By examining urine samples the researchers aimed to determine how these metals influenced the likelihood of developing excess body weight Their findings highlighted a complex interaction between various metal exposures and obesity risk One of the significant discoveries was the inverse association between urinary cobalt levels and the incidence of overweight and obesity Children with higher levels of urinary cobalt were less likely to be overweight or obese Similarly chromium Cr showed a borderline negative relationship with obesity indicating that higher Cr levels appear to contribute to lower body weight Molybdenum Mo along with Cr and cobalt played a role in reducing the likelihood of excess body weight among the participants Conversely the study found that certain toxic metals were positively associated with obesity The study found that urinary levels of lead cadmium and total arsenic were positively associated with overweight and obesity in children indicating that higher exposure to these metals increases the risk of developing excess body weight This relationship suggests that exposure to these metals increases the risk of developing obesity in children Interestingly the control group exhibited higher urinary mercury levels than the obese cases adding another layer to the metal specific effects observed in the study When analyzing the combined effects of multiple metalloids the research revealed that the mixture of lead cadmium and arsenic significantly contributed to the increased risk of obesity This mixture effect underscores the importance of considering how different metals interact within the body to influence health outcomes On the other hand the combination of Mo Cr and cobalt was associated with a decrease in obesity

certain metals counteract the effects of others The prevalence of excess body weight among children has been on the rise over the past decade This study adds to the growing body of evidence that environmental factors particularly exposure to toxic metals play a significant role in this troubling trend How metals influence obesity Metals like arsenic cadmium lead mercury and nickel Ni are recognized for their ability to contribute to obesity by disrupting metabolic processes Moreover the study highlighted that deficiencies in essential metals such as Cr Cu iron Fe and magnesium Mg also lead to increased adiposity or body fat accumulation This finding points to the delicate balance required in metal exposure for maintaining a healthy body weight Urinary metal levels were deemed appropriate biomarkers for assessing long term exposure providing a reliable method for future research in this area The researchers emphasized that the effects of one metal depend heavily on its interactions with others This complexity makes it challenging to isolate the impact of individual metals on obesity without considering their combined effects The study s methodology accounted for these interactions offering a more comprehensive understanding of how metalloid mixtures influence overweight and obesity in children Biologically cobalt influences body weight by regulating glycogen deposits and leptin levels a hormone that controls appetite Higher leptin levels signal fullness reducing food intake and preventing overeating Chromium involved in carbohydrate metabolism might enhance insulin sensitivity helping your body manage blood sugar levels more effectively These mechanisms provide a plausible explanation for the observed inverse relationship between these metals and obesity By identifying specific metals that either exacerbate or mitigate obesity risk interventions effectively targeted to reduce harmful exposures and promote healthier growth patterns in children

widespread among the study population and significantly increased the likelihood of children developing OWO This association was especially strong in children born to mothers who already had OWO Importantly the study identified that adequate levels of maternal Se and folate were effective in reducing the risk of childhood OWO highlighting the role of maternal nutrition in mitigating the adverse effects of toxic metal exposure The study utilized advanced statistical methods to analyze the interactions between metal exposure and micronutrient levels The researchers found a clear dose response relationship meaning that as exposure to the metals increased so did the risk of obesity in children This relationship underscored that there are no safe levels of exposure to these toxic metals as even minimal exposure had detrimental effects on weight and overall health Selenium and folate protect against metal exposure toxicity The protective effect of Se and folate was most pronounced in children born to mothers with OWO These micronutrients appear to counteract the obesogenic properties of mercury and lead providing a buffer that reduces the metals impact on the child s weight The study emphasized that maintaining adequate levels of these nutrients during pregnancy is essential for safeguarding children s long term health Biologically Se plays a pivotal role in the body s antioxidant defenses helping to neutralize harmful free radicals generated by metal exposure This antioxidant function prevents oxidative stress which is linked to the development of obesity and other metabolic disorders Folate is necessary for DNA methylation a process that regulates gene expression Proper DNA methylation ensures that genes involved in metabolism and fat storage function normally thereby preventing the onset of obesity The interplay between Se folate and toxic metals involves complex biochemical pathways Se may bind to heavy metals reducing their bioavailability and toxicity This binding process minimizes the metals ability to interfere with metabolic processes that regulate body weight Meanwhile folate s role in DNA methylation ensures that epigenetic

causing permanent damage to the nervous system and impairing cognitive development Lead and cadmium are particularly dangerous accumulating in bones and teeth while disrupting multiple organ systems Here s how to reduce your children s exposure to these harmful toxins Choose clean school lunches Testing has revealed alarming amounts of heavy metals in school lunches Pack homemade lunches using whole unprocessed foods whenever possible Avoid pre packaged meals and snacks that increase exposure to heavy metals through their ingredients and packaging Focus on fresh fruits vegetables and clean protein sources from grass fed animals Filter your water Install a high quality water filtration system in your home that removes heavy metals This step helps reduce exposure through drinking water and food preparation Look for filters certified to remove lead cadmium and other toxic metals Test your home environment Have your home tested for lead paint especially if it was built before 1978 Check the soil around your property for contamination particularly if you grow food or your children play in the dirt Remove sources of heavy metal exposure like old pipes or contaminated soil Choose breast milk over formula Many infant formulas are contaminated with heavy metals adding one more reason why breast milk is the best option for babies If breast milk is not an option I recommend making

competitions and was in peak physical condition All that changed after he got two COVID 19 shots in the summer and fall of 2021 Immediately after his second dose in September 2021 Sepp who had no history of heart problems experienced heart inflammation and severe chest pain He was diagnosed with pericarditis linked to vaccination and subsequently experienced severe and debilitating autoimmune

efforts to restore his health It feels like a knife coming inside your knees Sepp received doses of two different COVID 19 shots Pfizer BioNTech on June 29 2021 and Moderna on Sept 16 2021 According to Sepp mixing and matching COVID 19 vaccines was commonplace in Norway even though doctors told him it was not OK at all Following the first dose Sepp experienced some mild complications but he didn t immediately connect them to the vaccine He participated in the demanding Norseman competition in the summer of 2021 He didn t perform as well as usual but still finished in the top 20 Sepp initially attributed his diminished performance to that year s unusually warm summer in Norway After his second COVID 19 shot though the effects were immediate According to the documentary within hours Sepp

system brain fog headaches and cold feet According to Sepp he was experiencing symptoms associated with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or POTS a condition that can cause the heart to beat faster when transitioning from sitting or lying down to standing up POTS has been linked to the COVID 19 shots Sepp said before his vaccination he was in peak physical condition and rarely caught colds If you check my Instagram you can see in the wintertime I went running in the snow after that I m going swimming in the ice cold water Sepp said I was running five kilometers approximately 3 miles to a little lake near my house I always jumped in the water even if it was 15 C 5 F outside I was sitting in the water for five minutes and then I ran back home I never even had a winter jacket Activities like this were part of the normal training for the extreme triathlon competitions he participated in The competitions often involve swimming in below zero conditions and long distance runs in mountainous terrain during rainy or windy conditions Sepp s injuries made it impossible for him to continue participating in the competitions According to the documentary Out of Heiko s many symptoms one of the most shocking ones was serious muscle spasms reminiscent of those observed in Parkinson s disease It s so hard to explain what kind of muscle pain you have Sepp said It feels like

to hear from you Contact Us Sepp offered 140 in compensation for his vaccine injuries Sepp s treatment by Norway s national healthcare system has added insult to injury he said According to the documentary Sepp realized the doctors didn t fully investigate the possibility of an autoimmune disease and didn t conduct all the necessary tests As a result he had to seek answers in private clinics at his own expense which placed a heavy financial burden on himself and his family Sepp submitted a claim to Norway s vaccine injury compensation system but was informed earlier this year that none of his autoimmune symptoms are vaccine related According to the decision letter There is no permanent and significant injury There is no basis to claim that the vaccine can cause conditions such as fatigue tiredness or general pain lasting beyond four to six weeks Such conditions occur frequently in the general population and can be due to many factors The system did offer him about 140 in compensation for vaccine induced pericarditis Sepp has hired a lawyer and appealed the decision but is still awaiting the outcome Besides mounting legal fees Sepp s medical expenses are still piling up We are at this kind of point where we don t have any money at all every end of the month we have to figure out how we will get food in our fridge According to the documentary Sepp and his family have launched a crowdfunding campaign sold numerous personal belongings and taken on credit card debt to pay for treatment at private clinics and for his medication including steroid tablets and injectable drugs for rheumatoid arthritis symptoms This course of treatment is untenable though According to the documentary Heiko must avoid long term use of steroids because of their strong side

strategic cases that CHD will fund later this year and in 2024 on behalf of individuals with EMS according to Miriam Eckenfels Garcia director of CHD s EMR program In these lawsuits we are leveraging federal disability laws to petition for reasonable accommodation for clients that have been disabled by RF radiation coming from a cell tower near them Eckenfels Garcia told The Defender In addition to protecting disabled people individually she said the cases are testing whether the ADA can be used as an effective means to push back against the uncontrolled rollout of wireless infrastructure We are very excited to launch this new strategic line of cases which we hope will shift the paradigm for people severely harmed and disabled by RF radiation she said McCollough said these cases are significant because the number of people affected by EHS is substantial We re talking millions of people and hundreds of thousands for whom it just ruins their lives completely The numbers are such that frankly we expect to find that it overwhelms the people who are already disabled by other causes he added and people disabled by EHS must also be accommodated under the ADA Man moves to rural Idaho to escape RF radiation Allen was diagnosed with EMS in 2014 while working as a licensed general contractor in California on job sites with high RF radiation After realizing how exposure to RF radiation was exacerbating his EMS symptoms he and his family decided to relocate to a small farm in Idaho roughly two miles away from a cell tower Allen also changed careers to minimize his exposure to RF radiation by getting licensed as a real estate broker and working from his home which he hardwired for internet access With these changes Allen was able to successfully live and work normally

with RF blocking tint utilizing wire screens and wearing special clothing that blocks RF The RF emitted by the transmitting equipment threatens the plaintiff s life His condition is such that he may die as a result of the next cardiac event caused from RF exposure the complaint alleges The wireless companies responded to Allen s request for a reasonable accommodation modification by claiming that the federal disability laws do not apply to their tower operations because they do not meet the criteria for a place of public accommodation The Courts of Appeals are split according to the complaint on whether a place refers to an actual physical structure or whether it also applies to goods services and privileges that are also offered virtually The complaint argues that the space on the tower leased to the telecommunications companies and associated infrastructure that are necessary to access the internet constitute a physical place subject to compliance with the ADA It adds that given that access to the virtual realm is essential to modern life it should also be considered a place under the ADA Although Allen subscribes to wireless services he cannot use them without accommodation

engage in a good faith process to accommodate his disability and that he is entitled to a remedy that will allow him to access services without being substantially injured by them Second he asked the court to end the defendants discrimination against him by mandating the tower be moved to a new location that is reasonably calculated to avoid injuring the disabled population meaning that it wouldn t be installed right next to other citizens with EMS Alternatively he is asking the companies to be compelled to utilize their existing technological capabilities to adequately reduce the amount of RF energy directed at his home and body Third he is asking the court to compel the companies to stop discriminating against him and instead make reasonable accommodations so he can access their services

As public concern grows over the large and growing number of shots on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC childhood immunization schedule several critics are sounding the alarm about

day they are born Studies show that more than 90 of infants typically do so By age 24 months most of those infants have received the recommended three doses of the vaccine Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus HBV which can range from a mild short term acute illness lasting a few weeks to a serious long term chronic infection The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids most often via intimate contact such as sex or sharing intravenous IV drug equipment Being an IV drug user is the most common risk factor for the disease Infected pregnant mothers can also pass the disease to their infants but relatively few do about 25 000 pregnant women per year or 0 69 have Hep B and about 1 000 of them pass it to their babies according to the U S Department of Health and Human Services The CDC says almost all children and older adults infected with acute HBV recover completely with no lasting liver damage Women can be tested for the disease to see if their babies would benefit from vaccination but that s not what the CDC recommends Instead today the Hep B vaccine is required for children to attend either childcare school or both in every state except Alabama

added to the childhood schedule In a Yale Journal of Health Policy Law and Ethics article Children s Health Defense CHD CEO Mary Holland questioned the constitutionality of mandating the Hep B vaccine for children to access education especially given that CDC data show that transmission is unlikely through routine contact among children She said the CDC s position on mass vaccination for children changed after the pharmaceutical companies got legal protection from liability When the CDC vaccine advisory committee made its first Hep B vaccine recommendation in 1982 the agency observed that the U S was a place of low HBV prevalence CDC officials recommended the shot only for people at higher risk including healthcare workers people likely to be in sexual or needle stick contact with an infected person and infants born to mothers infected with the virus In 1988 the committee called for all pregnant mothers to be screened to determine if vaccination would be necessary At that time it was estimated that 16 500 mothers per year were infected and that without vaccination an estimated 3 500 infants would become chronic carriers Later that year the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP created by the 1986 Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was established The law protects vaccine makers from liability for injuries related to vaccines on the CDC s childhood schedule and the VICP is meant to provide an alternative means of compensating people who suffer accidental injury or death from taking those vaccines By 1991 the CDC had begun describing HBV risks differently stating that the consequences of infection were major health problems in the U S even though rates had not changed and the number of children infected with HBV was just a few hundred The CDC s advisory committee concluded that because it was challenging to vaccinate those at risk for HBV mass immunization against the virus was the most effective means of preventing HBV infection and its consequences

five days in the different trials No medium or long term studies were done no comparisons were made between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects and the vaccines were administered only to healthy babies According to the Recombivax HB label during clinical trials 434 doses of the drug were administered to 147 healthy infants and children up to age 10 who were each monitored for five days after each dose During those five days 10 of infants experienced systemic reactions including irritability fever 101 F oral equivalent diarrhea fatigue weakness diminished appetite and rhinitis Among the much larger group of 1 252 healthy adults reactions were wide ranging and sometimes serious They included injection site issues and fevers upper respiratory infections influenza body pain insomnia and hypotension The Engerix B package insert doesn t specify how many babies were included in its clinical trials However it does indicate the trial subjects were monitored for only four days The insert lists similar adverse events to those of Recombivax HB Post marketing studies which collect voluntary reports of adverse effects registered in places like the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System

this 20 years ago 50 years ago or 100 years ago Bell also expressed concern about the pressure to use new and more sensitive tests incentivizing sales and use and yielding results that are divorced from actual risk or the production of useful data It seems almost inevitable that we will find bird flu virus if we look for it in this way he said As an example of misplaced risk assessments Bell said most deaths during the 1917 18 pandemic were not due to the virus but occurred because modern antibiotics for treating secondary bacterial infections were unavailable It is relatively easy to demonstrate theoretical risk and run a fear campaign that may change behavior and sell a product such as a vaccine Bell said It is much harder to run a proportionate evidence based and sustainable

from newer mRNA shots including its bird flu vaccine and experimental COVID flu combination vaccine to make up for waning post pandemic demand for its COVID vaccine The company plans to explore

has been that bird flu spread from penguins to sea lions to a western Minnesota goat to Texas dairy cattle and finally to a dairy farmer with red eyes It s been a two year marketing campaign Bartlett said Bartlett said the messaging is intended to manufacture the perception of a need for new mRNA products despite the absence of long term safety data Last year former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf warned that a potential bird flu pandemic could have a 25 mortality rate Jeremy Farrar Ph D then the World Health Organization s chief scientist warned that bird flu has an extremely high mortality

Washington University said the outgoing Biden administration had not done enough to address bird flu and criticized the lack of availability of a bird flu vaccine After the start of Trump s second term and the implementation of funding cuts to government health agencies mainstream media reports suggested the cuts were placing the public at risk of a worsening bird flu outbreak In February

of emergency announcing that some flu viruses including H5N1 bird flu could cause a pandemic and threaten national security The announcement by HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra amended a 2013 section of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic FD C Act which allows the agency to extend the availability of medical countermeasures to pandemic influenza A viruses including the currently circulating H5N1 strain of bird flu Prior to the amendment the declaration covered only the previous H7N9 strain of bird flu The announcement specified that current circumstances justify the emergency use authorization EUA of in vitro diagnostics such as RT PCR tests to detect bird flu and other pandemic influenza A viruses This paves the way for more EUA vaccines devices and products to possibly be effective against these new and unknown viruses attorney Ray Flores told The Defender He added Just as EUA PCR tests exaggerated the COVID 19 pandemic the detection of avian influenza and influenza A viruses with pandemic potential via unlicensed PCR tests is destined to justify lockdowns masking invasive nasal swabs and wide scale vaccination with experimental mRNA technology The stage is set for RT PCR tests to take the pivotal role of determining false positives with amped up cycle thresholds designed to declare asymptomatic otherwise healthy people to be infected just like last time Under the FD C Act HHS can take steps to facilitate countermeasures only after the secretary of either the U S Department of Homeland Security U S Department of Defense or HHS determines there is an emergency or potential for an emergency involving a chemical biological radiological or nuclear agent that may threaten the national or health security of U S citizens After that determination the HHS secretary can declare that existing circumstances justify an EUA that would allow the FDA to authorize previously unlicensed drugs or vaccines or previously unapproved uses of licensed drugs The amendment covers animal or human flu viruses circulating in wild birds humans or domestic animals that may infect humans may have caused pandemics in the past or may mutate to cause a pandemic in

although the virus is not easily transmissible to humans and none of the human cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC involved severe disease the announcement said We

AMA said it is publishing the code update now to ensure electronic systems across the U S health care system are prepared in advance for the potential FDA authorization The update included new codes for administering the potential bird flu vaccine to both children and adults The new code is for a cell culture derived vaccine adjuvanted for intramuscular use which refers to an inactivated flu

into them when a new virus strain appears in what Nass called a plug and play approach to making new vaccines Nass reviewed the three currently approved bird flu vaccines raising serious questions about the small size of the clinical trials and serious adverse events in the trials including fatalities For example she said Sanofi Pasteur s bird flu vaccine was licensed in 2007 for the national stockpile based on a clinical trial of only 103 subjects One of those subjects died and three others experienced a serious adverse event including cancer In trials for GSK s vaccine licensed in 2013 0 5 of subjects experienced serious adverse events including thyroid cancer and cerebral vascular events In the trials for Audenz CSL Seqirus H5N1 vaccine serious adverse events occurred in all age groups including deaths in older adults These vaccines she said are prototypes for vaccines that could be emergency authorized for the current virus According to Nass the media are telling people referring to a May 2024 article in The Guardian the only question is when do we pull the trigger on these vaccines Nass added that the U S government in May relaxed the rules for handling bird viruses so they could be examined in regular hospital labs rather than high security labs So the U S government is trying to imply that this is a deadly virus but they re acknowledging it is basically a

solid scientific footing While advocates often claim the treatments are medically necessary and lifesaving the report concludes the overall quality of evidence concerning the effects of any

year 27 states have passed laws restricting or banning gender affirming care for minors These range from full bans on hormones and surgery to tighter consent requirements Nineteen of those laws were passed in 2023 alone according to the Kaiser Family Foundation Though many face court challenges the trend reflects mounting public concern over the medicalization of gender distressed youth The HHS findings are expected to accelerate further scrutiny and legislative action Global shifts The HHS review is part of a broader international movement to re examine pediatric gender medicine In 2024 the U K s Cass Review led by pediatrician Dr Hilary Cass delivered a landmark critique of the National Health Service s gender services Cass concluded that the model had been adopted prematurely based on a single Dutch study and lacked sufficient evidence In response the U K banned the routine use of puberty blockers and began closing the Tavistock gender clinic replacing it with regional centres focused on holistic mental health care In Australia the Queensland government took similar steps earlier this year pausing all prescriptions of puberty blockers and cross sex hormones for minors pending further review The move followed the suspension of Dr Jillian Spencer a senior psychiatrist from her clinical duties at Queensland Children s Hospital after she raised concerns about the gender care protocols being used Her case has since become a focal point in Australia s national debate on youth gender medicine A reckoning The HHS report is more than a policy review it is a warning It reveals that thousands of children many struggling with underlying psychological issues have been placed on a path of irreversible medicalization without the basic safeguards expected in any other area of healthcare The report concludes that gender medicine has been practiced backwards treatments were introduced first and only later did the search for evidence begin It calls for a course

2020 the CDC said in its latest report from the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network ADDM which is published every two years Overall the prevalence of autism in U S children rose approximately 17 between 2020 and 2022 continuing a decades long trend The mainstream media responded in lockstep to yesterday s report by denying that autism is an epidemic and doubling down on the argument that rising rates are simply the outcome of better diagnosis The Washington Post called the 17 increase small and The Hill labeled it a slight increase Kennedy responded today saying the rate increases are real and that each year there has been a steady relentless increase Kennedy said that while some people may be genetically predisposed to autism it takes an environmental exposure to trigger the condition He added This epidemic denial has become a feature in the mainstream media and it s based on an industry canard Obviously there are people who don t want us to look at environmental exposures Kennedy shared data from other previous studies on autism prevalence including a 1987 study from North Dakota in which researchers attempted to identify every child with autism

percentage of ASD cases with higher IQs 85 has decreased steadily over the last six ADDM reports to 36 1 in the 2022 survey Nearly two thirds of children with ASD in the latest survey had either

19 RSV flu and others the committee is responsible for adding vaccines to the CDC s childhood immunization schedule Currently the CDC recommends that by age 18 a child receive at least 76 doses of 18 different vaccines including the COVID 19 vaccine Once a vaccine is included on the childhood schedule the drugmaker is protected from liability for any injuries associated with the shot The combination of school vaccine mandates and no liability guarantees a steady revenue stream for vaccine makers Most ACIP members have a financial conflict of interest with the pharmaceutical companies

Politico reported that Kennedy plans to replace members of HHS advisory committees who have conflicts of interest as part of his broader effort to intervene in Big Pharma s undue influence over regulatory agencies That effort is likely to target ACIP members Critics of ACIP told The Defender they were optimistic that the postponement along with other actions already taken by the CDC such as ending its Wild to Mild flu shot campaign might signal an important shift in vaccine policy and public messaging This postponement raises questions about whether there are internal conflicts or strategic recalibrations underway at the CDC said Sayer Ji founder and editor of GreenMedInfo Given that the outgoing administration stacked ACIP with staunchly pro vaccine appointees one could speculate that the postponement is a stalling tactic to ensure continuity of their agenda Alternatively it could reflect an effort to re evaluate and possibly restructure ACIP under new leadership In its final days the Biden administration quietly stacked ACIP with several new pro vaccine members a move intended to insulate the scientific integrity of the panel from the incoming administration STAT News reported The outlet said these appointments were a direct response to President Donald Trump s nomination of Kennedy to head HHS However Kennedy could override or otherwise bypass these selections Pediatrician Dr Michelle Perro founder of GMOScience said she thought postponing the ACIP meeting was a great idea because it opens the possibility that vaccine policy decisions are made with greater transparency and scientific integrity which has been lacking under the previous leadership There are concerns regarding conflicts of interest and the members of ACIP lack of rigorous safety discussions and rushed recommendations without sufficient long term data review she said Drug safety advocate Kim Witczak a member of the U S Food and Drug Administration s FDA Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee also celebrated the postponement which she said is not only acceptable but necessary She said the move provides an opportunity to stop reflect and

International determined radiofrequency electromagnetic fields RF EMF emitted by cellphones and other wireless devices were linked to an increased risk of malignant gliomas in the brain and malignant schwannomas or nerve tumors in the heart in studies on animals The review noted that both tumor types had previously been found in studies on humans The WHO s review also concluded there is moderate

in concordance with the tumor types identified in human studies of mobile phone users As animal studies are essential for predicting cancer risk in humans governments should develop science based safety standards to protect human health The WHO review prompted leading scientists with the ICBE EMF on April 27 to call for immediate policy action to protect people from possible harm from wireless

The FCC continues to defy a 2021 court mandate to explain how its current limits adequately protect humans especially children and the environment from harm The agency needs to act now if it s going to protect public health according to Moskowitz He said in a statement The preponderance of the research published since 1996 finds adverse biologic and health effects from long term exposure to low levels of modulated or pulsed wireless RF radiation Given the widespread global usage of wireless among users of all ages even a very small increase in the incidence of disease will have broad implications for public health The Defender asked the FCC when it will comply with the 2021 court mandate and if it has plans to revise its wireless radiation exposure limits The agency did not

cases without changing body weight fasting glucose or fasting insulin levels according to a peer reviewed study published Dec 4 in Nature The authors of the study showed that dietary fructose promotes cancer tumor growth in mice that have melanoma breast cancer and cervical cancer Fructose is a naturally occurring sugar found in some fruits vegetables honey and table sugar according to the Mayo Clinic The consumption of fructose has greatly increased in recent decades since food and beverage companies started routinely using high fructose corn syrup as a sweetener the authors said in their report According to the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA high fructose corn syrup is derived from corn starch Corn starch is naturally made of glucose but added enzymes convert some of the glucose to fructose which tastes sweeter Gary Patti Ph D a professor of genetics and medicine at Washington University the senior director for the university s Center for Metabolomics and Isotope Tracing and the study s corresponding author told The Defender We put animals with cancer on a high fructose diet and then compared the progression of the disease with animals who were on standard diets We also fed fructose to cancer cells in a dish We were surprised that dietary fructose drove tumor growth in the animals but that the same cells could not use it as a nutrient when isolated in a dish This led Patti and his co authors to discover that fructose does not feed tumor growth directly Instead the liver transforms fructose into other nutrients that then drive tumor growth indirectly Patti said The researchers were also surprised to see how dramatic an impact fructose had on tumors In some cases Patti said in a press release the growth rate of the tumors accelerated by two fold or even higher Eating a lot of fructose was clearly very bad for the progression of these tumors The study s findings raise questions about the role of diet in mitigating cancer The idea that you can tackle cancer

you are putting into your body especially non essential additives such as high fructose corn syrup or cane sugar Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Liver transforms fructose into nutrients that tumors use In their report Patti and his co authors noted that prior research suggested that fructose promotes tumor growth directly by serving as a fuel but that s not what they found was happening Fowle Grider said the researchers initially expected that tumor cells would metabolize fructose just like glucose directly utilizing its atoms to build new cellular components such as DNA However Fowle Grider said the fructose was barely metabolized in the tumor cells that were isolated in a petri dish We quickly learned that the tumor cells alone don t tell the whole story Equally important is the liver which transforms fructose into nutrients that the tumors can use After discovering that cancer cells in dishes weren t enhanced by fructose the study authors went back to observing molecular changes in the blood of animals fed high fructose diets Using metabolomics a method of looking at small molecules as they move through cells and across different tissues in the body they noticed elevated levels of certain lipid species including lysophosphatidylcholines LPCs These lipids are building blocks for cell membranes the press release said Cancer cells need them to grow The study authors also noticed that when they put liver cells in a dish and fed them fructose the liver cells released LPCs This led them to conclude that consuming a lot of fructose indirectly fuels tumor growth by increasing the availability of LPCs in the blood Patti explained When we think about tumors we tend to focus on what dietary components they consume directly You put something in your body and then you imagine that the tumor takes it up But humans are complex What you put in your body can be consumed by healthy tissue and then converted into something else that tumors use The

Fran Drescher last week said the existing Hollywood vaccine mandate walks the razor s edge of compromising religious disability and body sovereignty freedoms Deadline com reported Dresher president of SAG AFTRA called for the union s national board to review the latest scientific data on the efficacy of COVID 19 vaccines in relation to their effectiveness against new variants before agreeing to extend the industry s existing mandate The industry s COVID 19 protocols include a narrowly defined provision that allows employers to require vaccinations as a condition of employment according to Deadline com However these provisions are set to expire on Sept 30 According to its website SAG AFTRA which stands for the Screen Actors Guild American Federation of Television and Radio Artists said it represents 160 000 actors announcers broadcast journalists dancers DJs news writers news editors program hosts puppeteers recording artists singers stunt performers voiceover artists and other media professionals The union s vaccine mandate includes exemptions for individuals who cannot be vaccinated due to disability or a sincerely held religious belief practice or observance but opponents argue that those exceptions are too rarely allowed Drescher said that with thousands of unvaccinated members still unable to work all new information begs review and consideration before deciding our position on the next RTWA Return to Work Agreement All I ask is we educate ourselves with the newest science and make an informed decision because members livelihoods hang in the balance she added In a recent article for SAG AFTRA magazine Drescher supported her calls for a review of the existing mandate arguing that in July Dr Anthony Fauci stated the current variant evades the vaccine Drescher was referring to remarks Fauci made on Fox News where he said vaccines because of the high degree of transmissibility of this virus don t protect overly well as it were against infection Drescher also wrote in her article that giving employers the discretionary rights to decide which of us can or can t work based on our medical history is a dangerous slippery slope If an employer can decide you can

on record in support of the RTWA According to Deadline com the RTWA includes provisions for comprehensive and mandatory COVID 19 testing regimens and a zone system based on a perceived level of vulnerability for workers in the entertainment industry based on their proximity to individuals who are obliged to work without a mask or practicing social distancing This zone system applies to vaccine mandates within the entertainment industry as cast and crew working in Zone A alongside unmasked actors are subject to the most restrictive protocols with producers given the option to implement mandatory vaccination policies for casts and crew on a production by production basis The RTWA received continued support in April when 86 44 of SAG AFTRA s national board voted to continue the protocols which also overwhelmingly were favored by the union s executive and safety committees While the vaccine mandate is left up to individual employers and the zone system SAG AFTRA s national board of directors in a 75 25 vote in June 2021 approved a motion authorizing the union s staff to approve requests for mandatory vaccination policies and established guidelines for mandates should they ever take effect Opinion within SAG AFTRA and Drescher s own governing faction within the union with many continuing to support the existing mandates and policies This was evident at a July 23 SAG AFTRA board meeting held online where according to Deadline com members of the guild s political factions that supported Drescher s election last year reportedly yelled at her claiming

Vaccines An international group of healthcare professionals scientists and academics has launched The Hope Accord demanding immediate suspension of COVID 19 mRNA vaccines and the return of healthcare and science of the people for the people by the people according to health commentator John Campbell Ph D You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A group of healthcare professionals scientists academics and concerned citizens has launched The Hope Accord an international initiative calling for the immediate suspension of COVID 19 mRNA vaccines and a comprehensive reevaluation of their safety and efficacy The accord has garnered signatures from prominent medical experts and researchers who argue that emerging evidence suggests these novel vaccine products may be contributing to increased rates of disability and excess deaths John Campbell Ph D a retired nurse educator and popular health commentator described the accord in a July 5 video as basically a new international movement developed by clever doctors and scientists But he emphasized that the accord is open for everyone to sign The accord s signatories including well known and highly reputable professionals such as diagnostic pathologist Clare Craig Dr Kat Lindley and Bret Weinstein Ph D are calling for a return to what they consider fundamental medical ethics and scientific transparency The movement comes amid ongoing debates about the long term impacts of the global COVID 19 response and the rapid deployment of new vaccine technologies The Hope Accord outlines five primary demands each addressing what signatories view as critical issues in today s medical and scientific landscape 1 Suspension of COVID mRNA vaccine products At the forefront of the accord is a call for the immediate suspension of COVID 19 mRNA vaccine products The accord argues that a growing body of evidence suggests that the widespread rollout of the novel Covid 19 mRNA vaccine products is contributing to an alarming rise in disability and excess deaths Signatories justify this call by pointing to what they describe as plausible biological mechanisms of harm and high rates of adverse events reported in clinical trials national surveillance programs and autopsy studies These vaccine products contain genetic sequences we feel should be suspended at least for the time being until we know one heck of a lot more about them Campbell said 2 Reevaluation of vaccine safety and efficacy The second point calls for a comprehensive reevaluation of the safety and efficacy of all COVID 19 vaccine products The accord demands independent investigations that are properly resourced preferably by governments and independent agencies Campbell said in a follow up video exploring the details of The Hope Accord The accord calls for focusing on the actual clinical impact on illness and mortality rather than relying on synthetic results based on modeled assumptions We certainly want to limit the use of modeling Campbell",

to limit the use of modeling Campbell said adding that it causes all sorts of problems Accord signer and DarkHorse Podcast co host Weinstein in a brief video posted July 6 on X formerly Twitter said the claim that the mRNA vaccines were safe was a dangerous lie 3 Recognition and support for vaccine injured individuals The Hope Accord s third demand focuses on immediate recognition and support for those claiming to be injured by COVID 19 vaccines Vaccine injury must be recognized and every effort made to understand their conditions Campbell said The accord calls for readily accessible multidisciplinary clinics offering investigation and treatment and appropriate compensation for all those who have been harmed according to Campbell Signatories argue that denying vaccine injuries betrays those who followed official directives often under coercion from mandates restricting access to work education and other aspects of daily life Lindley president of the Global Heath Project and an organizer of the Global Covid Summit told The Defender she signed the accord because governments and regulatory agencies continue to ignore safety and injury issues While we have had some hearings there has been no accountability for actions taken during the pandemic she said Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us 4 Restoration of ethical principles The fourth point addresses what signatories see as the abandonment of fundamental medical ethics during the COVID 19 pandemic Campbell highlighted principles such as First do no harm informed consent bodily autonomy and the notion that adults protect children not the other way around The accord argues these principles were disregarded under the premise of an emergency Emergencies are never a reason to abandon our principles it is precisely at such times that we most profoundly depend on them it states Lindley said the lack of ethics on the part of the medical establishment has been very disheartening and is one of the reasons she rewrote the Hippocratic oath a few years ago As physicians we have failed in our duty to protect the vulnerable and we must reevaluate the state of medicine that we find

causes The final demand calls for addressing what signatories view as the root causes of current medical and scientific predicaments The accord seeks an honest and thorough investigation into factors such as institutional groupthink conflicts of interest and the suppression of scientific debate Campbell emphasized the need for greater transparency and data access throughout his discussion of The Hope Accord Unpublished data needs to be put into the public domain he said Agencies and vested interests around the world are holding data that you and I are not allowed to see This has to stop Campbell stressed the importance of free speech and scientific debate This is how science progresses He also highlighted the need to address publication bias suggesting that unfavorable results may have been rejected or withheld due to fears of reputational damage He argued that this approach contradicts scientific principles All results should be published good bad and indifferent warts and all the whole thing In a July 5 post on X U K cardiologist and accord signer Dr Aseem Malhotra discussed the accord saying Big Pharma is an industry whose business model is one of fraud Healthcare and science of the people for the people by the people Campbell expressed particular concern about the erosion of free speech during the pandemic response saying it reminded him of past totalitarian regimes We don t want censorship in our era he said We want free speech and a democratic principle that underpins the ability to question untested interventions Looking to the future Campbell stressed the need to learn from recent experiences and restore ethical principles in medicine and public health He said We ultimately seek a renewed commitment to the core principles of ethical medicine and how it includes science and all life in general really returning to an era in which we strive for transparency accountability and responsible decision making through the spheres of medicine and public

won t be how many lives the virus claimed It will be how many were lost to a system that collapsed into fear censorship and fatal conformity At TrialSite News we chronicled the crisis as it unfolded We reported early relentlessly and despite immense pushback that the majority of COVID 19 infections were mild to moderate Peer reviewed research later affirmed what we knew by spring 2020 roughly 90 95 of infections did not require hospitalization and those at real risk were predominantly the elderly or chronically ill Even Bill Gates eventually admitted the fatality rate was relatively low and the disease pattern was akin to the flu Just think of the implications But public health leaders didn t follow the data they followed panic and centralized narrative control promulgated by a

the patient is incredibly important to interpret that recommendation from a public health agency Walke also conceded that public health agencies could have better communicated vaccine risks to the public He said Once we have that type of information we try to push that out in various ways including the scientific publications but also through again various state and local leaders to try to

Maryland researchers analyzed insurance claims data from 78 238 commercially and publicly insured young women ages 9 through 26 who received a first HPV shot between 2016 and 2020 Using a self controlled case series method where each individual functions as its own control they compared the young women s conditions during the six months before they were exposed to the shot with a post vaccination risk window of up to 36 months They identified 1 654 women with autonomic dysfunction and 3 140 with menstrual irregularities both of which were statistically significant safety signals The younger cohort was at higher risk for menstrual irregularities than the older cohort They hypothesized that the difference may be because the rapid and significant changes associated with puberty make younger girls more vulnerable to the vaccine The researchers said that although a large body of evidence supports the efficacy and safety of HPV vaccination their study was motivated by emerging work that has begun to question long term adverse effects They said there has been limited research investigating the safety of the vaccine but that in recent years a growing body of research has linked the vaccine to chronic and potentially disabling side effects such as those affecting the autonomic and reproductive systems Safety signals evident during Gardasil clinical trials A link

before the trial even got underway saying the company didn t have the authority to add warnings to its label Plaintiffs are appealing the ruling Expert reports made public in both trials however showed that Merck and regulators cherry picked data to claim there was no link between Gardasil and POTS They also showed that the company did not disclose an additional aluminum based adjuvant

Insider to save this article Sign Up By Yuhong Dong The decline of public trust in COVID 19 vaccines significantly impacts vaccination rates against routine childhood diseases This multiple part series explores the international research done over the past two decades on the human papillomavirus HPV vaccine believed to be one of the most effective vaccines developed to date Summary of Key Facts This multiple part series offers a thorough analysis of concerns raised about HPV vaccination following the global HPV campaign which commenced in 2006 In the U S the HPV vaccine was reported to have a disproportionately higher percentage of adverse events of fainting and blood clots in the veins The U S Food and Drug Administration FDA acknowledges that fainting can happen following the HPV vaccine and recommends sitting or lying down to get the shot then waiting for 15 minutes afterward International scientists found that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS logged a substantial increase in reports of premature ovarian failure from 1 4 per year before 2006 to 22 2 per year after the HPV vaccine approval yielding a Proportional Reporting Ratio of 46 1 The HPV vaccine is widely regarded as one of the most effective vaccines developed to date Nevertheless safety issues have been raised following its approval and in response additional research has been published and litigation has been brought on behalf of those with a vaccine injury In this HPV vaccine series Parts I and II explain how the vaccine works and the evidence suggesting there may be legitimate safety concerns The remaining parts present questions about real world vaccine effectiveness and identify specific ingredients which may pose harm The information presented here is drawn from peer reviewed scientific literature from the U S Australia Denmark Sweden France and Japan as well as statistics published by public health agencies in each of these countries More than 100 hours of research and internal peer review among scientists with experience in infectious diseases virology clinical trials and vaccine epidemiology have been invested in

than just the absence of a certain virus What is HPV According to the CDC HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U S HPV is a small DNA virus infecting human cutaneous epithelial cells in the mucosa and skin More than 150 strains of the HPV virus have been identified HPV infection is so common that the majority of sexually active people will get it at some point in their lives even if they have only one or very few sexual partners It can spread through sexual intercourse and oral sex It can also pass between people through skin to skin contact even by people who have no symptoms HPV infection causes genital warts some of which can turn into cancer For the most part however HPV infection is benign More than 90 of HPV infections cause no clinical symptoms and are self limited meaning the virus is cleared by the body via natural immunological defenses HPV associated cancers High risk HPV types types 16 18 and others can cause cervical cell abnormalities that are precursors to cancers Type 16 is associated with approximately 50 of cervical cancers worldwide and types 16 and 18 together are linked to 66 of cervical cancers An additional five high risk types 31 33 45 52 and 58 are linked with another 15 of cervical cancers and 11 of all HPV associated cancers Infection with a high risk HPV type is associated with a higher chance of the development of cervical cancer but by itself HPV infection is not the sole risk factor to cause cancer There are many other reasons as discussed in this paper Given the prevalence of infection it is unsurprising that globally cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women In 2018 an estimated 570 000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer worldwide and more than 300 000 died of the disease In the U S nearly 50 000 new HPV associated cancers occur annually with women infected at a slightly higher rate than men But in 9 out of 10 cases HPV goes away within two years without causing health problems Only persistent HPV infections may lead to cancer These infections evade the immune system s innate cell mediated defenses The incidence of cervical cancer can be controlled as a result of

Gardasil vaccine were proteins of HPV amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate yeast protein sodium chloride L histidine polysorbate 80 sodium borate and water for injection On Oct 16 2009 the FDA approved Gardasil HPV4 for use in boys ages 9 through 26 for the prevention of genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11 but not for cancer In 2010 it approved Gardasil for the prevention of anal cancer in males and females ages 9 to 26 Four years later the FDA approved an updated vaccine Merck s Gardasil 9 for use in girls ages 9 to 26 and boys ages 9 to 15 for the prevention of cervical vaginal and anal cancers Gardasil 9 contains the same ingredients as Gardasil but offers protection against nine HPV strains adding five additional types HPV types 31 33 45 52 and 58 The current HPV

article authored by scientists from the FDA and CDC that reviewed the safety data for Gardasil for adverse events reported to VAERS between June 2006 through December 2008 During that time there were 12 424 reports of adverse events Of these 772 6 2 were serious VAERS is a passive surveillance system which is subject to multiple limitations including underreporting unconfirmed diagnosis lack of denominator data and no unbiased comparison groups Nevertheless it is a useful and important tool for detecting postmarket safety issues with vaccines A disproportionately high percentage of Gardasil VAERS reports were of syncope fainting and venous thromboembolic events blood clots in the veins compared with other vaccines There were 8 2 syncope events per 100 000 HPV doses and 0 2 venous thromboembolic events per 100 000 HPV doses reported respectively The Gardasil package insert includes a warning about fainting fever dizziness nausea and headaches page 1 and notes at least the

2013 from 42 9 to 14 3 or from 65 4 to 3 9 Researchers around the world also started to investigate HPV safety A World Health Organization WHO position paper released on July 14 2017 concluded that the HPV vaccines were extremely safe The same report estimated approximately 1 7 cases of anaphylaxis per million HPV doses that no association with GBS was found and that syncope fainting was established as a common anxiety or stress related reaction to the injection In the spring of 2022 Japan announced it was relaunching its HPV vaccination drive Mainstream news outlets reported that for thousands of women the cost of caution may have led to preventable HPV induced cancers and an estimated 5 000 to 5 700 deaths However a true risk benefit analysis would also consider the number of serious adverse events prevented by putting the program on hold The question remains Was Japan s caution warranted or should their national vaccination program have continued Ovarian insufficiency Concerns that the vaccine may be negatively affecting fertility have been detailed in the scientific literature In 2014 a peer reviewed case series describing premature ovarian failure among Australian women following HPV vaccination was published in the Journal of Investigative Medicine This prompted other researchers to systematically examine the VAERS data to see if there was a connection between premature ovarian failure and Gardasil Their study found a potential safety signal and concluded that further investigations are warranted VAERS analysis on ovarian failure Two recent publications based on VAERS reports first study second study found that events with a probable autoimmune background were significantly more frequent after HPV vaccination compared to other vaccinations The team of international scientists that did the second study evaluated reports between 1990 and 2018 They found that among the 228 341 premature ovarian failure reports 0 1 was considered to be associated with HPV vaccination with a median age of 15 years and the time to onset was 20 5 days following vaccination The primary symptoms were amenorrhea 80 4 and premature

proportional reporting ratio of 46 The investigators noted that the WHO and CDC declared the HPV vaccine safe regardless of lacking adequate research into safety concerns For example the authors note that in a CDC sponsored VAERS study 17 cases of premature ovarian failure were identified but 15 were excluded due to insufficient information to confirm the diagnosis A separate observational study using the Vaccine Safety Datalink found no increased risk But this study was too underpowered to detect a signal In addition a cross sectional survey study using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data relied on an inaccurate measurement of premature ovarian failure and self reported HPV vaccination In summary the researchers detected a strong safety signal even after accounting for a potential upswing in reports due to media coverage after the product launch they refer to this as notoriety bias Because VAERS is a passive reporting system the data may be incomplete and are often unconfirmed by physicians Therefore this study cannot provide a definitive link between HPV vaccination and premature ovarian insufficiency or premature ovarian failure but does generate a hypothetical link The authors of the second study conclude by insisting that this signal warrants well designed and appropriate epidemiological research They note that if the signal is confirmed the risk is small compared to the lifetime risk of cervical cancer However the benefit risk profile on an individual level is not uniform Given the health impacts of premature ovarian insufficiency and premature ovarian failure some of which may be irreversible and the declining mortality rate for cervical cancer even in the prevaccine era the risk benefit profile for HPV vaccination remains unclear 3 case reports on ovarian insufficiency In the 2014 investigation mentioned above a general practitioner in Australia noticed that three girls developed premature ovarian insufficiency following HPV4

years who range in weight from 28 to 46 kilograms Danish retrospective cohort study finds no link A 2021 study also evaluated premature ovarian insufficiency in a nationwide cohort of nearly 1 million Danish females ages 11 to 34 years The researchers used Cox proportional hazard regression to detect an increased risk of premature ovarian insufficiency diagnosis by HPV4 vaccination status during the years 2007 2016 The hazard ratio for premature ovarian insufficiency vaccinated versus unvaccinated was 0 96 One limitation was that data on age at menarche first menstruation and oral contraceptive use were not available Girls who had not yet reached menarche would not be at risk for premature ovarian insufficiency of course The authors excluded girls under age 15 in a sensitivity

dyes the agency provided a compilation of information on potentially harmful compounds commonly found in ultraprocessed foods The document which appeared to be a draft included a section on emulsifiers such as xanthan gum and carrageenan It noted that the section needed more work HHS subsequently provided the document to KFF Health News As far back as 2020 an international organization

avoiding foods with emulsifiers chemicals such as carboxymethyl cellulose carrageenan guar gum xanthan gum and maltodextrin plus other additives For instance instead of eating Ben Jerry s ice cream he switched to Häagen Dazs ice cream which is free of the substances at issue The relief was dramatic It s a huge difference Rands said To me it s made more of a difference than any drug He has been able to scale back or stop taking several drugs which is an added relief not least because some can have harmful side effects and he said one was taking its toll Rands said he used a scientific approach isolating variables in his diet and logging the results Avoiding artificial sweeteners helps he said but most of the benefit relates to avoiding the emulsifiers Ben Jerry s did not respond to a

prevents businesses and Idaho local county and state governments from requiring medical interventions for employment admission to venues transportation or for providing products or services with some exceptions Little signed the law almost a week after he vetoed a previous version of the bill citing concerns it would have prohibited schools from sending home sick students with highly contagious conditions The new version of the bill clarifies that schools and businesses can turn away students employees or customers who are sick but they cannot require a medical intervention including a vaccine The new version also specified that schools cannot exclude unvaccinated children during an outbreak of a contagious disease they are not vaccinated against The revised bill was first introduced in the House where it passed 44 23 The Senate also voted to pass it with no debate 27 6 Little signed it immediately The bill s author Leslie Manookian president and founder of the Health Freedom Defense Fund celebrated the new law on X where she posted a video of her and co organizers Miste Karlfeldt and Sarah Clendenon discussing the victory for the medical freedom movement there Karlfeldt told The Defender that Idahoans rallied in response to rights violations that became especially apparent during the COVID debacle The governor also previously signed a bill that bans government and school mask mandates she said and another law Senate Bill SB No 1031 that limits the power of public health districts to do only what is necessary and reasonable to protect public

Committee introduced a new version SB 1210 which would have exempted day cares from the new law allowing them to mandate vaccinations for workers and children and toddlers Manookian said people who were working with legislators on the issue were surprised by the amended Senate bill that excluded day cares especially because Little s objection to the original bill was unrelated to day cares She suspected it may be tied to a case before the Idaho Supreme Court Ashley Tipton in 2022 sued New Horizon Academy a day care in Boise after it rejected her daughter as a client because she was not vaccinated A district judge in 2023 dismissed the case but Tipton appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for May 5 New Horizon operates day cares in numerous

Miste Karlfeldt executive director of Health Freedom Idaho agreed that the board s vote is historic It s thrilling she told The Defender The board s vote came after it received about 300 public comments urging the district which encompasses six counties to stop promoting the shots Just before the board voted members heard presentations from cardiologist Dr Peter McCullough pathologist Dr Ryan Cole pediatrician Dr Renata Moon and obstetrician and gynecologist Dr James Thorp on safety concerns related to the COVID 19 vaccines Dr John Tribble the board s only physician invited them to speak Dr Tribble was a very brave board member who is very aware of the harms of the COVID injection said Demaray He asked me to help gather the presenters Demaray who said she knows many people injured by the COVID 19 vaccines and others reached out to experts who could present data related to COVID 19 vaccine harms to the board It was total teamwork Mary Holland Children s Health Defense CEO applauded the board s action After hearing from 300 constituents listening to well informed physicians and assessing the public record the Southwest Idaho Health District Board made an informed decision not to stock its own clinics with COVID shots Demaray and Holland pointed out that the board didn t take away anyone s freedom to get a COVID 19 vaccine If residents want they can obtain the shots from other pharmacies and doctors offices Holland said Demaray said the board s decision showed there s some distrust in this shot She added If a health district is giving a shot in their own

heartbreaking stories of vaccine injury After listening to its residents the board members felt it was important to allow the free and open discussion and evaluation of the evidence for and against the safety and efficacy of the COVID 19 vaccine In addition to hearing presentations from McCullough Moon Cole and Thorp the board also heard from district staff physician Dr Perry Jansen who recommended keeping the vaccine on the district s clinic shelves Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us In the end Tribble said the evidence clearly showed a lack of safety and efficacy as it compares to the risk from COVID 19 and their the board members decision reflected that The board members who voted to remove the shot exhibited courage because they did so based on the evidence in direct opposition to the federal health agencies recommendations Tribble said I believe our actions here stand as an example and precedent for other health agencies to take back control of their health and freedoms from a corrupted federal system I hope this will inspire other health agencies to openly discuss this issue and evaluate the evidence for themselves That is how you open up a can of truth Karlfeldt said she s confident the board s landmark decision will embolden other health administrators across Idaho and the rest of the U S to make similar moves Demaray agreed She said she already heard from two other Idaho health districts that are now considering pulling the COVID 19 shots from their clinics after learning of the Southwest District s vote Demaray encouraged other U S citizens to reach out to their local health board members asking them to review the safety information on the COVID 19 vaccines Many federal health agency leaders are captured by industry but that

action Southwest Idaho Health District has made the correct and brave choice to remove COVID 19 injections from their clinics Hulscher said The updated boosters were never tested in humans while previous iterations have demonstrated that they re not safe for human use Hulscher noted that Boise State Public Radio s coverage of the vote labeled the presentations by McCullough and others as anti vaccine The Boise State Public Radio article which referred to McCullough and the other presenters as doctors widely accused of spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation appeared to blindly favor COVID 19 vaccines he said while ignoring deeply worrisome safety data For instance the number of injuries and deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS following COVID 19 vaccination continues to climb VAERS is the primary mechanism for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U S Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before confirming the reported adverse event was caused by the vaccine VAERS has historically been shown to report only 1 of actual vaccine adverse events As of Sept 27 there were 1 604 710 VAERS reports of injury or death following a COVID 19 vaccination The board s vote has helped create greater public awareness that the COVID 19 shots are massively injurious gene therapy products Holland said Tribble agreed People need to understand that these shots are not vaccines by the traditional definition That is to say they do not impart immunity or prevent transmission They were rushed to market given legal immunity and coercively pushed upon the world s population backed by unfounded fears spread by governments and media Moreover the safety and efficacy data we have is limited and primarily released by the same

normal daily life Manookian said The bill also prohibits schools and businesses from mandating medical interventions as a condition of entry Manookian who is also president and founder of the Health Freedom Defense Fund explained Basically no employer no business no entertainment venue no gym no store could mandate a medical intervention in order for you to access their business to shop there to work there anything like that The only exceptions would be if an employer requires personal protective gear due to an occupational hazard and situations in which the employer receives Medicare or

part of a larger green agenda promoted by organizations like the U N s Food and Agriculture Organization claiming insects are more sustainable protein sources than traditional livestock You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Story at a glance Singapore s Food Agency SFA approved 16 insect species for human consumption in July allowing the import of insects and insect products for food use with restaurants planning insect infused dishes Proponents market insects as sustainable and culturally diverse food with over 2 000 species consumed worldwide However historically insects were mainly eaten for survival not as delicacies Insect based products like cockroach milk and larvae derived Entomilk are being developed despite production challenges and potential allergy risks especially for those with shellfish allergies The push for insect consumption is part of a larger green agenda promoted by organizations like the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization FAO

traditional farming with patented ultraprocessed foods Mealworm meatballs anyone Or how about a salad with a side of crickets With the recent changes transpiring in the food industry it s highly possible that these will be the food choices you ll see on restaurant menus in the future In Singapore the movement toward a more insect inclusive diet is progressing rapidly The SFA recently approved the import of insect and insect products for human consumption set to take effect immediately SFA approves 16 insects for human consumption Reports about Singapore planning to add more edible insects and insect products to their food supply actually made news in the last quarter of 2022 It was estimated that by the end of 2023 the SFA would give the green light for 16 types of insects to be approved for human consumption or to be used in animal feed However the approval was pushed back it was only on July 8 that the agency finally gave the go signal for these insects to be used as food According to the SFA s press release As the insect industry is nascent and insects are a new food item here the SFA has developed the insect regulatory framework which puts in place guidelines for insects to be approved as food With immediate effect the SFA will allow the import of insects and insect products belonging to species that have been assessed to be of low regulatory concern The 16

example the restaurant House of Seafood is planning a menu with at least 30 insect infused dishes which include silkworm and crispy cricket garnished sushi and salted egg crab with silkworms Insects are touted to be the future of food According to insect as food promoters humans have a long history of eating insects saying that it isn t an entirely new concept They also market it as a sign of innovation and being hip they say that if you think eating insects is gross you may be in the cultural minority However insects are actually being used in some processed foods In particular cricket and mealworm flour are used not just in the U S but in many countries as well although you couldn t tell as they are discreetly mentioned on product labels For example if you see Acheta protein or Acheta powder listed as an ingredient in any product it means you re eating cricket protein powder A study reports that 2 205 species are being eaten worldwide across 128 countries mostly in Asia Mexico and Africa In Thailand India the Democratic Republic of Congo and China hundreds of species of insect are consumed with Brazil Japan and Cameroon each eating 100 or more species according to The Guardian In Canada and the U S the edible insect sector is also rapidly expanding driven by consumer demand for sustainable food According to a 2023 study published in the Animal Frontiers journal The edible insect sector is now gaining momentum with several primary insect producers across the continent and value chain partners downstream beginning to incorporate insects as a primary ingredient

drink cockroach milk Another seemingly out of this world innovation involving the use of insects to replace traditional food is cockroach milk and yes it is exactly what it seems As the Times of India reported C ockroach milk is a protein rich substance female cockroaches use to feed their young It has rich nutritional content which is extractable from only one type of cockroach the Pacific beetle cockroach Unlike other cockroach species that lay their eggs the Pacific beetle cockroach Diploptera punctata gives birth to 50 or so live young Before their birth the young feed on a pale yellow crystal like milk from the mother s uterus like brood sac The crystals have proteins fats and sugars they fit the requirements of a complete food An article in Prevention calls it a superfood trend nightmares are made of However cockroach milk production is an energy intensive and time consuming process as the crystals can only be harvested from the cockroach during a specific time in their lifespan lactation Plus it takes a thousand cockroaches to make just 3 5 ounces of milk Even so similar insect based products are being conducted in various countries For example a company called Gourmet Grubb in South Africa has a product called Entomilk that s basically milk made from black soldier fly larvae This lactose and gluten free dairy alternative is being used to make luxury ice cream an ingenious way to manipulate consumers to accept insects as an ingredient of popular snacks In a CNN article Gourmet Grubb co founder Leah Bessa said We were expecting a lot of push back

products is that they carry specific risks to the general population particularly people with shellfish allergies This has been known for years but even now a slew of peer reviewed papers are being published about the dangers of insects being added to foods without proper labeling Adding insects to your dinner plate is part of the green agenda So despite these drawbacks why is there a sudden somewhat insistent drive to encourage people to make the shift to insects The answer is simple they want to control you and every aspect of your life including your food choices It s apparent that the globalists are doing everything in their power to control the global food supply and that includes promoting and normalizing gross food options They use the narrative that doing so will help save the planet as these novel foods are a more sustainable source of protein As The Guardian article mentions The farming of insects for human food and for animal feed has been promoted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization FAO for their benefits as a sustainable form of protein Indeed the FAO has been strongly recommending the use of insects as human food and animal feed since 2003 As their website states Edible insects contain high quality protein vitamins and amino acids for humans Insects have a high food conversion rate e g crickets need six times less feed than cattle four times less than sheep and twice less than pigs and broiler chickens to produce the same amount of protein Besides they emit less greenhouse gases and ammonia than conventional livestock Insects can be grown on organic waste Therefore insects are a potential source for conventional production mini livestock of protein either for direct human consumption or indirectly in recomposed foods While their campaign toward sustainability may sound admirable it is important to realize that this green agenda they re imposing is nothing but a ruse and scare tactic to bring people to the point of accepting

idea of cannibalism You read that last statement right Apparently in 2020 scientists came up with a grow your own steak kit and the main ingredient is human cells Dubbed Ouroboros Steak named for the snake that eats its own tail the kit uses cells harvested from inside of a person s cheek and then fed serum derived from expired donated blood It s like something straight out of a terrifying science fiction novel The project s goal was to criticize the meat industry s rising use of living cells from animals However it ended up sparking a heated debate about bioethics and the pitfalls of artistic critique The designers hoped that shocking audiences with the suggestion would trigger an examination of environmental responsibility and the clean meat industry which has promoted itself as producing kill free food although most companies heavily rely on fetal bovine serum harvested during the slaughter of pregnant cows for cell cultivation The New York Times reports Although you wouldn t be

is not the answer to food safety and security Instead there are other more viable options available to help address all our existing environmental concerns I believe that regenerative agriculture

world data platform incorporating claims data electronic health records and other health information including wearable device metrics Yet in a surprise move Pritzker has shut Illinois out of the

necessary defense of individual liberty Every Illinoisan deserves dignity privacy and the freedom to live without fear of surveillance or discrimination he said characterizing the federal database as a potential surveillance threat linked to President Donald Trump era policies The executive order bars any autism related data collection by state agencies unless fully HIPAA compliant and strictly

organizations including The Autism Program of Illinois the Southern Illinois Autism Society and the Autistic Self Advocacy Network backed the order Hope a Springfield based service provider praised

objections That could hinder efforts to track emerging health crises or evaluate long term treatment safety and effectiveness It also undercuts scientific independence by implying that autism research tied to federal agencies or political figures should be viewed with inherent suspicion Meanwhile the autism rate continues to climb According to the CDC 1 in 36 children in the U S were diagnosed with

organic food industry has grown tremendously over the past few decades but concerns remain about the integrity of organic labeling and certification In my eye opening interview with organic industry watchdog Mark Kastel video below he discusses the challenges facing organic consumers and farmers offering insights on how to find truly healthy ethically produced food Kastel co founded The Cornucopia Institute which celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2024 and he is also executive director and founder of OrganicEye He notes that while the 1990 Organic Foods Production Act was well intentioned its implementation has been problematic Congress in 1990 passed the Organic Foods Production Act It gave the USDA U S Department of Agriculture the responsibility to protect industry stakeholders so farmers ethical business people and eaters consumers protect them from unfair competition and fraud And the legislation itself is really pretty solid and well intended Unfortunately like a lot of things that happen it gets handed over to the bureaucrats in Washington and the political appointees of both parties Something gets lost in translation Kastel explains that initially the USDA was resistant to regulating organic food viewing it as just a marketing scheme However as the U S organic food industry has grown to 61 7 billion annually large agribusiness corporations have bought out many pioneering organic brands This has led to efforts to make organic certification less rigorous and more profitable Globally the organic industry is now a 205 9 billion industry

include farmers markets community supported agriculture CSAs and independent local retailers who source directly from farms they know Kastel states he s found virtually no fraud on that local level Large scale commercial organics This includes major brands sold in supermarkets and big box stores These products may come from overseas or large industrial operations with less oversight The graphic here created by Phil Howard a professor with Michigan State University illustrates how big business has taken over many smaller organic brands It really is almost every major brand and it s very deceptive Kastel explains You ll never see General Mills on Cascadian Farms breakfast cereals or Muir Glen tomato products you ll see Small Planet Foods Doesn t that sound nice But Dean Foods bought the Horizon label that s now been sold off a couple of different times Smuckers is a giant They own Santa Cruz juices and Knudsen juices Kastel emphasizes the benefits of buying local organic food You re getting food that s more nutritionally dense fresher more flavorful and your dollars stay in your food shed they re recirculating We call this the multiplier effect The challenge of imported organics One of the biggest concerns in the organic industry is the integrity of imported organic products Kastel explains We ve helped break some major import fraud partnering with the Washington Post at one point We ve partnered with The New York Times The Wall Street Journal He describes two main types of fraud Outright fraud or organic alchemy Conventional products are relabeled as organic during shipping Regulatory loopholes Large industrial farms exploit weak oversight especially for animal products like dairy Kastel is particularly concerned about a practice called group certification for imports Instead of certifying every farm instead of inspecting every farm they will allow a group to band together and when that was conceived even though it was still illegal when

says large agribusinesses are using this loophole to avoid proper inspection of their suppliers Grower producer groups started out as a way to help small farmers or indigenous groups in developing countries but have morphed to include commercial scale farms that are escaping USDA oversight Only about 2 of the farmers involved in these grower producer groups are being inspected annually which means the vast majority 98 are not being inspected as frequently if at all Although almost universally complied with in domestic production that system has completely broken down for imports Kastel said in a news release A large percentage of all foreign imports making up a sizable amount of the organic food Americans eat are coming from producer groups whose grower members the USDA has exempted from the requirements to be certified For instance an investigation revealed the USDA s Organic Integrity Database lists no certified organic hazelnut growers in Turkey Yet the country is the leading importer of organic hazelnuts into the U S at prices close to conventionally grown hazelnuts We can grow hazelnuts in the U S Kastel says in the video but they can t compete with hazelnuts from Turkey which come from these group certifications where the farms are not even being inspected and it s forcing our Oregon nut growers out of business Nutritional insights Beyond the organic label While organic certification is crucial even organic practices may not always align with optimal nutrition It s important to look beyond the organic label to truly understand the health impacts of your food choices This includes feeding practices even within organic systems For instance feeding grains to chickens is a common practice on organic farms but the ideal food for them would be insects and bugs It can be difficult to find enough insects for this purpose but many organic farmers supplement with grains that are loaded with damaging omega 6 polyunsaturated fats Truly health conscious organic farmers should consider alternatives like sprouted peas or barley which result in eggs with healthier fat profiles Ideally organic standards need to evolve based on our growing understanding of nutrition I don t generally recommend consuming chicken even if it s organic and locally produced due to its typically high linoleic acid content the result of being fed grains high in omega 6 fatty acids Ruminants like cattle and sheep are a better choice for meat consumption because ruminants have an additional digestive compartment with bacteria that can saturate polyunsaturated fats This

accumulating high levels of linoleic acid in their tissues Even a food as seemingly simple as rice has important nuances you should be aware of for optimal health Kastel mentions eating brown rice but I recommend white rice instead This is because the fiber in brown rice can negatively impact your gut microbiome especially for people with insulin resistance which is 99 of the population Insulin resistance causes mitochondrial dysfunction decreasing intracellular energy which then impacts the ability of your gut to stay healthy White rice is a healthier option because it lacks the problematic fibers found in brown rice However no matter which rice you eat it should be organic As Kastel notes rice cultivation is often chemically intensive He also points out that both organic and inorganic arsenic can be present in rice depending on the soil it s grown in and past agricultural practices in the area The importance of collagen and hidden dangers in organic dairy We also briefly discuss the need for collagen in the diet an aspect often overlooked in discussions about organic meat and bone broth One third of your protein should be collagen rich connective tissue but most people consume only 0 to 1 gram of collagen daily Consuming whole animal products and bone broths ideally from organic pasture raised animals is an ideal way to increase your collagen intake Kastel says You want to make sure it comes from organic grass fed animals you can chew on your chicken bones you can use those beef bones which are a waste material because most people don t appreciate this yet So when you find your local beef producer you can buy bones from them on the cheap And the same thing with organ meats You can buy those on the cheap because nobody wants them Even within the organic dairy sector there s a little known issue with commercial cheeses most cheeses today are made with genetically modified rennet so make sure you re buying cheese made from raw organic grass fed milk and natural animal based rennet only Be wary of misleading terms like vegetarian rennet Another reason why grass fed animal foods particularly full fat raw dairy are so important is their content of

in the human diet C15 0 is the first new nutrient in 75 years to be considered an essential nutrient These odd chain fatty acids are only present in animals raised on pasture not those fed organic grains reinforcing the importance of supporting organic farmers who prioritize pasture based systems The rise of plant based meat alternatives many of which are marketed as health conscious or environmentally friendly options meanwhile is not beneficial for human health or the environment Most fake meat products are made with seed oils high in linoleic acid and will kill you prematurely Kastel adds They re not doing the due diligence in terms of scientific research They re going to convert this to 300 million plus guinea pigs lab rats your children in this marketplace And so we should be very cautious The big incentive is you can t patent meat and the profit potential just like in some of these imitation milks you have a handful of soy beans and water and they re selling it for more than conventional milk The reason they develop these is economic not because they re developing something that s healthier of course healthier for their bank accounts How to find truly organic food and take control of your food choices By integrating these nutritional insights with broader discussions about organic certification and farming practices you can make more informed dietary choices that support both your health and sustainable agricultural systems The key takeaway is that while organic certification is a valuable starting point truly health conscious consumers need to dig deeper to understand the full nutritional impact of their food choices Generally be cautious about embracing trendy alternatives like fake meat and instead focus on whole organically produced foods That being said how can you find authentic organic products OrganicEye is an invaluable resource for anyone interested in making healthier food choices and understanding the organic

feeding study commissioned by Impossible Foods suggested the Impossible Burger s key ingredient genetically engineered soy leghemoglobin caused the rats to develop unexplained changes in weight gain changes in the blood that can indicate the onset of inflammation or kidney disease and possible signs of anemia You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Claire Robinson and Dr Michael Antoniou The Impossible Burger is a plant based burger the key ingredient of which is a protein called soy leghemoglobin SLH for short derived from genetically modified GM yeast It s already being sold in restaurants and supermarkets in the U S In 2019 the manufacturing company Impossible Foods applied for permission to market the burger in the EU and the U K However the results of a rat feeding study commissioned by Impossible Foods and carried out with SLH suggest that the burger may not be safe to eat SLH is the substance that gives the burger its meaty taste and makes it appear to bleed like meat when cut The U S Food and Drug Administration FDA initially refused to sign off on the safety of SLH when first approached by the company The rat feeding study results suggest that the agency s concerns were justified Rats fed the GM yeast derived SLH developed unexplained changes in weight gain changes in the blood that can indicate the onset of inflammation or kidney disease and possible signs of anemia 2015 FDA says SLH safety not proven The company maintains that SLH is safe to eat It wanted the FDA to agree with its self declared conclusion that SLH is GRAS Generally Recognized As Safe providing reassurance for consumers But in 2015 in response to Impossible Foods first application the FDA refused to agree that the substance was safe It responded with tough questions for the company as revealed in documents obtained under a Freedom of Information request The FDA was concerned that SLH has never been consumed by humans and may be an allergen The agency pointed out that the safety information submitted by Impossible Foods was not specific enough Although proteins are a part of the human food supply not all proteins are safe Information addressing the safe use of modified soy protein does not adequately address safe use of soybean leghemoglobin protein from the roots of the soybean plant in food The FDA concluded FDA believes that the arguments presented individually and collectively do not establish the safety of SLH for consumption nor do they point to a general recognition of safety 2017 Impossible Foods tries again In 2017 Impossible

Although Impossible Foods had in its 2015 submission told the FDA it intended to conduct a 90 day feeding study the standard length for subchronic toxicity in rats the company said that following feedback from the agency it had decided on a shorter study of 28 days While this change would cut costs for Impossible Foods it is not in the public health interest That s because the shorter the duration of a study the less likely it is to find health effects such as organ damage which take time to show up The number of animals and duration of a feeding study are two key design elements in an investigation of the safety of a GM food substance It was always unlikely that SLH would have strong and obvious toxic effects in the short term any adverse effects from a novel food substance would likely be subtle Long term studies with relatively large numbers of animals are required in order to reveal the significance of such effects Given these requirements it seems clear that Impossible Foods study was statistically weak There were too few animals in each test group 10 per sex per group and again the study was too short in duration 28 days in a rat is equivalent to just 2 3 years in a human to clarify any health concerns from long term consumption of this product Potentially adverse effects in SLH fed rats In light of these limitations it is remarkable that the SLH fed rats did show a large number of statistically significant potentially adverse effects compared with the control group for example unexplained transient decrease in body weight gain increase in food consumption without weight gain changes in blood chemistry decreased reticulocyte immature red blood cell count this can be a sign of anemia and or damage to the bone marrow where red blood cells are produced decreased blood clotting ability decreased blood levels of alkaline phosphatase can indicate malnutrition and or celiac disease increased blood albumin can indicate acute infection or damage to

low number of animals in each group gives particular reason for concern Reproductive changes in SLH fed females In the study apparent disruptions in the reproductive cycle were found in some groups of females fed SLH In normal healthy rats the uterus fills up with fluid during the proestrus phase of the cycle in the run up to the fertile and sexually receptive phase estrus In the SLH fed rats significantly fewer fluid filled uteri were seen This correlated with decreased uterus weight as might be expected In response to this finding Impossible Foods commissioned a second rat feeding study which found no effect on the SLH on the rats estrus cycle The company concluded that the findings of the first study had been a mere artifact of the experimental method used For the sake of the women who may eat the Impossible Burger on a regular basis we hope that the company is correct All effects dismissed Impossible Foods dismissed all these effects as non adverse as having no toxicological relevance as transient on the grounds that they appeared to reverse themselves after some days and as not dependent on the dose i e the effect did not increase with increasing dose It is true that the adverse outcomes may appear somewhat haphazard However the fact that there were so many statistically significant changes in multiple organs and systems suggests that closer scrutiny of the safety of SLH is urgently required The apparent randomness of the effects may be due to the fact that the study design was statistically weak And it is well known that toxic effects do not always follow a linear dose response pattern Dismissing the findings as irrelevant appears irresponsible The only way of ascertaining if potentially adverse effects seen in short studies are truly adverse or have lasting consequences is to extend the study length to the rats full lifetimes 2 3 years and to do multigenerational testing In this case neither was done FDA capitulates Impossible Foods second attempt to obtain GRAS status for SLH succeeded and the FDA issued a no questions letter indicating that it had no further questions Contrary to what many people believe such letters are not an assertion by the FDA that the food in question is safe They state that the company asserts that the food is safe and remind the company that it and not the FDA is responsible for ensuring that it",

all but impossible to hold vaccine manufacturers or healthcare providers accountable for vaccine injury in the courts Vaccine injuries are not rare HHS s own studies show that the agency claims that

the Environment and Farmers Livelihoods The International Finance Corporation s IFC website brands many of the well founded criticisms of industrial animal production as myths But industrial animal agriculture is destructive destructive to food security the environment small scale farmer livelihoods and the well being of animals You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Peter Stevenson The International Finance Corporation s IFC website brands many of the well founded criticisms of industrial animal production as myths This reflects the regrettably polarized debate between those who believe that industrial agriculture is needed to feed the growing world population and those who like me argue that a far reaching transformation of our food system is needed The IFC website states that it is a myth that industrial animal production is bad for food security The truth however is that factory farming diverts food away from people it is dependent on feeding grain corn wheat barley to animals who convert these crops very inefficiently into meat and milk For every 100 calories of human edible cereals fed to animals just 7 27 calories depending on the species enter the human food chain as meat And for every 100 grams of protein in human edible cereals fed to animals only 13 37 grams of protein enter the human food chain as meat The scale of this is massive International Grains Council data show that 45 of global grain production is used as animal feed while 77 of world soy production is used to feed animals The inefficiency of doing this is recognized by the United Nations Environment Programme which states that it is essential to fight food insecurity and malnutrition reducing the use of much of the world s grain production to feed animals and producing more food for direct human consumption can significantly contribute to this objective I calculate that if the use of cereals as animal feed were ended an extra 2 billion people could be fed even allowing for the fact that if we reared fewer animals we would need to grow more crops for direct human consumption My figure is very cautious other studies calculate that ending the use of grains as animal feed would enable an extra 3 5 4 billion people to be fed Moreover industrial livestock s huge demand for these cereals pushes up their price potentially placing them out of reach of poor populations in the Global South So sorry IFC but it really is not a myth to say that industrial animal production is bad for food security The IFC website dismisses as a myth the argument that

it can form particulate matter this is a key component of air pollution which can lead to heart and pulmonary disease respiratory problems including asthma and lung cancer Industrial livestock s huge demand for cereals as feed has been a key factor fuelling the intensification of crop production This pivotal link between the livestock and arable sectors is often not recognized With its monocultures and high use of chemical pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers intensive crop production leads to soil degradation biodiversity loss and overuse and pollution of water In short it erodes the key fundamentals soils water and biodiversity on which our future ability to feed ourselves depends Arjem Hoekstra calculates that animals fed on cereals and soy industrially farmed animals use 43 times as much surface and groundwater and are 61 times as polluting of water as animals fed on grass and other roughages Its adherents claim that factory farming saves land by cramming animals into crowded sheds But in reality it eats up huge amounts of cropland for feed European Union studies show that feed production accounts for 99 of the land use of the pig and broiler sectors It is feed production not the tiny amount of space given to animals on the farm that makes factory farming so land hungry The contention that industrial systems undermine the socioeconomic potential of small scale farmers in the developing world is also branded a myth by the IFC The World Bank however takes a different view Its 2024 report Recipe for a Liveable Planet states The global agrifood system disproportionately and detrimentally affects poor communities and smallholder farmers who cannot compete with industrial agriculture thereby exacerbating rural poverty and increasing landlessness Instead of funding industrial agriculture the IFC should help small scale farmers move to agroecology and regenerative farming which can boost yields reduce the use of expensive inputs and improve livelihoods Also swatted aside as a myth is the mountain of scientific evidence that industrial livestock production results in poor animal welfare To dismiss the harsh suffering endured by

Juan Vassallo As Jill Trapp steered her pickup truck down the red dirt roads of southeast Oklahoma she raised a hand to greet a passing neighbor a calf roper who once made it to the National Finals

pothole one of many left behind by the constant flow of semitrucks hauling hundreds of thousands of chickens through the area In this corner of the state the poultry industry is hard to ignore Within a roughly 25 mile radius of the southeast Oklahoma town of Idabel there are 59 industrial poultry farms more than half built in the last 15 years typically larger than older operations Together they raise nearly 7 4 million birds at maximum capacity All but six grow chickens for Tyson Foods the largest meat company in the country the other six farms supply Pilgrim s Pride a Colorado based

Trapp said last month at a community meeting in Idabel attended by more than 150 people including officials from the Oklahoma Water Resources Board She went on to describe the overpowering smells that

of 785 four person households Unlike most other chicken farms in Oklahoma the cluster of farms in McCurtain County sits atop a regulated aquifer the Antlers These farms use water from the aquifer for

this admission makes one thing clear Oklahoma s water laws need to be updated to reflect the state s growth and protect its natural resources She points to the Arbuckle Simpson aquifer adjacent to the Antlers as a success story In the 1980s local advocates pushed for federal recognition of the aquifer as the region s only viable drinking water source a designation that later helped residents push for a comprehensive hydrological study and block a plan to export water That study led to a significant change the aquifer s withdrawal limit dropped from 2 0 acre feet to just 0 2 the lowest in the state To Hearne it s a straightforward lesson of how science should guide water policy You ve got to know your monthly daily seasonal variations before you can issue permits properly she said But perhaps the biggest shock for those at the meeting came with the revelation that most poultry operations typically don t apply for water permits at all The domestic use loophole lets industrial farms pump water without permits and without limits Lobbying by the poultry industry in the 1990s led to a loophole where a permit isn t required if a property owner claims the water is for domestic use rather than a business If the farm is doing business as Bob and Mary Jo Smith they don t need a permit If they re doing business as Smith Poultry LLC they do Gibson explained While the 63 industrial poultry farms in McCurtain County are owned by individual farmers they raise chickens under contract with corporations like Tyson Foods and Pilgrim s Pride which tightly control their operations Only four currently have water permits with a fifth pending for the planned 12 house chicken facility Not only does domestic use allow a farm to operate without a water permit but the operation can pull more than twice the amount of water from the aquifer compared to what is allowed under an agricultural use permit In practice the situation is even murkier Many farms registered as LLCs which should have permits also lack them a gap that Gibson says she is working with the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture Food and Forestry ODAFF to address The few farms that have applied for permits have likely

usage is essentially unlimited the OWRB relies on an honor system for water reporting the four poultry farms in McCurtain County with water permits reported zero use in 2024 and the agency has never revoked a permit or penalized anyone for exceeding their allowed water usage The water used on farms is required to be obtained from lawfully acquired sources a Tyson Foods spokesperson said Last year Gov Kevin Stitt vetoed a bill that would have required metering devices on all groundwater wells across the state a move praised by the agriculture industry and the Oklahoma Farm Bureau The Republican governor rejected the bill despite concerns over intensifying droughts and the agriculture industry s heavy water use particularly in northwest Oklahoma The region recently experienced its second driest period in over a century And its main water source the Ogallala Aquifer has been significantly depleted by Seaboard Foods Even if there were stricter rules and required metering there may not be enough money for enforcement or aquifer studies according to Gibson The OWRB s annual budget excluding supplemental funds for water and wastewater infrastructure and other programs has ranged from 5 million to more than 8 million in recent years The agency said it has fewer than 20 staff members to review an average of 250 permit applications and amendments each year investigate issues and

concerned about bacteria like E coli If E coli is consistently present in the well yes that is a cause for concern Cannon said E coli is an acute health risk and if it is present in water the water should not be used for drinking or consumption Last year an Oklahoma conservation group found elevated levels of E coli and enterococcus in parts of eastern Oklahoma with a high concentration of poultry farms an indication of animal feces contamination Trapp plans to retest her water to rule out contamination caused by recent storms But even if the bacteria returns proving it came from the Tyson farm next door would be difficult and past violations by poultry farms have rarely led to serious penalties In 2023 ODAFF fined 14 poultry farms between 100 and 300 each for failing to submit or submitting late their litter management reports The highest fine 600 was issued to a farm that failed to renew its license or file any reports for three years It was the only enforcement action taken by the agency Agencies are limited in what they can do because of the authorities they ve been granted by the legislature said Shanon Phillips director of the water quality division at the Oklahoma Conservation Commission A bill passed last year increased the fines ODAFF can impose to 1 000 and gave the agency more authority to act when poultry farms break the rules But the same bill also granted poultry companies legal protection shielding them from lawsuits as long as they comply with regulations That s troubling critics say because even when farms follow the rules pollution continues to be a problem In 2005 then Attorney General Drew Edmondson sued a group of poultry companies over elevated phosphorus levels in the Illinois River watershed caused by chicken litter used as fertilizer Rainfall and irrigation washed phosphorus from the litter into nearby streams and rivers fueling algae blooms and degrading water quality After 18 years of litigation a U S District Judge ruled in favor of Oklahoma holding poultry companies including Tyson Foods responsible for polluting the watershed The companies pushed back citing improvements since 2005 But at a hearing last

added sugars per day or the equivalent of two soft drinks per day if they are entirely formula fed researchers say in the study published Feb 24 in the Journal of Food Composition and Analysis The findings reveal the staggering extent to which sugar laden U S formulas undermine federal healthy diet recommendations for infants and cannot be easily avoided they say Most of the formulas that parents and caregivers feed their infants likely present a substantial risk to their infant s health and development Ultimately caregivers and infants in the U S deserve a formula market that promotes healthy infant development and does not promote early obesity risk Added sugars provide energy but lack nutritional value boosting the odds of rapid infant weight gain that can eventually lead to obesity Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease and other health problems They may also make babies develop a stronger preference for sweet foods increasing the risk of overeating and obesity later in

the Nutrition Data System for Research for the University of Kansas Health Behavior and Technology Lab Our infant formula market totally contradicts what experts in infant health recommend Children under 2 years should not be given any foods or beverages with added sugars since they need nutrient rich diets and are developing taste preferences according to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020 2025 Yet with few formula options free of added sugars the researchers say parents and caregivers who can t breastfeed or access breast milk face tough choices in terms of finding a nutritionally suitable formula due to lax government regulations Unlike adult food products U S regulations do not require that added sugars be reported on the nutrition label of infant formulas only total carbohydrates The U S Food and Drug Administration FDA specifies 30 nutrients that must be included in infant formulas but does not regulate the types of carbohydrates or require their clear labeling That means formula manufacturers can use any type of carbohydrate including starches or added sugars such as corn syrup solids fructose and glucose

against Merck alleging the pharmaceutical giant s Gardasil human papillomavirus HPV vaccine caused injuries The lawsuits were selected as exemplar cases from a larger pool of lawsuits pending in the U S District Court for the Western District of North Carolina They will serve as a series of bellwether trials the outcome of which will shape the process for the growing number of claims brought against Merck for Gardasil related injuries There are currently about 80 cases pending in federal court with hundreds more cases likely to be filed in federal court in the coming months In August 2022 a judicial panel ordered the consolidation of more than 31 lawsuits then pending against Merck into multidistrict litigation in a single court The panel said the individual lawsuits involve common questions of fact and consolidation would promote the just and efficient conduct of the litigation The consolidation order allows Gardasil lawsuits filed throughout the country to move into coordinated discovery and pretrial proceedings Merck opposed the consolidation alleging that publicity surrounding the consolidation would spread misinformation about vaccines increase vaccine hesitancy and could cause a flood of meritless vaccine injury claims However the court disagreed Gardasil is a widely used vaccine commonly administered to teens and young adults before they are sexually active to protect against nine of more than 200 strands of HPV which can be sexually transmitted later in life HPV infections may lead to the development of cervical cancer However most infections are benign and resolve on their own Merck s clinical trials for Gardasil did not test whether the vaccine protected against cancer Merck markets the vaccine as safe and effective but the lawsuits allege the drugmaker fast tracked Gardasil through the U S Food and Drug Administration s FDA approval process and deceptively conducted clinical trials to mask serious side effects and

stand or there won t be anything to stand for Irish geopolitical commentator Ivor Cummins told Kim Iversen on Wednesday s segment of The Kim Iversen Show Iversen and Cummins discussed the ongoing wave of rage fueled by growing existential anxiety among European farmers as they contend with an accelerating push to gut rural agriculture in the name of sustainable development The spark igniting the

that aims to strip away localized food production and self sufficiency The farmers are beginning to realize like a lot of people that this is an orchestrated campaign to almost eliminate us and to

these policies they are beginning to understand that it s no longer just the usual to and fro with governments over things like diesel taxes Cummins said Remorselessly crushing countries sovereignty

development In the Netherlands the government is focusing on nitrogen reduction threatening to shut down over 3 000 farms However according to Cummins the country leveled off and began reducing its nitrogen input into the rivers by around 2015 In Ireland leaked memos from the agriculture department suggested they d like to cull 200 000 cows Cummins noted In France the government used taxes and

say something negative against the government Ultra processed food at root of chronic disease epidemic Cummins a researcher on the relationship between diet and disease and co author of Eat Rich Live Long discussed how the return to time tested ancestral eating could result in profound gains in public health He suggested that embracing these old school farmer supplied staples would not only save local farming but could also devastate the pharmaceutical industry The simplest possible thing I can say is if you just eat meat fish and eggs and kinds of above ground vegetables that are not starchy he said most of Pharma would collapse within a few years because it is built on statins and antihypertensives high blood pressure drugs Today s long shelf life ultra processed fare laden with vegetable oils sugars and refined grains comprise upwards of 60 of the average person s calories and drive the devil s triad of modern chronic disease Type 2 diabetes obesity Alzheimer s disease now sometimes called Type 3 diabetes according to Cummins Such foods are internationalized Cummins said They ve got amazing supply chains that make big food business a ton of money And they re junk To support this diet Cummins argued one must eliminate most of what s in the supermarket because it s all ultra processed and just rely on what we ate say five to 10 000 years ago He admitted that changing mass dietary habits poses challenges given the engineered addictive properties of ultra processed foods and their dominant market footprint It s not as simple as just flicking a switch

other neurological disorders CDC decided to study its vast Vaccine Safety Datalink the medical and vaccination record of millions of Americans archived by the top HMOs to learn whether the dramatic escalation of the vaccine schedule beginning in 1989 was a culprit CDC s in house epidemiologist Thomas Verstraeten led the effort Verstraeten s initial data run suggested that mercury containing hepatitis B vaccines administered during the first month of life were associated with a wide range of neurological injuries including a dramatic 1 135 rise in autism risks among vaccinated children Verstraeten s findings propelled CDC into DEFCON 1 The agency s top vaccine officials summoned 52 pharmaceutical industry leaders the foremost vaccinologists from academia and the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP and public health regulators from the National Institutes of Health U S Food and Drug Administration FDA CDC World Health Organization WHO and European Medicines Agency to a secret two day meeting at the remote Simpsonwood retreat center in Norcross Georgia to strategize about how to hide these awful revelations from the public In 2005 I obtained the explosive transcripts of this meeting and was about to publish excerpts in Rolling Stone Deadly Immunity July 18 2005 Those recordings ironically portrayed these leading kingpins of the vaccine cartel poised at their own moral brink and chronicled their collapse into corruption over two sickening days of debate Most of these individuals were physicians and regulatory officials who had committed their lives to public health

Conversion of the percentage thimerosal to actual micrograms of mercury involves ninth grade algebra What took the FDA so long to do the calculations In the tense days leading up to the Simpsonwood conclave children s health champion Dr Ruth Etzel of the EPA pleaded with her fellow public health leaders to publicly admit they made a terrible mistake by inadvertently poisoning American children and to repair the damage Dr Etzel urged AAP and the government regulators to handle the crisis with the same honesty and public remorse that Johnson Johnson had demonstrated on discovering toxic

Big Pharma operatives and government technocrats persuaded each other to transform their disastrous error into villainy by doubling down and hiding their mistake from the public Tapper saw an early draft of my Rolling Stone story and proposed that in exchange for exclusivity he would do a companion piece for ABC timed to air on the magazine s publication day Tapper spent several weeks working on the story with me and a team of enthusiastic ABC reporters and technicians During his frequent conversations with me over that period he was on fire with indignation over the Simpsonwood revelations He acted like a journalist hoping to win an Emmy The day before the piece was to air an exasperated Tapper called me to say that ABC s corporate officials ordered him to pull the story The network s pharmaceutical advertisers were threatening to cancel their advertising Corporate told us to shut it down Tapper fumed Tapper told me that it was the first time in his career that ABC officials had ordered him to kill a story ABC had advertised the Simpsonwood exposé and its sudden cancellation disappointed an army of vaccine safety advocates and parents of injured children who deluged the network with a maelstrom of angry emails In response ABC changed tack and publicly promised to air the piece Instead following a one week delay the network duplicitously aired a hastily assembled puff piece promoting vaccines and assuring listeners that mercury laden vaccines were safe The new bait and switch segment precisely followed Pharma s talking points I m putting my faith in the Institute

Fulton County coroner had determined Aaron to have died from natural causes When the Fulton County coroner subsequently denied ever having seen Aaron s body much less performed an autopsy Tapper refused to correct his story In August 2021 Tapper gave Dr Fauci a platform to spread the rumor that deluded Americans were poisoning themselves with a horse medicine called ivermectin In an Aug 29 2021 interview Dr Fauci told Tapper There s no evidence whatsoever that that works and it could potentially have toxicity with people who have gone to poison control centers because they ve taken the drug at a ridiculous dose and wind up getting sick There s no clinical evidence that indicates that this works Tapper never corrected Dr Fauci He never pointed out that there were by then 70 peer reviewed studies demonstrating ivermectin s miraculous efficacy against COVID He didn t dispute Dr Fauci s characterization of ivermectin as a horse medicine by noting that the drug had won both a Nobel Prize and WHO s listing as an essential medicine for its miraculous efficacy against human illnesses and that people have consumed billions of doses with no significant safety signals Mr Tapper never thought to ask Dr Fauci if he was trying to discourage use of a cheap effective drug that might compete with his experimental vaccines Instead Tapper abjectly parroted Dr Fauci s talking points Poison control centers are reporting that their calls are spiking in places like Mississippi and Oklahoma because some Americans are trying to use an anti parasite horse drug called ivermectin to

article Sign Up Canadian researchers have called into question the findings of a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association JAMA that downplayed the risk of myocarditis following COVID 19 vaccination The study published in August 2024 examined 4 635 patients hospitalized for myocarditis in France up to 18 months following COVID 19 vaccination It found that patients who developed myocarditis following COVID 19 vaccination showed a lower rate of cardiovascular complications compared to those with conventional myocarditis In a letter to the editor published on Jan 27 in JAMA Dr Chengliang Yang and Scott J Tebbutt Ph D of the University of British Columbia said the study arbitrarily reduced the number of post vaccination cases of myocarditis by limiting the diagnosis window to seven days According to Yang and Tebbutt criteria used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Brighton Collaboration recognize the onset of post vaccination myocarditis symptoms for a significantly longer period 40 days and six weeks respectively They also cited a 2022 report by the U S government run Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS suggesting that myocarditis may appear up to 120 days following vaccination The study s 7 day window may underestimate vaccine associated myocarditis Yang and Tebbutt wrote The JAMA study also did not examine cases of pericarditis a similar cardiovascular condition associated with the COVID 19 shots Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist for Children s Health Defense CHD said the 7 day window used in the JAMA study is really short for most adverse events to appear post vaccination Under some paradigms a person is not even considered vaccinated until two weeks after they receive the vaccine This is based on the constraint of biological processes to develop immunity but manifesting myocarditis is also a biological process that takes time Jablonowski said According to the Daily Mail In myocarditis it s thought that the immune system may register mRNA in Covid vaccines as a threat leading the immune system to attack itself and cause inflammation of the myocardium the heart s muscle This same mechanism has been linked to pericarditis which leads to inflammation of the pericardium the sac surrounding the heart the Daily Mail added Clinical educator Dr Margaret Christensen

subclinical vaccine myopericarditis manifesting months to years after injection of mRNA as chronic intermittent chest discomfort palpitations arrhythmias heart failure and cardiac arrest McCullough said McCullough said vaccine related myocarditis and pericarditis can sometimes appear years after vaccination There should be no arbitrary time windows placed on genetic vaccination side effects which can emerge 5 15 years after administration McCullough said No healthy person should face either the acute or subacute manifestations of COVID 19 myopericarditis It is wholly avoidable if vaccination is declined Real world data show increased rate of myocarditis following COVID shots In their letter to the editor Yang and Tebbutt referred to real world data indicating increased rates of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID 19 vaccination compared to the pre vaccine period including a study that found that average monthly cases of the two conditions increased post vaccination The authors said there is substantial evidence linking cardiovascular disease to COVID 19 infection They noted that this may indicate that the mechanisms triggering post infection myocarditis are similar to those causing post vaccination myocarditis They called for more studies examining this relationship Myocarditis is an expensive and difficult diagnosis to make Jablonowski said In the presence of small and uncertain numbers it is no surprise that the scientific community makes contradictory claims Yang and Tebbutt are not the first researchers to question the conclusions of the JAMA study McCullough along with biostatistician Jessica Rose Ph D and epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher sent a letter to JAMA identifying major methodological flaws in the study that led to significantly biased conclusions The 7 day vaccine myocarditis window is obviously biased and may be approximately four times more likely to ascribe myocarditis to the infection as opposed to

part of the body distant from the point of injection and 15 2 required medical attention Karina Acevedo Whitehouse Ph D a professor of microbiology at the Autonomous University of Querétaro in Mexico told The Defender We do not know the safety profile of the self replicating vaccines She said There have been no studies on the potential of this technology to transform cells that is to render them cancerous or more prone to not repairing damage to DNA or to lead to a self inflammatory status that can harbor all sorts of pathologies There have also been no studies conducted on transgenerational effects for instance teratogenicity birth defects of self amplifying mRNA injections We simply do not know what the consequences could be Whitehouse said the lack of testing is similar to conventional mRNA products such as the Pfizer and Moderna COVID 19 shots which were introduced to the public despite insufficient testing and a lack of long term data There is now a myriad of studies that show the molecular consequences of synthetic mRNA being in our cells Whitehouse said Nothing of what was told to the public regarding the safety of these products in terms of biodistribution degradation carcinogenicity teratogenicity and immune exhaustion was backed by any type of study Whitehouse said the lack of testing has led to a series of consequences for public health The biodistribution assays provided to the regulators conducted in rats which have a much quicker metabolism than humans showed that the mRNA nanolipids of the injections were distributed to nearly all organs and tissues examined including the brain and reproductive tissues Also persistence of the synthetic mRNA is much longer than originally thought and there are published scientific studies that show that it is

triggered an unintended immune response in one third of recipients The study also found that the human body misreads the injected mRNA approximately 10 of the time This process called frameshifting leads to the production of unintended proteins which may elicit an autoimmune response Whitehouse said mRNA shots are also likely contributors to the increase in turbo cancers in recent years Multiple independent studies now show that many cellular pathways are impacted by the synthetic mRNA and many of these pathways when altered can lead to cancer This could help explain the marked increase in cancer observed since mid 2021 in most countries Self amplifying mRNA shots may be riskier than conventional mRNA shots Hulscher told The Defender that the risks associated with self amplifying mRNA vaccines are likely far greater than the risks of conventional mRNA injections Whitehouse explained how self amplifying mRNA injections are different than synthetic mRNA injections Synthetic mRNA vaccines contain foreign mRNA that the body s cells translate into a protein Self amplifying mRNA injections also contain a foreign protein but in addition they contain an enzyme that instructs the body on how to make more mRNA Whitehouse said The function of this enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRp is to copy RNA which means that once the cell produces the RdRp it will make new copies of the foreign mRNA as well as more copies of its own instructions likening this function to that of a photocopier She likened the process to how a photocopier works It keeps going and going and going making more copies that in turn help make more copies Whitehouse said Hulscher compared self amplifying mRNA vaccines to conventional mRNA injections on steroids He said These genetic products encode viral replicase genes and thus behave like a viral infection Unlike conventional mRNA tech replicons cause sustained antigen production resulting in a much higher amount being produced Dr Christof

President Donald Trump s nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health NIH said during today s confirmation hearing that he opposes vaccine mandates and scientific censorship He also told members of the U S Senate s Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions STEP that he believes in diverse scientific research and he supports efforts to address today s chronic disease epidemic During his opening statement Bhattacharya a critic of COVID 19 pandemic restrictions and co author of the Great Barrington Declaration listed the five priorities he will pursue if confirmed as NIH director Tackle the chronic disease epidemic Support scientific research that is replicable reproducible and generalizable Establish a culture of respect for free speech in science and scientific dissent Fund the most innovative biomedical research agenda possible to improve American health Vigorously regulate research that has the possibility of causing a pandemic such as gain of function research According to STAT News if confirmed as NIH director Bhattacharya will oversee the biggest funder of biomedical research in the world Composed of 27 research institutes and centers the NIH has a nearly 50 billion budget NBC News reported Following the hearing Endpoints News reported that Bhattacharya sailed through today s proceedings and appears headed for a relatively easy Senate confirmation Bhattacharya supports broad scientific agenda to study rise in autism Early during the hearing Bhattacharya responded to statements by Sen Bill Cassidy R La chair of the committee that a link between the measles mumps rubella MMR vaccine and autism has been debunked and therefore doesn t require further scientific study Bhattacharya responded As far as research on autism and vaccines I don t generally believe that there is a link based on my reading of the literature But what I have seen is that there s tremendous distrust in medicine and science coming out of the pandemic We do have a sharp rise in autism rates in this country and I don t know and I don t think any scientist really knows the cause of it So I would support a broad scientific agenda based on data to get an answer to

of Bhattacharya s testimony focused on the chronic disease epidemic in the U S its cost to American society particularly children and his plans to address the epidemic if confirmed by aligning with Trump s Make America Healthy Again MAHA agenda The chronic disease crisis is severe with hundreds of millions of Americans children and adults suffering from obesity heart disease cancer and more Bhattacharya said If confirmed I will carry out President Trump and Secretary Kennedy s agenda of committing the NIH to address the dire chronic health needs of the country with gold standard science and innovation Bhattacharya said He blamed childhood diabetes and obesity for most childhood illnesses That s where the vast majority of NIH efforts should go He criticized NIH for its past failure to address the chronic disease epidemic I think the chronic disease problem is something that the NIH ought to have done a better job at for the last several decades The mission of the NIH is to address the health needs the American people have and to expand life expectancy of the American people and we have not achieved that He said NIH research should focus on a broader range of research that

where he is a professor of health policy criticized scientific censorship Over the last few years top NIH officials oversaw a culture of cover up obfuscation and a lack of tolerance for ideas that differ from theirs Bhattacharya said Dissent is the very essence of science I ll foster a culture where NIH leadership will actively encourage different perspectives He said that contrary to pandemic era guidance to unquestioningly follow the science scientific progress requires tolerance for a broad range of perspectives I want to make sure that all the range of hypotheses are supported Bhattacharya told committee members that censorship of non establishment perspectives including criticism of pandemic era measures such as lockdowns caused significant harm He cited the examples of Florida and Sweden which did not keep schools closed for extended periods during the pandemic He said The Swedish example for instance where there s lower death rates all cause excess death rates in Sweden relative to their neighbors including Norway including Germany which locked down more is an example that we didn t need to do the lockdowns Florida having lower all cause excess death rates than California is an example where the lockdowns did not save lives but had tremendous consequences on the well being of the poor the working class on children and the vulnerable He suggested these societies ultimately had better pandemic outcomes because they were open to scientific dissent and did not deploy scientists as policymakers The proper role of scientists in a pandemic is to answer basic questions that policymakers have about what the right policy should be If science is a force for freedom and for knowledge it will have universal support That s what the role of science is In a Feb 20 post on X Cassidy said that Bhattacharya has a vision to restore faith in medical research for the American people protect and improve the institution and better distribute the benefits The

Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos are funding the development of a vaccine designed to reduce the methane produced by cattle Regenerative farmer Will Harris called the project unnecessary

Bezos is investing 9 4 million to develop a vaccine designed to reduce the number of methane producing microbes in a cow s stomach Agriland reported The funding comes from his Bezos Earth Fund a philanthropy he established with 10 billion in 2020 The fund intends to distribute all of its money by 2030 by funding projects to fight climate change and protect nature Researchers at the United Kingdom s Pirbright Institute and Royal Veterinary College and New Zealand s AgResearch are among the groups receiving funding to research how a vaccine could reduce the methane emitted by cows as they digest and expel food through manure flatulence and burping Vaccines have proven to be an incredibly cost effective way to deliver global health solutions said Bezos Earth Fund President and CEO Andrew Steer in a press release If we can apply this approach to vaccinate cattle and reduce emissions the scalability and impact could be phenomenal Although scientists have sporadically researched methane vaccines for over four decades no vaccine yet exists The project s first goal is to show that such a vaccine is possible This grant is a moonshot for proof of concept risky bets like this are essential to tackling the climate crisis Steer said according to Agriland The researchers will study how methanogens or methane producing microbes colonize the digestive tract of calves and how their immune system responds to those methanogens Researchers will then determine which antibodies would effectively target the methanogens as the first step in developing the criteria for their methane vaccine Professor John Hammond Immunogenetics Group leader at the Pirbright Institute said that before they could develop a methane vaccine they had to first define what a successful vaccine needs to achieve By understanding the precise antibody responses required we can provide a clear path forward for vaccine development This approach reduces the trial and error aspect and focuses on targeted high resolution immunology Hammond added Researchers can use that knowledge to trigger an immune response in cattle that will inhibit methane production he said Crop scientist and regenerative farmer

auditable and can be used in combination with other strategies such as chemical inhibition selection for low methane genetics or early life interventions to permanently alter microbiome composition in livestock he said according to Agriland But Vlieger said that regenerative farmers take a different approach which is to be attentive to cattle nutrition and to keep their cattle in balance with the environment Bill Gates also funding methane vaccine Shortly after the Bezos Earth Fund announced in August that it was funding the methane vaccine ag biotech startup ArkeaBio announced it also had raised 38 5 million to develop a methane vaccine Investors include the Bill Gates backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures Rabo Ventures the Grantham Foundation and others The Series A funding ArkeaBio announced was from its second round of funding Breakthrough Energy had fully funded its previous seed funding round with 12 million Axios reported Gates founded Breakthrough Energy in 2015 to fund start ups focused on innovating to reduce greenhouse gas emissions Bezos and other well known billionaires including Richard Branson and Jack Ma are also investors That means Bezos is funding the methane vaccine through his for profit investment group and his philanthropic organization So is Gates The Pirbright Institute which receives Bezos grant funding for the methane vaccine will use technologies developed in its Pirbright Livestock Antibody Hub funded by the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation Both the Bezos Earth Fund and the ArkeaBio initiatives were launched following a meeting in Dubai in 2023 during which the Gates Foundation brought together approximately 40 interested parties to discuss expanding a global effort to develop a methane reducing vaccine Beef Central reported

Methane Pledge which aims to reduce methane from fossil fuels and livestock by 30 between 2020 and 2030 He said the methane pledge stimulated investments of up to 200 million into the Global Methane Hub research program A little dystopian The whole thing feels a little dystopian according to Axios but agribusiness sailed over the dystopian hurdle long ago ArkeaBio CEO Colin South said other strategies including breeding feed additives and gene editing microbiomes in the rumen all could address the methane issue But a vaccine would be a holy grail in methane mitigation because it could scale easily Although their focus is cattle he said he thought the vaccine could also be used for other species The company says it doesn t yet have a viable product but aims to have something soon

Democracy and Public Health the new runaway bestseller by Robert F Kennedy Jr chairman and chief legal counsel for Children s Health Defense While some Republicans bridled warily at Dr Fauci s accumulating power and seemingly arbitrary pronouncements the alchemies of political tribalism and the relentlessly stoked terror of COVID 19 persuaded spellbound Democrats to close their eyes to the damning evidence that his COVID 19 policies were a catastrophic and dangerous failure As an advocate for public health robust science and independent regulatory agencies free from corruption and financial entanglements with Pharma I have battled Dr Fauci for many years I know him personally and my impression of him is very different from my fellow Democrats who first encountered him as the polished humble earnest endearing and long suffering star of the televised White House COVID press conferences Dr Fauci played a historic role as the leading architect of agency capture the corporate seizure of America s public health agencies by the pharmaceutical industry Lamentably Dr Fauci s failure to achieve public health goals during the COVID pandemic are not anomalous errors but consistent with a recurrent pattern of sacrificing public health and safety on the altar of pharmaceutical profits and self interest He consistently prioritized pharmaceutical industry profits over public health Readers of these pages will learn how in exalting patented medicine Dr Fauci has throughout his long career routinely falsified science deceived the public and physicians and lied about safety and efficacy Dr Fauci s malefactions detailed in this volume include his crimes against the hundreds of Black and Hispanic orphan and foster children whom he subjected to cruel and deadly medical experiments and his role with Bill Gates in transforming hundreds of thousands of Africans into lab rats for low cost clinical trials of dangerous experimental drugs that once approved remain financially out of reach for most Africans You will learn how Dr Fauci and Mr Gates have turned the African continent into a dumping ground for expired dangerous and ineffective drugs many of them

competitive products that have lower profit margins even if the cost is prolonging pandemics and losing thousands of lives all of these share a common purpose the myopic devotion to Pharma This book will show you that Tony Fauci does not do public health he is a businessman who has used his office to enrich his pharmaceutical partners and expand the reach of influence that has made him the most

Jamie suffered a traumatic brain injury and was left severely disabled by the AstraZeneca vaccine Kate s testimony is part of the inquiry s fourth module investigating issues related to the COVID 19 vaccines and therapeutics Jamie was an athlete a high power executive and an active husband and father of two boys until he nearly died after experiencing vaccine induced immune thrombosis and

YouTube show this week citing known safety issues of mRNA vaccines and the compromised regulatory process surrounding their development and deployment All of the issues that have been raised the concerns the adverse reactions don t really seem to have been taken into full cognizance and they re plowing ahead he said The FDA recently approved Moderna s mRNA vaccine mRESVIA to protect adults 60 and older against RSV infection It will be available in the U S by the 2024 2025 respiratory virus season and likely in multiple markets worldwide mRESVIA received the FDA s breakthrough therapy designation an expedited approval program for candidate drugs whose initial clinical results demonstrate a potential substantial improvement over available therapies This marks the second FDA approved mRNA product from Moderna the first was the vaccine maker s COVID 19 vaccine Approval overlooks LNP risks antigen production unpredictability Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel stated The FDA approval of our second product mRESVIA builds on the strength and versatility of our mRNA platform But Campbell questioned Bancel s claims expressing concerns about the systemic distribution of the lipid nanoparticles LNPs used to deliver the mRNA which could potentially reach multiple organs and tissues He explained that when an mRNA vaccine is administered through an intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle the LNPs containing the mRNA can either remain at the injection site or enter the systemic circulation Campbell described how the nanoparticles travel through the veins reaching the vena cava and the right side of the heart which pumps blood to the lungs From there the blood returns to the left side of the heart via the pulmonary veins and is pumped into the aorta which distributes the nanoparticles throughout the body The aorta will take it everywhere apart from the lung tissue he said So it ll take it to your ears your nose your toes your myocardium your brain your testes or ovaries This is the concern the systemic distribution Campbell also questioned the lack of control over the amount of antigen produced by the body s cells following mRNA vaccination This goes against one of the completely fundamental axioms of giving drugs he said You give the right dose of the right", "chunk_id":

the right route Campbell explained how the immune system s response to the mRNA produced antigens expressed on the surface of cells could lead to inflammation and cell death in various tissues Your cytotoxic T cells if they recognize this antigen as foreign will start beating it up and probably could eventually kill the whole cell he said Now if that s in your arm you get a sore arm If it s in your myocardium you ll get inflammation in your myocardium Regarding the COVID 19 mRNA vaccine Campbell said that the spike protein was particularly pathogenic and that the choice to make it the antigen was very very strange He said pharmaceutical companies and regulators have not addressed the issue of mRNA vaccines causing the body to fight against itself leading to inflammation and autoimmune reactions And yet the program plows on apace he said Several mRNA vaccines in late stage trials Moderna has several mRNA vaccines in development Campbell said including mRNA 1083 a combination vaccine targeting both the flu and COVID 19 now in Phase 3 trials Moderna announced positive data from the trial claiming statistically significantly higher immune responses compared to existing vaccines on the market So this would be giving two RNA vaccines to the same person in the same syringe same injection site Campbell said The influenza portion of the vaccine is trivalent targeting three strains Campbell said meaning the combined formulation would code four RNA sequences including the spike protein assuming they re still using the spike protein RNA Now this is not me making this up honestly he said pointing viewers to the links in the show notes and urging them to read the announcements for themselves Campbell expressed skepticism about replacing existing flu vaccines with mRNA based alternatives pointing to concerns about the potential for reverse transcription Reverse transcription is the process of converting RNA back into DNA which is the opposite of the normal flow of genetic information in cells This process is concerning in the context of mRNA vaccines as it could lead to the integration of vaccine related genetic material into the human genome

Year Old Against Parents Wishes In an interview on The Defender In Depth Vermont attorney John Klar warned of potentially grave consequences for medical autonomy if the recent Vermont Supreme Court ruling is allowed to stand You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up In an interview on The Defender In Depth Vermont attorney John Klar warned of potentially grave consequences for medical autonomy if a recent Vermont Supreme Court ruling is allowed to stand The case Politella v Windham Southeast School District revolved around a 6 year old boy who was administered a COVID 19 vaccination despite his objections and his parents communication in advance to the school that he was not to be vaccinated The July 26 ruling held that the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act PREP Act shielded school officials from all state law claims as a matter of law This is a particularly shocking case Klar said because it shows us an extreme result that I don t think either Congress or the American people want And so it should not be allowed to stand and it draws people s attention to understand what the laws are that apply to these vaccines that are being injected into our bodies Klar discussed the ruling its implications and possible next steps as well as potential legal and judicial remedies regarding the PREP Act s liability shield Usurping parents wishes clearly not the intention of Congress with PREP Act Klar said the facts of the case are pretty simple the child s parents had communicated to the school during the pandemic that they did not want their child vaccinated with any of the vaccines on offer But at a school vaccination clinic someone vaccinated the child anyway while distracting him with a stuffed animal What the Vermont court has done is it said that because the PREP Act was passed and that s federal law and it preempts state law that any parental consent rights or any other rights that a person might have aside from recovering for death or serious bodily injury for willfully giving you the shot are foreclosed forever Klar said Klar said the PREP Act provides virtually limitless liability protection to corporations for products like vaccines He argued that when such products are administered to children though there should be a very high standard of safety The 6 year old in Vermont wasn t injured which Klar said is relevant to this case because the sole remedy offered under the PREP Act is in cases of serious bodily injury Klar said usurping parents wishes was clearly not the intention of Congress when passing the PREP Act

just have vaccine hesitancy but hesitancy to allow their children in a school that administers vaccines We re left with a situation where the government would say Well no we ve never ruled that the government can go ahead and give your child a shot when you don t want them to We ve just ruled that if they do that they have no liability Klar said According to Klar attorneys for the plaintiffs in the Vermont case are moving for a rehearing with the Vermont court but it is uncertain whether they plan to appeal to a federal court He said he would be willing to work with these plaintiffs and others to help appeal the case to the U S Supreme Court PREP Act does not supersede federal guarantees of our Constitution The Vermont ruling raises key constitutional questions according to Klar who said The PREP Act does not supersede federal guarantees of our Constitution Those protections still stand and that I think is the battle before us Where does our Constitution fit to protect us from federal or state legislation that transcends against our fundamental rights to privacy and bodily autonomy and parental consent for decisions affecting our children Klar noted that even a seminal U S Supreme Court decision Jacobson v Massachusetts a 1905 decision that pro vaccine advocates argue justifies government vaccine mandates recognized such constitutional rights Jacobson s very relevant Klar said It is the highest law in the land among some other cases relating to vaccines It does not hold that the government can give me a vaccine against my wishes The case held that the government could give a person a vaccine against their wishes or compel them to pay a 5 fine Drawing a distinction between smallpox and COVID 19 Klar noted that the Jacobson decision concerns smallpox a very virulent disease with a high mortality rate for an attenuated virus vaccine that was established to be quite effective That court went to very careful consideration in a lengthy opinion quite in

question what is the standard today in 2024 Klar asked He said Where s the balance Can the government institute a compulsory vaccination for monkeypox for hepatitis B for diseases that by their definition are related to a particular type of conduct or maybe a particular age group We don t even have a legal standard in America right now in 2024 to tell us under the PREP Act because it is bound by the U S Constitution what level of disease threat or mortality and to how many people does the government have to demonstrate before it has the power to launch novel vaccines at the behest of Big Pharma Klar also suggested that courts should assess other issues including whether the vaccines are experimental if the vaccines don t work as advertised and if the vaccines cause adverse events or cause you to die suddenly The courts have been reluctant to engage in scientific factual analysis he said This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The Defender is 100 reader supported No corporate sponsors No paywalls Our writers and editors rely on you to fund stories like this that mainstream media won t write Please Donate Today Parental rights have been jettisoned Klar also referred to the World Health Organization s proposed pandemic treaty noting that if it is passed the U S government may use it to strip further constitutional rights and protections as they pertain to health The pandemic treaty if passed would be used by our federal government to deny the constitutional liberties they already want to take away In doing so the U S government may claim that it is merely complying with the treaty Klar said congressional action might serve as a potential solution for parental rights that have just been jettisoned via the PREP Act That might be our best remedy It s a quick fix But Klar added At some point we have to get this case or another before the U S Supreme Court to overrule what s been done by this court and say no that was not intended by Congress

Green Publishing and Robert F Kennedy Jr who wrote our foreword are suing Warren both in her official and personal capacities for violating our First Amendment rights The federal lawsuit in which Warren is listed as the sole defendant was filed in the state of Washington As noted in our complaint Once upon a time the First Amendment was understood to guarantee that books challenging governmental orthodoxy could be sold without fear of governmental intimidation or reprisal Almost sixty years ago in Bantam Books v Sullivan 372 U S 58 1963 the Supreme Court held that state officials violated the First Amendment by sending letters to booksellers warning that the sale of certain named books was potentially unlawful The vice in such letters and in the veiled threat of legal repercussions they communicated explained the Court is that they allow government to achieve censorship while doing an end run around the judiciary provid ing no safeguards whatever against the suppression of constitutionally protected speech thus effecting an unconstitutional prior restraint It made no difference that the officials who sent the letter lacked the power to apply formal legal sanctions i e that the officials did not themselves have the power to sanction or prosecute the booksellers in any way Indeed this fact made the unconstitutionality more apparent The officials are not law enforcement officers they do not pretend that they are qualified to give or that they attempt to give distributors only fair legal advice T hey acted not to advise but to suppress It also made no difference the Court expressly found that the letters were framed as mere exhort ation or that the booksellers were in theory free to ignore the letters because the officials had deliberately set about to achieve the suppression of publications deemed objectionable and people do not lightly disregard public officers veiled threats Today certain members of the United States Congress have

letter is calling on Amazon to suppress protected speech In our book we share viewpoints ideas opinions verifiable facts and factual hypotheses that our federal government just so happens to disfavor as it counters their chosen narrative that SARS CoV 2 emerged naturally cannot be prevented by any means other than experimental gene therapy and cannot be treated by any other means than certain experimental and exorbitantly costly drugs Since the start of the pandemic government has systematically sought to suppress the kind of information shared in our book using the same tactic as Warren used against us here warning internet based companies that if they don t censor these views the full weight of the government s wrath will be turned against them As explained in our complaint The term vaccine misinformation as Warren uses it is propagandistic and false As she uses it vaccine misinformation refers to any speech challenging the safety and efficacy of the COVID vaccines even when that speech consists of factually accurate information or protected opinion On September 10 2021 as a direct result of Warren s letter a major national bookseller chain Barnes and Noble notified the publisher of The Truth About COVID 19 by email that it would no longer sell the work as an e book Barnes and Noble has for now reversed that decision It is impossible for Plaintiffs to know with certainty whether as a result of Warren s letter Amazon is now covertly demoting downgrading or otherwise suppressing The Truth About COVID 19 in numerous ways that would be hidden from view but Plaintiffs believe that Amazon is in fact covertly taking such action Even if no bookseller in the country had yielded to Warren s threats her letter would still be actionable as a clear violation of the First Amendment In Backpage com LLC v Dart 807 F 3d 229 7th Cir 2015 Posner J relying on Bantam Books the Court held that a governmental official violates a plaintiff s First Amendment rights if by threat or intimidation the official attempts to induce a third party to stop publishing or otherwise disseminating the plaintiff s message and emphasized that such a threat is actionable and thus can be enjoined even if it turns out to be empty the victim ignores it and the threatener folds his tent Such threats go by the name of prior restraint and a prior restraint is the quintessential

misinformation In our complaint we also emphasize the fact that Warren s claims of misinformation are themselves misinformation For example Warren claims our book falsely asserts that vitamin D can prevent COVID 19 infection According to Warren this claim has no scientific basis This is clearly and verifiably false as there are many studies published in 2020 and 2021 supporting this claim For example in May 2021 the National Institutes of Health s website PubMed gov published a Journal of Medical Virology article titled Vitamin D Deficiency Is Associated With COVID 19 Positivity and Severity of the Disease Many other scientific articles have also linked vitamin D deficiency with a higher risk of COVID infection more severe outcomes and increased rates of death Indeed a recent systematic review of the literature posted on the U S National Library of Medicine which is another National Institutes of Health website concluded that blood vitamin D status can determine the risk of being infected with COVID 19 seriousness of COVID 19 and mortality from COVID 19 Therefore maintaining appropriate levels of Vitamin D through supplementation or natural methods is recommended for the public to be able to cope with the pandemic As noted in our complaint Thus while Warren professes to champion true COVID information to save lives she is purveying false information that could lead to COVID deaths Warren is telling people that vitamin D levels don t matter for COVID when in fact as readers would learn from The Truth About COVID 19 correcting vitamin D deficiencies could save their lives By her own logic and according to her own demands every major social media platform should have banned Warren s letter as COVID misinformation But officials like Warren only denounce

wildly exaggerated and major safety questions have gone unanswered This statement is accurate and well within the bounds of constitutionally protected opinion Warren s letter further cites a June 2021

laboratory in Wuhan China It is true that The Truth About COVID 19 argues that that the preponderance of evidence supports the lab leak theory of the origins of the COVID virus But the claim that this position is misinformation is once again itself misinformation The lab leak theory long denounced as a conspiracy theory by federal actors and suppressed on social media is in fact supported by substantial and growing evidence See e g Wall St Journal Science Closes In on Covid s Origins Four studies including two from WHO provide powerful evidence favoring the lab leak theory Oct 5 2021 The review s next example of the supposed misinformation in the The Truth About COVID 19 is this the book insists multiple times that the public health measures and restrictions will be permanent Not true The CDC announced that fully vaccinated Americans could resume activities without wearing masks or physically distancing resume domestic travel and refrain from quarantine even when following a known exposure to the virus if they remain symptom free This CDC announcement obviously proved to be false while the prediction made in The Truth About COVID 19 that health restrictions would continue after vaccination has proved more accurate Moreover it is not the case that the Truth About COVID 19 insists that these restrictions will be permanent it says that certain restrictions on our liberty

Up Five lawsuits against Tylenol and makers of generic acetaminophen alleging prenatal exposure to the drug can lead to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD are likely to be dismissed after a U S District Court rejected new evidence supporting a causal link U S District Judge Denise Cote in the Southern District of New York said Dr Roberta Ness will not be allowed to speak before the court on a causal link between acetaminophen and ADHD leaving the plaintiffs with no admissible testimony William Parker Ph D who for the last 10 years has researched acetaminophen risks told The Defender a key problem with the Tylenol lawsuits is that they restricted the timeframe to prenatal exposure rather than looking at what happens when babies and small children are exposed to the drug Parker said that watching the slow demise of the lawsuits due to lack of admissible evidence was like watching a train wreck that he could see coming because the research on prenatal exposure to acetaminophen is relatively limited most studies employed the same kind of analysis and doesn t firmly show that the drug causes ADHD or autism Meanwhile there s more than a decade worth of compelling evidence that the drug when administered postnatally to a baby or child can cause neurodevelopmental injury that can manifest as autism and perhaps other neurodevelopmental disorders Parker said Cote s ruling is the latest development in the ongoing legal battle over whether Tylenol s warning label adequately warned the public about the possible neurodevelopmental risks to the unborn when the drug is taken during pregnancy Cote has been presiding over hundreds of cases brought by families who filed lawsuits in early 2023 alleging their child developed autism and or ADHD as a result of the mother taking acetaminophen during the pregnancy She previously dismissed more than 500 suits in February after rejecting other expert witnesses who alleged that prenatal acetaminophen exposure can cause ADHD and autism The five plaintiffs involved in the latest ruling who filed their cases after Jan 12 proposed a different expert witness Ness and research not presented in the earlier cases In a March 15 order

Ness opinion from the case The ruling again leaves these new plaintiffs without a means of proving causation meaning additional Tylenol ADHD and autism lawsuits brought in the federal court system this year will likely be dismissed wrote Irvin Jackson in an article for AboutLawsuits com However Jackson added the ruling does not apply to lawsuits filed in various state courts nationwide which have different evidentiary standards and are continuing to be pursued by lawyers Overwhelming evidence Tylenol causes autism in babies expert says Parker and his colleagues in March 2024 published a peer reviewed paper tracing overwhelming evidence that acetaminophen causes neurodevelopmental harm in babies and children who are predisposed due to genetic epigenetic and environmental factors to process the drug in a way that creates toxicity in their body In the paper he and his co authors said that while there s a narrow range of evidence on prenatal acetaminophen exposure there s a preponderance of evidence on post natal exposure Parker said it was nonsensical to look only at the impact of taking the drug during pregnancy It s like knowing that a robber broke in sometime during the night and only looking at what happened between 2 and 3 a m He said he is very certain that much if not most of the harm occurs after the umbilical cord is cut as the mother s liver is no longer protecting the fetus In another peer reviewed article published Jan 11 Parker and his colleagues included a figure showing what they based on the evidence they ve seen believe to be occurring The figure shows that newborns are especially vulnerable to developing autism when exposed to acetaminophen referred to in the figure as APAP just after birth Parker said if he were to rewrite Tylenol s warning label he would have it say The best evidence available indicates that Autism Spectrum Disorder which affects one in every 36 children in the United States is caused by exposure to acetaminophen combined with other risk factors He noted that there s some question about whether the drug is linked to dementia or Alzheimer s disease If that s not the case then it s probably a

there s no valid rationale for controversy over their assertion that the drug causes harm in susceptible babies and kids Parker said it s been challenging to get that message out because it runs contrary to public beliefs about Tylenol Companies like Johnson Johnson the original makers of Tylenol over the years have spent billions of dollars in direct to consumer marketing telling parents This is your friend this will make your baby happy Parker said It was a tremendous money maker he added Tylenol is now manufactured by Kenvue Inc formerly Johnson Johnson s Consumer Healthcare division According to Parker acetaminophen induces autism in susceptible babies and kids similar to how alcohol induces fetal alcohol spectrum disorders The only difference for public awareness really between the fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and the autism spectrum disorder is that people were so willing as soon as the data came out that said Look this condition is connected with alcohol everybody just said Oh wow Okay Yeah that makes sense That didn t happen with autism he said The data that first showed us that autism spectrum disorder is connected with acetaminophen is now 15 years old The link still largely goes unrecognized he said even as more studies have confirmed it New study detracts from research showing link between Tylenol and autism in babies kids Making matters worse Parker said is that a large study was recently published in JAMA that denied a link between the drug and neurological harm Although Parker mostly focuses on acetaminophen s effect when administered postnatally he took issue with the JAMA study which looked at the drug s possible impact on kids whose mothers took it while pregnant Parker said the authors designed their study in a way that

March 18 issued an order granting a preliminary injunction prohibiting the mayor of the District of Columbia the D C Department of Health and D C public schools from enforcing the D C Minor Consent for Vaccination Amendment Act of 2020 D C Minor Consent Act until further order of the court This is a major legal victory for children parental rights and informed consent said Rolf Hazlehurst senior staff attorney for Children s Health Defense CHD who argued the case Government overreach such as this has dire implications for children s health and the constitutional rights of citizens Hazlehurst said The D C Minor Consent Act allows children 11 and older to consent to vaccinations without their parents knowledge or consent The law specifically targets children whose parents have religious exemptions for their children The measure contains several provisions designed to deceive parents and hide the fact that their children have been vaccinated against their parental judgment authority or religious convictions The court order stated the parents have shown they are likely to succeed on the merits because the District s law requires providers to hide children s vaccination status from parents who invoke their religious exemption rights The D C Minor Consent Act also requires healthcare providers to falsify records by leaving the child s school vaccination records blank The doctors may bill the parents insurance companies for the vaccines administered to the children against the parents written directive However to deceive the parents insurance companies may not send the parents

speak out at county health board meetings You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Julie Threet moved to Butte County California in 2014 and soon began volunteering at her local hospital eventually helping set up the COVID 19 vaccination clinic in her area Today she has become public enemy number one after suffering injuries and heartache she attributes to the vaccines In late 2020 Threet was volunteering at Enloe Health Enloe Medical Center during the rollout of the COVID 19 vaccines But her life changed after she received the two primary doses of the Moderna COVID 19 shot in January and February of 2021 Threet experienced minor reactions after the first dose However following the second dose she developed injuries she s still dealing with today including tinnitus microangiopathy leaky gut liver damage fatigue and impaired vision If I would not have taken those two shots I doubt I would be sitting here with these problems Threet told The Defender In January 2022 Threet resigned from her volunteer position and began advocating for victims of vaccine injuries and their families She has spoken at dozens of county board meetings and meetings of the California State Board of Pharmacy Threet also speaks out on social media and contributes to VAERSAware com The site analyzes reports submitted to the U S government run Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS for inconsistencies and other deficiencies As injuries pile up Threet knows something s not right At Enloe Threet volunteered as a patient ambassador where she provided non medical support to doctors nurses and patients She eventually joined the board of directors for the volunteer program and helped with fundraising When COVID 19 vaccination began in late 2020 Enloe worked with the Butte County Public Health Department to store and administer the vaccines for the local region and set up a mass vaccination clinic at the county fairgrounds Threet said she volunteered at the vaccination clinic because she was optimistic the COVID 19 vaccination program would help restore normalcy The job that I really loved was working with the people in the actual

Enloe She said she developed a big knot in her left arm that remained for one week But after Threet s second dose in February 2021 she developed brain fog This brain fog was so unusual because it wasn t a senior moment You d be sitting here in your room and it s almost like you are out of body It s so hard to explain but I knew this is not right Threet said A CT scan of her brain revealed microangiopathy or damage to her small blood vessels Threet said she was in a state of shock but continued to volunteer Soon she noticed a growing number of vaccinated people including nurses developing injuries following their COVID 19 shots Threet said I m working with these young nurses and they re talking about their menstrual disruptions They re like I don t have a period all of a sudden My period was regular Why is it not anymore And they re just generally having these conversations as they re doing their business and work Threet said some patients including children reported abnormal bleeding after vaccination And a track and field athlete from nearby Chico State University had a seizure and collapsed after his vaccination she said Part of my eyes were looking down at this kid and part of my eyes were looking at the fairgrounds where we had hundreds of people in line and they re still wanting to get their shots no big deal And I m like something s not right Threet said Sharing concerns made Threet public enemy number one In June 2021 Threet began experiencing tinnitus now a chronic condition for her It is a screeching of the ears unlike anything she had previously experienced She researched the condition and discovered tinnitus was an adverse event commonly associated with the COVID 19 vaccines She also found accounts of COVID 19 vaccine recipients who began experiencing menstrual disruption after vaccination Threet said the pivotal movement was when she discovered How Bad is My Batch an online tool that allows the public to search for the

the COVID 19 vaccines and about her injuries But her concerns were dismissed I was now public enemy number one Threet recalled I had been working there as a very mature professional for five years as a volunteer and now they were basically questioning my integrity Threet considered getting the booster to continue volunteering but ultimately decided to resign It was literally a mental blow she said Threet s concerns met with a whole lot of gaslighting After resigning Threet worked to raise public awareness about COVID 19 vaccine safety and vaccine injuries In March 2022 she began attending meetings of the Butte County Board of Supervisors I started going to every single meeting demanding answers sending emails trying to engage my local politicians Threet said Her concerns were met with a whole lot of gaslighting and nobody wanting to do anything Later that month then U S Health Secretary Xavier Becerra visited Butte County to meet privately with local health officials to discuss low childhood vaccination rates in the county Following that meeting local officials organized several childhood vaccination events including vaccine vans and pop up clinics Threet said she and other local advocates attended the events to distribute flyers and speak out against the shots Threet also submitted Freedom of Information Act requests for details on the county s communication with Becerra and federal public health agencies and for the batch numbers of the COVID 19 vaccines administered in the county Through those requests Threet discovered Butte County received 225 000 to operate the mobile vaccine clinics for children She also found out some of the COVID 19 vaccine batches administered in the county were really bad really lethal During this advocacy work Threet faced

Grace Schara a 19 year old with Down syndrome who died in a Wisconsin hospital days after being admitted for a COVID 19 infection testified this week in court that their daughter died as a result of a lethal combination of drugs and a Do Not Resuscitate DNR order the hospital implemented without their consent Grace s family sued Ascension St Elizabeth Hospital in April 2023 and filed an amended complaint in July 2023 alleging the hospital s COVID 19 treatment protocols directly resulted in Grace s death in October 2021 a week after admission The trial began Tuesday at the State of Wisconsin Circuit Court for Outagamie County This isn t about failing to provide information This is about providing treatment with no consent whatsoever Scott Schara Grace s father testified on Wednesday Her passing was a result of combining Precedex lorazepam and morphine in a 26 minute window and putting an illegal do not resuscitate order on her chart The lawsuit names 14 defendants including Ascension Health five medical doctors and four John Doe medical providers two registered nurses and the Wisconsin Injured Patients and Family Compensation Fund The defendants argued that Schara may have died due to a naturally progressing disease a pre existing condition or a superseding or intervening cause Green Bay based CBS affiliate WFRV reported According to the Journal Sentinel the hospital also argued that the federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act PREP Act provided it and its doctors and staff immunity from liability during the COVID 19 pandemic At times during the first

and reducing the medications causing the problems this medical team did the opposite Mendenhall said Jason Franckowiak and Randall Guse attorneys for the defendants said hospital staff provided an appropriate standard of care which did not lead to Grace s death Instead they argued that a worsening COVID 19 infection led to her death Her parents testified that they became concerned after her daughter displayed allergy symptoms in late September 2021 days after the family attended a concert and that they took her for treatment as a precautionary measure We were just hoping that we would just get some supplemental oxygen Cindy Schara Grace s mother testified Tuesday Scott Schara told the court that Grace was not having any trouble breathing and that it wasn t an emergency so there was no need to have Grace in the hospital But the hospital told the family they were keeping Grace overnight for observation and that they would put her on a steroid for two to three days after which she would be discharged But that s not what happened Cindy Schara testified Instead hospital staff gave Grace Precedex lorazepam and morphine Mendenhall said that Precedex dangerously lowered Grace s blood pressure and pulse and that her condition improved after its dosage was lowered According to Scott Schara after Grace s first oversedation event Dr Gavin Shokar a defendant who was the primary physician in charge of Grace s care gave an order to stop administering Precedex but nursing staff waited 22 minutes to do so Shokar testified Thursday that he was uncertain whether his order was

Vaccine Saint Luke s Health Systems improperly fired an employee when it rejected her request for a religious exemption from the hospital system s COVID 19 vaccine mandate the Court of Appeal of the State of Kansas ruled You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Saint Luke s Health Systems improperly fired an employee when it rejected her request for a religious exemption from the hospital system s COVID 19 vaccine mandate the Court of Appeal of the State of Kansas ruled On Sept 14 2021 Sheryl Glean submitted an online exemption request from the hospital s vaccine mandate according to the court opinion issued on Jan 17 Glean worked at Saint Luke s South Hospital in Overland Park Saint Luke s runs 10 hospitals in Kansas and Missouri In her request Glean said her religious beliefs include that her body is holy She also said she talked with her church pastor about her decision to refuse the vaccine The hospital denied the request the court said because it interpreted the language Glean used as expressing a concern about physical harm from the vaccine rather than a sincerely held religious belief against getting the vaccine Saint Luke s was wrong to interpret Glean s request that way the court said Not only did she explain that her refusal to get the COVID 19 vaccine is based on her religious views she further evidenced the religiosity of her beliefs when she stated that she had discussed her concerns about getting the vaccine with the pastor from her church The court pointed out that the Kansas law on COVID 19 vaccination requirements specifies that an employer shall grant an exemption requested in accordance with this section based on sincerely held religious beliefs without inquiring into the sincerity of the request In other words the hospital was wrong for even questioning the sincerity of Glean s religious beliefs regarding her request Ruling is the latest in back and forth legal battle The Jan 17 ruling is the latest development in a back and forth legal battle that started when Saint Luke s fired Glean on Nov 30 2021 for failing to comply with the vaccination requirement Glean sued Saint Luke s alleging the hospital had improperly denied her religious exemption request under Kansas law on COVID 19 vaccination requirements The law passed in 2021 requires employers that mandate the COVID 19 vaccine to exempt an employee who submits a written waiver request as long as the employee states in the request that complying with the mandate would endanger the life or health of the employee or an individual

Medically Vulnerable Children From Potentially Harmful Vaccines In an exclusive interview with The Defender Dr Mary Kelly Sutton recounts how she lost her medical license in two states after being accused of improperly exempting eight children from required school vaccinations You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The Massachusetts medical board last month revoked the medical license of Dr Mary Kelly Sutton following the California medical board s decision last year to revoke her license for according to the board improperly exempting eight children from required school vaccinations The California board alleged that Sutton an integrative physician licensed and practicing since the early 1970s had written the exemptions based on a rationale that was not fully compliant with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP guidelines The board disciplined her as part of California s move in recent years to cut back on medical exemptions for vaccines by sanctioning doctors who provide them California first revoked Sutton s license on Dec 8 2021 effective January 2022 She appealed the revocation filing two writs of mandate in Superior Court in March 2022 The California board had prematurely closed her case despite the filing of the writs and the ongoing appeals process On Dec 20 2021 the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine filed a complaint against Sutton saying it was enacting reciprocal discipline against her mirroring the discipline imposed by the California board even though Sutton had not violated any rules or laws in Massachusetts where she had been licensed to practice medicine since 2015 The Massachusetts board informed Sutton that a committee would investigate her actions and make a disciplinary recommendation to the board unless she opted to resign Sutton was residing and practicing in Massachusetts at the time where she had moved to be near her grandchildren She had no interest in resigning Upon learning her California case was being appealed the Massachusetts board initially stayed the proceeding But on Sep 8 2022 the board issued a Statement of Allegations against Sutton stating that she had engaged in conduct in California that placed into question her ability to practice medicine that she lacks good moral character and has behaved in a way that undermines the public confidence in the integrity of the medical profession The allegations were addressed to the Division of Administrative Law Appeals DALA an independent agency that conducts due process adjudicatory hearings for Massachusetts state administrative agencies The document ordered Sutton to show cause as to why she should not be disciplined in

challenging the revocation filed in California Sutton said The Massachusetts board turned out to be very aggressive and not inclined to follow normal courtesy and procedures in legal discussions back and forth But that s I ve learned since then pretty much characteristic of bureaucracies There s a level of power given to the administrative state because they re supposed to be experts in their field so they feel they don t have to dot all the i s and cross all the t s that would be required in a normal legal argument back and forth where you clearly state these are the facts these are the key issues At a pre hearing conference on Nov 15 2022 the opposing counsel cut the conference short indicating she would introduce a motion for summary decision That meant there would be no discussion of charges evidence presented or questions responded to Instead they would go straight to discipline Sutton said In effect it was kind of like Shut up and sit down she said Sutton said the Division of Administrative Law Appeals in Massachusetts is assigned a role of being the neutral arbiter and very clearly sided with the Massachusetts Board of Medicine from the beginning Sutton recounted her experience with the bureaucracy Every request I made for records for discovery whether it was documents or responses to questions or admissions was denied Every motion I made was denied And at a certain point in January I felt like This is going nowhere This is not a real case There s nothing relating to the rules that s happening So I said On my side the case is closed But the medical board continued to make decisions she said Rachel Shute the Massachusetts board s complaint counsel submitted the promised Motion for Summary Decision to revoke Sutton s license on Nov 30 2022 and DALA

magistrates involved in the case requesting that it set aside the board s decision She is awaiting a response California s road to eliminating vaccine exemptions In 2012 after a decade of increasing numbers of parents seeking exemptions for their children California passed Assembly Bill 2109 AB 2109 to restrict the ability of parents to have their children exempted from vaccine requirements based on personal beliefs Where before parents simply had to write a letter stating their personal beliefs the new law stipulated that parents seeking exemption for their children must get the signature of an authorized healthcare provider stating that parents had received information about the risks of not being vaccinated In 2015 allegedly prompted by a measles outbreak at Disneyland that the media blamed on unvaccinated children and low vaccination rates in many California schools Democratic State Sens Richard Pan and Ben Allen authored a controversial bill SB 277 that eliminated the personal belief exemption altogether Pan s SB 277 passed in 2015 and Gov Jerry Brown signed it into law despite significant pushback from parents hundreds of whom protested at the legislature Several years later during the COVID 19 pandemic Pan also proposed legislation which did not pass mandating the COVID 19 vaccine for all school children with no personal or religious exemptions permitted even prior to the full approval of the vaccine for children by the U S Food and Drug Administration He also wrote a 2021 op ed in The Washington Post likening anti vaccine extremism to domestic terrorism The passage of SB 277 in 2015 made California the first state in nearly 35 years to eliminate nonmedical vaccine exemptions Beginning in January 2016 nonmedical vaccine exemptions were no longer accepted for school entry California bill left norms for exemption open to interpretation Sutton said SB 277 passed by continuing to allow strong freedom of doctors to exercise professional judgment regarding the reason for the medical exemption For example the first version of the bill proposed medical exemptions be granted only for children with contraindications but that language was then broadened The law said children could be exempted for circumstances including but not limited to family medical history for which the physician does not recommend immunization Following the passage of the law

And I was among them And over time we have been sort of picked off with discipline to our licenses Dr Douglas Hulstedt a pediatrician whose license was also revoked by the California board earlier this year for providing an allegedly improper vaccine exemption also told The Defender that he and other doctors provided exemptions in accordance with SB 277 He said he did so to the best of his ability based on reading the committee hearings and understanding the criteria they were using That was all I could go on There wasn t anything else He added that he didn t agree with SB 277 but I went along with it Research published in the American Journal of Public Health also found the language of the law left norms for exemption open to interpretation Physicians such as Sutton and at least 11 others since 2020 who were disciplined for providing improper vaccine exemptions following the 2015 law were accused of failing to comply with the CDC s ACIP guidelines for exemptions But Sutton said the ACIP guidelines don t address exemptions nor were any administrative procedures ever established for how to implement SB 277 So doctors are supposed to know that this ACIP guideline that never mentions exemption is in fact an exemption guideline she said Charity Dean s Medical Exemption Pilot Project Following the passage of SB 277 in 2016 the Santa Barbara County Department of Public Health created a Medical Exemption Pilot Program MEPP led by its then public health officer Dr Charity Dean Dean later emerged as a key voice designing harsh COVID 19 public policy in California and was profiled as a COVID 19 public health policy visionary in Michael Lewis book The Premonition A Pandemic Story The MEPP was designed as a project to surveil and discredit medical exemptions they found to be not appropriate because they are out of compliance with SB 277 On June 6 2016 the project sent a letter to schools directing them to fax all exemptions to the health department office so they could be inspected for compliance At the time Voice for Choice Advocacy a parent s group objected to the program accusing it of overreach They wrote A Voice for Choice Advocacy firmly believes

letter to schools and changed the description of its mission as seeking to provide procedural support to schools and requesting the children s personal health information be redacted from faxed exemptions A Voice for Choice also found through a Public Records Act request that Sacramento and Marin Counties were implementing similar programs Leaked meeting notes from the California Conference of Local Health Offices in July 2016 showed health officials across the state strategizing how to expand the pilot program statewide They wanted the legal power to launch investigations into physicians providing exemptions and refer them to the medical board a process they noted would be exempt from public records requests They also complained about the number of public records requests they were receiving and discussed alternative approaches to getting around them In that meeting Dean indicated the National Institutes of Health was interested in collaborating with the MEPP In the same meeting the participants moved to communicate with the California Department of Public Health CDPH to get a statewide consistent response to evaluating the implementation of SB 277 Gov Brown

reputation of the accused doctors a key part of the strategy to discipline them The process cost them their licenses their reputations and hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees he added Eventually three complaints were filed against Sutton but none were from patients and none were related to injury They were all filed by a school official or public health official who informed the board she was writing erroneous exemptions These are people all following orders to submit a complaint Sutton said They are functioning in an employee capacity Eight of the approximately 800 vaccine exemptions Sutton had written over the course of her career were challenged and were the basis for the board revoking her license The bases for those exemptions included for example family histories of serious adverse reactions to vaccines or autoimmune disorders In June 2021 Sutton had a three day trial that took place in an administrative court with a single judge and no right to a jury During her trial Sutton was represented by attorney Rick Jaffe who marshaled evidence from three top experts in defense of Sutton s methods to protect patients from vaccine injury The state produced one

release The HHS also said it wants to work with Congress to pass laws to close the GRAS loophole The HHS did not immediately respond when asked how long it would take for the FDA to eliminate the GRAS loophole or how soon it plans to ask Congress to close it Ashka Naik chief research and policy officer for the nonprofit Corporate Accountability said the GRAS loophole is just the tip of the iceberg The larger problem is the political power of the food industry in the U S and actually across the world she said adding This would be a moment for us to build even more pressure on Secretary Kennedy and remind him about the immense corporate political power because GRAS didn t just happen Decades of lobbying and behind the curtain manipulation by the industry have gone into making the American food system this unhealthy and even fatal for so many 950 substances allowed in U S foods that are banned in Europe Kennedy s directive to the FDA came one day after he met with food industry leaders including representatives from Kraft Heinz General Mills Tyson Foods WK Kellogg Co The J M Smucker Company and PepsiCo for a roundtable discussion in Washington D C Fox News reported Although the specific topics are unknown Kennedy said in an X post that the group had a great discussion on advancing food safety and radical transparency to protect the health of all Americans especially our children The Health Research Institute s Co founder CEO and Chief Scientist John Fagan explained why getting the FDA to change its rule on GRAS matters The rule has created a channel called the Self

and its employees as a charitable trust with special rights in Kenya under the Privileges and Immunities Act The new status exempted the foundation and its employees in Kenya from legal action for acts performed in Kenya as part of official duties However the Nov 25 ruling by Justice Bahati Mwamuye suspends the immunity until at least Feb 5 2025 when a court will review progress and set a hearing date for oral submissions on the petition The ruling also requires all defendants including Kenya s minister of foreign affairs and the State Law Office to collect preserve and compile all documentation regarding the privileges granted to the Gates Foundation including details of the cooperation agreement under threat of legal consequences for non compliance The Gates Foundation and the Kenyan government have until Dec 10 to respond Eastleigh Voice reported The diplomatic privileges allowed the Gates Foundation to engage in contracts legal actions and property transactions within the

legal consequences for his actions and those of the Gates Foundation Dr Meryl Nass founder of Door to Freedom told The Defender It should be assumed that no one entity would seek such immunity unless they thought they might be at risk of legal penalties Nass added Gates has been charged with many crimes including for monopolistic business practices for conducting a clinical trial involving girls in India that was associated with child deaths and lack of informed consent He has certainly been accused of false advertising of agricultural products in India and Africa Francis Boyle J D Ph D

Capital FM The decision to extend diplomatic immunity has sparked widespread debate over accountability Critics argue that the privileges shield the Foundation from legal scrutiny setting a dangerous precedent Mohamed told The Defender that granting immunity to Gates in Kenya creates diplomatic and economic pressures on other African countries to offer similar legal exemptions She said Given Gates influence and the reach of his philanthropic initiatives across the continent neighboring countries might feel compelled to follow Kenya s lead to attract or retain Gates investments and programs particularly in health education and agriculture This could lead to a domino effect where more African nations feel obligated to grant immunity This will undermine the autonomy of African countries over their legal systems and create a tier of foreign actors operating outside the jurisdiction of local laws weakening governance and setting a precedent where exemptions are granted based on wealth or influence rather than merit or need posing risks to legal sovereignty and equitable governance across the continent Catherine Austin Fitts founder and publisher of the Solari Report and former U S assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development said the immunity granted to the Gates Foundation is part of an ongoing trend in which major international organizations are granted such privileges Ever since we created a central bank with sovereign immunity in 1930 the Bank of International Settlements BIS we have seen the steady creation of international organizations that enjoy sovereign immunity as well as international treaties that subvert national and local law Fitts said Not surprisingly this has been followed by the steady erosion of the rule of law and centralization of ownership and wealth allowing a handful of elites to make war on the population and take assets In the case of the Gates Foundation Fitts said she believes granting diplomatic immunity to the Gates

phenomenon known as the allergic or atopic march which refers to how allergic diseases progress in a person beginning in infancy In the largest study of its kind researchers from Children s Hospital of Philadelphia CHOP analyzed electronic health record EHR data collected between 1999 and 2020 from more than 200 000 pediatric patients ages 0 to 18 Their goal was to uncover patterns and prevalence of allergic disease Dr Stanislaw Gabryszewski a fellow in the Division of Allergy and Immunology at CHOP who led the study said in a press release Allergic diseases are one of the most common causes of impaired quality of life in children so to improve the diagnosis and care of children with these diseases it is important that we have an accurate understanding of how widespread they are and the risk factors that are associated with them The study found that children on average tended to be first diagnosed with eczema at 4 months old then food allergies and asthma around 13 months allergic rhinitis or hay fever at 26 months and a rare food allergy called eosinophilic esophagitis EoE at 35 months Peanut egg and shellfish were the most commonly diagnosed food allergies A total of 13 4 of children had two or more allergic conditions Patients with respiratory allergies like asthma and allergic rhinitis tended to have both conditions Dr David Hill a pediatric allergy expert at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the study s authors told CNN If a child is diagnosed with one form of allergy their likelihood of developing a second form is much higher than the general

the Pediatrics paper overlooked vaccines as a potential cause of allergies given that even the CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made the connection between aluminum in vaccines and asthma as well as eczema Hooker was referring to a CDC funded study showing that children who received 3 milligrams or more of vaccine related aluminum had at least a 36 higher risk of developing persistent asthma than kids who got less than 3 milligrams According to The Associated Press experts have criticized the study for its various shortcomings including failure to account for the effects from other potential aluminum exposures such as in the air or through diet When the research was published last September in the journal Academic Pediatrics Christopher Exley Ph D an expert on aluminum toxicity weighed in on the methodology telling The Defender It the CDC study is a classic aluminum industry study appearing to surrender some possible toxicity of aluminum in vaccines while actually delivering multiple messages signaling the safety of aluminum in general Hooker told The Defender about an analysis he conducted with Neil Z Miller of the Institute of Medical and Scientific Inquiry to better understand health outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated children We saw an odds ratio of 4 49 statistically significant for asthma in vaccinated children versus unvaccinated

research support the reconsideration of better vaccination development in the future There has long been evidence that food proteins in vaccines cause the development of food allergies In the abstract of a study published in the Journal of Developing Drugs researcher Vinu Arumugham wrote Many studies since 1940 have demonstrated that food proteins in vaccines cause sensitization in humans Allergens in vaccines are not fully disclosed No safe dosage level for injected allergens has been established As a result allergen quantities in vaccines and injections are not regulated It is well recognized that many currently approved vaccines have enough allergen to cause anaphylaxis Arumughan concluded that given the unknown risk factors we should immediately stop multiple vaccines being administered simultaneously Potentially concerning findings on EoE allergy trends among racial groups According to U S Pharmacist EoE prevalence has increased over the past two decades nearly doubling in both adults and children and occurring in an estimated one in 1 500 to 2 000 persons The CHOP study researchers also found that EoE which has historically been considered a disease affecting primarily white males is more common among non white patients now at 40 than previously reported Meanwhile a disproportionate number of kids with eczema and asthma were Black Couey said A possible explanation for the racial disparity the authors see could be related to income Lower income children may be more likely to receive more vaccines at once than children from higher income families who have better insurance and can take their children for regular well visits to receive vaccines on a more protracted schedule It seems the authors are also working under the assumption that allergies develop as a

surging among children globally even with an increasing number of kids eating healthier and brushing regularly Emerging research suggests maternal nutrition toxin exposure and gut health as well as overexposure to fluoride are factors in oral health You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Chimnonso Onyekwelu and Melissa Smith The rising crisis of childhood tooth decay Early childhood caries ECC commonly known as tooth decay is the most common chronic disease among children globally Amazingly tooth decay is five times more common than asthma and seven times more common than hay fever in children In the U K it remains the leading cause of hospital admissions for children ages 6 10 years Recent data shows that 33 4 of secondary school students in England have visible dental cavities and nearly 46 of children in the U S are affected Despite being largely preventable childhood tooth decay continues to surge In response public health strategies like water fluoridation and increased access to dental care have been widely adopted Yet these efforts haven t curbed the crisis In the U K alone by the end of 2024 there were 49 112 hospital episodes for tooth extractions in children ages 0 to 19 with 62 of them having a primary diagnosis of tooth decay Traditionally tooth decay has been blamed on high sugar diets starchy foods and poor oral hygiene But an increasing number of children with healthy diets and good brushing habits are still developing severe decay some requiring surgery This troubling trend suggests we may be missing deeper less visible causes Might the true roots of dental disease begin even before birth Emerging research points to factors like maternal nutrition toxin exposure during pregnancy birth interventions and the early life microbiome as key contributors to a child s oral health These findings also raise new concerns about overexposure and underexposure to fluoride To truly understand and prevent dental disease in children we must widen our focus from the mouth itself to the earliest stages of life How ECC begins before the first tooth ECC refers to the presence of one or more decayed missing or filled tooth surfaces in any primary tooth in children 71 months about 6 years or younger as defined by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry It s also commonly known as baby bottle tooth decay nursing

can transmit cariogenic bacteria to their infants especially between 6 and 30 months of age through everyday actions like kissing sharing utensils or pre chewing food In this way maternal oral health directly shapes the baby s oral microbiome Even during pregnancy a mother s diet and gut health can affect tooth and jaw development in the womb Nutrients like vitamins A D and K2 help form strong enamel and jaw structures while calcium supports tooth mineralization On the other hand antibiotics antidepressants and poor maternal gut health can impair nutrient absorption and disturb microbial balance effects that may then be passed on to the child Beyond the womb The many roots of childhood tooth decay While a mother s gut health and diet lay the foundation what happens during and after birth is just as important for a baby s oral health The mode of delivery whether it s a vaginal birth or a caesarean section C section can shape or disrupt the development of a baby s oral microbiome Research here and here has demonstrated that babies born vaginally are exposed to more beneficial bacteria from the maternal vaginal canal helping seed a healthier oral nasal and skin microbiome as well as the gut This process known as vertical transmission is largely bypassed in C section births which leaves infants more vulnerable to imbalanced microbial development throughout their bodies Similarly antibiotics while sometimes necessary wipe out both harmful and beneficial bacteria disrupting the microbiome s natural balance Just one course of antibiotics will alter the gut microbiome for years irreversibly for some species Early exposure to antibiotics in infancy significantly affects the diversity and number of bacteria colonising the baby s mouth and gut Beyond these early life influences several ongoing factors also shape a child s oral health and immunity Feeding practices such as breastfeeding versus bottle feeding the type and timing of weaning foods and frequent consumption of sugar and refined starches can all feed harmful bacteria and wear down enamel Reduced saliva flow due to certain medications or health conditions can limit the mouth s natural

many of them come with extremely high sugar contents Regular consumption of these pouches has been linked to an increased risk of dental decay in young children We also need to mention the rapid introduction of a range of non nutritive sweeteners to eliminate sugar in people s diets which is now raising questions about the effects not only on the gut microbiome but the oral microbiome as well Together these factors create an environment where dental disease can take root early and progress quickly in children Hidden in plain sight Other clear drivers of dental caries In 1945 community water fluoridation was introduced as a strategy to reduce dental caries This involved adding controlled amounts of hydrofluorosilicic acid the fluoride used to mass medicate public water supplies based on research suggesting that fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and helps prevent decay Over the following decades the benefits were documented here here and here with studies reporting a 50 70 reduction in tooth decay among populations with fluoridated water However in recent years the apparent public health victory of water fluoridation has come under scrutiny Later studies here and here reveal that alongside the decline in dental caries came a rise in dental fluorosis white streaks spots or enamel discolouration caused by excessive fluoride during tooth development Even more concerning high levels of fluoride exposure have been linked to skeletal fluorosis painful joint and bone damage calcification of soft tissues increased fracture risk and impaired bone development A major meta analysis also found that children exposed to high fluoride levels had lower IQ scores compared to those in low fluoride areas raising red flags about its impact on brain development This isn t entirely surprising Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral found in water soil and certain foods While it can help protect teeth at low levels too much of it disrupts calcium signaling mitochondrial function and the normal development of tooth enamel making it porous or mottled In a natural diet we d only ever be exposed to minute quantities very different from when the public is

significantly higher among young people suffering from chronic physical conditions According to that study youth with co occurring chronic physical and mental conditions had significantly higher odds of self harm suicidal ideation and suicide attempts than healthy peers Youths with chronic physical conditions alone were at slightly elevated risk for all three outcomes Other recent studies have also drawn a link between chronic illness in youth and mental health disorders A systematic review and meta analysis published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics identified a prevalence of anxiety and depression among youth with chronic illness more than 3 times greater than what is seen in the community setting Anxiety and depression are common clinical comorbidities and should be considered when assessing and treating youth with chronic pain the study noted And a 2019 systematic review published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry found the prevalence of

Williams said From my experiences on the wards I found that the interactions of young patients with chronic illness were often limited to their family if present and the health professionals caring for them Rarely did I see interaction with peers their own age Notably there are children of similar age around in the rooms next to across and down the hall from them Though even with available community spaces I noticed that the kids seldom used them together Incidence of chronic illness in youth The elephant in the room Experts who spoke with The Defender agreed that young people suffering from chronic illness need increased mental health support However they also said more should be done to prevent chronic disease Dr Michelle Perro a pediatrician praised Williams for tackling a difficult but prescient issue regarding the emotional well being of our youth suffering with chronic diseases However Perro said There still exists a major educational gap in the understanding of the drivers of why our children have fallen victim under the burden of chronic health challenges For Perro there are several additional contributors to the incidence of mental health challenges in youth with chronic illness and for the incidence of chronic illness in these children in the first place While no doubt school absenteeism and decreased social engagement exacerbated mental health during the COVID 19 pandemic without addressing the root cause the true drivers of chronic health precipitants the mental health tolls will continue to escalate Perro said According to Perro some factors that contribute to the onset of chronic disorders in children include environmental toxicants that are found in our food GMOs and their associated pesticides air pollution EMFs 5G experimental gene

chronic kidney disease those who received self management support and peer support experienced fewer hospitalizations and slowed progression of disease Williams proposed the development of hospital school programs which she said are common in some countries such as Italy but are only available to a limited extent in the U S despite a decades old recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics for such programs Williams cited a 2021 article in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health describing Italy s Hospital School Program as a national flagship system in education that has been active since the 1950s and served over 40 000 students during the 2019 2020 school year The Hospital School Program is part of a broad therapeutic process that aims to overcome the fear once hospitalization ended in order to prevent the school drop out risk the article states Williams also suggested that daily group social sessions may help pediatric patients with chronic illness as they actively facilitate conversation game play and camaraderie between chronic inpatient peers The faltering mental health of pediatric patients with chronic disease is something health professionals and health systems should address with vigor Williams wrote However Williams acknowledged that while such programs may contribute to mental well being for youth with

Dr Robin Kobbe with the Institute for Infection Research and Vaccine Development at the University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf in Germany looked at blood samples of 14 healthy children the day the children received dose one of Pfizer s shot one month afterward and one year after the children received dose two A year after the second dose they found increased levels of IgG4 antibodies in the children s blood suggesting that their immune system switched its type of immune system response IgG4 is one of the four subclasses of immunoglobin or antibodies produced by plasma cells in the blood While prior studies have found elevated levels of IgG4 in adults after repeated mRNA COVID 19 vaccination Kobbe and his co authors said their investigation is the first showing it happens in children too The researchers wrote in their report published July 30 in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal IgG4 responses should gain more attention in health and disease especially in the context of mRNA vaccination Understanding the unusual mechanism triggering IgG4 production is crucial they added as more mRNA vaccines are currently under development and could hit the global market soon Heightened IgG4 indicative of IgG4 related disease Brian Hooker Ph D chief scientific officer at Children s Health Defense CHD told The Defender the study s findings are very concerning because elevated IgG4 may be indicative of IgG4 related disease a multi organ fibro inflammatory condition that usually involves the pancreas kidneys or salivary glands but could involve any other organ Seventy to 80 of those with the disease have elevated IgG4 Hooker said Although IgG4 related disease is treatable the underlying autoimmune conditions are often chronic and will require a lifetime of treatment The disease could be autoimmune in origin due to molecular mimicry from the COVID 19 vaccine Hooker said It is also analogous to systemic sarcoidosis which is an inflammatory condition caused by an immune system exaggeration leading to granulomas According to the Cleveland Clinic granulomas are clusters of white blood cells that wall off bacteria a foreign object or something else

the lungs but can also form in the liver kidney skin or other areas of the body As The Defender previously reported the mRNA COVID 19 vaccine s propensity to alter the immune system s functioning in this way is something discussed in Byram Bridle Ph D and Dr Harvey Risch s new book Toxic Shot Facing the Dangers of the COVID Vaccines Bridle a viral immunologist who wrote the book s chapter on the vaccine s immunological harms did not respond to The Defender s comment request on the German study However Risch professor emeritus of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health told The Defender in an earlier interview After three to four doses of the vaccine the antibody response of the immune system gets shifted from an IgG1 immunoglobin type 1 or 2 response which are neutralization responses to an IgG4 response which is a tolerance response Tolerance describes how the immune system reduces its overreaction to certain pathogens for example those related to food or seasonal allergies This dampening of immune system surveillance could potentially leave people more vulnerable to infections and other health issues including cancer IgG4 response may reduce body s ability to fight cancer When the immune system is dominated by IgG4 antibodies the body may be less able to fight off cancer The authors of an April 24 review article published in Nature Reviews Immunology explained IgG4 competes with other antibody sub classes for binding to tumour antigens and owing to its anti inflammatory properties blocks the induction of antitumour immune responses In the absence of an immune response tumour cells have increased ability to proliferate and metastasize resulting in disease progression and decreased survival Immune evasion through class switching to IgG4 has been observed in patients with melanoma cholangiocarcinoma colon cancer pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma A 2022 study found that individuals with IgG4 related disease appeared to have a

General Hospital was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when she was just 3 years old In her case the manic aspects of the condition are more evident Jaylene s psychiatrist Dr Robert Doyle who is also the chief medical director at the hospital comments Looking back she was the most classic bipolar kid with these full blown manic giddy laughing out of control unable to be redirected children I ve ever seen However physicians in Europe diagnose psychiatric irregularities like this differently According to Dr Martin Holtman who has a clinic in Frankfurt if the factors used to diagnose bipolar disorder in the U S were to be considered as mere behavior descriptions instead then the children would be diagnosed with milder disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD Holtman recounts how young American patients in Frankfurt might be given psychostimulants for their ADHD but when these children go to the U S for vacation they return with additional prescription medications saying they ve been diagnosed in the States as bipolar Children in America often fall victim to polypharmacy Polypharmacy refers to the use of multiple medications to address a health condition and it is becoming prevalent among both the elderly and the youth According to a recent study published in the Journal of Pediatrics out of 302 pediatric patients surveyed 68 2 have experienced polypharmacy In the featured documentary Jaylene s mother Elizabeth shared how Doyle has prescribed various types of medications to manage her daughter s condition About age 6 she started with the anxiety So I mentioned that to him Doyle and he said Well let s give her an antianxiety medication So at that point he gave her Lorazepam to calm her down That didn t do anything It just made her more hyper it just made her more stimulated So he said Well let s try Klonopin We tried that it didn t help her Nothing would help So at that point we went back and forth He just kept mixing the medication s like

Jaylene small doses of lithium a mood stabilizer with side effects like memory problems and seizures It even poses a risk for kidney failure when used long term But it still didn t work out as Jaylene started to become confused and couldn t think clearly causing him to halt the lithium treatment Meanwhile Anna who has been taking a new drug called Abilify to curb the manic side of her condition is shown to be struggling with severe mood swings and crying fits Her mother says that according to her doctor the new drug works to get rid of the manic side of the condition but as a result the depression manifests more causing Anna s intense outbursts Indeed U S children are now being plied with powerful drugs to treat mental health concerns Rarely do these medications address the root of the problem Plus they create new issues of their own The result More symptoms that are then treated with additional medications Giving children a cocktail of drugs provides very little to no benefit There s no doubt that overprescribing medications is ultimately setting children up for a downward spiral of increasing side effects and worsening health The documentary mentions some of the side effects of psychotropic drugs on children including weight gain growth dysfunction sleep problems nervousness and mood swings Medicated children are also at higher risk of diseases like heart disease and diabetes What s even more alarming is that drug cocktails have been shown to provide very little or no benefit For example a 2021 review published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology found that when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs were added to other ADHD treatments there was only minimal evidence of benefit for mood or anxiety comorbidities In addition the drug Strattera atomoxetine led to mixed reports of benefit including the only small RCT randomized controlled trial showing no benefit The study also highlighted that taking drug

of Psychiatry and Psychology explains why giving antipsychotic medications to children could be particularly damaging When you give an antipsychotic drug to anyone especially children you are causing an imbalance It s an exogenous substance that you re putting into the brain and you re causing a purposeful imbalance You re doing very damaging things in my opinion to the child because you re shutting down the centers of the brain that are responsible for creativity for loving for emotion for feeling the very things that make us human beings and discriminate us from the animals Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us The long term effects of polypharmacy in children are still unclear Eleven year old Raul who has ADHD and bipolar disorder has been on a cocktail of psychotropic drugs since he was diagnosed According to his adoptive parents Tessa and Terrence Williams some of the prescription medications he was given include antianxiety medications like Buspar stimulants like Concerta and Ritalin methylphenidate and even Depakote an antiseizure drug They also describe an incident in which Raul s outbursts took a turn for the worse and he became violent and had a seizure He was hospitalized in the psychiatric ward for a month Terrence shares how he was very upset as he was hopeful that the medications were working We thought perhaps we were turning a corner but they actually really went downhill he said The film states that without definitive studies the long term consequences of these drugs cannot be concluded and with incidents like Raul s it s often unclear whether it s the illness or the medication that s really responsible for the behavior European doctors also highlight the long term risks associated with prescribing psychotropic drugs to young children According to Dr Bruno Müller Oerlinghausen a clinical psychopharmacologist these drugs are excitatory potent patients who take them often experience sleep disturbances coordination

functioning of the brain and is prescribed very early also leads to the alteration in the maturation of the brain If one prescribes the same psychotropic medication for an adult then it s as if one sets a wobbling train back on the tracks But the tracks are all already there If these drugs are given to a child whose brain is still in the stage of development then it s as if it affects the building of the tracks That means the train can drive somewhere else and that is then also verifiable Nondrug approaches for ADHD In Europe even though they still prescribe drugs to children doctors are more conservative than U S doctors when it comes to prescribing multiple medications at a time According to Holtman We re not quick to prescribe medication In most cases we don t give high doses We don t give several types of medication The Americans almost always don t just take one type of medication You could say they are taking a cocktail of drugs So we are being careful In addition seeking alternative therapies are encouraged such as enrolling in rehab centers where children with ADHD work with their family and other families to develop traditional values such as trust and strengthening the child parent relationship to manage their condition Jens Missler whose young children Marc Andre and Jan Phillip have both been diagnosed says I don t think that you can call it a general remedy You try to integrate into daily life what you have learned as much as possible It won t always be easy that s obvious but of course you have to see what you alone have got out of it We have to see what he wants to put into practice for himself at his age and of course how far we can propel him in that direction Marc Andre before doing therapy was unable to do simple tasks like catching a ball or hopping on one foot After two years of occupational therapy his concentration has improved as well as his dexterity and ability to focus on one task at a time Yet there s no doubt

Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital made headlines after it was discovered that they received millions of dollars of funding from pharmaceutical companies It s a clear indication of how Big Pharma is pulling strings to ensure that medications become the first line of treatment for adults and children alike In the documentary Dr John Abramson a former psychologist and author of the book Overdosed America comments There s definitely a relationship to the funding system of how the knowledge is produced and disseminated that creates the impression that physicians who are trying their best to help children will realize that goal by using drugs and expensive drugs instead of by doing what they did before these expensive drugs became the recognized therapy for pediatric bipolar disease Advocating for your child is your responsibility as a parent it is imperative that you stand up against allowing powerful corporations to rake in profits at the cost of your child s well being If your child is dealing with an emotional or mental challenge I recommend seeking help from a trustworthy physician who does not consider psychotropic drugs as the first choice of treatment The treatment of children with psychotropic drugs is a science that is still partly experimental Only the future will tell if the parents of these children have made the right decisions and by then it will be too late to go back the film concludes You must also realize that most behavioral problems in children are related to an unhealthy diet emotional upset and exposure to toxins For example paying attention to the health of your and your child s gut microbiome is crucial Research shows that the makeup of gut flora at birth and during a child s first year of life plays a key role in the development of neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD Other toxic substances that have been associated with an increased risk of ADHD include lead phthalates BPA pesticides and air pollution as they disrupt brain development and neurotransmitter systems affecting your child s behavior and cognitive function For more information on this I recommend reading my article Why Do 1 in 9 Children Now

habits in your children is one of the greatest gifts you can give them not just for their hearts but for their brains as well Establishing healthy patterns early in life sets the stage for robust brain development and enduring cognitive health The key to protecting your child s long term brain health starts with something fundamental physical activity Incorporating movement into everyday life is key Here s how to get your kids moving for a healthier brain Make it fun Exercise shouldn t feel like a chore Find activities your child genuinely enjoys whether it s dancing biking swimming playing tag or jumping rope The more fun it is the more likely they are to stick with it Engaging in a mix of activities helps keep things interesting and engages different muscle groups Encourage a combination of aerobic exercise Like walking hiking or swimming strength training such as climbing or using playground equipment and flexibility exercises including stretching or yoga Remember the goal is to instill a love of movement so be sure to celebrate small victories and effort Lead by example Children are more likely to be active if they see their parents being active Make exercise a family affair go for walks or bike rides together play tag in the park or try a new activity as a family The earlier children develop healthy habits the more likely they are to maintain them throughout their lives So make physical activity a part of their daily routine from a young age Limit screen time Too much screen time encourages a sedentary lifestyle Set limits on screen time and

children according to the findings of a peer reviewed study published last week in Pediatric Rheumatology Growing concerns about the emergence of new autoimmune diseases prompted the study according to the four Israeli researchers who authored the paper Using the health records of 493 705 Israeli patients up to age 21 the authors studied the incidence of autoimmune diseases which occur when the immune system attacks the body instead of defending it in vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects before and during the COVID 19 pandemic The study measured a hazard ratio of 1 2323 for patients who received at least one dose of a COVID 19 vaccine This translates to a 23 2 greater risk of developing an autoimmune disease when controlling for age sex and socioeconomic status a statistically significant outcome according to the study By comparison unvaccinated children with a prior COVID 19 infection did not have a statistically significant increase in risk for developing autoimmune disease Autoimmune diseases cover a range of conditions including Type 1 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis celiac disease and rare neurological disorders like Guillain Barré syndrome which has been associated with COVID 19 vaccines In a post on Substack epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher said the study s findings underscore the clear long term dangers of COVID 19 vaccination Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist for Children s Health Defense told The Defender The immune system is an extremely complex system our knowledge of which is hardly scratching its surface Any time we meddle with it we risk unintended consequences According to pediatrician Dr Michelle Perro the study was methodologically robust Larger sample sizes increase the ability to detect true effects and reduce the margin of error strengthening the reliability of the study s findings she said A strong feature of this paper is that they looked at children from 1 to 21 years Although that age range extends beyond what we generally use 1 to 18 years younger adults are particularly prone to autoimmune disorders since they can take time to develop Perro said The authors of the study concluded that

finding indicating the need for long term clinical testing of vaccines before they re approved The takeaway is that prior to the introduction of any proposed pharmaceutical for children there must be an adequate time period of study Perro said The development of vaccines for children typically spans 10 to 15 years including preclinical research three phases of clinical trials and regulatory review Regulators didn t follow that timeline for COVID 19 vaccines as clinical trials were rushed as part of Operation Warp Speed Children were not adequately studied prior to the roll out and have paid the consequences Perro said She said autoimmune diseases are difficult to treat even from a holistic perspective and have serious health ramifications We don t even understand the mechanisms that lead a vaccine to induce autoimmunity Jablonowski said Diseases of autoimmunity are among those we have the least success in treating Growing number of studies links COVID shots to autoimmune conditions Some experts warned of a potential super epidemic of autoimmune diseases just weeks after the COVID 19 vaccines were released to the public Meanwhile several recent studies have linked autoimmune disorders to the COVID 19 shots A study by 19 German scientists published in Molecular Systems Biology in March linked the mRNA COVID 19 vaccines to long term changes in genetic structures that can provoke an inflammatory response and lead to the onset of cancer and autoimmune disorders A study published last month in Immunity Inflammation and Disease found that people who received the COVID 19 vaccine exhibited elevated levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines proteins that help regulate the immune system These cytokines are associated with conditions including chronic inflammation immune dysregulation and autoimmune activation A preprint by a group of scientists led by three Yale University researchers and published in February found that those who received the COVID 19 vaccine were at increased risk of autoimmune disorders immune system exhaustion and other biological changes following vaccination And a meta analysis conducted by researchers at Saint Peter s University Hospital

the spike protein was expected to remain in the body The mechanisms of the induction of autoimmunity may be related to the spike protein Perro said One such potential mechanism is molecular mimicry where viral proteins share structural similarities with human proteins leading the immune system to attack the body s tissues Another possible mechanism is bystander activation where the immune system responds to the spike protein and inadvertently activates nearly all immune cells that target self antigens Perro said This process can lead to tissue damage According to Perro the body s initial encounter may also increase the immune system s attack on the body s own proteins in a process known as epitope spreading New autoimmune disease diagnoses skyrocketed in our practice Dr Margaret Christensen a trained gynecologist clinical educator and co founder of the Carpathia Collaborative said the new study s findings match trends she s observed with patients at her practice Since the advent of the COVID 19 vaccine the number of young women and men with newly diagnosed autoimmune diseases has skyrocketed in our practice Christensen said Perro said the new study strengthens calls by

the months that followed he stopped speaking in meaningful language became obsessed with numbers and letters and his behavior became erratic and difficult to contain He also developed physical health problems including gastrointestinal issues and different infections On June 3 2002 after many doctor visits a psychologist diagnosed Yates with autism spectrum disorder Dr Jean Ronel Corbier the neurologist who evaluated Yates and diagnosed him with regressive autism theorized Yates autism was a response to the MMR vaccine Dr Andrew Zimmerman a pediatric neurologist at the Center for Autism and Related Disorders at Johns Hopkins Kennedy Krieger Institute tested Yates for a mitochondrial disorder that he thought might have made Yates vulnerable to vaccine induced regressive autism particularly when vaccinated while ill After they learned that Yates condition was vaccine related the Hazlehurst family in 2003 filed a claim with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP which adjudicates vaccine injury claims Also known as the vaccine court the program was designed by Congress in 1986 to address the risks of unavoidably unsafe vaccines by both insulating vaccine manufacturers from liability for vaccine injuries and compensating families whose children are injured by vaccines Although they didn t realize it at the time the Hazlehursts story was nearly identical to that of thousands of families across the country whose once healthy children quickly descended into silence or erratic behavior and severe physical illnesses that often accompany autism

families and autism advocacy organizations fought for access to government information which was never forthcoming on vaccine safety and side effects did their own scientific research sought experts to inform their cases combined resources to keep the cases going and fought a public relations battle with a national media that eventually turned against them Simultaneously the public health agencies and the vaccine court itself covered up data showing that vaccines can cause autism The chief special master presiding over the proceedings the media Big Pharma and the U S Supreme Court opined that a win for the families in the omnibus would risk public confidence in vaccines and threaten to bankrupt the compensation fund In 2009 and 2010 the proceedings ended when the vaccine court rejected the plaintiffs medical theories about how vaccines cause autism and dismissed all six test case claims and subsequently all of the cases pending in the omnibus The U S Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the decisions upon review in the two cases that appealed including Yates case Those decisions and the Supreme Court decision in the Bruesewitz v Wyeth case that followed in

Bono Learning that his claim in vaccine court was fraudulently dismissed literally added insult to injury The injustice to the thousands of children in the Omnibus Autism Proceeding and those who have been injured since along with their suffering families cannot be overstated The censorship machine went right to work By the early 1990s autism rates had begun to rise and parents whose children had regressed into autism after vaccination were starting to connect through the internet creating chat groups to share their experiences and theories about how the vaccines harmed their children doing research and speaking out in public and confronting the public health agencies and the pharmaceutical companies At the time autism prevalence rates were estimated to be about 1 in 1 000 children up from 4 5 in 10 000 in the 1960s Today that rate is 1 in 36 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC attributed the rise in prevalence to better reporting and diagnostics However many researchers take issue with this argument pointing out that most cases are clustered in recent generations of children As parents began to speak out and confront public health agencies and Big Pharma the country was listening Bono told The Defender Parents were invited to speak in congressional hearings on the issue Emmy award winning local and national television news segments magazines and

years later a CDC senior scientist Dr William Thompson invoked federal whistleblower status to release the raw data sets that he said the CDC ordered him to conceal That data showed that African American boys who received the MMR vaccine before age 3 as the CDC recommends were 3 36 times more likely to receive an autism diagnosis than those who received the vaccine after 3 years of age How the vaccine court fails parents and children with autism Many parents early in the epidemic were unaware there was a national program to shield manufacturers and compensate families whose children had been injured by vaccines The VICP or vaccine court was established when Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 Congress passed the law in response to a previous crisis around Wyeth s now Pfizer s diphtheria tetanus pertussis DPT vaccine In the late 1970s and 1980s serious and widespread concern grew about the safety of the shot because many children were suffering seizures serious brain injury or death following DPT vaccination Between 1980 and 1986 people claiming vaccine injury brought over 3 billion worth of damage claims to U S civil courts against vaccine manufacturers most of which were for the DPT vaccines After lawsuits against Wyeth revealed the company knew of the risks juries began authorizing large payouts to some DPT injured children which threatened to bankrupt the vaccine insurance industry as manufacturers began to exit the industry The publicity also generated public concerns about vaccine adverse events By 1985 only four vaccine makers remained to produce the vaccines that all states had mandated in 1981 and Congress anticipated a vaccine supply crisis Parents of children injured by the DPT vaccine also began organizing in a national nonprofit called Dissatisfied Parents Together now the National Vaccine Information Center to demand safer vaccines and a system to compensate families of injured children In 1986 Congress",

Parents of children injured by the DPT vaccine also began organizing in a national nonprofit called Dissatisfied Parents Together now the National Vaccine Information Center to demand safer vaccines and a system to compensate families of injured children In 1986 Congress passed the law giving the pharmaceutical industry broad protection from liability and creating a framework to compensate children injured by compulsory vaccines through a no fault administrative system on the premise that vaccines were important for public health but also unavoidably unsafe A report that accompanied the act and explained its intentions indicated that Congress intended to generously compensate the victims of vaccine injury ensure the vaccine supply and improve vaccine safety Awards for vaccine injuries are paid out from a fund generated by a small surcharge on each vaccine The VICP is administered by HHS with court appointed special masters typically lawyers who previously represented the U S government who manage and decide the individual claims The U S Court of Federal Claims appoints special masters who serve four year terms Attorneys may represent the petitioners and the DOJ represents HHS VICP proceedings are more informal than a typical courtroom In the so called vaccine court there is no judge or jury and the rules of evidence civil procedure and discovery do not apply Entitlement to compensation is based on the Vaccine Injury Table the list of vaccines known associated injuries and the time periods in which they must occur If a petitioner suffers a known injury within the short period prescribed by the table it is presumed that a vaccine caused the injury The petitioner is then eligible for compensation without proof of causation This is called a table injury However if a petitioner files for an off table injury an injury not listed on the table or that didn t manifest within the specified time frame the petitioner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the vaccine caused the injury Evidence includes medical records and expert witness testimony Claims must be filed within three years of the first symptom or two years of death This

preponderance of evidence is up to the special master alone to decide Autism is not listed on the vaccine injury table The Omnibus Autism Proceeding They wiped us off the map In 2002 the Office of the Special Masters established the Omnibus Autism Proceeding to address the claims brought by parents who believed the MMR vaccine thimerosal containing vaccines or a combination of both caused their children s autism The omnibus settled on a method where it would apply the findings of six test cases selected by a Petitioners Steering Committee to other similar cases The hearings did not begin until in 2007 five years after the omnibus was convened Estepp contends that the cases took years partly because the DOJ and HHS consistently fought the petitioners lawyers attempts to access basic information like governmental records and data on vaccines and adverse events For example they refused petitioners access to the CDC s Vaccine Safety Datalink where the agency tracks vaccine injuries In the first test case Cedillo v HHS Michelle Cedillo s parents reported that Michelle developed normally until 16 months of age when she was diagnosed with severe autism and profound mental retardation along with other health issues after receiving the MMR vaccine In the Cedillo case Zimmerman had worked with the DOJ to prepare an expert report on behalf of HHS finding that Michelle s autism had likely not been caused by the MMR vaccine Zimmerman later wrote in a 2018 affidavit that he attended the Cedillo hearing and listened to the testimony of Dr Marcel Kinsbourne another world renowned expert in pediatric neurology On that basis Zimmerman stated he decided to clarify his written expert opinion about Michelle concerned it would be taken out of context Zimmerman spoke with DOJ attorneys to clarify that his expert opinion in the Cedillo case was not intended to be a blanket statement as to all children and all medical science according to the 2018 affidavit He specified that advances in science medicine and his own clinical research had led him to believe there were exceptions in which vaccinations could cause autism He also referred the attorneys to a paper he

a possible association between mitochondrial dysfunction vaccinations and regressive autism After communicating this evidence to DOJ attorneys the DOJ dismissed Zimmerman as a witness but continued to use his written opinion as general causation evidence in subsequent cases including Yates case which was the second test case Yates treating neurologist Dr Jean Ronel Corbier testified Yates autism was likely caused by a genetic predisposition combined with an environmental insult in the form of vaccinations administered when Yates was ill a theory of causation similar to the theory developed by Zimmerman in the Poling paper which he shared with DOJ attorneys Yet despite knowing Zimmerman had concluded that in a subset of children like Yates vaccines could cause autism the DOJ intentionally and fraudulently misrepresented Zimmerman s expert testimony in its closing statements in Yates case Hazlehurst alleges The special masters continued to hear the cases They took over two years to issue their decisions In the end the special masters ruled that the causation theories offered in all cases were not convincing They denied the claims of all of the test cases and consequently to all of the families in the omnibus The decisions in the first three of the six test cases were based on the misrepresentation of Zimmerman s testimony but the petitioners did not know about the alleged

confidence in vaccines While the omnibus proceedings were ongoing in 2008 Chief Special Master Gary Golkiewicz addressed the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines on policy concerns related to vaccines He told the commission he was concerned with protecting the vaccine s integrity that is that vaccine s do not cause every injury that follows immunization He contended that generous remuneration to vaccine injured petitioners might weaken public confidence in vaccines It is clear from this address that special masters feel the pressure between compensating vaccine injured petitioners and sustaining public confidence in vaccines according to an article on the proceedings in Hofstra Law Review Many scholars also speculated that if Cedillo were compensated it would have a disastrous impact on the future of the VICP and likely raised concerns for the special masters that a positive outcome for Cedillo and other cases in the omnibus would drive public fear of vaccines and lower vaccination rates They were also aware that finding no causal link between vaccines and autism in such a highly publicized case would bolster public confidence and provide reassurance that the vaccines were safe People were also concerned that if the autism cases were compensated the fund that was used to compensate claims would go bankrupt If they weren t compensated there could be a

compensated there could be a serious possibility that civil lawsuits against manufacturers would begin again The strong language in the special masters rulings helped to preclude that but so did the ruling in the Bruesewitz v Wyeth case Bruesewitz v Wyeth the Supreme Court protects the vaccine market In the very same month that the final omnibus decisions were being rendered the U S Supreme Court announced it would hear the Bruesewitz v Wyeth case to decide whether the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act protects vaccine manufacturers from lawsuits in state court seeking damages for design defects where the design of the drug itself makes it dangerous to consumers The high court agreed to hear a Pennsylvania case involving a lawsuit by the parents of Hannah Bruesewitz who suffered seizures and developmental issues after taking the DPT vaccine in 1992 The vaccine court didn t compensate Hannah s parents so they sued the vaccine manufacturer Wyeth now Pfizer in state court in Pennsylvania one of the few avenues open to parents who wanted to sue vaccine makers In its majority ruling the court interpreted the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 to shield Big Pharma with full immunity from liability for vaccine injuries by ruling that people could no longer sue vaccine makers for injuries caused by design defects The ruling prohibits essentially all vaccine injury lawsuits against Big Pharma In a scathing dissenting opinion Justice Sonia Sotomayer joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg accused the court of imposing its own policy preferences misconstruing the Act and disturbing the careful balance Congress struck between compensating vaccine injured children and stabilizing the childhood vaccine market Sotomayer noted that as Bruesewitz was argued there were 5 000 petitions alleging a causal link between some vaccines and autism spectrum disorder and that Wyeth Pfizer argued that if the court did not find in its favor it could unleash a crushing wave of tort litigation that would bankrupt vaccine manufacturers and deplete vaccine supply This concern underlies many of the policy arguments in respondent s brief and appears to underlie

injury claims for children with autism Most widely publicized was the case of Hannah Poling Poling was the subject of a study co authored by Zimmerman linking her autism to vaccines which the study found exacerbated an underlying mitochondrial condition the same diagnosis given to Yates In 2007 just three weeks after the lead DOJ attorney misrepresented Zimmerman s opinion during the hearing in Hazlehurst the same DOJ attorney submitted a report to the special masters conceding that in the case of Poling v HHS Hannah s regressive encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder i e regressive autism was caused by a vaccine injury based upon a preponderance of the evidence standard In other words the government conceded that Hannah s autism was an off table injury When the Polings sought to make the judgment public the DOJ opposed their motion and amended the report to change the basis of Hannah s injury to a table injury By conceding the case the DOJ was able to remove Hannah s case from the omnibus court documents show her case was going to be designated a test case and also conceal the original finding that vaccines caused her autism A 2011 article in Pace Environmental Law Review showed the VICP compensated approximately 1 300 cases of childhood brain injury In 83 of the cases the child had autism The authors of the study said the program compensated children with autism when the compensation was sought for symptoms associated with autism like encephalopathy or residual seizure disorder but not for autism itself The study authors said at the time

repeatedly misrepresented Zimmerman s opinion and concealed other evidence that emerged during the test case hearings in the omnibus in subsequent cases before multiple courts Hazlehurst said he is asking the court to give this motion the serious attention it deserves At a minimum the court should allow discovery and hold a hearing on this motion Overturning a ruling due to fraud on the court is an extraordinary remedy reserved for extraordinary cases But according to Hazlehurst This motion we filed shows that this indeed is an extraordinary case Hazlehurst said that by forcing people injured

s annual meeting pay a high price tag exceeding six figures to participate He said Schwab built the WEF using an international pay to play model akin to a trade guild or fraternal organization WEF members contribute substantial funds to WEF and in return the WEF members enjoy a seat at the financial table meaning they gain influence and insider information from fellow mega corporations and

transhumanism and corporatism and fascism under the guise of public private partnerships will carry on through his successor whomever that may be Hinchliffe said According to Semafor Schwab didn t name a successor However in the past year the group s executive board led by WEF President Børge Brende a former Norwegian conservative leader has taken full executive responsibility Last year Politico speculated that Brende is a possible successor to Schwab Other names Politico cited include former U K Prime Minister Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde head of the European Central Bank and

significantly He said If current WEF president Børge Brende were to become Schwab s successor we would still get the same tyrannical policies that have always been pushed The WEF will continue to push for the total technocratic takeover of society through the merger of corporation and state the fusion of humans and machines and the Orwellian use of technologies emerging from the so called Fourth

tribunal inferior La sentencia de un tribunal federal de apelación que desestimó a finales de la semana pasada la demanda de censura de contra Facebook interpuesta por Children s Health Defense CHD incluía una opinión discrepante de un juez que afirmaba que el tribunal debería haber tenido en cuenta las pruebas adicionales que CHD presentó desde que interpuso la demanda a finales de 2020 En su

disponibles y que al igual que los materiales presentados por CHD al tribunal de distrito reflejan efectivamente alegaciones fácticas adicionales específicas que CHD propone alegar si se le concede permiso para enmendar en caso de devolución Opinión disidente de Collins también señaló que las interacciones de Meta con el Gobierno respecto a la represión de categorías específicas de discursos relacionados con las vacunas y en particular el discurso de CHD y de su fundador y presidente Robert F Kennedy Jr bastaron para implicar a la Primera Enmienda Según Collins la presión del gobierno sobre Meta se vio respaldada por la amenaza plausible de emprender acciones contra la plataforma es decir despojar a Meta del escudo de inmunidad del que gozan ella y otras plataformas de medios sociales en virtud del artículo 230 de la Ley de Decencia en las Comunicaciones La demanda de CHD presentada en agosto de 2020 y enmendada en diciembre de 2020 acusaba a los Centros para el Control y

CHD presentó una serie de mociones ante el 9º Circuito muchas de las cuales se referían a pruebas obtenidas como parte del proceso de descubrimiento en el caso Misuri y otros contra Biden y otros ahora Murthy y otros contra Biden y otros que indicaban violaciones similares de la Primera Enmienda por parte del gobierno estadounidense y connivencia con las plataformas de medios sociales para censurar contenidos Estas pruebas constituyeron una parte sustancial de la opinión disidente de Collins Sin embargo la mayoría dictaminó que CHD no demostró que la acción estatal influyera en las decisiones de Meta de censurar contenidos de la CHD y de Kennedy entonces presidente y abogado jefe de litigios de la CHD ahora presidente en excedencia CHD no cumplió el primer requisito de la acción estatal porque la fuente del supuesto perjuicio de CHD fue la propia política de censura de Meta no ninguna disposición de la ley federal Las pruebas sugerían que Meta tenía incentivos independientes

que hacen referencia a las pruebas de Murthy y otros contra Biden y otros así como otros casos judiciales que demuestran la interferencia o connivencia del gobierno con plataformas de medios sociales como Meta para censurar las contranarrativas relacionadas con las vacunas La directora general de la CHD Mary Holland dijo a The Defender que estaba satisfecha de que la decisión no fuera unánime Dijo

través de solicitudes de la Ley de Libertad de Información Según el disidente era importante que el tribunal considerara estas pruebas a la luz de las importantes cuestiones constitucionales que se planteaban en este caso Collins escribió En mi opinión dados los importantes intereses de la Primera Enmienda que están en juego en este caso y las considerables dificultades inherentes al intento de descubrir hechos relativos a supuestas interacciones entre bastidores entre Meta y el personal del Gobierno deberíamos ejercer nuestra discrecionalidad a favor de considerar la importancia de las alegaciones adicionales que CHD podría hacer a la luz de estos documentos recientemente disponibles Gran parte de la discrepancia de Collins se centró en la inmunidad legal que el artículo 230 otorga a las plataformas de medios sociales para alojar moderar y eliminar la mayoría de los tipos de contenido de los usuarios Para Collins conferir dicha inmunidad a plataformas como Meta equivale a un vasto poder práctico que Meta ejerce sobre el discurso de millones de personas que descansa en última instancia en un privilegio concedido por el gobierno privilegio al que Meta no tiene derecho constitucionalmente Las plataformas verdaderamente gigantescas de Meta simplemente no podrían existir en nada parecido a su forma actual sin la inmunidad legal que el Gobierno Federal ha concedido a las plataformas de Internet en virtud de Section 230 escribió Collins señalando que las plataformas de medios sociales como Meta son distintas de los editores tradicionales debido a su enorme tamaño Collins escribió Section 230 confiere una inmunidad legal sin la cual Meta no podría operar de forma viable plataformas gigantescas como Facebook e Instagram La responsabilidad potencial por contenido difamatorio por sí sola por no mencionar otras teorías de responsabilidad del anfitrión de la plataforma sería tan aplastante que impediría el funcionamiento de estas plataformas en cualquier cosa que se parezca a su forma actual Y lo que es más importante la inmunidad concedida por Section 230 es puramente un acto de gracia del Congreso porque Meta no tiene ninguna pretensión plausible de derecho

plataformas de medios sociales que pueden albergar billones de mensajes de ser demandadas por cualquiera que afirme sentirse agraviado por la publicación de otra persona sea o no legítima la queja Sin la inmunidad de la Sección 230 otorgada por el gobierno las plataformas de medios sociales como Facebook probablemente no existirían en su forma actual escribió Collins señalando que estas protecciones legales permiten la capacidad misma de Meta de ejercer un poder tan ilimitado para censurar la expresión de tantas decenas de millones de otras personas Según Collins es por su propio diseño una inmunidad creada precisamente para dar a sus beneficiarios la capacidad práctica de censurar el discurso de un gran número de otras personas Cada vez que Meta censura selectivamente la expresión de terceros en sus enormes plataformas está ejerciendo literalmente un poder especial conferido por el gobierno sobre la expresión de millones de otras personas Este poder conferido por el gobierno distingue la demanda de acción estatal de CHD de otros casos similares argumentó Collins Este hecho clave que Meta está ejerciendo efectivamente un poder distintivo conferido por el gobierno sobre el discurso de otros cuando decide si censurar o no y cómo censurar el discurso de terceros en sus vastas plataformas marca una diferencia crucial en el análisis de la acción estatal Las supuestas interacciones de Meta con el Gobierno aquí son suficientes para implicar los derechos de la Primera Enmienda de CHD y de aquellos a los que representa incluido Kennedy El gobierno federal disfrutó de un beneficio directo de la censura de Meta Collins también cuestionó que el gobierno federal tuviera un interés gubernamental en y un beneficio directo de ejercicios específicos de su poder sobre Meta Para Collins las pruebas presentadas por CHD incluidos los nuevos hallazgos del proceso de descubrimiento y los documentos de la Ley de Libertad de Información en otros casos legales eran suficientes para demostrar que el gobierno cruzó claramente este umbral de tres formas distintas y confirman firmemente el interés del gobierno en y el beneficio de muchos de los ejercicios

específicamente contra el discurso de CHD y Kennedy Collins citó un correo electrónico privado enviado por Rob Flaherty ex director de estrategia digital de la Casa Blanca en el que Flaherty se quejaba claramente de que Meta no estaba haciendo lo suficiente para detener a la docena de la desinformación lo que era una clara referencia a CHD y Kennedy The disinfo dozen se refiere a la docena de la desinformación The Disinformation Dozen una lista de personas que se oponían a la narrativa COVID 19 del gobierno y a las políticas relacionadas con las vacunas Las comunicaciones internas de la Casa Blanca revelaron que la Casa Blanca utilizó esta lista elaborada por el Centro para Contrarrestar el Odio Digital Center for Countering Digital Hate para atacar a organizaciones y personas como CHD y Kennedy Según el voto particular de Collins las alegaciones presentadas por CHD también demostraban que Meta trabajó ampliamente con funcionarios del Poder Ejecutivo para ajustar y perfeccionar sus criterios y prácticas con respecto a la limitación o represión de la expresión relacionada con las vacunas No se trataba simplemente de intercambios informativos en los que Meta transmitía sus criterios internos para abordar dicho discurso escribió Collins Más bien Meta entabló un diálogo con funcionarios del Poder Ejecutivo para desarrollar y empezar a aplicar nuevas normativas con respecto al discurso relacionado con la vacuna Covid Collins dijo que el gobierno no era un participante pasivo en estas discusiones Un tercer ejemplo que Collins citó a favor de CHD fue la conclusión de que Meta llegó a crear un portal real en el que funcionarios preseleccionados del gobierno podían iniciar sesión y enviar solicitudes específicas para que se retiraran publicaciones concretas relacionadas con la vacuna Covid un sistema que se extendía al discurso veraz que desalentaba la vacunación Las acciones de Meta y el gobierno federal implican la Primera Enmienda Según Collins el gobierno federal y la administración Biden respaldaron estas acciones con amenazas coercitivas hacia Meta Escribió También es importante señalar que todas estas acciones tuvieron lugar en un contexto de continuas amenazas legislativas a múltiples niveles para limitar o abolir la inmunidad Section 230 de la que depende críticamente la capacidad misma de Meta para operar sus megaplataformas Esto

en ambas cámaras en las que Zuckerberg y otros directores ejecutivos de redes sociales fueron llamados a declarar y las declaraciones amenazando con despojar a Meta de la inmunidad de la Sección 230 Teniendo en cuenta todas estas consideraciones el Gobierno dejó clara su fuerte preferencia por determinados ejercicios del poder de Meta inmunizado por la Sección 230 sobre la expresión de terceros en sus megaplataformas escribió Collins Esta marcada preferencia afectó directamente a la toma de decisiones de Meta según Collins que escribió Consciente de ese interés concreto y de los beneficios que el Gobierno esperaba obtener si se eliminaba dicha expresión Meta trabajó entonces afirmativamente con el Gobierno para perfeccionar las políticas y prácticas de Meta relativas a dicha expresión de forma que resultaran satisfactorias para el Gobierno y pregonó repetidamente al Gobierno sus acciones específicas dirigidas directamente contra CHD y Kennedy En consecuencia Collins escribió que

AP Les États membres de l UE ont chargé la Commission européenne d organiser l achat conjoint de vaccins et de mener les négociations avec les fabricants L ampleur et la rapidité de ces achats étaient sans précédent Selon le tribunal environ 2 7 milliards d euros 2 95 milliards de dollars ont été rapidement mobilisés pour passer des commandes fermes de plus d un milliard de doses de vaccins Cette approche conjointe a permis l acquisition rapide de vaccins pour les 27 États membres de l UE Dans un premier temps Mme von der Leyen a été félicitée pour son leadership lors de la crise du COVID 19

Insider to save this article Sign Up For decades the public has been told there is no evidence that wireless technology is harmful Claims of 5G harms have been dismissed as conspiracy theory A landmark case against the Federal Communication Commission FCC contests these statements and asserts that the harms are proven and that an epidemic of sickness exists Recently the leading environmental and health advocacy organizations that filed the case submitted 11 000 pages of evidence in support of their claims Links to the evidence are provided below The case is being heard by the U S Courts of Appeals of the DC Circuit Oral arguments are scheduled for Jan 25 at 9 30 a m EST The public can listen to it on YouTube In December 2019 the FCC closed an inquiry it initiated in 2013 in which the commission asked the public to submit comments to the inquiry s docket as to whether or not the FCC should review its 1996 health guidelines for Radio Frequency RF radiation emitted by wireless devices and infrastructure About 2 000 comments an exceptionally large number were filed with the FCC These comments were filed by scientists and science organizations such as the BioInitiative and EMF Scientist by doctors and medical organizations by cities such as Boston and Philadelphia and by hundreds of individuals including parents of children who were injured by this technology The comments referenced thousands of studies showing clear and profound evidence of harm Nevertheless the FCC order published on Dec 4 2019 concluded there is no evidence that wireless technology causes harm and no need to review the guidelines The FCC decision didn t provide an analysis of the science disregarded the evidence of sickness and didn t defend its decision with evidence Consequently two lawsuits were filed against the FCC One by the Environmental Health Trust EHT and Consumers for Safe Cell Phones and one by the Children s Health Defense CHD and additional petitioners including Prof David Carpenter who is the co editor of the BioInitiative Report the most comprehensive review of the science by 29 leading scientists and public health experts CHD s case

outbreaks continue to surface the mainstream media is now using them as a political weapon attempting to blame our new U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr for so called anti vaccine rhetoric The Wall Street Journal recently ran an opinion piece insinuating that his advocacy for vaccine safety is responsible for rising measles cases This narrative is not only baseless but ignores decades of documented measles vaccine failures failures that have occurred in highly vaccinated populations all over the world Read the CNN article here The real issue is not a failure to vaccinate but a failing vaccine As this article will demonstrate measles outbreaks have repeatedly occurred in communities with exceeding 95 vaccine coverage proving that the vaccine itself does not provide durable immunity The ongoing effort to scapegoat RFK Jr is simply a distraction from the deeper scientific and historical evidence that challenges the mainstream vaccine narrative A long history of measles vaccine failures For over 25 years outbreaks have been reported in populations with vaccination rates exceeding 95 undermining the mainstream assumption that vaccines are the singular solution to measles control Here is a documented historical record of such vaccine failures 1985 Texas U S A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1987 analyzed a measles outbreak in Corpus Christi Texas where 99 of students were vaccinated and more than 95 were immune The researchers concluded Outbreaks of measles can occur in secondary schools even when more than 99 percent of the students have been vaccinated and more than 95 percent are immune 1985 Montana U S An article in the American Journal of Epidemiology examined an outbreak of 137 measles cases in Montana despite a 98 7 vaccination rate The researchers stated This outbreak suggests that measles transmission may persist in some settings despite appropriate implementation of the current measles elimination strategy 1988 Colorado U S A measles outbreak at a Colorado college infected 84 students even though over 98 had documented immunity due to strict vaccination policies Researchers concluded that measles outbreaks can occur among highly vaccinated college populations 1989 Quebec Canada Initially blamed on low vaccine coverage a study published in the Canadian Journal

South Africa A study in the South African Medical Journal documented an outbreak where 91 of children were vaccinated and vaccine efficacy was only 79 The researchers concluded that primary and secondary vaccine failure contributed to the outbreak These are just a handful of examples from an extensive body of literature documenting measles outbreaks occurring in highly vaccinated populations clear evidence that vaccine induced immunity is neither lifelong nor consistently effective Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Ignoring history won t make vaccine failures disappear Public health officials continue to ignore these well documented failures while insisting that stricter vaccine mandates are the only way to prevent measles However history shows that vaccination does not equal immunization The widespread belief that vaccines alone can eliminate measles is more faith based than evidence based as seen in the knee jerk blame placed on the unvaccinated whenever outbreaks occur Ironically those who highlight peer reviewed evidence of vaccine failures are dismissed as anti vaccine even though they are merely pro truth and pro vaccine awareness The global health agenda led by organizations such as UNICEF and the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation continues to push mass vaccination campaigns while ignoring the real issues poor sanitation malnutrition and compromised immune health The media s attempt to pin measles outbreaks on RFK Jr is not based on science but on political opportunism RFK Jr has consistently advocated for vaccine safety and medical choice principles that are far from anti vaccine If anything his warnings about vaccine induced injuries and failures are validated by the very outbreaks being reported today Measles A disease with real risks and real benefits Measles is a real disease and while it can have serious complications it is largely determined by an individual s immune status Before widespread vaccination campaigns measles was a common childhood illness that conferred lifelong immunity Now due to waning vaccine induced immunity adults who are at higher risk for complications are

California allows Google to avert disclosing how much value news generates for Google s search engine which analysts estimate at 21 billion a year in the U S based on searches using news media content You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Karina Montoya A California Google deal that would provide 250 million for local journalism and an AI artificial intelligence accelerator program was announced by California Gov Gavin Newsom as a major breakthrough to ensure the survival of newsrooms across the state In exchange the state has agreed to kill the California Journalism Protection Act a bill that would have forced the tech giant to share revenues with news publishers and which was deemed to be more transparent than similar legislation in Australia and Canada News publishers and other advocates focusing on the good side of the deal more money have also been cautious about celebrating it Journalists unions and associations have been more straightforward in decrying it Altogether newsrooms are feeling the toll of elongating their survival mode especially if the trade off is to continue handing their future to those who helped create their crisis By eliminating legislation enforcing revenue share agreements California has reduced Google s financial liability compared with Australia and Canada where news outlets including broadcasters are compensated for creating value for Google In addition Google got the state of California to pick up an important portion of the 250 million bill using public funding More significantly the deal allowed the corporation to avert disclosing how much value news generates for Google s search engine which estimates put at 21 billion a year in the U S based on searches using news media content Let s be clear Google is the sole winner of this deal and this should be an example of what not to do to redress power and financial imbalances between news media and large digital platforms If anything it should be a wake up call to the harmful effects of digital monopolies on the news media industry Governments can no longer spare Google and other tech giants from their role in the financial crisis of journalism The recent ruling from a federal district court confirming Google s monopoly over search tells part of this story Although that case didn t address the corporation s impact on newsrooms we learned that Google s grip on advertising demand couldn t have been achieved without a key illegal practice its multibillion dollar contracts with phone makers that were designed to squash rival search engines Today search advertising continues to be the largest channel capturing ad spending in the U S Most importantly this stranglehold enabled Google to constrain media s bargaining power and

Google s search engine newsrooms are beholden to Google s whims for news discoverability and distribution on search results A separate trial starting next week tackling Google s monopoly over advertising technologies ad tech is likely to complete the story of this corporation s role in this crisis The ad tech industry once thought to help news publishers make revenue from digital has become extraordinarily complex opaque and concentrated At the same time it is the backbone that connects advertisers and publishers to buy and sell ads across the web providing an alternative to search and social media ads all of which drive a marketplace worth around 300 billion in the U S alone Besides controlling search ad revenues Google also controls the ad tech platforms upon which most ad sales by news publishers are made Without getting too technical in practice this means Google has eyes on the value of news publishers ad inventory on advertisers preferences and perceptions about those publishers and on the algorithms that connect the two to determine ad prices Also unchallenged Google controls between 50 and 90 of transactions in each layer of this market where it takes a cut of about 35 of each ad dollar spent In the trial the U S Department of Justice DOJ is expected to cut through the ad tech complexity and show how Google has also manipulated ad prices to divert ad dollars away from news publishers into the tech giant s own pockets For the first time in many years in this case the DOJ is seeking a breakup to redress Google s harms As a counterargument Google has been trying to push a story in which a very competitive market already exists since multiple giants in various other sectors Amazon Walmart CVS etc are also competing for ad dollars This view invites us to presume news publishers and journalists must be doing something wrong so what else is there to do but to help them to survive in this brave new world But nothing could be further from the truth

Vaccines to Injury Compensation Program Paul Brundage says he developed a serious blood clotting disorder after receiving a COVID 19 vaccine but can t pursue compensation under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program because HHS failed in its legal obligation to add the shot to the list of vaccines covered under the program You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The U S Department of Health and Human Services violated federal law by failing to add the COVID 19 vaccine to the list of vaccines covered under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP according to a lawsuit filed by a man diagnosed with a severe blood clotting disorder he alleges was caused by the vaccine Paul Brundage filed the lawsuit in January against then U S Health Secretary Xavier Beccera However Becerra s successor Robert F Kennedy Jr became the target of the suit when he was confirmed in February The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 also known as the Vaccine Act requires HHS to add vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC for routine use in children or pregnant women to the Vaccine Injury Table within two years of the CDC s recommendation According to the complaint the two year period has elapsed and Brundage should now be eligible to bring a claim for compensation for his injury in the United States Court of Federal Claims under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP However Brundage is not able to pursue compensation under the VICP because HHS has not added the COVID 19 vaccine to the Vaccine Injury Table the lawsuit states Under the Vaccine Act s Citizen s Action provision citizens may pursue civil action against the HHS secretary where there is alleged a failure of the Secretary to perform any act or duty contained within the Vaccine Act The provision requires claimants to provide 60 days notice to the secretary which the lawsuit states Brundage did in November 2024 The beauty of this provision is that it empowers the average citizen to ask a judge to force the HHS Secretary to take action said Ray Flores senior outside counsel for Children s Health Defense CHD and an expert on vaccine injury compensation cases It even provides for attorney fees Flores said Brundage s lawsuit is not the first or the only pending citizen s action against the HHS In May Flores sued Kennedy for violating the 1986 Vaccine Act which requires HHS to establish a task force dedicated to making childhood vaccines safer and to provide U S Congress with progress reports every two years Since Congress passed the act over 35 years ago no health secretary including Kennedy has convened such a task force or reported to Congress on steps taken toward making vaccines safer CHD is funding", "chunk_id":

vaccines safer CHD is funding the lawsuit HHS must do right by the people seriously injured by COVID vaccine Attorney Altom Maglio of the District of Columbia law firm mctlaw who represents Brundage said he is stumped as to why HHS has not added the COVID vaccine to the Vaccine Injury Table HHS seems to have no real argument as to why the Secretary has failed to do so The goal of this lawsuit is to have the United States do right by the people seriously injured by adverse reactions to the COVID vaccine Maglio said In May under Kennedy HHS filed a motion to dismiss Brundage s lawsuit stating HHS cannot add the COVID 19 vaccines to VICP until Congress adds a 0 75 excise tax to the shots The excise tax levied on vaccines the CDC recommends for children funds VICP payouts for injury claims connected to those vaccines Later in May Brundage responded to HHS motion arguing that the department s claims contradict the requirements outlined in the Vaccine Act The response said other vaccines including hepatitis B and varicella were added to the Vaccine Injury Table before an excise tax was enacted on them In his original complaint Brundage said The Secretary s failure to act is not based on a valid interpretation of the law but on a refusal to comply with it COVID vaccine injury compensation program a bureaucratic black hole The lawsuit demands a court order requiring Kennedy to add the COVID 19 vaccines to the Vaccine Injury Table According to TrialSite News this would unlock access to the VICP s robust legal process full hearings and generous payouts including up to 250 000 for pain and suffering VICP a government run vaccine injury compensation program is separate from the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program CICP which covers COVID 19 vaccines CICP was established

denied 4 338 or are pending review or in review 9 423 Maglio called CICP a bureaucratic black hole The CICP was never intended to handle something like the COVID vaccine It was a compensation scheme drafted back in 2005 for a different purpose It should never have been the only avenue for people injured by the COVID vaccine to obtain compensation for their injuries There is no court judge record due process or right of appeal to the courts For almost all the 13 836 injured people that have filed claims in the CICP it has been a waste of precious time and energy The Biden administration declared the COVID 19 public health emergency over in May 2023 However in December 2024 President Joe Biden extended the liability shield for COVID 19 countermeasures under the PREP Act through the end of 2029 the 12th such extension since 2020 Maglio said the PREP Act s liability shield is almost certainly unconstitutional and that while VICP could certainly be improved it is a far superior

an interview earlier this month during which Kennedy said HHS is looking at ways to expand the VICP and potentially extend the deadline for COVID 19 vaccine injury claimants to file claims In May the CDC changed its recommendations on COVID 19 vaccines for healthy children It now recommends that parents of healthy children consult their pediatricians and together decide whether to vaccinate against the virus As a result of this change Flores said Brundage s lawsuit is likely to be dismissed In a strange quirk of fate the chances for COVID 19 injuries being adjudicated in vaccine court were torpedoed after COVID 19 shots were removed from the recommended childhood schedule on May 27 For a vaccine to be covered by VICP it must be recommended for routine administration to children or pregnant women HHS s reply brief raises this argument convincingly Plaintiff s case against the HHS was strong until the CDC removed the recommendation for healthy children to receive COVID 19 shots Since the success of MCT s lawsuit is contingent upon the CDC s recommendation the case is moot Flores said Brundage first notified Beccera of his intention to file a citizen s action and subsequently filed his lawsuit prematurely When the case was filed on Jan 16 the HHS Secretary still had 24 days to adjust the Table Plaintiff s counsel also sent a premature 60 day warning letter to Secretary

between risk management and others So I think in Louisiana if we prevail we will get the discovery of such evidence It s a different ballgame In the Louisiana case the family of Frank Aaron Walker sued the telecommunications industry alleging the pastor s death from an aggressive brain cancer was brought on by cellphone radiation the health risks of which the industry has known for decades According to the suit the telecommunications industry suppressed credible cell phone safety concerns and has conspired to conceal or alter results of safety studies to make them more market friendly Walker was a 25 year user of cell phone products the suit claims before dying on Dec 31 2020 age 49 following a two year battle with glioblastoma that included extensive radiation chemotherapy and surgery During this two year period Walker experienced severe symptoms including seizures visual auras excessive fatigue migraines light sensitivity memory problems psychological and emotional stress anxiety and depression the lawsuit alleges Similar to the D C case the defendants in the Louisiana lawsuit include several major telecommunications industry players such as AT T Cricket Communications CITA Motorola the Telecommunications Industry Association and ZTE In a 2021 press release issued after the lawsuit was filed Lundy stated For generations the telecom industry has fought the release of scientific studies and information regarding ties between mobile phone use and brain tumors The industry manipulated the science to the detriment of consumers With this lawsuit Mr Walker s family hopes to help reveal the telecom industry s secrets and hold them accountable for harm done to consumers In the same release Lundy alleged the telecommunications industry downplayed understated and or did not state the health hazards and risks", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:childrenshealthdefense.org_defender_lawsuit-cellphone-brain-cancer-jury-trial.txt:2:a72a78696041", "wtk_id":

Louisiana lawsuit also cites a significant number of scientific studies and industry actions taken since the 1980s including the firing defunding or denigration of researchers who discovered adverse effects associated with cell phone use According to the lawsuit At all times herein mentioned Defendants were aware of numerous studies and experiments that demonstrated the health hazards of RF radiation dating back to the late 1940s and continuing to this day yet Defendants have consistently maintained to the public at large that cell phones are absolutely safe The lawsuit alleges scientific and medical research published in peer reviewed literature has demonstrated a correlation between biological effects and the exposure to RF radiation within the radio frequency band of 300 megahertz to 2 4 gigahertz noting however that such peer reviewed journals are not typically read by the general public Radiation exposure standards adopted by the American National Standards Institute ANSI initially in the 1960s and subsequently modified in the 1980s and 1990s excluded cell phones states the lawsuit as the cell phone industry manipulated the research and pressured members

concern over radiation produced by cellular phones increased in the 1990s defendants individually and through their trade associations undertook with public fanfare to fund scientific studies to prove the safety of cell phones resulting in the formation of the Scientific Advisory Group in 1993 Subsequently industry associations CTIA and Telecommunications Industry Association hired an expert Dr George Carlo to direct the Scientific Advisory Group and conduct research into cellular phone radiation However as the lawsuit states When this industry funded research failed to corroborate the industry s claims of safety and in fact presented new evidence supporting health concerns the industry responded by terminating the research funding and publicly disparaging Dr Carlo as well as suppressing and minimizing the results of his studies Nevertheless numerous other scientific studies followed calling into question the industry s claims regarding the safety of their mobile devices These studies are cited in the lawsuit and include A 1995 University of Washington study conducted on rats exposed to radiation similar to the type of radiation emitted from the antenna of a cell phone found the radiation caused damage to DNA The industry funded research that aimed to disprove these fundings but which ultimately confirmed them leading the industry to refuse to publish the results Another scientist who subsequently replicated the DNA damage found by the University of Washington research had his findings suppressed by the industry pressuring him and threatening to withdraw funding A 1996 study of Air Force personnel found those exposed to RF radiation had a risk of brain tumors 1 39 times higher versus those not exposed A 2000 study by Sweden s Orebro Medical Center found the risk of tumors developing on the same side of the head cell phone users hold their cell phones is significantly higher than it is for the other side In 2000 the World Health Organization WHO launched a decade long multinational research study the Interphone Study ultimately finding that the use of cell phones for a period of 10 years or more can increase the risk of

Thursday filed a 250 million lawsuit against the city and Mayor Eric Adams seeking to end the mandate The 72 fired workers are demanding the city overturn the mandate reinstate their jobs and compensate them with punitive damages The workers argue the mandate should be found arbitrary and capricious given that President Joe Biden Governor Kathy Hochul and Senator Chuck Schumer have all declared that the pandemic is over and that it was already rescinded for private sector employees and students according to the lawsuit The lawsuit filed in the Bronx County Supreme Court of the State of New York also alleges the plaintiffs were discriminated against with willful or wanton negligence or recklessness and were mocked and ridiculed by their colleagues Many of the plaintiffs formerly with the New York Police Department NYPD the New York Fire Department the Department of Education the Department of Health and other agencies worked for the city for more than 20 years but now are unemployed have lost their homes and their ability to support their families the lawsuit states Attorney James Mermigis who represents the plaintiffs told The Defender Anybody that goes into the city does not have to be vaccinated except for NYC public sector workers including firemen policemen teachers I just think it is absurd especially once Mayor Adams lifted the mandate for private employees that these people who were heroes during COVID 19 still have the mandate According to the lawsuit Adams admitted I don t think anything dealing with COVID is makes sense sic and there s no logical pathway of what one can do sic The lawsuit also alleges the COVID 19 vaccines don t prevent disease transmission and that it is well established that the risks of vaccination outweigh the benefits It also argues the plaintiffs have immunity from prior infection that should exempt them from any mandate because the scientific community has conclusively established that natural immunity provides strong and durable protection According to the lawsuit the city used a discriminatory practice to coerce intimidate threaten or interfere with Petitioners in their exercise or enjoyment of their

again Mermigis said Landmark win for New York healthcare workers may help city workers Alleging New York City lacked the authority to institute COVID 19 vaccine mandates city workers cited the landmark ruling earlier this month by the New York Supreme court which struck down the state s COVID 19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers In that case which Children s Health Defense CHD financed the court held that the state s health department lacked the authority to impose the mandate In the ruling Judge Gerard Neri declared the mandate null void and of no effect The court also ruled that the state s mandate was arbitrary and capricious on the basis that COVID 19 vaccines do not stop transmission of the virus thereby eliminating any rational basis for such a policy That lawsuit was filed Oct 20 2022 by Medical Professionals for Informed Consent and additional plaintiffs against NYSDOH New York Gov Kathleen C Hochul and Mary T Bassett the state s health commissioner Commenting on the Supreme Court ruling in favor of healthcare workers Mermigis said he believes the decision will help the workers case against the city It puts less pressure on the judge reading our lawsuit knowing that another judge in New York also eliminated a healthcare vaccine mandate Mermigis said Michael Kane CHD s national grassroots organizer and founder of Teachers for Choice said It s historic what Sujata Gibson and CHD were able to do and it s part of the cascading falling dominoes It really feels like it s just a matter of time They will delay as much as they can but public opinion has

Arizona court alleging the agency has the tools to regulate toxic forever chemicals on blueberries lettuce milk and other foods but isn t taking action You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Shannon Kelleher U S regulators are failing to address concerns about toxic per and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS chemicals in foods despite having the scientific tools to do so according to a lawsuit filed by an environmental group in Tucson Arizona The lawsuit filed on Jan 24 in the U S District Court of Arizona follows the submission of a legal petition filed in November 2023 by the Tucson Environmental Justice Task Force that asked the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA to establish limits for certain PFAS the agency has found in blueberries lettuce milk salmon and other foods The group wants the FDA to take action to remove products from grocery store shelves if PFAS residues are found at the minimum level of detection We re asking the FDA to do something that they are required to do under the law that they failed to do under the law said Sandra Daussin attorney for the plaintiffs and a plaintiff herself who worked for over 25 years as a regulatory chemist for agricultural products and environmental protection Under its own regulations the FDA is required to respond to petitions within 180 days but the agency failed to address the petition after more than a year an arbitrary and capricious delay the complaint alleges PFAS are a class of thousands of chemicals used for decades across many industries The chemicals have become ubiquitous in the environment found in water soil and the blood of animals and people around the globe Many types of PFAS have been found to be health hazards linked to disease and disability The petition cites connections between seven types of PFAS and serious life threatening health effects including kidney and liver damage cancer neurotoxicity immunotoxicity and adverse reproductive effects The petitioners argue that in August 2023 the FDA developed a validated method for detecting up to 30 PFAS chemicals in foods and thus has an obligation to use that knowledge to set enforceable limits The group wants the FDA to adjust those limits to be lower ifthe methodology improves to detect smaller concentrations The FDA has been testing foods for PFAS contamination since 2019 but so far says it has found very little contamination Mark Moorman director of FDA s Office of Food Safety acknowledged the petition in an April 2024 letter but said that the FDA had not yet reached a decision due to competing agency

that are not directly related to emergencies or critical to preserving health under the new Trump administration Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us The lawsuit comes after the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA withdrew a draft rule that proposed setting limits on PFAS in industrial discharge following an executive order from the new Trump administration on Jan 20 that put a freeze on new federal regulations pending review PFAS discharged into waterways can contaminate drinking water and soil where crops are grown Last year the EPA finalized the first legally enforceable limits for six PFAS chemicals in drinking water while in February 2024 the FDA announced it is eliminating the sale of food packaging that contains PFAS FDA testing of food for PFAS is ongoing but as of April 2024 the agency had tested almost 1 300 food samples for PFAS according to the FDA s website In a set of 92 samples collected from one region the agency reported finding PFAS in six samples including beef shrimp and fish In an April 2024 update the agency said that exposure to PFAS at the levels it measured in these samples is not likely to be a health concern for young children or the general population based on evaluation of each PFAS for which there is a toxicological reference value adding that no PFAS has been detected in 97 of foods tested through the study to

finding two particularly harmful PFAS chemicals PFOS and PFOA in six samples The results of our limited spot check don t and can t show that our food supply is dangerously contaminated or that all milk contains the toxic chemicals Consumer Reports said in a statement But the results also raised some red flags The levels of those two PFAS were higher than previously found in limited sampling by the FDA and high enough that in the European Union they would have triggered investigations As the new Trump administration begins it s anybody s guess whether or not the FDA will fulfill the petition s request to set limits on PFAS in foods said Daussin In reality this aligns quite well with this idea of let s make America healthy again she said referring to the agenda of Robert F Kennedy Jr

proxy to illegally censor free speech The complaint cites the now weekly ongoing disclosures of secret communications between social media companies and federal officials in the Twitter files other

Vaccine Safety U S Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr is accused of violating requirements of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 which includes promoting the development of safer vaccines The lawsuit filed by attorney Ray Flores is funded by Children s Health Defense You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Attorney Ray Flores is suing U S Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr for failing to establish a task force dedicated to making childhood vaccines safer as mandated by federal law The lawsuit alleges Kennedy is violating the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 which requires the secretary of the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS to promote the development of safer childhood vaccines that cause fewer and less serious adverse reactions than existing ones The act requires HHS to establish a task force that includes the health secretary the commissioner of the U S Food and Drug Administration the directors of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC It also requires the health secretary to provide Congress with progress reports every two years Since the U S Congress passed the act over 35 years ago no health secretary including Kennedy has reported to Congress on steps taken toward making vaccines safer Flores said in the complaint that because more than 100 days have passed since the Trump administration took office any grace period for Mr Kennedy to rectify the failure of his predecessors has ended Mary Holland CEO of Children s Health Defense which is funding the lawsuit said it is blackletter law that the HHS secretary must convene a task force on how to make vaccines safer This is part of the 1986 act itself she said That no secretary has done so since the passage of this law is a blow to the rule of law I hope and trust that the current secretary will fulfill his obligation to Congress s mandate Flores said the 1986 act includes a broad provision allowing citizens to sue the secretary if the requirements are not met His lawsuit asks the court to compel Kennedy to comply with the mandate to set up a task force and submit biennial reports to Congress Flores told The Defender it was astonishing that HHS hasn t fulfilled its responsibility to make vaccines safer Perhaps a little encouragement from a federal judge will help move this along he said Kennedy filed a similar lawsuit against HHS when he was a practicing attorney Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act after a crisis in the late 1970s and early

children Between 1980 and 1986 people injured by vaccines filed more than 3 billion worth of damage claims with U S civil courts against vaccine manufacturers most of which were for the DTP vaccines After lawsuits revealed that Wyeth knew of the risks juries began authorizing large payouts to some DTP injured children The payouts threatened to bankrupt the vaccine insurance industry The publicity also generated public concerns about vaccine adverse events In 1986 Congress passed the law giving the pharmaceutical industry broad protection from liability and creating a framework to compensate children injured by compulsory vaccines The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP a no fault administrative system adjudicates vaccine injury claims Although it is notoriously difficult to win compensation in the VICP it has paid out over 5 2 billion to injury victims since its inception Flores lawsuit alleges the number would be significantly higher if vaccine manufacturers had to defend themselves in federal court rather than in the VICP A lesser known part of the 1986 law mandated the pursuit of safer vaccines and the establishment of the task force Like the VICP this aspect of the law has long been a point of controversy In 2018 when Kennedy worked as a lawyer he and co counsel Aaron Siri filed a lawsuit against HHS in a New York district court seeking copies of the biennial reports after the agency failed to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests Kennedy s lawsuit revealed that no reports were ever submitted HHS created the first task force in 1990 but

Motorola AT T and other telecommunications companies The lawsuit filed April 8 alleges the cancer was caused by exposure to cell phones radiation and that the telecommunications industry has engaged for decades in fraudulent practices to hide the health risks of cell phone radiation The lawsuit was brought by the widow and two sons of Frank Aaron Walker a pastor teacher and musician from Louisiana Mr Walker who used cell phones for 25 years was diagnosed with glioblastoma brain cancer in January 2019 Walker died Dec 31 2020 at the age of 49 after a two year battle with this cancer The case April Marie Walker et al v Motorola Mobility LLC et al was filed in the U S District Court for the Western District of Louisiana The family is represented by Lundy Lundy Soileau South LLP one of the leading personal injury law firms in the country and by Robert F Kennedy Jr chairman and chief legal counsel for Children s Health Defense CHD The defendants in the case include Motorola Mobility LLC Motorola Solutions Inc Motorola Inc AT T Mobility LLC ZTE Corp Cricket Communications LLC HMD Global Oy the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association and the Cellular Telecommunications

defendants of fraud unfair trade practices design defects inadequate warning and misrepresentation among other state and federal causes of action CTIA played leading role in defrauding public The plaintiffs claim that the wireless lobby associations the CTIA and the Telecom Industry Association have been at the forefront of the cell phone industry s bad faith and deceptive public relations

cause cancer including U S government studies The Plaintiffs allege that the telecom industry has misrepresented the scientific evidence suppressed credible evidence and concerns and has conspired to conceal or alter results of studies The lawsuit claims that researchers who discovered adverse effects associated with cell phone use lost their funding were fired found their reputation damaged and had their work denigrated The Complaint provides evidence of such industry actions stretching over decades For example in 1994 Henry Lai Ph D presented to the CTIA Motorola and other telecommunication companies the findings of a series of experiments he conducted showing DNA damage from radiation similar to that emitted by cell phones The lawsuit claims instead of disclosing the findings to the public the defendants conspired to war game Lai and his studies results attempted to prevent their publication and hired a public relations firm to discredit the findings According to the lawsuit the defendants then funded other researchers in an effort to disprove Lai s findings However when the defendants own research confirmed Lai s findings the defendants refused to publish the research For example when Jerry L Phillips Ph D wanted to publish his study which essentially replicated Lai s studies and reached the same conclusions Motorola which funded the study pressured him not to publish and threatened to withdraw funding When Phillips refused to allow Motorola to spin his research Motorola cut Phillips funding and threatened to discredit him in the scientific community Patent applications show industry knew of potential harms The lawsuit claims not only were the defendants aware of the mounting studies demonstrating adverse health effects caused by cell phones they were also aware of solutions that could reduce the risk of harms To support their claims the plaintiffs provided a list of patents for cell phone safety devices obtained by the defendants Even though these

note that a series of court decisions held that section 704 of the 1996 Telecommunication Act preempts state tort laws allowing lawsuits for damages for personal injury from cell phones cell towers and other personal devices In Murray et al the court held that only those who started to use cell phones prior to 1996 could bring personal injury lawsuits Defendants ask court to disallow expert s testimony The most recent development in the Murray cases took place in March when the plaintiffs filed a 176 page expert opinion by Dr Christopher Portier who was director of the National Center for Environment Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Prior to his appointment at the CDC Portier was associate director of the National Institute for Health and Environmental

opinion and post 2013 evidence from being admitted in the Murray cases According to the Walker lawsuit since IARC s 2011 decision to classify RF radiation as a 2B possible carcinogen more than 1 000 studies have been published showing extensive harms from this radiation including studies that establish causal mechanisms of harm DNA damage and carcinogenic effects Especially important to the brain tumor cases is the publication in 2018 and 2019 of the results of the U S government 30 Million NTP study which found clear evidence that cell phones cause cancer and DNA damage The NTP is the expert agency on toxic agents The Walker lawsuit quotes Dr Ron Melnick who led the design of the NTP study who stated that the NTP results should put to rest the old argument that RF radiation cannot cause DNA damage The results of the NTP study were replicated in another study by the renowned Ramazzini Institute The results of these two large scale studies are especially important because when IARC in 2011 classified cell phone radiation as a 2B possible carcinogen the agency explained that while there is epidemiological evidence that cell phones increase cancer risk especially of brain tumors more animal studies were needed to determine if the agency should assign a higher classification The NTP study and the Ramazzini Institute study provide the missing link for a classification of a human

of ultraprocessed foods The lawsuit presents evidence from scientific studies finding that childhood diseases such as obesity skyrocketed with the advent and wide availability of such foods According to Reuters Martinez s lawyers from Morgan Morgan a prominent personal injury firm described the lawsuit as the first of its kind The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the lawsuit was two years in

regulators to promote deliberate lies about the impact of their ingredients on our health We don t have a free market when it comes to food we have a rigged market Litigation like this is a great tool to rebalance the harm processed food makers have inflicted on American children Pediatrician Dr Michelle Perro author of What s Making Our Children Sick How Industrial Food Is Causing an Epidemic of Chronic Illness and What Parents and Doctors Can Do About It told The Defender The food industry has neuroscientists designing their addictive cocktails that have a combination of fats salt sugar and palatants flavor enhancers to create junk food addictions in our youth Perro said this was evident in Martinez s diet which was unfortunately filled with toxicants some known to cause non alcoholic fatty liver disease such as glyphosate which can progress to advanced and irreversible forms of liver disease Unfortunately the food additive emulsifiers added to ultraprocessed foods are also known to cause Type 2 diabetes Perro added The lawsuit calls UPF industrially produced edible substances that are imitations of food and which consist of former foods that have been fractioned into substances chemically modified combined with additives and then reassembled using industrial techniques such as molding extrusion and pressurization The lawsuit adds UPF are alien to prior human

increased 168 3 since 2017 in part due to overconsumption of processed foods Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Big Tobacco took over the American food environment The lawsuit drew parallels between Big Food and Big Tobacco arguing that the food industry adopted the manufacturing and marketing tactics of the tobacco industry to make UPF appealing and addictive to children In the 1980s Big Tobacco took over the American food environment the lawsuit states Collectively Phillip Morris and RJ Reynolds dominated the US food system for decades During this time they used their cigarette playbook to fill our food environment with addictive substances that are aggressively marketed to children and minorities According to the lawsuit the manufacturing process for UPF was guided by the same tobacco company scientists and the same kind of brain research on sensory perceptions physiological psychology and chemical senses that were used to increase the addictiveness of cigarettes In doing so Big Tobacco companies intentionally designed UPF to hack the physiological structures of our brains the lawsuit states At a press conference Tuesday Rocha and other attorneys representing Martinez repeated these claims comparing the lawsuit to those that challenged tobacco companies in the 1990s over the dangers and addictiveness of their products They used the same kind of marketing tactics that they had used to sell cigarettes to children and converted that to sell these types of foods to children as well Rocha said at the press conference The lawsuit noted that 12

without jobs New York City s mayor plans to fire thousands of municipal workers today for refusing to comply with the city s COVID vaccine mandates in what will arguably be the nation s most extreme example of a workforce reduction tied to a vaccine requirement A motion for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order were filed today asking a federal district court to intervene and prohibit the enforcement of the mandates while a lawsuit alleging the city violated the constitutional rights of workers by denying them religious exemptions to the vaccine requirement is before the U S Supreme Court on an emergency petition According to The New York Times Mayor Eric Adams reaffirmed that a vaccine mandate was put in place by his predecessor Bill de Blasio requiring city workers to get vaccinated or lose their jobs About 4 000 unvaccinated employees in New York City including police officers teachers and firefighters face termination Most if not all had applied for religious exemptions This includes 3 000 workers who took unpaid leave instead of getting vaccinated when the city s mandate went into effect in October 2021 and 1 000 recent hires who failed to submit documentation of their second shots In a press conference Thursday Adams characterized the employees termination as quitting saying that they re choosing to leave their jobs by not following the rules We have to be very clear people must be vaccinated if they are New York City employees Adams said Everyone understood that We are not firing them he added People are quitting The responsibility is clear According to the complaint on July 21 2021 New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a Vax or Test policy for the folks who work in our public hospitals and clinics De Blasio said people either needed to get vaccinated or get tested once every week It s a fair choice he said Two weeks after issuing the Vax or Test mandate for all municipal workers the city enacted new requirements

individuals Plaintiffs allege that as the city began implementing the mandates de Blasio admitted during a press conference he intended to discriminate against employees with unorthodox or personally held religious beliefs stating whether one was entitled to religious exemption was not based on their individual beliefs but whether one is a standing member of a faith that has a very very specific long standing objection The complaint alleges the city went a step further and codified its ideas about what constitutes a valid religious objection to vaccines into a written policy that discriminated against unorthodox beliefs implemented through what can only be described as heresy inquisitions with government officials zealously advocating denial of accommodation because the Pope does not agree with the applicant s interpretation of what her faith required of her Although the Second Circuit said the policies were blatantly unconstitutional the city did not revise them but created a second policy one for the heretics and one for the lucky few whose religious views lined up with state approved religions and dogma Plaintiffs claim this was a violation of their fundamental rights According to Bloomberg more than two dozen unions filed lawsuits this week over the requirement for municipal workers including the Police Benevolent Association United Federation of Teachers and Uniformed Fire Officers Association Other unions took legal action when the city first announced its mandates De Blasio s administration negotiated an agreement with some groups allowing members

four years Before winning approval of its COVID 19 vaccine Moderna had never successfully brought a product to market Investigative journalist Whitney Webb reported that without that authorization and

healthy children and pregnant women The announcement sparked confusion as the changes weren t yet visible on the CDC website The agency subsequently changed what previously was a universal

17 years who are not moderately immunocompromised On Monday Hughes said at a news conference that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Kennedy are asking the court to order the secretary to announce

Case A three judge panel late Tuesday heard oral arguments in the landmark censorship case Kennedy et al v Biden et al The judges must decide if Robert F Kennedy Jr and Children s Health Defense have standing to sue the Biden administration for colluding with social media companies to censor constitutionally protected speech You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The 5th Circuit U S Court of Appeals late Tuesday heard oral arguments in the landmark censorship case Kennedy et al v Biden et al The hearing focused on two points Kim Mack Rosenberg Children s Health Defense CHD general counsel told The Defender First the 5th Circuit is considering whether to uphold a lower court s August decision that two of the three plaintiffs Robert F Kennedy Jr and CHD have legal standing to bring the suit Second it s considering whether to uphold the Lousiana court s injunction which would prohibit the Biden administration from coordinating with social media companies to censor Kennedy and CHD s social media posts until the lawsuit is settled The case brought by Kennedy CHD and news consumer Connie Sampognaro alleges that President Joe Biden Dr Anthony Fauci and other top administration officials and federal agencies waged a systematic concerted campaign to compel the nation s three largest social media companies to censor constitutionally protected speech During Tuesday s hearing Jed Rubenfeld Yale law professor and attorney for the plaintiffs told judges District court called this the most massive attack on free speech in this nation s history and it would be shocking if no plaintiff in the country had standing to challenge it Standing is the legal doctrine that requires plaintiffs to be able to show they have suffered direct and concrete injuries and that those injuries could be resolved in court The issue of standing shut down another related government censorship case Murthy v Missouri The plaintiffs in Murthy v Missouri the states of Missouri and Arkansas Drs Jay Bhattacharya Martin Kulldorff and Aaron Kheriaty The Gateway Pundit s Jim Hoft and health activist Jill Hines argued that the censorship they experienced on social media could be tied to government action and that they were likely to be censored in the future In June the U S Supreme Court ruled the plaintiffs didn t have standing to bring their case The Murthy originally Missouri et al v Biden et al and Kennedy v Biden cases were consolidated because they shared common legal and factual issues This allowed them to share processes such as discovery of evidence However

s decision in Murthy v Missouri in the forefront on the issue of standing we believe that the plaintiffs in our action have clearly demonstrated standing more than sufficient to meet the requirements the Supreme Court described in Murthy in June Mack Rosenberg said there is clear evidence that plaintiffs Kennedy and CHD were specific targets of censorship and that they continue to be censored CHD in particular continues to be deplatformed from major social media sites with no end in sight She said the facts demonstrate that the injunction issued by Judge Doughty was appropriate given the circumstances and the government s continued actions Legal battle has dragged on for over a year Tuesday s hearing was the latest development in a class action lawsuit brought by Kennedy CHD and Sampognaro on behalf of more than 80 of U S adults who access news from online news aggregators and social media companies primarily Facebook YouTube and Twitter The suit was filed on March 24 2023 in the U S District Court for the Western District of Louisiana The case alleged that key officials and federal agencies in the Biden administration violated the plaintiffs First Amendment rights by censoring online speech disfavored by the government According to the complaint the federal government s censorship campaign has repeatedly systematically and very successfully targeted constitutionally protected speech on the basis of its content and viewpoint Nearly a year later U S District Judge Terry Doughty issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting key Biden administration officials and agencies from coercing or significantly encouraging social media platforms to suppress or censor online content containing protected free speech However Doughty stayed the injunction until the U S Supreme Court ruled on a similar injunction in the Murthy v Missouri case After the Supreme Court on June 26 ruled in favor of the Biden administration in Murthy v Missouri Doughty on July 9 denied two motions by lawyers for the Biden administration seeking to overturn the preliminary injunction which was set to take effect July 7 Less than 24 hours later Biden administration lawyers filed an emergency motion with the 5th Circuit seeking to block the injunction The 5th Circuit on July 25 sent the case back to the Louisiana District Court to decide if Kennedy CHD and

Sampognaro does not have standing Lawyers disagree on whether plaintiffs have standing In Tuesday s hearing U S Department of Justice DOJ attorney Daniel Tenny argued on behalf of the defendants saying that the Murthy v Missouri decision foreclosed the plaintiffs theories on why the plaintiffs have standing Rubenfeld disagreed saying that Kennedy v Biden plaintiffs differ in key ways from the Murthy plaintiffs First unlike the Murthy plaintiffs the Kennedy v Biden plaintiffs have a specific causation finding meaning there is clear evidence that government defendants through threats caused the deplatforming and censorship that they suffered Second the Kennedy v Biden plaintiffs have evidence of ongoing injury not just past injury CHD s deplatforming which happened a couple of years ago is exactly the same right now unchanged in status as it was then In other words the government defendants are directly responsible for the injury that CHD is currently suffering Number three Rubenfeld said we have specific evidence of in the event of a favorable ruling from this court a significant increase in the likelihood of our plaintiffs receiving relief That s the established test for redressability he said Redressability means that the plaintiffs alleged injuries are likely to be redressed if the court grants the relief the plaintiffs are seeking Right now there is zero likelihood that CHD will get relief Rubenfeld said CHD has been litigating against Facebook for years They have not reinstated them If the 5th Circuit issues a ruling that Facebook s actions were likely unconstitutional and that will likely be unconstitutional if Facebook keeps on doing it that changes Facebook s incentive and that increases the likelihood that CHD will be reinstated In their brief plaintiffs attorneys also argued that Sampognaro who is potentially immunocompromised has what s called right to listen standing because she needs access to accurate information about COVID 19 and

en raison des allégations selon lesquelles le plan autoriserait la vaccination forcée Les experts ont déclaré que les affirmations alarmistes concernant de nouveaux pouvoirs autoritaires sont inexactes mais que le plan pourrait préfigurer une prochaine pandémie et qu il est impératif de tenir un débat public Le mois dernier Health New Zealand a annoncé une mise à jour provisoire de son plan de lutte contre la pandémie qui selon les médias prévoit de donner au gouvernement de nouveaux pouvoirs pour imposer des vaccins en recourant à la force si nécessaire au cas où l Organisation mondiale de la santé OMS annoncerait une nouvelle pandémie Cette annonce a déclenché un tollé sur les réseaux sociaux et une série d articles sur Substack ZeroHedge et d autres sites décriant les nouveaux pouvoirs du gouvernement Cependant l avocate néo zélandaise Kirsten Murfitt qui a participé aux efforts visant à empêcher le pays de signer le traité de l OMS sur la pandémie a déclaré au Defender que les dispositions du plan de lutte contre la pandémie qui suscitent l inquiétude ne sont pas nouvelles et que les interprétations qui ont circulé étaient faussées Le nouveau plan qui met à jour le plan existant de 2017 intègre les leçons tirées de la réponse à la pandémie COVID 19 Les critiques ont déclaré que les nouvelles leçons ont été incorporées avant même que la Commission royale d enquête sur la réponse à la pandémie COVID 19 n ait terminé son enquête Les principaux changements sont l élargissement du champ d application du plan aux agents pathogènes de type respiratoire à potentiel pandémique la mise en conformité du plan avec les changements législatifs intervenus en 2022 et la clarification du rôle de Health New Zealand et du ministère de la santé selon l Analysis Policy Observatory une plateforme de recherche politique à but non lucratif Mais le plan fait également référence à des actions autorisées par un certain nombre de lois néo zélandaises en vigueur

fonctions autorisées Il est important de reconnaître dit elle dans un autre billet sur X que malgré ce langage inquiétant il n y a pas de traitement obligatoire pour les maladies infectieuses et à déclaration obligatoire en Nouvelle Zélande dans le cadre du dernier plan de lutte contre la pandémie La loi sur la santé de 1956 précise que les fonctions autorisées d un médecin conseil comprennent des éléments tels que l orientation d une personne présentant un risque pour la santé publique mais en aucun cas une orientation ne peut exiger d une personne qu elle se soumette à un traitement obligatoire La même interdiction de traitement obligatoire s applique aux personnes qui ont été exposées à une personne présentant un risque pour la santé publique a déclaré Murfitt sur X Les pouvoirs prévus dans le nouveau plan sont les mêmes que ceux qui existaient auparavant y compris les pouvoirs déployés pendant la pandémie de COVID 19 tels que le dépistage obligatoire la quarantaine et l interdiction d entrée dans le pays pour les personnes non vaccinées La limitation des pouvoirs des responsables de la santé publique a t elle déclaré est sans aucun doute la raison pour laquelle des mandats ont été utilisés pour le déploiement des vaccins au lieu de vaccinations obligatoires Il est toutefois possible que le Parlement modifie la législation à l avenir écrit elle Il est important de prendre le temps d analyser les détails avant de tirer la sonnette d alarme a écrit M Murfitt sur X Nous avons traversé beaucoup d épreuves depuis 2020 et nous savons qu ils peuvent répéter ce qui

demandé comment le gouvernement pouvait délivrer un document validant toutes ses actions alors qu il n a pas conclu ses enquêtes sur la manière dont ces actions se sont déroulées Il a suggéré que cela pouvait être dû au fait que le commissaire en chef de l enquête était lui même impliqué dans l élaboration des politiques de réponse à la pandémie COVID 19 Le plan affirme également que les pandémies sont d origine zoonotique qualifie les vaccins COVID 19 de sûrs et efficaces et n aborde aucune des questions liées à la surmortalité actuelle ou aux effets secondaires des vaccins a conclu M Hatchard

indésirables des vaccins VAERS a montré que près de 80 des décès signalés au système entre 1990 et 2019 sont survenus dans les sept jours suivant la vaccination Plus récemment lors du confinement du COVID 19 les taux de vaccination ont chuté en raison de l annulation des visites médicales de routine et en même temps le nombre de décès dus au syndrome de mort subite du nourrisson a aussi chuté Une étude récente évaluée par des pairs a mis en évidence une corrélation statistique positive entre les taux de mortalité infantile TMI et le nombre de doses de vaccin reçues par les bébés confirmant les résultats obtenus par les mêmes chercheurs il y a une dizaine d années L étude Health Affairs de 2018 indique que la bifurcation entre les taux de mortalité des États Unis et ceux des autres pays riches a commencé dans les années 1980 à l époque où le pays a connu une forte augmentation de la vaccination des enfants Les chercheurs en mortalité infantile ont également noté que les morts subites et inexpliquées chez les enfants de plus d un an sont souvent sous estimées et que de nombreux décès d enfants restent inexpliqués en raison de l incapacité à comprendre ou à rechercher les causes de

been 66 confirmed bird flu cases in the U S all but one of which caused only mild illness and there have been no reports of human to human transmission of the virus You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A leading public health figure has called on the Biden administration to authorize a bird flu vaccine and ramp up testing for the virus across the U S During a Dec 29 2024 interview on CBS News Face the Nation Dr Leana Wen the former commissioner of the Baltimore City Health Department and a professor of public health at George Washington University accused the outgoing Biden administration of not doing enough to address the bird flu outbreak I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren t testing it doesn t mean that the virus isn t there It just means that we aren t looking for it We should be having rapid tests home tests available to all farm workers to their families for the clinicians taking care of them Wen said There have been 66 confirmed bird flu cases in the U S all but one of which caused only mild illness The first severe human infection in the U S was recorded on Dec 18 in a Louisiana man over the age of 65 who was exposed to a backyard flock NBC News reported According to The New York Times bird flu samples from the patient revealed concerning mutations of the virus During her appearance on Face the Nation Wen criticized the lack of availability of a bird flu vaccine There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1 The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses of the vaccine However they have not asked the FDA U S Food and Drug Administration to authorize the vaccine Wen said She suggested the Biden administration take quick action to approve the vaccine before the Trump administration takes office later this month They could get this authorized now and also get the vaccine out to farm workers and to vulnerable people I think that s the right approach because we don t know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu Wen said Wen suggested the Trump administration would seek additional evidence of the vaccine s effectiveness before authorizing it I don t want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence Look evidence is always good and facts are always good New research is always good But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe as we could be having for bird flu the way that we had for COVID Wen", "chunk_id":

potential confirmation of Robert F Kennedy Jr President elect Donald Trump s nominee for secretary of the U S Department of Health and Human Services might pose obstacles to the authorization of a bird flu vaccine She said Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti vaccine In fact he s been one of the leading anti vaccine advocates in the country if not in the world over the last couple of decades He s also someone who has made his career from being an activist and not a scientist it s very concerning to have someone who doesn t believe in how science works in basic scientific principles to be in charge of our nation s preeminent scientific and medical agencies Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Cardiologist Dr Peter McCullough told The Defender that Wen is following the COVID 19 playbook pushing fear and rushed approval of unsafe vaccines Our farm dairy and poultry workers should be outfitted with nasal throat sprays gargles and contagion kits if there are baseline risk factors for severe disease McCullough said Sadly the poultry to human transmission is occurring when the workers are ordered to cull or mass kill the chickens Wen previously was an outspoken advocate of COVID 19 vaccines and restrictions In a July 2021 NPR interview she expressed her hope that the Biden administration at this point really gets behind vaccine mandates adding that the government ended masking requirements too abruptly and prematurely In March 2023 Wen told CNN that COVID 19 misinformation led to declining public trust in medical science As recently as September 2024 Wen advised the public to get COVID 19 boosters Wen s remarks mirrored those of other public health experts Dr Deborah Birx the White House coronavirus response coordinator under then President Donald Trump told CNN last week We kind of have our head in the sand about how widespread this is from the zoonotic standpoint from the animal to human standpoint The Centers for

in Southern California Epidemiologist Nicholas Hulscher told The Defender the bird flu vaccine that s been developed poses a greater risk to the public than the virus itself The bird flu vaccine that Dr Wen wants approved for humans is called AUDENZ made by CSL Seqirus Humans injected with AUDENZ died at a rate of 1 in 200 0 5 compared to 0 1 in the placebo group in one of the clinical trials Study 3 Hulscher said The AUDENZ vaccine doesn t cover the current circulating strain of bird flu meaning it would likely be highly ineffective and promote the emergence of mutant strains Hulscher

and she described the latest cases as one more sign that the drum beat of bird flu coming closer to humans is becoming a major threat It hasn t been a major issue in humans because while it spreads among birds it hasn t really spread among mammals But now there is this mutation and there s another concern now which is that we re in flu season and it s possible that a single person could have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time Wen said According to Wen The viruses could exchange genes You could develop a new hybrid virus and if you now have a virus that s more contagious and causes more severe disease that s when it becomes a major threat to humankind Wen said that in prior bird flu outbreaks the mortality was 52 arguing that while cases during the current outbreak have been mild this could change when bird flu affects more vulnerable individuals Yet there are no reports of person to person transmission and no signs that the virus has changed to spread more easily among

Research Foundation avec l aide de la pathologiste Clare Craig a comparé les marques de vaccins en analysant les données individuelles de plus de 10 millions d habitants de la République tchèque M Kirsch a obtenu ces données à la suite d une demande d un citoyen tchèque au titre de la loi sur la liberté de l information Freedom of Information Act Les données sur les personnes vaccinées comprenaient le fabricant du vaccin la date de vaccination le numéro de lot et le code de chaque personne M Kirsch a pu analyser les dossiers médicaux des patients au fil du temps en déterminant quelles personnes avaient reçu une deux ou trois doses d un vaccin d un fabricant donné et si elles étaient décédées au cours de l année suivante Il a calculé et comparé le taux de mortalité global dans le groupe Moderna et dans le groupe Pfizer et a constaté qu à tous les âges il y avait plus de décès dans le groupe Moderna Il a également constaté que la différence entre les taux de mortalité était statistiquement significative dans toutes les tranches d âge étudiées Cependant le pourcentage d augmentation du risque augmente à mesure que les personnes sont plus jeunes Son analyse a porté sur des personnes âgées de 40 à 90 ans selon ses graphiques Kirsch a indiqué par exemple que les personnes âgées de 46 à 69 ans ayant reçu deux doses du vaccin Moderna avaient un risque de décès dans l année supérieur de plus de 50 à celui des personnes ayant reçu deux doses du vaccin Pfizer Il a également écrit que les données montrent que le vaccin de Pfizer n est pas du tout adapté à une

critique du biostatisticien de l Université de Pennsylvanie Jeffrey Morris Ph D à qui Kirsch a demandé de commenter Morris a déclaré que l analyse ne tenait pas compte des variables confusionnelles possibles Kirsch a rétorqué qu aucun facteur de confusion ne pouvait expliquer cette différence et a mis les chercheurs ou les gouvernements au défi de l expliquer Denis Rancourt docteur en médecine chercheur sur la mortalité toutes causes confondues et ancien professeur de physique à l université d Ottawa au Canada qui a réalisé des analyses approfondies pays par pays du lien entre l introduction des vaccins et la mortalité toutes causes confondues a également déclaré au Défenseur que l analyse de M Kirsch présentait des limites systématiques Par exemple il a indiqué que la République tchèque avait connu des pics importants de surmortalité au cours de la période COVID 19 dont beaucoup n étaient pas liés aux vaccins parce qu ils s étaient produits de manière complexe avant les campagnes de vaccination Cela suggère qu il existe d autres mécanismes de mortalité comme les protocoles de traitement COVID 19 les fermetures ou d autres problèmes a déclaré M Rancourt La manière dont les vaccins des différents fabricants ont été introduits varie également Par exemple le vaccin d un fabricant peut avoir été distribué plus tôt ou plus tard lors d un pic de la vague de mortalité toutes causes confondues lié à plusieurs facteurs différents Dans l analyse de Kirsch ce décès serait attribué à un vaccin même s il a pu être causé par des facteurs sans rapport avec le vaccin Selon Rancourt il y a un élément temporel important que l analyse de Kirsch ne prend pas en compte Le moment où les personnes sont vaccinées et celui où elles meurent au cours d une vague de

personnes plus susceptibles de mourir dans chaque groupe d âge et tout au long de la période il s agit alors de preuves irréfutables que ce médicament était plus mortel écrit elle Toutefois M Rancourt a fait remarquer que les vaccins ne sont pas distribués au hasard Différents fabricants sont lancés à des moments différents et sont même utilisés pour différents groupes de personnes a t il déclaré Il n y a donc aucune raison de supposer que les deux fabricants ont été proportionnellement déployés de manière synchronisée Au contraire les différences entre les déploiements devraient être prises en compte dans l analyse M Kirsch a également déclaré que les différences ne pouvaient pas s expliquer par l efficacité du vaccin car les taux de mortalité du COVID 19 étaient assez faibles Les résultats démontrent également une plausibilité biologique écrit M Kirsch car les deux vaccins contiennent le même ingrédient actif ARNm mais les doses sont sensiblement différentes L injection de COVID 19 de Pfizer contient 30 microgrammes par dose et celle de Moderna 100 microgrammes par dose D autres recherches ont abouti à des résultats similaires Kirsch a noté que ses conclusions concordent avec d autres recherches sur cette question L article de Fraiman qui a réanalysé les essais de phase 3 de Pfizer et de Moderna a révélé que le vaccin de Moderna présentait un taux d effets

La nouvelle théorie de Geert Vanden Bossche Dans un article paru le 23 mai sur TrialSite News le virologue Geert Vanden Bossche s est penché sur les préoccupations scientifiques générales concernant la capacité du H5N1 à adapter ses protéines de surface pour mieux interagir avec les cellules de mammifères Cependant il a proposé une théorie alternative liant la vaccination COVID 19 à la propagation du H5N1 Vanden Bossche a suggéré que les populations humaines fortement vaccinées agissant comme des réservoirs de variantes du SRAS CoV 2 SC 2 pourraient indirectement influencer le système immunitaire aviaire Il a émis l hypothèse que l exposition des oiseaux au SC 2 d origine humaine pouvait déclencher une forte réponse immunitaire chez les oiseaux en activant notamment les lymphocytes T cytotoxiques CTL des cellules immunitaires qui tuent les cellules infectées par un virus Je ne dispose pas de preuves concluantes mais je n exclus pas la possibilité que les populations humaines fortement vaccinées au C 19 puissent être à l origine d une forte activation des CTL chez les oiseaux exposés au SC 2 a écrit Vanden Bossche Selon la théorie de Vanden Bossche le système immunitaire de l oiseau ainsi activé pourrait réagir différemment en cas d exposition au H5N1 Au lieu d une réponse immunitaire typique qui limiterait la propagation du virus le système immunitaire ainsi stimulé pourrait par inadvertance faciliter l infection par le H5N1 et sa transmission Vanden Bossche a également proposé que cette interaction du système immunitaire permette au H5N1 d infecter plus facilement les mammifères y compris l homme Normalement un virus doit subir une mutation importante pour passer d une espèce à l autre Cependant Vanden Bossche a suggéré que cette réponse immunitaire altérée pourrait permettre au H5N1 de se propager à travers différentes espèces sans nécessiter les mutations adaptatives habituelles M Hooker a qualifié de spéculatives les théories de M Vanden Bossche sur la physiologie des oiseaux mais il a déclaré que la vaccination par ARNm provoque spécifiquement une suppression de l immunité innée qui rendrait les humains plus sensibles à l infection par les virus de la grippe aviaire M Vanden Bossche a également proposé un résultat potentiel surprenant de cette interaction entre le H5N1 et le SARS CoV 2 suggérant que la panzootie de

must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Meleni Aldridge Chile s Atacama Desert is hailed as one of the Earth s most extraordinary places It s the driest nonpolar desert on Earth which stretches across around 600 miles 1 000 kilometers or km in a piece of land between the coastal Cordillera de la Costa Mountain range and the Andes Mountains The entire area is an oasis of geologic formations and has provided scientists with seemingly never ending research opportunities As with so many areas in our wonderous planet it also has a history of being raped for its minerals Prior to the 1930s it was for nitrate minerals that were used in fertilizers and explosives But more recently other minerals such as lithium copper and iodine are also being mined Unfortunately lithium mining is hugely toxic and poses a significant danger to the environment particularly in South America Despite the mining industry s exploration of technological advancements aimed at reducing the industry s ecological footprint the question remains Should we continue to rape the earth for lithium in the race to electrify Do electric vehicles EVs do more good than harm Are the supply chains for the resources needed to electrify our world sufficiently transparent for us to evaluate them properly Can we really call the move away from fossil fuels toward hyper electrification another green revolution None of us are in a position to fully answer these questions as the data required are just not available But what we do know suggests we should be concerned very concerned Lithium mining the hidden environmental costs As the global push toward electrification intensifies the demand for lithium a key component in batteries for EVs and renewable energy storage is skyrocketing Lithium is often dubbed the white gold of the energy revolution It converts chemical energy into electrical energy very efficiently and is the lightest metal on Earth We re repeatedly told that it promises a future free from fossil fuels However beneath this so called promise of a sustainable world lies a deeply troubling environmental and social cost particularly in regions rich in lithium reserves such

accounting for over half of the world s supply These desert regions host stunning salt flats including the beautiful Salar de Atacama in Chile see SDA in figure 1 above From the air lithium fields appear beautiful vivid blue pools where lithium rich brine is evaporated under the harsh sun However on the ground this process brings significant environmental consequences Extracting lithium is a water intensive process In Chile s Salar de Atacama for example approximately 500 000 gallons of water are needed to produce one metric ton of lithium This extraction competes with local communities and ecosystems already strained by water scarcity Indigenous groups and environmental activists have long raised concerns about the depletion of vital freshwater sources threatening their traditional ways of life and local biodiversity In addition toxic chemicals are needed to process lithium The release of such chemicals through leaching spills or air emissions can harm communities ecosystems and food production Lithium extraction inevitably harms the soil and also causes air contamination Environmental degradation Beyond water usage lithium mining has broader ecological ramifications The brine extraction process disrupts the delicate balance of salt flats and can lead to land subsidence The drying up of freshwater sources impacts wildlife including flamingos that rely on the region s saline lakes Furthermore chemical leaks and waste can contaminate soil and groundwater threatening local agriculture and livelihoods The environmental impact is not limited to South America In Australia the world s largest lithium producer open pit mining techniques create vast scars in the landscape accompanied by dust and habitat destruction In both regions the infrastructure needed to support large scale mining can also fragment ecosystems and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions offsetting some of the benefits of the green energy it s meant to support Whether you subscribe to the carbon argument or not it s noteworthy that once in operation a clean EV is meant to reduce one s carbon footprint but making lithium ion batteries can emit 74 more carbon dioxide than a

you get the idea We re not being told the full story yet EVs are being pushed heavily on an unsuspecting public Also current levels of lithium collection in the European Union are very low In the case of batteries this amounts to an estimated 5 of the lithium ion batteries put on the European market Most of the current lithium is either dumped in landfills or incinerated contributing to Europe s dependency on lithium supply Both also contribute to land water and air pollution Can the mining of the future offer a technological solution To give them their due the mining industry is beginning to address these concerns by embracing technological advancements aimed at reducing environmental damage Companies are exploring innovations like water recycling more efficient extraction techniques and the use of artificial intelligence to minimize the ecological footprint of mining operations Lithium brine operations are also looking into direct lithium extraction technologies which could potentially reduce water consumption by extracting lithium directly from the brine without the need for large evaporation ponds This method still in its experimental phase could cut down water use and

environmental organizations and the mining sector must collaborate to find solutions that respect both people and the planet but also that end users need to be told the truth about the real cost of going electric Add regulatory frameworks stricter environmental standards and investments in cleaner technologies which are all essential to mitigate the impact of lithium extraction We have to stop

the substantia nigra primarily through mechanisms involving oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction and dopaminergic neuron apoptosis All golf courses pose risks but not all of them are equal In a related study published in Social Science Research Network SSRN researchers noted that pesticide risk on golf courses varies significantly based on where you live This research specifically compared pesticide hazards across eight regions in the U S and Europe investigating why some areas seem safer than others By focusing on differences in regulation budget and climate the analysis identified what determines the toxicity level of golf courses in each area The difference here is that the population of this study wasn t individual people but rather golf courses themselves Europe has lower golf course pesticide use Researchers looked at numerous courses from different countries including the U S Denmark Norway and other European nations After calculating the pesticide risk using a special model the study found massive discrepancies Courses in Florida had median pesticide risk scores topping out at 40 806 Meanwhile courses in Denmark scored as low as 64 highlighting a shocking disparity based on the two continents Pesticide risks in American courses dwarf those of their European counterparts As noted in the findings above the median hazard quotient score in Florida was hundreds of times greater than the score in Denmark Moreover even comparing states within the U S northern golf courses located in New York and Oregon typically carried lower risks than southern states located in Florida and Texas again due to variations in pesticide regulation and choice of products rather than simply weather or budget considerations The main driver of the differences was the strictness of pesticide regulations Among U S courses especially in Florida maintenance staff tend to use pesticides far more due to relaxed or limited regulation Golf courses in Florida averaged over 60 fungicide area treatments on greens each year the researchers said This is in contrast to Denmark which has stricter regulations agreed upon by various stakeholders In 2005 an agreement to phase out the use of pesticides on Danish golf courses was signed by the Danish Golf Union DGU the Danish Ministry of Environment MoE and the Municipalities Organization in Denmark According to the

pesticides on Danish golf courses was signed by the Danish Golf Union DGU the Danish Ministry of Environment MoE and the Municipalities Organization in Denmark According to the MoE pesticide risk on golf courses has been reduced 97 since the agreement was signed in 2005 Ninety eight percent of golf courses are compliant in tracking their pesticide risk with values below the maximum allowable To remain under this threshold golf course superintendents must tolerate higher levels of disease weeds and insects Budget did have some impact but it was less influential than regulations Courses with lower budgets in colder northern U S states sometimes had reduced risk scores but these findings were minimal compared to those achieved by robust regulatory measures Essentially even if a golf course spends less money on pesticides if the chemicals allowed are particularly harmful or poorly regulated the overall health risks for nearby residents remain high The type of pesticides matters more than the amount For instance fungicides which are chemicals used to prevent fungal growth on grass turned out to be particularly problematic with golf courses using more potent varieties drastically increasing their overall risk scores In regions where powerful fungicides are heavily regulated or outright banned such as much of northern Europe the courses showed far lower hazard scores In short it isn t necessarily about how frequently pesticides are applied but rather what specific pesticides are used Pesticides stay in the environment for a long time The researchers discussed that the reason fungicides and certain herbicides weedkillers are harmful is their ability to persist in the environment and interact with wildlife groundwater and ultimately humans These chemicals stay active long after application leaching into groundwater and becoming airborne presenting continuous and chronic health risks to anyone exposed over time Stronger regulations will help curb pesticide overuse One key point raised by the researchers is that improving your local environment requires stricter regulations European models show clearly how legislative action drastically reduces pesticide

pesticide exposure is your top goal As noted earlier these chemicals harm your neurological health and increase your risk for Parkinson s To protect yourself here are my recommendations 1 Exercise regularly to sweat out chemicals Engaging in activities that make you sweat such as interval walking training cycling or sauna sessions is one of the most powerful tools for eliminating pesticides and heavy metals that have accumulated in your body Furthermore there s plenty of evidence showing that regular exercise boosts overall health so there s no downside to sweating Best of all exercise is essentially free and available any time you want to do it 2 Filter your drinking water Because pesticides easily contaminate groundwater filtering your tap water becomes crucial if you live near a golf course There are many water filters available on the market so choose one that fits your budget and needs Just remember that the filters need to be able to have the capability to remove toxins such as pesticides fluoride and heavy metals 3 Support stricter local regulations Getting involved at the community level matters Advocate for tougher pesticide policies with local legislators Stricter rules on pesticide use like those in Europe translate into safer neighborhoods and less exposure for you and your family 4 Improve your indoor air quality Airborne pesticides can drift indoors settling in your home Use air purifiers equipped with high efficiency particulate air HEPA filters keep windows closed when pesticide spraying is scheduled and frequently clean surfaces Cleaner indoor air reduces direct exposure protecting your respiratory system and your brain health 5 Choose organic food whenever possible Switching to organic fruits and vegetables greatly reduces your body s pesticide burden helping you detoxify effectively Nonorganic produce often contains residues from the same pesticides golf courses use increasing your total chemical load To find the best organic food it s important to carefully read and understand the labels printed on the food you re buying For an in depth explanation of this topic read Organic Food Safety Navigating Labels and

Why does living near a golf course increase my Parkinson s disease risk A Living close to golf courses significantly raises your exposure to pesticides used to maintain grass which drastically increases your Parkinson s risk if you live within a mile These chemicals contaminate groundwater and drift into the air directly affecting nearby homes and communities Q How far away should I live from a golf course to reduce Parkinson s risk A The closer you live the higher your risk Even at about 3 miles away risk exists but starts dropping notably around 13 for each additional mile further away from the course Q Are golf courses in Europe safer than those in the U S A Yes European golf courses generally pose less pesticide risk because of stricter regulations For example median pesticide hazard scores in Denmark are hundreds of times lower than in states like Florida Q Does filtering my drinking water help lower Parkinson s risk if I live near a golf course A Yes Filtering your drinking water effectively removes pesticide residues from local groundwater significantly reducing your daily exposure and protecting your neurological health Q What else can I do to lower my

AAP the American Dental Association ADA and other pro fluoridation groups rushed to confirm their staunch support for community water fluoridation after a California federal judge last month ruled

which has long promoted water fluoridation has not issued any statement The ADA said it remains staunchly in support of community water fluoridation at optimal levels to help prevent tooth decay It said the court ruling provides no scientific basis for the ADA to change its endorsement of community water fluoridation as safe and beneficial to oral health However Chen s 80 page ruling summarizes and evaluates the extensive scientific data The data include a key report researched and compiled over six years by the U S Department of Health and Human Services National Toxicology Program NTP

people experienced adverse effects from fluoride long before those effects manifested as crippling skeletal fluorosis The agency knew adverse effects like severe joint pain would precede crippling according to the testimony of EPA risk assessor Joyce Donohue Ph D and that fluoride exposure could cause severe dental fluorosis a discoloration of the teeth from overexposure to fluoride that can also cause tooth enamel to pit and crumble Pushback against the standards led the agency to request that the National Research Council part of the National Academy of Science review the toxicologic literature on fluoride Its 2006 report concluded that EPA s MCLG level was too high because strong evidence showed severe dental fluorosis is an adverse health effect and fluoride damages bones before severe skeletal fluorosis The EPA accepted severe dental fluorosis as an adverse health effect and set a lower reference dose for water fluoridation to 0 08 mg L Connett said although it never changed the official MCLG or MCL The National Research Council report also flagged a range of other adverse health effects including effects on the endocrine system blood sugar and the neurological system

Up By Sharon Lerner For decades Republican lawmakers and industry lobbyists have tried to chip away at the small program in the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA that measures the threat of toxic chemicals Most people don t know the Integrated Risk Information System IRIS as the program is called but it is the scientific engine of the agency that protects human health and the environment Its scientists assess the toxicity of chemicals estimating the amount of each that triggers cancer and other health effects And these values serve as the independent nonpartisan basis for the rules regulations and permits that limit our exposure to toxic chemicals Now IRIS faces the gravest threat to its existence since it was created under former President Ronald Reagan four decades ago Legislation introduced in Congress would prohibit the EPA from using any of IRIS s hundreds of chemical assessments in environmental rules regulations enforcement actions and permits that limit the amount of pollution allowed into air and water The EPA would also be forbidden from using them to map the health risks from toxic chemicals The bills filed in both the U S Senate and House of Representatives earlier this year are championed by companies that make and use chemicals along with industry groups that have long opposed environmental rules If it becomes law the No IRIS Act as it s called would essentially bar the agency from carrying out its mission experts told ProPublica They re trying to undermine the foundations for doing any kind of regulation said William Boyd a professor at UCLA School of Law who specializes in environmental law Boyd noted that IRIS reports on chemicals toxicity are the first step in the long process of creating legal protections from toxic

ultraconservative playbook that has guided much of Trump s second presidency calls for the elimination of IRIS on the grounds that it often sets safe levels based on questionable science and that its reviews result in billions in economic costs The policy blueprint echoes industry claims that IRIS does not adequately reflect all of the research on chemicals there are sometimes significant differences between the program s conclusions and those of corporate funded scientists IRIS has long been a target of industry and has at times been criticized by independent scientific bodies More than a decade ago for example the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine took issue with the organization length and clarity of IRIS reviews a more recent report from the same group found that IRIS had made significant progress in addressing the problems IRIS s work stands out in a world where much of the science on toxic chemicals is funded by corporations with a vested stake in them Studies have shown that industry funded science tends to be biased in favor of the sponsor s products But IRIS s several dozen scientists do not have a financial interest in their findings Their work has had a tangible impact on real people The program s calculations are the hard science that allow the agency to identify heightened disease risk due to chemicals in the air water and land And these revelations have in some cases led to stricter chemical regulations and grassroots efforts to curtail pollution Bitter battles IRIS was created in 1985 Until that point different parts of the EPA had often assessed chemicals in isolation and their methods and values were not always consistent At first IRIS just collected assessments completed by various divisions of the EPA Then in 1996 it began conducting its own independent reviews of chemicals Its scientists analyze studies of a chemical and use them to calculate the amount of the substance that people can be exposed to without being

to prioritize their environmental efforts acting first on the chemicals that IRIS deems most harmful Countries that don t have the expertise to assess chemicals themselves often adopt IRIS values to guide their own regulations Today IRIS s collection of more than 500 assessments of chemicals groups of related chemicals and mixtures of chemicals is the largest database of authoritative toxicity values in the world according to Vincent Cogliano a recently retired scientist who worked on IRIS assessments for more than 25 years From the beginning industry scientists challenged IRIS with calculations that showed their chemicals to be less dangerous There were a lot of pretty bitter battles said Cogliano who remembers particularly intense opposition to the assessments of diesel engine exhaust and formaldehyde during the 1990s Critiques of IRIS assessments intensified over the years and began to slow the program s work It took so long to get through that there were fewer and fewer assessments said Cogliano In 2017 opposition to IRIS escalated further Trump s budget proposal would have slashed funding for the program Although Congress funded IRIS and the program survived some of its work was halted during his first presidency Trump appointed a chemical engineer named David Dunlap to head the division of the EPA that includes IRIS Dunlap had challenged the EPA s science on formaldehyde when he was working as the director of environmental regulatory affairs for Koch Industries Koch s subsidiary Georgia Pacific made formaldehyde and many products that emit it Georgia Pacific has since sold its chemicals business to Bakelite Synthetics While Dunlap was at the EPA work on several IRIS assessments was suspended including the report on formaldehyde IRIS completed that report last year That assessment proved controversial as ProPublica documented in its investigation of the chemical late last year In calculating the risks that formaldehyde can cause cancer IRIS

called ethylene oxide The evaluation changed the chemical s status from a probable human carcinogen to plainly carcinogenic to humans And IRIS calculated the uppermost amount of the chemical before it starts to cause cancer finding that it was 30 times lower than previously believed The EPA used that information to create a map which showed that people living near a sterilizing plant in Willowbrook Illinois had an elevated cancer risk because the facility was releasing ethylene oxide into the air Once locals learned of their risk they kicked into action That knowledge led us to be able to really activate the groundswell of community members said Lauren Kaeseberg who was part of a group that held protests outside the plant met with state and local officials and testified at hearings Not long after the protests Illinois passed legislation limiting the release of the pollutant the local plant shut down and the cancer causing pollution was gone from the air Around the country the pattern has been repeated After IRIS issues its estimate of the amount of a chemical that people can safely be exposed to without developing cancer and other diseases the EPA uses that information to map the threats from chemicals in the air IRIS s evidence showing that people have an elevated risk of cancer has sparked some hard hit communities to fight back suing polluters shuttering plants and demanding the offending chemical be removed from their environment In St John the Baptist Parish Louisiana residents had long felt as if they had more than their share of sickness The small rectangle

organizing his neighbors to demand a stop to the deadly pollution His wife died in December 2024 The assessments of chloroprene and ethylene oxide and the activism they sparked around the country eventually led the EPA to crack down Last year the agency announced several rules that aimed to reduce toxic emissions The rules call for changes in how companies produce and release chemicals the type of reforms that can be expensive to undertake The Joe Biden administration sued Denka the company that owns the chloroprene releasing plant in St John in an effort to force it to curb the amount of the chemical it released But the Trump administration intends to drop that suit according to The New York Times For its part Denka sued the EPA over one of the rules in July 2024 asking the court for more time to implement the changes The company argued that the agency was on a politically motivated unscientific crusade to shut down the plant Critics of IRIS have used similarly barbed language

the Government Accounting Office GAO according to a report the congressional watchdog issued last week The GAO which monitors how taxpayer dollars are spent placed IRIS on its high risk list in 2009 But the GAO did so not because it was vulnerable to waste fraud and abuse the reasons some programs land on the list but because the watchdog decided IRIS wasn t doing enough assessments of dangerous chemicals Since 2009 the GAO has made 22 recommendations to IRIS all of which have been implemented according to the agency s website The new report acknowledged improvements but noted that the program s current pace of finalizing assessments likely cannot increase without more resources According to the GAO report in 2023 and 2024 IRIS had reported needing 26 additional staff members to meet the demand for chemical assessments Defenders of the program say the criticisms mask a simple motive protecting industry profits rather than public health It s blatant self interest said Robert

Outcry Citing unanswered questions the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously agreed to delay its final vote on two ordinances that would allow for the fast tracked

Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously agreed to delay its final vote on two ordinances that would allow for the fast tracked proliferation of wireless infrastructure without due process and without residents right to appeal The five board members will seek experts opinions and discuss questions raised by constituents during a closed session on Dec 20 The board scheduled another public hearing and the final vote for Jan 10 2023 Commenting on the delayed vote Janice Hahn board chair said We have a lot of questions and a lot of those came up during public comment Children s Health Defense CHD attorney W Scott McCollough said Today s vote is significant because Los Angeles County is the largest county in the nation by population Its actions influence what happens elsewhere The result here will soon be exported to other local jurisdictions Brenda Martinez an L A County resident and activist on the executive committee of Fiber First Los Angeles County a nonprofit that promotes fiber optic networks agreed The Dec 6 vote has major precedent setting implications in other cities Other smaller municipalities seem to look up to the county for guidance Everyone s eyes and ears are on the county s decisions What made this happen was the enormous response from the public thousands of emails sent out to the supervisors and over 300 pages of comments in opposition on the county portal website McCollough a former Texas assistant attorney general and telecom and administrative law attorney said the delayed vote was the result of democracy at work but the fight is not over We must defeat ordinances that institute a rubber stamp process for cell towers by eliminating public input take away everyone s property and privacy rights and allow thousands of towers to be placed in environmentally and historically sensitive areas without concern of the significant negative effects he said McCollough also told The Defender The action alerts CHD ran on this issue generated a huge response and created great hesitancy by the board members and the hard work on the ground by the local public interest groups securing so many people calling in or appearing in person got us over the top Concerned citizens submitted an overwhelming number of public comments in opposition to the ordinances and the board members simply did not want to vote against their constituents McCollough said

via an action alert Simply put the politicians got scared so they delayed McCollough said Susan Foster co founder of the nonprofit California Fires Firefighters who attended the meeting said she was not surprised the supervisors decided to postpone their decision given all the opposition to the passage of these two wireless ordinances that are deeply telecom friendly Foster added This postponement shows that a majority of the supervisors are starting to recognize the fact that if they don t protect the residents from cell towers in their front yards they will be voted out of office It s that simple CHD and several of the other public interest organizations are prepared to take legal action against the county if the ordinances pass McCollough said CHD is covering some of the legal costs for a woman in L A County who sued over a small cell placed on her property after the county staff unilaterally followed the no notice or hearing ministerial process they want the board to codify for small cells even though the current code does not allow that Thousands of wireless transmitters could pop up if ordinances pass The two ordinances up for a vote in L A County are amendments to title 16 and title 22 of the Los Angeles County Code These amendments seek to establish regulations for small cell wireless communication facilities in highways as well as establish regulations for wireless facilities on private property in the unincorporated areas of L A County and associated provisions The proposed ordinances have been met with significant opposition from the public According to Fiber First L A if passed the two ordinances would remove public notice setbacks oversight safety and environmental review and any opportunities for appeal Thousands of wireless transmitters could pop up across unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County in the next few years Public News Service reported Tuesday s meeting was the second reading of the proposed ordinances The first took place on

firefighters who experienced neurological and immunological harm due to the presence of cell towers on their stations testified about the dangers of wireless cell towers Four major California wildfires in the last 15 years alone were started by telecommunications equipment she said Two of these fires the Malibu Canyon Fire in 2007 and the devastating Woolsey Fire in 2018 took place in L A County and caused over 6 billion in damages Foster pointed out that the guilty parties in those two fires were Southern California Edison AT T Verizon Sprint now T Mobile and NextG now Crown Castle and that the California Public Utilities Commission accused every one of those parties of impeding the fire investigations Safety belongs to the county to regulate Foster said The FCC Federal Communications Commission never mandated that L A County burn itself to the ground Until now the county has required a conditional use permit with public input on each wireless transmitter Do FCC rules necessitate fast tracking wireless permit procedures Bruce Durbin supervising regional planner in the county s Department of Regional Planning told Public News Service the conditional use permit process with public input on each wireless transmitter had become problematic because the FCC requires government agencies to approve or deny them within two months A conditional use permit in California requires 30 days public notice a public hearing in front of the commission Durbin said And to be able to approve that all within 60 days it s impossible But McCollough disagreed While L A County staff have argued that the FCC shot clock rules functionally not legally require elimination of public involvement since the processing time is so compressed that is not true he said They L A County staff claim they have no choice other than to rubber stamp wireless applications However the FCC emphasized that its shot clock rules do not preempt state and local rules requiring notice

implemented a fast tracked ministerial process that is bureaucrat speak for rubber stamp he said even though its policy guidance from 2010 says wireless permits must be handled using notice and comment and are not subject to ministerial treatment Today s vote was about codifying this process he said McCollough said that L A County staff adopted the idea of using a fast tracked ministerial process for wireless because they are displeased when citizens make them do their job and they have to take into account what constituents have to say He added The wireless industry wants to get rid of bothersome public input or involvement in wireless facility siting matters even for cell sites that would be on utility poles or light standards in the right of way adjoining people s property or on private property next door They want a process where people figure out what has happened only after it is too late to do anything Folks will come home some evening and an ugly toxic tower will be right next to their living room bathroom and bedroom windows but the time to challenge the permit decision will have already passed Fiber optic networks a better option many say According to Fiber

adversely affected by line of sight obstructions including buildings and seasonal foliage and weather While a fiber network can physically connect every household in a service area and deliver predictable performance it is significantly more complex for a fixed wireless network to deliver a line of sight to every household in a service area Scalability is a critical challenge to fixed wireless deployments both technically and financially A given amount of wireless spectrum is capable of supporting a given amount of network capacity If the number of network users increases or users need more bandwidth the network operator must increase the spectrum which is both scarce and extremely expensive and may not be possible upgrade the technology or add antennas It is challenging to design a fixed wireless network that will provide sufficient robust upstream and downstream capacity and reach all the addresses in unserved areas The fastest fixed wireless technologies such as those that use millimeter wave spectrum are effective in delivering short range service to closely grouped households in urban and suburban settings These technologies are largely unsuitable for serving rural communities because of the typical geographic dispersion of addresses and the lack of mounting structures such as towers or building rooftops Fiber is sustainable scalable and renewable It offers greater capacity predictable performance lower maintenance costs and a longer technological lifetime than fixed wireless technologies Fiber service is not degraded by line of sight issues and

health In a statement published by The Washington Post the CDC said While tragic a death from H5N1 bird flu in the United States is not unexpected because of the known potential for infection with

The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses of the vaccine However they have not asked the FDA U S Food and Drug Administration to authorize the vaccine Dr Meryl Nass founder of Door to Freedom questioned the need for a bird flu vaccine Why would you use a vaccine in humans that has not been shown to work or be safe for a disease that has only killed

if they were also found in animals or within a few days of the start of symptoms because that would suggest the virus was already acquiring these mutations Nass said that the longer a virus is able to reproduce inside a body the more mutations you will find and some are sure to improve its ability to infect human cells The same thing occurred with COVID It had no clinical significance then either

that mainstream media won t write Please Donate Today CNN reported that the Louisiana man was infected with the D1 1 clade of the bird flu virus a strain that is currently circulating in wild birds and poultry but not in dairy cattle that have been infected with bird flu In November 2024 a teenager in the Canadian province of British Columbia was infected with this strain but recovered Since we only have the Louisiana elder and the British Columbia teen who have come down with this particular strain of bird flu it is not possible to say anything about the clinical illness the propensity to

the Prime Minister of Samoa and Leader of the Human Rights Protection Party since 1998 I went to Samoa to attend an independence celebration and discuss with the government the introduction of a medical informatics system that would allow Samoa s health officials to assess in real time the efficacy and safety of every medical intervention or drug on overall health Edwin Tamasese had arranged the trip and Children s Health Defense had offered to finance the innovative system Samoa banned certain vaccinations after several children had died following MMR vaccines the previous year A nephew of the Prime minister was diagnosed with autism following a vaccine induced fever and seizures and government officials including the Prime Minister were curious to measure health outcomes following the natural experiment created by the national respite from vaccines Samoa s choice had infuriated the Global Medical Cartel A mild measles outbreak in November gave that cohort the opportunity to turn Tamasese into an international villain Near the end of the month following the introduction of an Indian manufactured MMR vaccine many Samoans began dying On the ground Samoan families blamed the vaccine and poor hospital protocols mainly the use of panadol and widespread vaccination of measles infected hospital patients for the mortalities The global cartel and the Pharma compliant press

horrified at what I saw a 9 month old boy his 2 year old brother and their father were all lying together in one room of the house The 9 year old was severely ill with cracked lips and eyes swollen

that the child should be in hospital but the mother was clearly concerned She said the children are dying at the hospital and the medications they were given were not working I said ok I am not a

on the lips were much improved He fully recovered over the next few days much to my relief as I honestly thought he was going to die This is when things got out of control Word spread very rapidly I started to get calls from everywhere for help I had also realized at this point that the medications being given out by the hospital were ineffective and needed to change urgently before more lives were lost I tried to call the measles helpline to get through to them but the phones just rang out repeatedly I also started to email several of my contacts in the medical community to hopefully urgently get changes put through In addition I contacted a few of my contacts who are members of Parliament to see if they could help In addition organizations like Children s Health Defense had reached out from the U S Quite quickly when I raised my concerns with them I was linked into a group of medical professionals by Mr Kennedy and we worked on a protocol to ensure effective treatment In addition a nurses group from Australia made contact I also decided to make public posts on Facebook passing on information on how to treat measles using vitamin C and A I also passed on information on

protocol confirmed by the U S team of doctors As we were going out to villages treating children a very troubling trend was emerging Over 90 of those we were treating were either recently vaccinated or according to the parents had caught measles from a recently vaccinated person This led to a call to a few contacts in the medical community to ask if it was possible that the vaccine could actually be the source of the outbreak A contact who happens to be on the medical board of New Zealand mentioned that there are a few ways that this could happen Either the vaccine is under attenuated or not weak enough the population being injected is vulnerable and too weak to take the vaccine the vaccine is not being transported in a suitable chilled environment allowing it to regain virulence or the vaccine itself is contaminated and we are not dealing with measles at all but another pathogen This became a major source of concern as our small team was overwhelmed not to mention the National Health Services who merged with the Ministry of Health in 2017 and the World Health Organization WHO were increasing vaccination campaigns As activities ramped up and news spread that we were having very good success treating children I received my first call to come in to the police station to meet with the police During this conversation the officer interviewing me explained that he had been directed by NEOC National Emergency Operations Center to arrest me for disobeying the state of emergency orders He stated that he had been told that I had posted a video on facebook telling parents not to come into the national hospitals for treatment I advised him that this was not the case at all and convinced him to review the video on his computer He agreed and we watched it together In the video I am clearly directing parents to take their children into the national health services and to ensure that they are given vitamin A as per the WHO guidelines for their treatment A few days after

the secretary for the Prime Minister in the hope that he would be able to support it and prevent further unnecessary deaths I am not sure if he received it however Early the next morning I was to go to another of the islands to work on the coconut oil factory that I am a shareholder in The night previous I had received a call from one of the district hospitals A parent of a very sick little girl was calling asking for help I had spent an exhausting day delivering vitamins to several villages and almost did not take the call By this time I had lists of messages asking for help my phone was sending constant message alerts to such a degree that it was almost as if it was ringing It was at the stage where I would just say a prayer flip through the messages and whichever one it stopped on I would choose to help I just imagined if this person was me appealing for help with a sick child and I decided to take it and go I got there in the late evening and the mother met me in the carpark I said that I did not think I was allowed into hospitals but she said do not worry just come in I went through the usual spiel I am not a doctor the protocol I am giving you however has been endorsed by doctors If you agree that you understand this then I will help you She agreed and I helped her out While I was speaking to her I could hear several other parents looking after children saying my name That is Tamasese from Facebook They came over and asked for help as well I explained again that I am not a doctor but if they wanted my help still I would help them They agreed Early the next morning I headed to catch the ferry to the other island to get to the oil factory I called to follow up with the sick child I had visited the night before at the district hospital The mother stated that her

This post immediately set off events within the NHS who directed the district hospital to hold all the patients and contacted the police As I was on the way to Savaii I took another one of the messages Just by chance it happened to be on the island I was heading to It was a message from Australia asking if I could help I responded yes and we began to communicate She mentioned the child a little girl was in hospital in Tuasivi Savaii the island I was going to I explained everything about what we were doing and the protocol and said I did not want to go into the hospital but could meet the parents outside She thanked me and organized the meeting It was while waiting to meet these parents outside the hospital that an individual I know saw me and pulled up his car to talk to me He mentioned that I am entitled to my view but that I was being disruptive of government efforts I stated that I would be as disruptive of the deaths of children as I could possibly be and if NEOC thought this was contrary to what we should be trying to achieve then that was their problem He left and I continued to my meeting with the parents I explained how to use the vitamins and left it with them Later that evening just on dusk a police car turned up at our factory I was on a call with some other parents asking for help I told the parents I would call them back and approached the car The officers advised that they had been informed to deliver a letter to me to inform me that there was going to be a two day lockdown starting in the morning If I was seen outside my place of residence

parents of the child I had just provided vitamins sent me a video of the child I had just helped six hours previous The change was miraculous The little girl had been lying on her back with a distended stomach and an IV in her arm before she started on the vitamins Three doses later of a gram a dose every two hours of vitamin C powder mixed in 20 mls of water and she was sitting up eating She was very close in age to my daughter and seeing her recover like that brought me to tears of happiness and frustration at the same time The fact that there was an effective treatment at hand and children were still dying needlessly was incredibly disheartening The following morning I noted a post from a friend who was to help with the mass vaccination efforts of the government Considering the pattern of infection that made it look like the outbreak was coming from the vaccine I made a post in reply that I later took down Two hours after this post the police arrived and said that I was going to be arrested with the charges to be advised later The oddest part of this arrest was that one of the officers had been hugging me across the shoulders and thanking me for helping his relative the day before I was then transported to the police post at Tuasivi near the main town center where I was held for one night My greatest concern was for the parents of the child I had spoken to the previous evening that I was intending to meet when the curfew was to be lifted in the afternoon In the meantime I had no method to contact the team working the main island where the outbreak was at its worst We had set up a distribution pattern where we would create delivery routes and assign people to areas to drop off vitamins We were also keeping records of infections age sex village

incitement against a government order under state of emergency powers in the afternoon The registrar at the advice of the police asked that I be confined until bail hearing The registrar complied and I was then transferred to the main prison to be held I ended up spending three nights in that prison which was thankfully in much better condition then the one I had left behind At the bail hearing on the third day the Judge agreed to release me on bail under the specific conditions that I release my passport and not say anything against the specific measles vaccine on social media He disagreed that I should not be allowed to give out vitamins as requested by the prosecution and permitted me to continue doing this After being released on bail the outbreak had subsided significantly A group of us met to look at what data we had available to try to determine what had actually happened in Samoa to cause this outbreak to be so severe and why the death rate was an astronomical one in 68 and not one in 5000 as would be expected if you trust the official statistics It was then that a few anomalies showed themselves At the commencement of the outbreak 36 tests were sent to Australia Only

to us saying that he really wanted it to be an interactive meeting and he wanted to hear from people Big Food afraid of MAHA Moms and state level activism Food safety topped the list of topics discussed with health freedom influencers and activists with Kennedy discussing takeaways from his Monday meeting with Big Food representatives Mackintosh said Kennedy said that actually the Big Food companies are more afraid of the MAHA Moms than they are of him Mackintosh said At a state level they re very intimidated by the amount of MAHA Moms that have really just led this movement Kennedy s remarks came as a growing number of U S states are considering laws to ban artificial food dyes On Monday Kennedy directed the FDA to work on eliminating its generally regarded as safe GRAS loophole

Rollins said in the press release During Tuesday s meeting with health freedom influencers and activists Kennedy said MAHA will focus on the safety of products such as baby formula One of the first priorities is to make good healthy formula available to American children Kennedy said noting that many baby formulas sold in the U S contain potentially harmful seed oils We re looking at ways to make European formulas available to American children He added One of the problems is that the nutrition standards for baby formula from the FDA had required the seed oils The seed oils contain Omega 6s too many Omega 6s and the way they re pasteurized and homogenized is in a form that we think may be problematic too In an appearance on Fox News Hannity Tuesday Kennedy said Seed oil is one of the components of processed foods All the science indicates that ultraprocessed foods are the principal culprit and it s an extraordinary explosion the epidemic we have of chronic disease In a March 7 letter to Kennedy Rollins EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and over 300 food companies urged these officials to use sound science and expressed significant concerns that the MAHA commission has placed

protections for manufacturers of toxic substances Third the normalization of harm with no recourse This is not theoretical It is a real time shift in the balance of power between public interest and private industry A coordinated effort is unfolding in state legislatures and on Capitol Hill to grant legal immunity liability shields to agrochemical manufacturers This means Big Ag Big Chem and Big Seed can hurt you even kill you and not just get away with it but profit from it At this very moment across America a new wave of legislation seeks to provide legal immunity to chemical companies removing the right to recourse for harm their products have caused This shield is not just for a niche set of chemicals but for all pesticides and chemicals regulated under federal law The chemical

wireless world were not featured front and center in the MAHA report as a driver of children s deteriorating health EMR relegated to one bullet statement that had glaring error In the months leading up to the report s release U S Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr spoke about the risks EMR poses to children s health At a MAHA Commission meeting in March with health freedom influencers and activists Kennedy said We allow levels of electromagnetic radiation in our devices in our homes in our schools that are illegal in many countries And a lot of countries now are limiting the amount of exposure that children could get forbidding cell phones for example in schools Yet the final version of The MAHA Report unfortunately relegated the impact of electropollution from wireless devices and networks to one bullet statement on page 44 said Dr Robert Brown a diagnostic radiologist with more than 30 years of experience and the vice president of Scientific Research and Clinical Affairs for the Environmental Health Trust EHT And in that one statement there is a glaring misstatement that was likely added by someone without a background in the biomedical research field Brown said The report claimed that some studies have linked EMR exposure to reduced sperm counts and motility but not quality but sperm quality includes factors like sperm motility so that claim doesn t make sense according to Brown By affecting sperm counts and motility sperm quality is affected Brown said He noted that the authors of the very paper cited by the report defined sperm quality data as including sperm density motility viability morphology and DFI DNA fragmentation index I wonder who added this erroneous phrase and find it interesting that it was added in the same document in which a separate section discusses corporate capture and the revolving door Report ignores thousands of other studies showing EMR risks The report also noted that the National Institutes of Health s NIH National Toxicology Program found clear evidence of DNA damage and increased cancer risk in rats Yet the admission of harm was immediately tempered by citing a 2022 systematic review of about 50 studies that found low to inadequate evidence on impact in children and called for more high quality research Rees said calling for more research is a well known delaying tactic by polluting industries The report failed to mention a larger and more recent systematic review commissioned by the World Health Organization WHO and published in April that concluded there is high certainty evidence that cellphone radiation exposure causes two types of cancer in animals Wilkens called out the report for citing the stale 2022 systematic review and omitting the 2025 WHO systematic review

health risks from low intensity wireless radiation These studies in these reviews may not have been solely focused on effects on children but the findings are still relevant to children who are more

three agrochemicals atrazine chlorpyrifos and glyphosate that children are exposed through food water dust lawn treatments and household sprays However in its overall assessment of what it called crop protection tools the report said only that some studies have raised concerns about possible links between some of the products and children s health and that human studies on the issue are limited The report footnoted some key studies that have shown links between agrochemicals and health However it also noted that most products comply with the U S Environmental Protection Agency s EPA established

the environment he said However Freese said the report didn t mention the second part of the cumulative exposures issue which is the regulatory side Freese said the EPA has been charged with assessing cumulative pesticide assessment since the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act was passed but very little progress has been made On top of that different chemical exposures are regulated by different agencies Freese said There are regulatory silos which makes it nearly impossible to take on the broader question of cumulative exposures Pesticides are regulated under the Federal Insecticide Rodenticide and Fungicide Act industrial chemicals are regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act There s a different law for Superfund sites I don t see any analysis of how you overcome that Clearly Big Ag interests influenced the outcome of this report The study makes many calls for more scientific research into the issues it raises Freese said while more research is always good for some of these issues there s already enough science to take action For example the insecticide chlorpyrifos is a neurotoxin The herbicide Paraquat is acutely toxic and has strong links to Parkinson s disease which EPA acknowledges but it s still approved for use in the U S Glyphosate has clear links to non Hodgkin lymphoma In an article highlighting the report s limitations Honeycutt noted that it didn t mention harms from GMOs at all and that hundreds of studies have shown harms from glyphosate which ought to be addressed Clearly Big Ag interests influenced the outcome of this report she wrote Honeycutt said that when the report states that 99 of tested food samples are compliant with the EPA s safety limits it misleads readers to assume those standards are set at levels that would protect

infectious diseases they can have side effects that must be balanced against their benefits The report also acknowledged that many parents are concerned about the appropriate use of vaccines and their possible role in the growing childhood chronic disease crisis The report noted that since 1986 the number of recommended vaccines on the CDC s childhood immunization schedule increased from three to 29 and today exceeds the number of vaccinations on many European schedules A 2023 study connected the increase in vaccine doses given to infants to a higher infant mortality rate According to the report the expansion of the childhood vaccination schedule was accompanied by only a limited scientific inquiry into the links between vaccines and chronic disease the downsides of vaccine injury and conflicts of interest in the development of the vaccine schedule Highlighting deficiencies in the clinical trial process for vaccines the report called for more rigorous clinical trial designs including the use of true placebos larger sample sizes and longer follow up periods Many vaccines on the CDC s childhood schedule involved small participant groups had no inert placebo controlled trials and had limited safety monitoring some lasting six months or less raising concerns about the ability to detect rare or long term adverse effects the report stated Prior to any roll out of any

impede and undermine efforts in the MAHA movement No mention of liability shield for vaccine makers The report also noted deficiencies in the vaccine safety surveillance system noting that manufacturers are not required to list possible adverse events on their package inserts if there is inadequate evidence to accept or reject a causal relationship According to the report one of these systems the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS provides incomplete data because physicians aren t required to submit reports to the system and often don t diagnose a connection between a health condition and vaccination Data from another system the Vaccine Safety Datalink VSD is not generally available to scientists outside of the VSD network and is geared towards studying short term outcomes at the expense of identifying associations between vaccines and longer term chronic disease the report said Raising awareness regarding the flaws of the VAERS is an excellent point by the commission and it must be overhauled Perro said The report addressed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 under which the federal government offers compensation for injuries connected to routine childhood vaccines According to the report this is a conflict of interest because of the conflicting duty of HHS to monitor vaccine safety and to promote vaccines and to defend them against

compensation for injuries connected to routine childhood vaccines According to the report this is a conflict of interest because of the conflicting duty of HHS to monitor vaccine safety and to promote vaccines and to defend them against claims of injury in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program which covers vaccine injury claims for vaccines on the childhood schedule Critics pointed out that the report didn t address the liability shield provided by the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act PREP Act to vaccines issued under emergency use authorization EUA such as the COVID 19 shots or the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program which handles claims of injuries related to EUA vaccines Recent polls show a solid majority of Americans believe vaccine makers should be held liable for injuries caused by their products If the MAHA report aspires to truth telling its decision to neglect these realities may appear to the public not merely as an oversight but as a lack of moral and scientific courage particularly for those who have endured injury loss or marginalization in the name of public health Ji said Earlier this month the FDA announced the development of a new real time surveillance system to capture data on vaccine injuries In March HHS announced it would create a sub agency within the CDC focusing on vaccine injuries A concrete and encouraging sign of change to come According to the report scientific censorship which has worsened as the childhood vaccination schedule has expanded has stifled open discourse and inquiry Physicians who question or deviate from the CDC s vaccine schedule may face professional repercussions including censure from medical licensing boards the report stated According to the report the federal government has helped suppress such speech as federal agencies urged or in some cases pressed platforms to suppress content questioning pediatric vaccine risk profiles or school closure policies The ability to have open and honest discourse about vaccines has become nearly impossible with opposing sides in gridlock points of view Perro said It behooves the HHS and the FDA to take on this minefield perform real science and valid data free from bias and corporate capture and set the record straight Notably the report did not directly address one frequently suppressed narrative the potential connection between vaccines and autism though it did note that autism diagnoses have skyrocketed in recent decades from less than 1 in 10 000 children in 1960 to 1 in 31 children today Referring to these figures during

Cory Booker has introduced a bill that would give Americans the right to hold pesticide makers accountable for the harm they cause It s time for MAHA to build a nonpartisan alliance for a healthy America You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up On July 17 Sen Cory Booker D N J introduced a provocative piece of legislation the Pesticide Injury Accountability Act designed to guarantee Americans the right to sue pesticide manufacturers for proven harms caused by their products The bill is a direct response to recent efforts at the federal and state levels to grant liability immunity to global pesticide corporations like Monsanto now owned by Germany s Bayer and Syngenta owned by ChemChina Booker s legislation has been endorsed by 18 organizations including farmers groups and notably many of the largest grassroots Make America Healthy Again MAHA organizations including Moms Across America Global Wellness Forum and Children s Health Defense CHD These aren t just the usual environmental NGOs but represent the very heart of the movement widely credited with an instrumental role in President Donald Trump s 2024 election victory So what are they doing supporting a Democrat sponsored piece of legislation The answer is simple Pesticides are an issue of central concern to the MAHA movement MAHA isn t just about medical freedom vaccine safety and ultraprocessed foods It is active across many health related issues including plastic pollution toxic chemicals in air soil and water regeneration of healthy soil restoration and protection of family farms and local food production wildlife conservation electromagnetic pollution and yes pesticides There is virtually no MAHA supporter who favors pesticide liability shields which imitate the much despised vaccine liability shield enacted in 1986 at the behest of Big Pharma The pesticide liability shield is even worse lacking even the inadequate reporting system and compensation court that exists for vaccines Despite clear scientific evidence linking pesticides like glyphosate and paraquat to cancers birth defects Parkinson s disease and infertility the U S permits 85 pesticides banned in countries across Europe China and Brazil Shockingly glyphosate is found in 80 of Americans tested and 87 of children according to CDC data Few Republicans seem to understand how important this issue is to the MAHA base Republican legislatures in Georgia and North Dakota have passed liability shields and many more are trying House Republicans just inserted liability shield language into this

settlements related to glyphosate linked cancers and Syngenta recently agreed to a 187 5 million settlement over paraquat related Parkinson s disease claims Shielding these foreign owned corporations shifts the costs onto consumers farmers and the healthcare system U S Health Secretary Kennedy has made huge strides toward realizing MAHA priorities within the U S Department of Health and Human Services However the same cannot be said for the U S Department of Agriculture USDA or the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA where recent appointments of food and chemical industry lobbyists to policy positions starkly contradict the MAHA mission In March the administration killed USDA grants that let schools and food banks buy produce from local farmers This gut punch to family farmers also pushes kids toward the ultra processed food Kennedy is trying to control Meanwhile EPA chief Lee Zeldin moved to loosen restrictions on PFAS forever chemicals and to narrow Clean Water Act protections opening millions of acres to contamination Such actions risk derailing the very agenda that galvanized MAHA supporters in the first place At this moment when old alignments are wavering these

populist base There is no constituency for pesticide poisoning microplastics or toxic waste Republican congresspeople have a chance in Tuesday s Ag Committee meeting and Appropriations Markup meeting

experts said it s time to sunset the law that protects people who inject children with COVID 19 vaccines even when parents object You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The Maine Supreme Judicial Court has upheld a lower court ruling that school medical staff who gave a COVID 19 vaccine to a minor without obtaining parental consent cannot be held liable On March 4 the court ruled that school medical staff were protected under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act PREP Act The PREP Act provides a liability shield to covered persons including those who administer COVID 19 or other countermeasures during a public health emergency COVID 19 vaccines are covered under the PREP Act because they were rolled out under emergency use authorization EUA In November 2021 J H a minor was given a dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 vaccine at Miller School in Waldoboro Maine In May 2023 J H s parents Siara Harrington and Jeremiah Hogan who said they did not consent to the vaccination sued Lincoln Medical Partners MaineHealth and pediatrician Dr Andrew Russ The lawsuit originally filed in Lincoln County Superior Court challenged the PREP Act s liability shield The complaint alleged battery negligence false imprisonment infliction of emotional distress and tortious interference with parental rights In April 2024 the Maine Superior Court dismissed the lawsuit finding that the PREP Act granted immunity to the defendants J H s parents appealed to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court in August 2024 arguing that the PREP Act does not protect practitioners from liability in cases involving nonconsensual medical interventions The appeal also referenced the Project Bioshield Act of 2004 which states that people must have the option to accept or refuse administration of EUA products In its ruling the Maine Supreme Judicial Court found that the staff who administered the vaccine to J H were immune under the PREP Act because they were covered persons as defined by the act and because the vaccine was classified as a covered countermeasure and was administered during a public health emergency The court also ruled that the lawsuit contained no viable claim for willful misconduct the only exception to the PREP Act s liability shield and that the PREP Act supersedes state law even for battery claims F R Jenkins an attorney for the plaintiffs disagreed with the decision He said the EUA statute clearly states that Americans have the right to accept or refuse covered countermeasures but that the court did not consider this in

Flores senior outside counsel to Children s Health Defense CHD and an expert on the PREP Act said the Maine court ruling is part of a trend in which state and federal courts have ruled in favor of the PREP Act s immunity provisions There is more than enough case precedent going back 13 years for the PREP s preclusion for battery of a minor Flores said The Maine opinion cites the cases The Maine ruling comes just a week after the U S Supreme Court refused a petition to review a lower court s ruling in a similar lawsuit in Vermont Politella v Windham Southeast School District In that case the school gave the vaccine to a 6 year old boy despite his and his parents objections In July 2024 the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that the PREP Act shielded school officials from liability John Klar attorney for the plaintiffs in the Vermont case said the U S Supreme Court s subsequent decision to deny the plaintiff s petition means the Politella case remains binding but only in Vermont and only for now The Supreme Court s denial of the petition doesn t set precedent and doesn t render an opinion on the merits of the case Flores said However according to Klar the Maine Supreme Judicial Court

forever chemicals have been widely used since the 1950s in products including cosmetics cookware clothing carpeting food packaging and firefighting foam Researchers say they permeate water systems and

given rapidly evolving scientific information and few established protocols The work I do is exhausting and time consuming and sometimes frustrating Criswell said but it s exactly what I should be doing Phil Brown a Northeastern University sociology professor and a co director of the PFAS Project Lab said the medical community doesn t know a lot about occupational and environmental health adding that it s a very minimal part of the medical school curriculum and continuing education Courtney Carignan an environmental epidemiologist at Michigan State University said learning of PFAS exposure whether from their drinking water or occupational sources is a sensitive and upsetting situation for people and it s helpful if their doctors can take it seriously Clinical guidance concerning PFAS improved after the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine released a report on PFAS in 2022 It found strong evidence associating PFAS with kidney cancer high cholesterol reduced birth weights and lower antibody responses to vaccines and some evidence linking PFAS to breast and testicular cancer ulcerative colitis thyroid and liver dysfunction and pregnancy induced hypertension That guidance revolutionized my practice Criswell said Instead of being this hand wavey thing where we don t know how to apply the research it brought a degree of concreteness to

finding out in 2021 that his family was exposed to PFAS through sludge spread on their Unity Maine farm decades earlier Adam Nordell discovered that it was exceedingly difficult to get tested Our family doctor had not heard of PFAS and didn t know what the test was he said A lab technician needed coaching from an outside expert to source the test The lab analyzing the samples had a backlog that left the family waiting three months The results were devastating but incredibly helpful Nordell said Their blood serum levels for PFAS were at roughly the 99th percentile nationally far higher than their well water levels would have predicted indicating that additional exposure was probably coming from other sources such as soil contact dust and food Blood levels of PFAS between 2 and 20 nanograms per milliliter may be problematic the national academies reported In highly contaminated settings blood levels can run upward of 150 times the 20 ng mL risk threshold Nordell and his family had been planning to remain on the farm and grow crops less affected by PFAS but the test results persuaded them to leave Knowledge is power Nordell said and having the blood data gave us agency The national academies guidance paved the way for more clinicians to order PFAS blood tests The cost typically 400 to 600 can be prohibitive if not picked up by insurance and not all insurers cover the testing Deductibles and copays can also limit patients capacity to get tested Less costly finger prick tests administered at home appear to capture some of the more commonly found PFAS as accurately as blood serum tests Carignan and colleagues found Maine legislators recently passed with overwhelming support a bill modeled after one in New Hampshire that would require insurers to consider PFAS blood testing part of preventive care but it was carried over to the next legislative session In my mind it s a no brainer that the PFAS blood serum test should be universally offered at no cost to

Criswell served on an advisory committee tasked with allocating 60 million in state funds to address PFAS contamination from past sludge spreading in Maine The group recommended that labs analyzing PFAS blood tests should report the results to state public health authorities That change slated to take effect this summer will allow Maine health officials to follow up with people who have high PFAS blood levels to better determine potential sources and to share information on health risks and medical screening As with many earlier PFAS policies Maine is among the first states to adopt this

you can take to reduce your exposure Maine residents for example are warned of PCB contamination in fish and shellfish allowing them to make the smart choice to avoid these contaminated products PCBs are chemical compounds that were produced by the biotech company Monsanto and were used in a wide range of products due to their capacity to withstand high temperatures and pressure However they were banned in 1979 after their carcinogenic potential and toxicity were revealed although Monsanto has known about their toxicity for decades Now the biotech giant now under Bayer is being sued once again this time by Aaron Frey the attorney general of Maine I am taking action to demand that Monsanto pay for the harm it knowingly caused our state he said Monsanto accused of decades long campaign of misinformation and deception On April 11 Frey filed a 47 page complaint in Cumberland County Superior Court accusing Monsanto of selling PCBs despite being aware of their dangers to human health wildlife and the environment According to an article published on the Maine Wire The complaint alleges that Monsanto despite early knowledge of the grave dangers associated with PCBs ran a decades long campaign of misinformation and deception to increase their rate of manufacture and sale of PCBs in Maine and elsewhere From 1960 to the mid 1970s alone Monsanto sold at least hundreds of thousands of pounds of commercial PCB mixtures to customers in Maine the suit reads PCBs have caused extensive damage to the state s resources polluting over 400 river stream miles and over 1 9 million ocean acres classifying them as impaired due to the presence of these chemicals The lawsuit claims that PCB specific fish and shellfish consumption advisories have also been issued by the

consisting of hydrogen carbon and chlorine atoms They have no taste or smell and have a liquid structure that s either oily or waxy They were first produced in 1929 by the Swann Chemical Corporation During that time PCBs were sought after chemicals because of their extreme resistance to high temperatures and pressure making them valuable for use as fire retardants and insulators The U S Environmental Protection Agency s EPA website lists some of the uses of PCBs in industrial and commercial applications such as Electrical and hydraulic equipment as well as heat transfer applications Paints as plasticizers plastics and rubber products Carbonless copy paper Pigments and dyes After Monsanto purchased and absorbed Swann Chemical in 1935 they continued to manufacture and commercialize PCBs sold under the brand name Aroclor licensing these chemicals to other companies as well Up until its ban overall global production of PCBs was estimated to be between 1 and 1 5 million tonnes The Maine Wire reports Monsanto manufactured and sold PCBs from about 1935 to 1977 during that period accounting for 99 percent or more of all PCBs used or sold within the U S and used PCBs in a wide variety of products including paints caulks inks dyes lubricants plastics and other applications Frey says that he has copies of Monsanto s internal memos verifying his claims that the company was aware of the risks of PCBs but chose to turn a blind eye for the sake of profit There are dozens of lawsuits concerning PCBs dangers Frey s complaint adds to the growing list of lawsuits against Monsanto over their PCB products In December 2023 the biotech giant was ordered to pay 857 million to students and parents from a Washington state school who claimed that the PCBs from fluorescent light fixtures triggered brain damage autoimmune disorders and other health issues In a CBS News article Keri C Hornbuckle a professor and environmental engineer at the University of Iowa said

first state in the country to require older schools to test their indoor air for these chemicals The lawsuit states that removing PCBs can be expensive as it could require demolishing buildings and building new ones This could potentially cost hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars Monsanto responds claims allegations are meritless The Maine Wire reports that Frey is also seeking damages for the injuries and contamination Monsanto s toxic chemicals caused to the people and the environment This will cover the costs needed for cleaning monitoring and mitigating the state s waterways that have been polluted by PCBs In response to the Maine lawsuit Monsanto issued a statement claiming that they have strong defenses and will vigorously defend against these claims According to their press release We will respond to the complaint in greater detail in court at the appropriate time however we believe this case is meritless as Monsanto never manufactured or disposed of PCBs in the State of Maine and any PCB containing products that could be the source of any impairments in the state were manufactured and disposed by third parties Under applicable law a manufacturer of component parts is not responsible for the downstream third party uses of a product that it lawfully introduced into the stream of commerce and over which it has had no control for nearly five decades

media as being the state s first case in four years was vaccine induced according to documents released Tuesday by Informed Consent Action Network ICAN Kim Mack Rosenberg general counsel for Children s Health Defense told The Defender that measles outbreaks are a well worn tactic of state and federal governmental agencies to churn up fears about people who choose not to vaccinate or who do so

vaccine related According to the Mayo Clinic measles is a viral infection typically accompanied by a skin rash fever cough runny nose sore throat inflamed eyes and tiny white spots on the inner cheek On May 5 2023 Maine s Department of Health and Human Services warned that the Maine CDC had been notified of a positive measles test ostensibly the state s first measles case since 2019 The health department said the child received a dose of measles vaccine and that Maine CDC officials were considering the child to be infectious out of an abundance of caution The news was quickly picked up by mainstream news outlets such as CNN which blamed low vaccination rates for recent measles outbreaks and USA Today which stressed that the best way to prevent measles is for children and babies as young as 12 months to get the MMR measles mumps and rubella vaccine However the child s May 3 2023 test results which ICAN obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request revealed that the measles strain was consistent with vaccine strain meaning the vaccine caused the child s rash symptoms Roughly 2 of people who get a measles vaccine develop a rash according to a World Health Organization report But the Maine CDC never went public about this information Nearly two weeks after the testing was done the Maine CDC on May 16 2023 announced that the child didn t have an infectious strain of

identified Yet when the true nature of this child s exposure was revealed she said ranks were closed to prevent the truth from getting out Karl Jablonowski Ph D a senior research scientist at CHD told

their immunization status should get vaccinated Fear mongering is formulaic danger solution and vilify those who do not conform he said If it s well executed and done in coordination with media it may

in an earlier interview it doesn t make sense to assume the unvaccinated are to blame She said cyclical outbreaks still occur even in populations with nearly 100 vaccination such as college students The overwhelming majority of the approximately 130 000 measles deaths annually occur in countries in the global south that have weak health infrastructures according to the World Health Organization Those deaths along with measles hospitalizations in the global north are associated with vitamin A deficiency Measles can be deadly if a child does not have access to safe water and medical care Mumper said In developed countries fatalities from measles are very rare Effective treatments include vitamin A in high doses and attention to hydration status Mumper said Other pediatricians who spoke with The Defender said it s likely better for a U S child to get a measles infection than to receive an MMR vaccine Dr Michelle Perro a pediatrician said the idea of vaccinating children to protect them from getting measles isn t completely without merit It is worth noting that training the immune system to recognize deleterious foreign pathogens has had public health success However the risks associated with the MMR vaccine since it s nearly impossible to get a single measles vaccine outweigh getting measles due to the rise in neurocognitive and other health challenges directly caused by the MMR vaccine which contains toxic excipients she said Dr Paul Thomas a retired pediatrician and author of Vax Facts What to Consider Before Vaccinating at All Ages All Stages of Life agreed He said the MMR vaccine is associated with many serious side effects including seizures encephalopathy death and autism Perro said children s health took a big hit when Big Pharma and the

in the fine print of Monday s approval by the U S Food and Drug Administration of the Pfizer Comirnaty COVID vaccine are two critical facts that affect whether the vaccine can be mandated and whether Pfizer can be held liable for injuries You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Monday the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA approved a biologics license application for the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine The press reported that vaccine mandates are now legal for military healthcare workers college students and employees in many industries New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has now required the vaccine for all teachers and school staff The Pentagon is proceeding with its mandate for all military service members But there are several bizarre aspects to the FDA approval that will prove confusing to those not familiar with the pervasiveness of the FDA s regulatory capture or the depths of the agency s cynicism First the FDA acknowledges that while Pfizer has insufficient stocks of the newly licensed Comirnaty vaccine available there is a significant amount of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine produced under Emergency Use Authorization EUA still available for use The FDA decrees that the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine under the EUA should remain unlicensed but can be used interchangeably page 2 footnote 8 with the newly licensed Comirnaty product Second the FDA pointed out that the licensed Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine and the existing EUA Pfizer vaccine are legally distinct but proclaims that their differences do not impact safety or effectiveness There is a huge real world difference between products approved under EUA compared with those the FDA has fully licensed EUA products are experimental under U S law Both the Nuremberg Code and federal regulations provide that no one can force a human being to participate in this experiment Under 21 U S Code Sec 360bbb 3 e 1 A ii III authorization for medical products for use in emergencies it is unlawful to deny someone a job or an education because they refuse to be an experimental subject Instead potential recipients have an absolute right to refuse EUA vaccines U S laws however permit employers and schools to require students and workers to take licensed vaccines EUA approved COVID vaccines have an extraordinary liability shield under the 2005 Public Readiness and Preparedness Act Vaccine manufacturers

to date and not a single COVID vaccine injury despite the fact that physicians families and injured vaccine recipients have reported more than 600 000 COVID vaccine injuries At least for the moment the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine has no liability shield Vials of the branded product which say Comirnaty on the label are subject to the same product liability laws as other U S products When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices places a vaccine on the mandatory schedule a childhood vaccine benefits from a generous retinue of liability protections But licensed adult vaccines including the new Comirnaty do not enjoy any liability shield Just as with Ford s exploding Pinto or Monsanto s herbicide Roundup people injured by the Comirnaty vaccine could potentially sue for damages And because adults injured by the vaccine will be able to show that the manufacturer knew of the problems with the product jury awards could be astronomical Pfizer is therefore unlikely to allow any American to take a Comirnaty vaccine until it can somehow arrange immunity for this product Given this background the FDA s acknowledgement in its approval letter that there are insufficient stocks of the licensed Comirnaty but an abundant supply of the EUA Pfizer BioNTech jab exposes the approval as a cynical scheme to encourage businesses and schools to impose illegal jab mandates The FDA s clear motivation is to enable Pfizer to quickly unload inventories of a vaccine that science and the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System have

handouts to install expensive manure digesters that capture and burn methane and generate profits from the waste But the systems don t reduce greenhouse gas emissions they just move the pollution around You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By John E Peck There has been much media hype about manure digesters and how they will solve climate change by capturing and burning methane from confined animal feeding operations CAFOs aka factory farms Billions in taxpayer handouts and other incentives through pollution offset trading markets are encouraging factory farms to expand and profit from their waste stream Some economists now speculate that factory farms are earning more from making methane than milk A recent Friends of the Earth and Socially Responsible Agriculture Project report goes even further suggesting that if the U S really wanted to reduce its agricultural contribution toward greenhouse gases it would make more sense for regulators to phase out or split up CAFOs and shift taxpayer support toward smaller grass based livestock operations instead Sadly the misguided notion of manure digesters as a solution to the climate crisis is nothing new Back in 2009 at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen I almost fell off my chair when then U S Department of Agriculture USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that manure digesters on factory farms were going to be a key part of former President Barack Obama s climate change agenda He later admitted that less than 10 of dairy farms i e CAFOs would be large enough to qualify for these USDA digester grants another example of how federal policies support industrial agribusiness to the detriment of smaller farmers This manure digester building binge has ramped up even more under President Joe Biden with Vilsack once again back at the helm of the USDA The latest Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy report critiquing the Environmental Quality Incentive Program EQIP reveals just how much of this popular USDA effort has been hijacked by a small elite number of CAFOs to the detriment of the majority of farmers who have their EQIP applications declined Encouraging livestock grazing is NOT front and center among climate smart practices promoted under EQIP and the Natural Resources Conservation Service that star role is held by waste lagoons and manure digesters A typical CAFO digester for 2000 dairy cows costs over 2 million with EQIP covering up to 400 000 But there are many other funds available such as through the Rural Energy for America Program REAP which bankrolled 78 million for digesters in the last decade The recent Inflation Reduction Act added another 250 million to EQIP along with another 2 billion for REAP including a brand

industrial complex is long and deep but there is even more potential revenue to be milked In Wisconsin alone there are now 15 manure digesters getting money for their methane offsetting of 1 3 million carbon credits available through the California Cap and Trade System How does this work Build a methane digester in Wisconsin claim that by burning off this really bad methane it is equal to reducing the impact of so many tons of carbon dioxide emitted in California and then get a bonus check for that hard offset work The value of one carbon credit on the California market as of April 2023 was 28 66 The problem with this taxpayer mandated and subsidized cap and trade system is that it does not necessarily reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions it just moves pollution around and the atmosphere doesn t care about your zip code Worse yet if your offset claims prove to be bogus and corrupt the climate crisis ends up much worse This was exactly the case when Midwest activists alerted California officials that some of the Wisconsin CAFOs claiming methane offset credits were really engaged in wire fraud since their digesters were either broken or not effectively functioning to capture methane as claimed More details can be found in the Socially Responsible Agriculture Project expose of this 21st century Ponzi style scheme Along with many allies Family Farm Defenders has been diligently opposing such corporatized pollution trading mechanisms through the Alliance Against Farm Bill Offsets whether they involve offsets for carbon sequestration pipelines manure digesters or no till genetically modified organism monocultures My gut reaction 15 years ago to Vilsack s manure digester panacea to global climate change remains true today why pay to fix a problem that doesn t even need to exist Countless studies have shown that the most cost effective eco friendly and often quite profitable form of animal husbandry including dairying is managed rotational grazing If animals are just allowed to enjoy pasture outside as they prefer and are meant to do by mother nature and then also allowed to deposit their manure in a healthy perennial ecosystem one does not end up with a methane

liquefy millions of gallons of their manure and then store it in massive anaerobic lagoons that one creates a pollutant 80 times worse than carbon dioxide Sure one can always capture and burn the methane that doesn t leak from a CAFO digester to make electricity or run a vehicle which means more greenhouse gas pollution but you still have the leftover sludge aka digestate to deal with This is loaded with nitrates phosphorous and depending upon what other waste gets dumped into the digester a group of chemicals known as PFAS pharmaceuticals agrochemicals heavy metals which will then seep into the ground and become part of runoff contributing to tainted wells beach closures toxic fish the list goes on and on Besides methane there are other toxic CAFO gases such as hydrogen sulfide ammonia and nitrous oxide that cause chronic headaches for neighboring residents and hurt anyone else downwind And let s not forget the ever present danger of methane explosions and lagoon ruptures When a massive lagoon leaked on a hog factory farm in Wayne County North Carolina in May 2022 spilling into the nearby Nahunta Swamp it was revealed that hundreds of rotting pigs along with deli meat and discarded hotdogs were part of the digester feedstock to make the methane being sold to Duke Energy Closer to home just ask anyone who lives near Waunakee Wisconsin what it was like to have a poorly designed and managed digester both explode and also leak 400 000 gallons of fresh manure into Lake Mendota about a decade ago This single disaster set back Yahara Watershed cleanup efforts for years It would have been so much cheaper simpler and less disastrous for Wisconsin state and Dane County taxpayers to have promoted composting instead which some better CAFOs actually do without

Christensen connected some of the adverse events and chronic health issues experienced by those who received the COVID 19 vaccines with hormonal disruptions caused by their ingredients Christensen told The Defender she has observed these effects in her patients For me it was the hormonal imbalances that really caught my attention she said citing postmenopausal women who suddenly started bleeding out of nowhere and women with very irregular cycles having ovarian cysts having pelvic pain infertility challenges and miscarriages What really really disturbed me is that there were three fetal deaths in our practice Christensen added There was a fetal death of 35 weeks one at 37 weeks and one girl who had a placental abruption during delivery I ve never had that before Christensen

brain fog If you re not producing appropriate energy in the heart then you start getting arrhythmias and the heart muscle not working correctly When you re getting damaged mitochondria in the ovaries and testes it s going to impact egg and sperm production The spike proteins can lead to neurodegenerative type of symptoms including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or POTS she said Spike protein toxicity and subsequent mitochondrial damage can also trigger autoimmune diseases Christensen said The spike protein is triggering production of massive amounts of antibodies and cytokines and some of those antibodies are antibodies against ourselves and also antibodies that are involved in not allowing cancer cells to keep themselves in check she said We are finding spike protein in the testes and ovaries Not only are we getting disrupted signals from the hypothalamus to the ovaries and testes but we are also having direct inflammatory hits from the spike protein itself which is being found because of the lipid nanoparticles in the ovaries in testes triggering inflammation Christensen added And so we are disrupting the normal metabolism and excretion of hormones So you get recirculation of old hormones throwing off the balance Christensen added Other forms of vaccine contamination also played a role in causing adverse health effects including aggressive cancers according to Christensen There s a lot of unusual sequences in the vaccine that we know are not found in nature These include an SV40 segment which we know is involved in tumors and cancerous growths As a result Christensen said We are seeing suppression of the immune system and overactivation of a different part of the immune system suppression of the innate and overactivation of the adaptive So we re seeing rapid growth of onset of stage four cancers without any previous symptoms We also know that there are other unusual immune suppressing segments within the spike protein that are dysregulating our immune system significantly They re suppressing the part of the immune system that s called the innate which goes after viruses and bacteria and parasites and cancer cells in our

adverse health effects We know that COVID was not a normal viral pneumonia she said It was a vasculitis It was an inflammation particularly in the very small blood vessels and treatment of that inflammation is what helped heal people She added The inflammation in the blood vessels caused lots of clots to form and micro clots The microclots gather together and they make some very big clots And these clots also have very unusual architecture to them They re not normal blood clots that we re seeing We re seeing lots of tiny micro clots very similar to mold toxicity Christensen who has 23 years of experience diagnosing and treating toxic mold exposures said they lead to suppression of your innate immune systems You can t go after cancer cells you can t go after the viruses and bacteria that are in your body so you get recurrent infections and then you re over inflaming the adaptive immune system Vaccines may cause constant fight or flight mode Christensen said vaccine toxicity targets the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal HPA axis which she said controls the entire hormonal system in the body The hypothalamus is the master regulatory center in the brain which receives input from all the rest of the body and then sends signals to the pituitary gland to produce hormones that drive various functions from ovulation to sexual intercourse she said Christensen said If we are in chronic stress or chronically inflamed or have a chronically disrupted gut microbiome then we are sending signals to our brain that say I m anxious I m distressed I can t sleep I m very confused The hypothalamus has mixed signals that it s sending to the rest of the body and therefore we can see disruption in normal hormonal cycles This may spur excess production of adrenaline leading to a chronic state where you re in fight or flight mode constantly Christensen said As a result hormone disruption occurs and you can t heal Spike proteins and vaccine contamination may also impact gastrointestinal health Christensen said We know that COVID and the spike protein have damaged a lot of gut microbiome getting rid of the bacteria that are supposed to be helpful and causing

estrogens We call that estrogen dominance she said This leads to excess quantities of estrogen which can make the lining of the uterus grow leading to heavy bleeding problems growth of uterine

mental health is multifactorial According to Christensen COVID related restrictions put our entire population into a fight or flight state for months on end This along with using shame and guilt for people who didn t comply contributed severely to anxiety and depression Anxiety and depression trigger other effects in the human brain Christensen said Then you have the impact again to the adrenal the HPA axis and the brain in constant overdrive constant neuroinflammation being constantly confused That s going to contribute to anxiety depression insomnia OCD obsessive compulsive disorder

to massive increases in suicide and helplessness and hopelessness Christensen said the vaccines also contribute to histamine dumping in the brain Histamine is a chemical released by the immune system Now you re disrupting neurotransmitters and you re releasing all kinds of histamine And histamine is what s involved in a lot of psychotic behaviors and schizophrenia and just plain old anxiety and

days leading up to the incoming Trump administration Mark Zuckerberg reversed his stance on fact checking In a video announcing these changes Zuckerberg admitted that their efforts to address this issue had created more problems than they resolved He stated that he would be replacing fact checkers with community notes similar to those used on X formerly Twitter The fact checkers have been too politically biased and have eroded more trust than they have built Zuckerberg said Facebook filters scanned posts and took down any possible policy violations The problem is that the filters make mistakes and they take down a lot of content that they shouldn t said Zuckerberg They sure did when it came to the pandemic In November 2020 Facebook marked one of our articles published in The Spectator as potential misinformation with the explanation Independent fact checkers reviewed the information and said it was missing context and could mislead people Then they included a link to a mysterious website called HealthFeedback one of the groups of self appointed censors and witch hunters they used We posted the original text that was submitted to The Spectator in February 2023 The pandemic saw censorship disinformation retrofitting of evidence to bolster policy and the political use of masks as a visible symbol that governments were seen to be doing something Facebook ensured that drunk on power the politicians and their advisers went unchallenged Whether the policies worked or not didn t matter Without dissenting voices challenging the government s pandemic policies the

use the standard antibiotic indicated for treating her pneumonia until it was too late Even after CHD exposed the accurate cause of death The New York Times reported the 6 year old died from measles

Kelleher Residents of a Maryland community afflicted with contamination from harmful chemicals are demanding that a local soybean processing plant immediately stop releasing toxic per and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS into their drinking and groundwater in violation of a federal law that governs the disposal of hazardous waste Attorneys representing two residents of Salisbury Maryland on April 29 sent a letter to Perdue Agribusiness as well as state and federal regulators warning that they intend to sue the company in 90 days if it continues violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act The Notice of Intent NOI to sue calls on the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the Maryland Department of the Environment MDE to enforce the law By allegedly continuing to release and improperly dispose of these PFAS from its facility Perdue s actions may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment says the letter The notice comes on the heels of a class action lawsuit filed in October 2024 in the U S District Court for the District of Maryland on behalf of six residents of Salisbury a city of about 33 000 people in Maryland s Eastern Shore region who live down the road from the facility Perdue Farms the parent company of Perdue Agribusiness was founded in Salisbury 105 years ago and currently has 21 facilities across the U S The lawsuit was filed after MDE stated in a September 2024 letter that it was designating Perdue a responsible person for the contamination noting that well and surface water sampling data west of the plant are suggestive of a regional PFAS contamination plume traceable to the Site The class action suit calls for the company to pay to clean up the PFAS contamination and to fund a medical monitoring program for those exposed to the chemicals In February Perdue filed a motion to dismiss or stay the case pending completion of MDE s investigation of the PFAS contamination stating that the Plaintiffs raced to the courthouse without sufficient facts In early April the plaintiffs responded with a request for a hearing on the motion Chase Brockstedt an attorney for the

in partnership with MDE to address the issue said Andrea Staub Perdue Farms senior vice president for corporate communications The recent NOI does not change our plan of action she added Salisbury is one of a growing number of agricultural communities across the country struggling with PFAS pollution as the chemicals are increasingly detected on farmland The contamination is linked to a longstanding practice of the land application of sewage sludge as fertilizer or groundwater contaminated by PFAS PFAS is also increasingly added to pesticides sprayed on crops according to a 2024 study with the federal regulators currently poised to approve a new PFAS containing pesticide ingredient developed by the agrichemical company Syngenta But while recent lawsuits have been filed related to contamination from PFAS in sewage sludge the litigation against the Perdue soybean processing facility in Salisbury may be the first of its kind potentially serving as a canary in the coal mine for future PFAS legal actions I m unaware of another PFAS case out there that has an agribusiness facility like this one said Brockstedt If there s not one already pending I would imagine it s only a matter of time Grappling with contamination Over 350 wells in Salisbury are reportedly contaminated with PFAS chemicals which have been linked to certain cancers liver damage thyroid problems

contamination are ongoing according to the letter The local Perdue facility has allegedly contaminated the community through lagoons that leak PFAS laced wastewater and sludge discharges into a local stream spraying highly contaminated wastewater on croplands and forest and improper disposal of polluted soil among other practices The MDE in 2023 discovered PFAS levels as high as 33 parts per trillion ppt for perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA and 1500 ppt for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid PFOS in wastewater sprayed on the local crops and forest lands The EPA in April 2024 set limits of just 4 ppt for both PFAS chemicals which an international cancer research group classified as carcinogenic and possibly carcinogenic to humans respectively Even after finding high levels of the chemicals in its groundwater Perdue waited almost a year before informing people living near the plant that their drinking water was likely contaminated according to the letter The source of the PFAS in the groundwater at our Perdue AgriBusiness facility has not been determined the company says on its website Working with MDE Perdue AgriBusiness is dedicated to actively investigating all possibilities including other potential sources in the area A report conducted in January by Langan Engineering and Environmental Services a consultant investigating Salisbury s groundwater contamination pointed to a 2019 discharge of PFAS containing firefighting foam as one of several potential sources We think that s a distraction and a red herring said Brockstedt We don t think that is remotely the source of this contamination The PFAS chemicals the plant allegedly continues to discharge could be entering the facility through the soybean crops it processes or it could be related to what s happening during the refining process he added We re not 100 sure yet Since November Perdue has been installing PFAS treatment systems to treat drinking water on impacted properties at no cost to residents according to its website The company has also been providing free bottled water to residents living within the area being tested for PFAS it says In January the company s associates in Salisbury donated over 100 000 to the American Cancer Society Perdue s Salisbury soybean facility previously came under fire for air pollution violations with MDE announcing a 12 million settlement with the company in July

residents urged state lawmakers not to eliminate religious exemptions from school vaccine mandates and not to allow minor children to be vaccinated at school without the consent of a parent The state s Joint Committee on Public Health last week heard public testimony on several bills including bills 2554 in the House and 1557 in the Senate that would eliminate religious exemption for school required vaccines and a bill 1618 in the Senate that would among other things allow minors to consent to vaccination without parental consent or knowledge regardless of age or mental capacity The committee is expected to vote on the bills soon Candice Edwards executive director of Health Action Massachusetts one of the many Massachusetts residents who testified in opposition to the bills told The Defender that for decades Massachusetts residents have relied on the state s religious exemption to make deeply personal value based decisions about their children s health Taking that away would force many to choose between violating their conscience or losing access to school childcare and even college Edwards said Children s Health Defense CEO Mary Holland who attended the hearing remotely said Massachusetts efforts smack of politics not common sense or public health Massachusetts should follow the lead of 46 states that successfully balance religious rights with public health Michael Kane founder of Teachers for Choice who attended the hearing remotely and will interview Edwards about the bills on Tuesday s episode of Good Morning CHD said he was very impressed with the response from Massachusetts citizens He estimated that over 90 of the testimony delivered at the hearing urged support for medical freedom parental and religious rights Edwards agreed We showed up as parents grandparents immigrants doctors scientists educators and faith leaders Voices from every background across faiths ethnicities and life experiences stood united She added This fight is not just about opposing vaccines it s about preserving parental rights religious liberty and equal access to education for all families For decades families in Massachusetts have relied on the religious exemption to make deeply personal decisions grounded in faith and values about their children s health Taking that away would force many to choose between violating their conscience or losing access to school with

and first generation Americans all came forward to show that this issue doesn t just affect a few it affects all of us In addition to voicing opposition to the bills that threatened religious exemptions and parents rights citizens voiced support for a measure 2541 in the House and 347 in the Senate which would preserve existing law governing religious exemptions for school required vaccines According to Health Action Massachusetts the measure would also broaden and clarify the criteria doctors can use when considering medical exemptions for school attendance and protect doctors from professional repercussions for issuing medical exemptions Here s what the Massachusetts bills would do The bills that threaten religious exemptions House bill 2554 and Senate bill 1557 have different titles but identical text According to Edwards the measure would eliminate religious exemptions for school required vaccines leaving only medical exemptions The bills also mandate schools to report immunization data to the Department of Public Health and would allow the Department of Public Health to publish school level data on vaccination and exemption rates Edwards said She said Senate Bill 1618 An Act Promoting Community Immunity is a roughly nine page bill that is complicated coercive and deeply harmful not just to students but also to schools families and doctors Holland noted that a more accurate title for the bill would be the community coercion bill rather than the community immunity bill The bill which would apply to public and private K 12 schools childcare centers preschools summer camps after school programs and colleges claims to improve immunization reporting but it goes far beyond that Edwards said According to Edwards here is what the Community Immunity Act would do Allow minors regardless of age or mental capacity to consent to vaccines and other preventative care without a parent s knowledge or consent Require parents to apply for state approval every year for both religious and medical exemptions separately for each school or program their child attends Offer no appeal process if an exemption is denied leaving families with no recourse Force

listened remarkably well to the eight hours of testimony something that didn t happen in past years he said Now with Robert F Kennedy Jr serving as U S Health and Human Services Secretary politicians are seeing that the medical freedom vote has truly changed the political landscape Kane said He added I think Massachusetts is very aware there s a microscope on them and that if they re going to try to pull this off by repealing religious exemptions and undermining parents rights they better dot their I s and cross their T s All eyes are on Massachusetts right now just as all eyes were on Hawaii a few months ago Residents in Hawaii recently killed a bill that included a provision that would have removed residents right to religious exemptions from vaccines Kane said he was very encouraged by

bill that would have removed religious exemptions However the bill never made it to a full vote due to massive opposition It just kind of fizzled after hundreds of people voiced opposition to it during an online hearing Ingham said She recalled They invited people to come online for three minutes each and there were 400 or 500 people online and they let all of them testify It was amazing It went on for hours and hours and hours The majority of those who testified spoke against the bill she added Edwards said that bills aiming to remove religious exemptions were introduced even before

equipment at the Pittsfield tower operates well under the FCC s conservative limits as confirmed by the city s own RF study from last summer Susan Foster a medical writer who organized a SPECT brain scan pilot study of California firefighters in 2004 said Verizon and other telecom giants championed by the FCC and the U S Food and Drug Administration hide behind the illusion that their cell towers produce only a small fraction of what the FCC allows The truth is the FCC set those limits extraordinarily high for several purposes and one is to offer the illusion of safety Foster said She added Every time one of the carriers wants to come in and place a cell tower near your child s school or in the midst of a residential neighborhood telecom representatives come before a local planning board and present carefully orchestrated routines in which they say The cell tower we are proposing for this site measures at 1 1000 of what the FCC allows Of course that sounds reassuring What they don t

previously healthy firefighters suffering cognitive impairment to the point they got lost responding to 911 calls in the same town they grew up in The study published in 2004 was conducted by Gunnar Heuser M D Ph D then of Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles It found brain abnormalities inconsistent with the profile of previously strong healthy men in the prime of life The study served as the basis for state and national lobbying on the part of the firefighters which resulted most recently in an exemption to 5G towers on fire stations throughout the state of California the first such

the midst of her neighborhood Gilardi and her 13 year old daughter spoke at the recent Pittsfield Board of Health meeting along with eight of their neighbors The two also testified before a subcommittee of the Massachusetts legislature as lawmakers were considering establishing a 5G commission patterned after that of neighboring New Hampshire Foster called Pittsfield a microcosm of the country We are literally trapped in a web of laws and FCC directives that take away our rights when it comes to fighting these towers Foster said One year after Verizon activated the tower in Pittsfield a victory in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals found the FCC s regulatory limits were arbitrary and capricious In a case brought by Children s Health Defense and Environmental Health Trust the court ruled on Aug 13 2021 that the FCC failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its determination that its current guidelines adequately protect against the harmful effects of exposure to radiofrequency radiation Foster said there s growing outrage at the encroachment of cell towers into every corner of people s lives including outside their children s bedroom windows With 5G beaming from hundreds of thousands of satellites orbiting Earth and global petitions by scientists and physicians calling for a halt to the 5G rollout until it can be studied for health effects the world

must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Rep Thomas Massie R Ky on Tuesday introduced legislation to repeal the sweeping liability shield that exempts COVID 19 vaccine manufacturers from responsibility for serious injuries or death caused by their products The liability protection amounts to medical malpractice martial law Massie said in a press release The PREP Repeal Act H R 4388 would revoke the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness PREP Act of 2005 a law that provides legal immunity to covered persons who manufacture or administer countermeasures during a public health emergency Covered persons under the PREP Act include vaccine makers manufacturers of masks and other personal protective equipment and physicians nurses and pharmacists who administer vaccines The Biden administration ended the COVID 19 public health emergency in May 2023 However the public health emergency declared in January 2020 by the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS under the PREP Act remains in effect In December 2024 HHS extended the liability protections through 2029 It was the 12th extension since 2020 Massie s bill would strip away these protections repealing the PREP Act s liability shield and restoring civil remedy rights for people harmed by products covered under the act Τhe ability of citizens to seek redress for injury or harm is a fundamental principle of justice and due process the bill states adding that the PREP Act s liability shield has undermined public trust and accountability and enabled regulatory capture The 2005 PREP Act prevents people from holding corporations accountable for the pain and suffering they cause during Presidentially declared emergencies Americans deserve the right to seek justice when injured by government mandated products The PREP Repeal Act will restore that right Massie said in the press release In an interview today on the Brian Thomas Morning Show Massie said the bill would apply to all COVID 19 related countermeasures not just vaccines If somebody made a mask that had cancer particles on it and you inhaled those too bad they re covered by the PREP Act Massie said I don t like lawsuits but they do

conceivable medical atrocity If Massie s bill passes the pandemic assembly line would be dismantled It would be goodbye liability protections goodbye mandates and goodbye mass human experimentation According to Flores repeal of the PREP Act would also end other current public health emergencies including mpox monkeypox pandemic influenza anthrax and Zika Dr Meryl Nass founder of Door to Freedom said the bill will stop another COVID vaccine fiasco and also stop the widespread use of unproven tests such as the COVID 19 PCR tests which were also issued under emergency use authorizations EUA Wayne Rohde author of The Vaccine Court The Dark Truth of America s Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and The Vaccine Court 2 0 said the bill contains nonspecific language and gaps that require attention Rohde said this includes How to wind down the Act address all of the amendments added to the Act over the last 4 years covered persons how to handle the covered countermeasures such as medical devices medications drugs and personal protective equipment and of course the elephant in the room the vaccines used and their future legal liability Legislation would open the door to thousands of lawsuits previously blocked by PREP Act Massie s proposed legislation would apply to all current and future lawsuits challenging the PREP Act including pending appeals Attorney Rick Jaffe said the proposed legislation is retroactive to March 10 2020 reopening the courthouse doors to thousands of injured individuals whose claims were previously blocked by PREP s sweeping liability shield The legislation would allow claimants to sue COVID 19 vaccine makers directly Jaffe said The bill if passed allows people injured by the COVID shots to sue presumably the manufacturers as well as those who administered the shots and that would be a big and much unwanted thing from the perspective of the manufacturers and pharmacy chains which administered the shots Massie told Brian Thomas he believes the PREP Act is unconstitutional as it preempts state medical malpractice laws Here s why I call the PREP Act medical malpractice martial law Massie said It s a federal law that says none

vaccine injury lawsuits challenging the PREP Act s liability shield In March the Maine Supreme Judicial Court upheld a lower court ruling that school medical staff who gave a COVID 19 vaccine to a minor without obtaining parental consent cannot be held liable under the PREP Act The Maine ruling came one week after the U S Supreme Court refused to review a lower court s ruling in a similar lawsuit in Vermont In that case a school administered a COVID 19 vaccine to a 6 year old boy despite his and his parents objections Last year the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that the PREP Act shielded school officials from liability At least two recent lawsuits challenging the PREP Act have cleared initial judicial hurdles but remain pending In March the Supreme Court of North Carolina ruled that a lawsuit filed by the mother of a 14 year old boy given a COVID 19 vaccine at school without consent can proceed The court ruled the PREP Act does not preempt state law requiring parental consent for vaccination In November 2024 a federal court ruled that a lawsuit filed by a woman injured by AstraZeneca s COVID 19 vaccine during a U S clinical trial can continue According to the complaint

injury victims said CICP strips claimants of their constitutional rights to due process and a jury trial The CICP program was intended to be the safety net for those Americans injured by the emergency countermeasures such as the COVID 19 shots However the program is a dismal failure with over a 98 denial rate Wallskog said If the proposed legislation passes Flores said the most likely outcome would be attempting to move COVID 19 injuries into the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP which covers injuries from vaccines routinely administered to children and pregnant women However such a move may face obstacles including complications regarding how to handle claims pending before the CICP Rohde said Money obligated for current operations would not be affected but how do you determine the monetary need for pending CICP petitions How to handle the CICP petitions already received and what about the future claims Do you move all the CICP vaccine petitions into the VICP That creates all sorts of new problems In May the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC changed its recommendations on COVID 19 vaccines for healthy children The CDC now recommends that parents of

session to discuss and vote on whether to end the practice of fluoridating the state s drinking water supply 17 year old Max Widmaier was there to offer key testimony In 2019 when Max was a fifth grader he was poisoned when a malfunctioning pump in Sandy Utah released undiluted hydrofluorosilicic acid into the water affecting 1 500 households institutions and businesses and sickening over 200 people An investigation revealed that fluoride was detected in the drinking water at 40 times the recommended levels and officials failed to notify the public for 10 days Max unknowingly drank the over fluoridated water in school Soon after he spiked a high fever developed tics had severe emotional swings and experienced developmental regression so severe that at one point he lost the ability to compose sentences his mother Jenny Widmaier told The Defender I don t remember fifth grade Max told Utah lawmakers That year is just a gaping hole where memory should be because I drank the fluoridated water that day when Sandy City broke its line to public water Jenny said that day the school called her to pick Max up because he had a fever She didn t know if it was a virus an infection food poisoning or something else so she asked Max about what he had been up to Max mentioned that he drank water at school and it tasted metallic At the time Jenny didn t give it a second thought After some severe gastrointestinal distress and about four days sick in bed Max seemed fine she said The following Saturday he hung out at a friend s house ate some tacos and things seemed normal That night Jenny s husband who came home late checked in on Max before heading to bed He immediately went to Jenny and asked What s wrong with Max s face Jenny was surprised by the question They went downstairs to examine Max together I was just watching him Jenny said and about every 30 to 45 seconds his whole face would seize up and his head would drop his chin would drop to his chest and then

asleep it could be serious but that otherwise it was probably just a tic The tic seemed slightly better the following day but Jenny took Max to the hospital to be evaluated While they were there the provider asked if they lived in Sandy City which they didn t When Jenny asked why it mattered if they lived in Sandy the provider said there had been a fluoride leak there Then it sort of clicked into place the metallic tasting water and his school is in Sandy Jenny said The provider checked the map and saw that Max s school was located in the fluoride leak zone He told Jenny to get Max tested for heavy metals Water fluoridation comes with heavy metals Jenny performed a home test on Max and it was positive for several metals including chromium and lead She kept him out of school the next day She said At this point it was getting weird He had reverted to being a 2 year old We took him to get some food and he sat there and he had this little metal cow that he was using to make mooing noises And his ability to put sentences together had declined dramatically This is a kid who in fifth grade was scoring high on what s called the AMC 8 test which is a mathematics test for eighth graders And that day he could hardly put words together into a sentence The family struggled to find a place that could do the appropriate blood tests although she did finally find an out of network provider A neurologist told her it was late for a tic to present but that Max probably just had tourette syndrome Max also experienced behavioral problems He had panic attacks and would scream hysterically She

a very strict diet Max had to undergo several rounds of chelation therapy because he also had high levels of lead arsenic and cadmium in his blood Most members of the public are not aware that heavy metals are present in the hydrofluorosilicic acid a byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer production process typically used to fluoridate water Max also had to do neurological exercises to retrain his brain As the fluoride was eliminated from his system his mental health also returned to normal None of the treatments were covered by insurance Jenny said The family never received any compensation from the city The school however was very responsive Jenny said they immediately turned off the water fountains and now provide filtered water for all students I have horrible balance and my sense of

immediately when he has eaten rice that s been cooked in water it s not been filtered because he starts to twitch and his face starts to seize Max told The Defender that his only memories of the entire year long experience were of getting strange soreness at the edge of his eyes He said he would blink to make it go away Those were the blackouts When Max accidentally consumes something with fluoride in it today now more than five years later he experiences that same feeling and has to blink He also continues to have shaky hands My handwriting is horrible he said so he uses heavy pens to

you are willing to take Water fluoridation accidents occur frequently but public often last to know The 2019 accident in Sandy City was just one of many accidental fluoride spills and overfeeds that

department discharged nearly half a million gallons of the toxic acid into the Mississippi River Failure to warn the public about fluoride accidents is also common Last month in Richmond Virginia an accidental fluoride overfeed caused a discharge of approximately 5 900 gallons of fluoride solution into the drinking water The city said the previous fluoride system had failed in January and the recent leak occurred during the installation of a new pump The leak began on April 23 However it wasn t until April 27 when a Richmond Water Treatment Plant employee called a state agency to report the overflow and said no one was taking action to address the problem that any state officials even knew about the spill 6 News Richmond reported The City of Richmond had not notified the Virginia Department of Health neighboring counties or the public Officials said the short term exposure didn t cause a public health concern However that assertion was based on the claim that Fluoride levels detected at the Water Treatment Plant were 2 67 milligrams per liter mg L which is below the Maximum Contaminant Level MCL of 4 0 mg L the highest level that is allowed in drinking water by the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA the city s press release said The optimal target level of fluoride is 0 7 mg L While that may be technically true last year plaintiffs who sued the EPA alleging

In neither of those cases did a single child die Nonetheless non stop media fearmongering drove California and New York to repeal long standing parental rights to reject compulsory vaccination on

press is already predicting measles outbreaks in Hawaii And Hawaii is a one party state the governor majorities in both houses of the legislature and the attorney general are all Democrats The clearest indicators however are the words and actions of Hawaii Gov Josh Green a physician For months Green has railed against Robert F Kennedy Jr as secretary of Health and Human Services In media appearances Green suggested that Kennedy will cause outbreaks you will see outbreaks and children will die and he will be deadly for our country Green a fierce advocate for vaccination won the governorship during the COVID 19 pandemic while vigorously promoting COVID 19 vaccination Further Hawaii Department of Health Director Kenneth Fink has stated that the religious exemption repeal is necessary because the state is facing a growing risk for a measles outbreak From 2015 to 2021 the momentum was behind repeal proponents with California removing its exemption after the Disneyland

in Texas and New Mexico with one new case reported in Kentucky and two in New Jersey are fueling media stories that the U S is poised for an epidemic On Wednesday Texas health authorities announced the death of a child who tested positive for measles setting off a spate of media reports blaming the measles outbreaks on declining vaccination rates However some doctors warn the situation isn t as dire as the headlines suggest Dr Lawrence Palevsky a pediatrician said it is a tragedy anytime a child dies But he also said there isn t enough information to know whether the child had an underlying medical condition whether the child had measles and what diagnostic criteria were being used to make the diagnosis of measles Palevsky said it remains unknown what treatment the child received in the hospital that may or may not have had anything to do with the deterioration of this child s health More information is needed Outlets like Vox The Washington Post and The New York Times warned that the outbreaks herald a coming public health crisis that will be made worse by the fact that Robert F Kennedy Jr who has raised questions about the safety and efficacy of vaccines on the childhood vaccination schedule is now secretary of Health and Human Services HHS Some accused Kennedy of downplaying the news after he said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC is watching what is happening and that measles outbreaks happen every year Should we panic over measles outbreaks Leana Wen writing in the Post said people aren t alarmed enough about measles because they don t see the illness often enough She warned it is a dangerous disease with high hospitalization rates and serious long term health consequences that may include immune system destruction and death However

measles Children s Health Defense CHD Senior Scientist Karl Jablonowski told The Defender The 1950s Vital Statistics report states measles are poorly reported because a large proportion of the cases are never seen by a physician This at a time when 600 000 annual reports of measles was normal Despite Wednesday s tragic reported death of a child in Texas deaths from measles in the U S are extremely rare Typically people who die from measles have some other serious underlying condition Dr Liz Mumper a pediatrician said it is very uncommon for a child to die from a measles infection in developed countries such as the U S that have access to clean water and good sanitation systems Although the CDC reports that the U S death rate from measles is 1 to 3 deaths out of every 1 000 reported cases prior to the reported death on Wednesday in Texas the last U S measles death was in a young immunocompromised woman in 2016 The last time a child died of measles in the U S was in 2003 Hospitalization rates for measles are high but that s partly because people are often hospitalized to keep them isolated to stop transmission of the contagious illness according to the CDC Treatment in hospitals typically involves keeping people hydrated and lowering their fevers Effective treatments include vitamin A in high doses and attention to hydration status Mumper said Many natural methods to help the body fight viruses like extra vitamin D and vitamin C are effective but not widely recommended by mainstream medicine Is the measles vaccine effective Most media reports blame the

placebo according to pediatrician Dr Paul Thomas co author of Vax Facts What to Consider Before Vaccinating at All Ages Stages of Life MMRII was tested against the vaccine components without the virus which included the adjuvant and Priorix was tested against the MMRII Merck s label for MMRII the most commonly given measles vaccine reports that clinical trials and post marketing studies identified a wide range of adverse reactions affecting almost every system in the body Examples include atypical measles and measles type rashes pancreatitis thrombocytopenia myalgia respiratory illnesses like pneumonia skin disorders encephalitis Guillain Barré syndrome convulsions or seizures syncope and many other possible reactions The possible side effects for Priorix are similar During the drug s trials there were high rates of serious adverse events and emergency room visits New onset of chronic diseases occurred in both groups To any sane mind that means both the MMRII used as placebo and the new Priorix are dangerous according to Thomas A series of studies by the National Academy of Medicine formerly the Institute of Medicine conducted in the 1990s to 2000s found similar adverse

know that Hawaii s legislature currently has bills to repeal its religious exemption Holland added The measles repeal playbook is well worn and has been effective in the past not because of a real threat to children s health but rather in large part due to media hype from corporate funding and government fearmongering In 2015 allegedly prompted by a measles outbreak at Disneyland blamed on unvaccinated children and low vaccination rates California passed a controversial bill Senate Bill No 277 SB 277 which eliminated the personal belief exemption for mandatory vaccination The passage of

Fauci Bill Gates Big Pharma and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health by 1983 it had become a hardwired reflex at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID to exaggerate

Journal of the American Medical Association warning AIDS could spread by casual contact At the time AIDS was almost exclusive to intravenous drug users and males who had sex with other males but Dr Fauci incorrectly warned of the possibility that routine close contact as within a family household can spread the disease Given that nonsexual non blood borne transmission is possible Fauci wrote the

misrepresent AIDS as a general pandemic to secure greater public funding and financial support The flimflam worked Terror of pestilence it turns out is a potent impulse and Fauci was adept at weaponizing it and he quickly learned that other respected authorities would follow his lead Following Dr Fauci s fearmongering prophecy Theresa Crenshaw of the President s AIDS Commission made the astonishing forecast that within 14 years double the number of people then on the planet would be dying from lethal infections If the spread of AIDS continues at this rate in 1996 there could be one billion people infected five years later hypothetically ten billion Crenshaw asked Could we be facing the threat of extinction during our lifetime Crenshaw s dire soothsaying never materialized In 2007 the World Health Organization estimated only 33 2 million people worldwide were HIV positive The HIV prevalence curves based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC own data show at least in the U S HIV has not spread at all since testing was first available stubbornly remaining at the same levels relative to population The Oprah show broadcast Crenshaw s subsequent prognostication that By 1990 one in five heterosexuals may be dead of AIDS Thankfully this prognosis was also hyperbolic According to CDC data about one in 250 Americans tests HIV positive Outside the risk groups this number drops to about one in 5 000 about 1 1 000th Crenshaw s bodement The hysteria following Fauci s dystopian prediction prompted der Spiegel to warn AIDS infections would entirely

Bhattacharya several times to account for canceled grants as well as news accounts of turmoil inside the agency The Disinformation Chronicle reported The questions led Bhattacharya to ask Kaiser on several occasions to clarify and explain exactly what she was asking about the NIH s new subaward grant policy Subawards typically involve a contract between the U S investigator s institution and the entity in a foreign country that is conducting the research Science reported Subawards support everything from investigator initiated research projects to large clinical trial networks that test new medicines The new NIH policy issued May 1 prohibits NIH grantees from outsourcing parts of their research to foreign entities through subawards According to the NIH the purpose behind the new policy is to ensure it can transparently and reliably report on each dollar spent However the new policy does not prohibit direct NIH awards to foreign applicants In one exchange Kaiser asked Bhattacharya about a policy cancelling collaborations foreign collaborations No that s false Bhattacharya replied There s going to be a policy on tracking subawards I mean if you re going to give a subaward we should be able the NIH and the government should be able to see where the money s going Yet Science s May 5 story reported that NIH and HHS were finalizing a new policy on foreign research funding

former director of NIH s Fogarty International Center which funded thousands of foreign scientists and supported collaborations between hundreds of U S researchers and institutions in resource strapped countries Keusch worked closely with the EcoHealth Alliance Keusch now an emeritus professor at Boston University called the NIH subaward policy insane and suggested that there was no compelling evidence that COVID 19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology According to The Disinformation Chronicle a U S House of Representatives report released last year found that Keusch coordinated with the NIH s Dr David Morens to keep EcoHealth Alliance funded and to hide government records of this collusion In 2023 the House launched an investigation against Morens a longtime aide of Dr Anthony Fauci after an investigation revealed he used his personal email address to evade Freedom of Information Act requests for communications related to the origins of COVID 19 NIH scientists are required to produce emails and other records under the Freedom of Information Act The Disinformation Chronicle said Keusch had co authored a February 2020 letter published in The Lancet also co authored by Daszak and others calling Wuhan lab leak allegations a conspiracy theory Last month the Trump administration launched a new version of the government s official COVID 19 website presenting evidence that COVID 19 emerged following a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology The CIA FBI U S Department of Energy U S Congress and other intelligence agencies have endorsed this theory The Disinformation Chronicle reported that emails released by House investigators showed that Keusch and Morens also shared ideas to pressure NIH leadership to fund EcoHealth Alliance including writing essays and placing stories with writers Jon Cohen and Meredith Wadman at Science Magazine Despite this history Science Magazine quoted Keusch as an unbiased source who claimed that no compelling

Texas hospital after developing pneumonia following a measles infection died as a result of medical error including failure to administer the correct antibiotic in time according to a medical expert who reviewed the child s medical records Children s Health Defense CHD obtained the medical records from the family of the 6 year old girl The parents said they wanted people to know what happened to their daughter so it wouldn t happen to other children The parents obtained the records from Covenant Children s Hospital in Lubbock where their child died on Feb 26 The parents told Dr Ben Edwards who successfully treated their other children for measles that they didn t want to use the information uncovered in the medical records to inflame the situation However they did want to get the word out about the mistake if it could prevent it from happening to other children Dr Pierre Kory who has extensive experience in pulmonary and critical care medicine analyzed the records He said today in an interview on CHD TV I ve done medical case reviews from malpractice lawyers for a good part of my career and this case was tragic According to Kory s analysis of the records the girl died from a secondary bacterial pneumonia that had little to do with measles He added When I say it has little to do with measles secondary bacterial pneumonias can happen after any viral infection Kory said the girl died of a medical error and that error was a completely inappropriate antibiotic for treating the kind of pneumonia she had The records showed that the girl was initially admitted to the emergency room ER for secondary bacterial pneumonia Kory told The Defender At that time her measles rash was already fading She was not administered the correct antibiotic for treating her secondary bacterial pneumonia until roughly two and a half days later By that time she had declined so severely that doctors had already placed her on a mechanical ventilator Kory said Also it appears there was a delay of more than nine hours from the time when the correct antibiotic was finally ordered and the time it was given Kory said Less than 24 hours later she died and she died rather catastrophically

analysis by Johns Hopkins University researchers including Dr Marty Makary Trump s nominee to lead the U S Food and Drug Administration Hospital initially prescribed inappropriate antibiotic Kory broke down in more precise medical terms what appears to have happened When the girl was admitted to the ER the staff made a general diagnosis that she had a secondary bacterial pneumonia She was clearly being admitted from the community so it was implied that it was a community acquired pneumonia Kory said referring to how the girl didn t get the pneumonia from being in a hospital or healthcare facility They were absolutely correct about that Kory said But what they initially gave her for that diagnosis was incorrect he said Generally doctors put patients on two antibiotics to cover all the possibilities of what specific kind of bacterial pneumonia the patient may have Kory said It s in every guideline infectious disease pulmonary every guideline in the country tells you that for a hospitalized child or adult who gets admitted to the hospital you put them on two antibiotics One is from a category called beta lactams which is like penicillin cephalosporins And they the hospital got that part correct They put her on something called ceftriaxone which was excellent But you always need to pair it with an antibiotic from a different category which is called a macrolide or a quinolone They didn t do that part Kory said They didn t put her on the most common which is azithromycin Instead they put her on vancomycin an antibiotic used for very drug resistant organisms like MRSA According to the Mayo Clinic MRSA short for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus is an infection caused by a staph bacteria that s become resistant to many of the antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections Most MRSA infections occur in hospitals or healthcare settings like nursing homes or dialysis centers Giving vancomycin to the girl was an inappropriate choice according to Kory He said There s no reason to think that this child would come in with MRSA from the community from a Mennonite community She s not coming from a facility where a lot of antibiotics

over two days The records show that the hospital didn t adjust the girl s antibiotics until a test came back showing that she had a type of bacterial pneumonia called mycoplasma pneumonia According to the Cleveland Clinic mycoplasma is a single form of bacteria that causes an infection that can occur in different parts of the body such as the respiratory urinary or genital tracts The tragedy is that mycoplasma is an extremely common what we call community acquired organism Kory said Azithromycin is very effective against mycoplasma he said The hospital staff finally ordered it for her upon seeing her test results But they should have ordered it much sooner given that her bacterial pneumonia was community acquired Kory said Kory said it wasn t proper doctoring to let her decline for days without adjusting the treatment they were giving her You almost have three full days of a seriously declining medical status with no real changes to her treatment plan He added If I m taking care of someone and I m rounding on them every day and I see that today they re doing a little bit worse than yesterday And then the next day they re doing a little bit worse than the day before I m going to review exactly what I m doing and say What am I missing What am I missing What else can I do And that didn t happen until a test showed up on a computer And that s just not doctoring By this time the child was in the intensive care unit And from my review of the records Kory continued the antibiotic was ordered at 11 00 p m or approximately 11 00 p m and as far as I can tell it was not administered until 9 00 a m the next morning So not only did you have several days delay of decline without the appropriate antibiotic he said but then when they realized that they were missing the

mistake and I agree a fatal mistake However Edwards said the girl s father who gave CHD permission to report on the medical records didn t intend to inflame the situation or cause more division and more just hot rhetoric Edwards told a brief story to illustrate how divisive the media coverage of the West Texas measles outbreak has been The day the girl died Edwards was in the middle of an interview with a reporter I remember that reporter grabbing his phone as the alert just came from the news announcing the first measles death Edwards said there was almost a giddiness in the reporter s response to the news It was disgusting actually he said I want people to know Peter the father doesn t want this information to be used on the other side in the same almost giddiness kind of way of Aha we got you The girl s father simply wants the truth to be told so that other kids who potentially could go down the same path as his daughter won t have to The parents aren t sharing the information to give one side more ammunition in the ongoing public debate around measles The father told Edwards I love my neighbor and my neighbor s my enemy My neighbor s the one who hurt me My neighbor s the one who offends me Edwards said he wants the public to understand the father s reason for letting the medical records go public so that we can maybe come to the table on this Edwards added There s potential risk of measles complications and death There s potential risk complications and death from MMR the measles mumps rubella vaccine We need to have that conversation at the table

delle tecniche diagnostiche avanzate nell identificazione e nella comprensione degli effetti collaterali legati ai vaccini Un caso clinico proveniente dal Giappone ha documentato il primo caso noto di cardiomiopatia dilatativa infiammatoria iDCM una condizione in cui il cuore si ingrossa e si indebolisce a causa di un infiammazione in seguito alla vaccinazione anti COVID 19 I medici del Narita Tomisato Tokushukai Hospital di Chiba in Giappone hanno utilizzato una biopsia endomiocardica per diagnosticare la iDCM in una donna di 78 anni che ha avuto problemi cardiaci dopo la somministrazione della terza dose di vaccino anti COVID 19 La paziente aveva ricevuto in precedenza due dosi del vaccino a mRNA BNT162b2 di Pfizer BioNTech seguite da un richiamo Moderna mRNA 1273 Il caso riportato il 1 luglio in un articolo a revisione paritaria ad accesso aperto pubblicato sulla rivista ESC Heart Failure segna un significativo progresso nella comprensione delle potenziali complicazioni cardiache legate ai vaccini anti COVID 19 Utilizzando l analisi dei tessuti i medici sono stati in grado di collegare in modo più definitivo la condizione cardiaca alla vaccinazione distinguendola da altre cause possibili Anche se le reazioni così gravi rimangono estremamente rare questo caso dimostra il valore delle tecniche diagnostiche avanzate per identificare e comprendere gli effetti collaterali legati ai vaccini hanno scritto i medici La paziente è stata trattata con successo con un corticosteroide che ha migliorato le sue condizioni in modo significativo ma non completo Questo risultato sottolinea l importanza di un attenzione medica tempestiva e di una diagnosi accurata per qualsiasi sintomo insolito successivo alla vaccinazione I casi più gravi possono essere fatali se non trattati hanno scritto i medici Il Dr Peter McCullough si è detto d accordo e ha dichiarato a The Defender che il suo articolo di gennaio scritto con Jessica Rose e Nicolas Hulscher ha dimostrato che in migliaia di casi di miocardite associata al vaccino il tasso di mortalità è del 2 9 McCullough ha dichiarato che l articolo giapponese è importante perché riguarda l insufficienza cardiaca che si verifica da mesi ad anni dopo la vaccinazione anti COVID 19 Per i pazienti che presentano sintomi simili i medici dovrebbero prendere seriamente in considerazione la possibilità che il vaccino anti COVID 19 possa aver causato il danno ha affermato Brian Hooker responsabile scientifico di Children s Health Defense ha dichiarato a The Defender che il caso di studio è molto solido Gli autori

precedenti di malattie cardiache ha accusato palpitazioni e mancanza di respiro il quarto giorno dopo la somministrazione della terza dose di vaccino anti COVID 19 I suoi sintomi sono gradualmente peggiorati ed è stata ricoverata in ospedale 11 giorni dopo la vaccinazione Quando è stata ricoverata nel nostro ospedale aveva già un insufficienza cardiaca acuta hanno spiegato i medici In base alla visita medica hanno notato diversi segni preoccupanti Battito cardiaco rapido di 120 battiti al minuto Vene del collo gonfie ed edema alle gambe Suoni cardiaci anomali tra cui ritmo galoppante e soffio al cuore Bassi livelli di ossigeno nel sangue Gli esami diagnostici indicavano una disfunzione cardiaca L elettrocardiogramma ECG mostrava una frequenza cardiaca anormalmente rapida con modelli di conduzione elettrica disturbati sia nel lato destro che nel lato sinistro del cuore Gli esami del sangue hanno rivelato livelli elevati di troponina cardiaca I e di peptide natriuretico cerebrale entrambi marcatori di stress e danno miocardico L elettrocardiogramma mostrava una funzione ventricolare sinistra gravemente ridotta con una frazione di eiezione di appena il 20 Per escludere una malattia delle arterie coronarie l équipe medica ha eseguito un esame a raggi X chiamato angiografia coronarica che non ha mostrato alcuna ostruzione significativa L insieme di sintomi e i risultati dei test hanno portato i medici a diagnosticare una iDCM potenzialmente associata alla recente vaccinazione anti COVID 19 Per stabilire una diagnosi definitiva hanno proceduto con una biopsia

un infiammazione cardiaca attiva Questo suggerisce che la condizione della paziente fosse in fase attiva e potenzialmente curabile La risonanza magnetica cardiaca un altra tecnica di imaging avanzata ha mostrato ulteriori segni di danno al cuore Ha rivelato un ingrossamento del ventricolo sinistro e un tipo di cicatrizzazione della parete del muscolo cardiaco che si riscontra spesso nelle infiammazioni cardiache di origine non infettiva La biopsia ci ha permesso di osservare direttamente il processo infiammatorio nel tessuto cardiaco fornendo un livello di certezza che non abbiamo avuto in casi precedenti di sospetti problemi cardiaci legati ai vaccini hanno scritto i medici Hanno sottolineato come questo caso differisca dai problemi cardiaci legati ai vaccini riportati in precedenza La maggior parte dei casi riportati di infiammazione cardiaca dopo la vaccinazione anti COVID 19 erano casi di miocardite in giovani maschi Questo caso di iDCM in una paziente donna anziana amplia la nostra comprensione delle potenziali complicazioni cardiache I risultati dettagliati hanno permesso ai medici di distinguere questo caso da altri tipi di problemi cardiaci e hanno suggerito con forza un legame con la recente vaccinazione anti COVID 19 Gli esami di follow up a sei mesi hanno mostrato miglioramenti significativi Dopo aver confermato la diagnosi di iDCM attraverso la biopsia i medici hanno avviato un piano di trattamento mirato che prevedeva la somministrazione di prednisolone un corticosteroide orale per ridurre l infiammazione del cuore L équipe medica ha inoltre somministrato i farmaci standard per l insufficienza cardiaca tra cui Enalapril che aiuta a rilassare i vasi sanguigni Spironolattone un diuretico che ha anche proprietà antinfiammatorie Dapagliflozin un nuovo farmaco che ha dimostrato di essere utile nell insufficienza cardiaca Le condizioni della paziente sono migliorate costantemente in seguito al trattamento Dopo 16 giorni di

fornisce nuove informazioni sullo spettro di complicazioni cardiache potenzialmente legate ai vaccini anti COVID 19 I ricercatori hanno sottolineato diversi punti chiave nella loro discussione L attuale conoscenza della miocardite associata alla vaccinazione anti COVID 19 riguarda principalmente casi di giovani maschi spesso verificatisi dopo la seconda dose di vaccino Hooker ha osservato che i giovani maschi presentano il rischio più elevato di danni al cuore causati dai vaccini a mRNA Questi casi di miocardite mostrano in genere un abbondanza di linfociti un tipo di globuli bianchi che si infiltrano nel tessuto cardiaco Ma questo caso si discosta dal profilo tipico della miocardite associata al vaccino per diversi aspetti La paziente era una donna anziana La complicazione si è verificata dopo una terza dose di un diverso vaccino anti COVID 19 diverso La diagnosi è stata specificamente di iDCM I risultati della biopsia hanno rivelato un mix di macrofagi e linfociti T nel tessuto cardiaco cellule del sistema immunitario che hanno il compito di liberare l organismo da infezioni e malattie insieme a microtrombi cardiaci piccoli coaguli di sangue Questo schema differisce dai casi di miocardite associata al vaccino riportati in precedenza e da altri tipi di infiammazione cardiaca legata al vaccino Ciò sottolinea la complessità delle risposte immunitarie ai vaccini

did not maintain the stated potency and therefore effectiveness over its shelf life in violation of FDA regulations Merck with the FDA s knowledge boosted the initial potency of the vaccine by overfilling doses with extra quantities of live virus hoping to create a better buffer to maintain potency throughout its shelf life while the company addressed the potency issues The temporary fix didn t work But Merck didn t inform the FDA for fear the agency would compel the drugmaker to reduce the efficacy claims on the label which would open the door for GSK s rival mumps vaccine GSK sold its mumps vaccine in Europe but the company could gain approval to sell its MMR vaccine in the U S only if the drugmaker could show the vaccine wasn t any less effective than Merck s which claimed 95 efficacy To block that possible competition the U S Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit in October 2024 ruled that Merck sought to extend its apparent monopoly by misrepresenting the end of shelf life vaccine potency and by filing a Supplemental License Application seeking FDA approval to maintain its efficacy claims with a less potent vaccine To support the application Merck attempted to develop more sensitive tests that would allow it to make higher efficacy claims with its less effective drug Its vaccine trial Protocol 7 was a flawed study that did not reliably capture

complications have become one of the most common side effects of the vaccine and data show it afflicts vaccine recipients at a dramatically higher rate than normally seen from a pharmaceutical You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By A Midwestern Doctor Story at a glance Since vaccines seek to provoke the immune system into creating an immune response unintended immune responses to vital human tissues are one of the most common significant side effects of vaccination When the COVID 19 vaccine campaign started many were concerned that the experimental mRNA injections had a variety of unique risks for autoimmunity Rather than require the manufacturers to properly assess that risk the vaccines were instead brought to market and then mandated upon the world Autoimmune complications like Megyn Kelly s have become one of the most common side effects of the vaccine and data shows it afflicts vaccine recipients at a dramatically higher rate than normally seen from a pharmaceutical This wave of autoimmunity is causing an immense degree of suffering and appears to be inflicting profound damage on the entire economy due to how many people are being forced into disability because of their new autoimmune disorders There were three highly unusual characteristics of the COVID 19 vaccines From the start they were highly controversial and opinions on them largely split along partisan lines Despite the previous they were eventually mandated upon the entire population The vaccines had an unprecedented degree of toxicity to the point so many were injured that the majority of the population is worried about their side effects almost half of the vaccinated American adults believe they suffered an adverse reaction and half of America believes the COVID 19 vaccines are causing a wave of unexpected deaths This in turn has understandably shaken the lifelong trust many Americans held in our institutions and also has created a tragic political situation for the vaccine injured Since the left strongly endorsed the vaccines admitting you had an adverse reaction is a direct affront to their tribe As a result many liberals I ve talked to have told me they ve had to stay silent about their injury or risk being excommunicated Likewise in the medical field because the faith in the vaccines was so powerful stating you had an injury was viewed as being equivalent to medical malpractice since it might encourage others not to receive the life saving COVID 19 vaccine For example a California doctor who has treated thousands of vaccine injured patients frequently saw local nurses only to discover their co workers had also been injured because they met each other in his waiting room The psychological burden vaccine injured people in those

fired immediately after giving a scathing critique of the vaccine campaign and the media s complicity in it Since then on Twitter he built one of the largest independent media platforms in the world and has increased his criticism of the vaccines For example Sharyl Attkisson a renowned Emmy award winning investigative journalist left her prime time spot after she became fed up with management censoring her stories to become a truly independent journalist She has repeatedly reported on the COVID 19 vaccine injuries and just hosted a town hall on treating them Jimmy Dore a popular comic who was featured on many major networks in 2009 started building his own talk show After being injured early in the vaccine campaign he got red pilled and decided to share it with his audience For example see this July 2021 interview describes his injury and discusses the hatred those injured by vaccines face In 2017 Megyn Kelly one of the most popular news anchors in America decided to leave Fox News and then began building her own platform Like Dore she now has over a million subscribers on YouTube and has given a voice to outsiders like Robert Kennedy Jr Kelly also initially supported the

Anthony Fauci s remarks in this clip contrary to what he said there as detailed in Scott Atlas M D s excellent memoir Fauci not only zealously supported the lockdowns but actively sabotaged any attempts to repeal them from both within the White House and throughout the national media Specifically in regard to her injury Kelly stated I m sorry I did it to myself I regret getting the vaccine I

positive for an autoimmune issue at my annual physical and I went to the best rheumatologist in New York and I asked her Do you think this could have to do with the fact that I got the damn booster

may have changed her perspective on the vaccines but I was unable to find anything confirming this Vaccines and autoimmunity The adaptive immune system works by producing lots of white blood cells with a random protein sequence on them and then waiting until a foreign protein henceforth termed an antigen comes into contact with a white blood cell whose random sequence matches the antigen Once this occurs a signal is set off for the white blood cell to copy itself and large numbers of white blood cells match that cell form which can then bind to the new antigen and thereby protect the body from it While this approach has served our species well it s not perfect because it takes time the right cell has to stumble across the antigen and sometimes the needed adaptive response doesn t form at all The theory behind vaccination is that since infectious microbes continually reproduce inside the body by the time an adaptive immunity forms the infection may have progressed too far and your

may have progressed too far and your immunity can no longer save you or it does but the disease you go through will be much worse Vaccines work by introducing one or more of the antigens from the microbe to the body and allowing you to develop adaptive immunity to it so that when the actual reproducing microbe enters your body your adaptive immunity can kick into gear before the microbe overwhelms the body While this sounds good in theory there are a variety of ways where it runs into issues in real life One of them arises from the fact that for vaccines to be approved they have to reliably stimulate an adaptive immune response to their antigen In order for that to happen vaccines either need to directly inject a lot of the antigen or cause the antigen to reproduce inside the body e g the measles vaccine is a replicating virus so that in either case enough of the vaccine antigen can come into contact with the immune system for its adaptive process to occur Since antigens are expensive it s often not commercially feasible to produce enough of them for an injection to generate the desired immune response To solve this problem vaccines are often mixed with adjuvants which stimulate the immune system into responding to the nearby vaccine antigens Furthermore some antigens are more difficult to elicit a reliable response from the ones from HPV being a classic example and in turn require even stronger adjuvants to be used A major problem with provoking the immune system to produce an immune response to the vaccine antigen is that it can trigger an immune response to other antigens as well such as those the body needs to function For example one study showed that mice developed allergies to pollens that were in the air at the time of their vaccination This becomes more of an issue when antigens in vaccines partially match those in human tissue For example the hepatitis B vaccine has a significant overlap with myelin which coats your nerves and thereby allows the nerves to function Because of this debilitating demyelinating disorders e g multiple sclerosis have been associated with hepatitis B vaccination and one study showed approximately half of its recipients also developed immune reactivity to myelin which in the majority of cases persisted for over 6 months Since autoimmunity is a longstanding issue with vaccines an excellent

of the disorders listed in the study cited above are autoimmune in nature Theoretical risks of autoimmunity When the mRNA vaccines were being developed a few major concerns emerged scientists tried to sound the alarm on but were nonetheless ignored One of those was that the vaccine design had a high risk for autoimmunity This was because The COVID 19 vaccines worked by causing your body to produce large amounts of the spike protein either with mRNA or through a virus that was modified to have the spike protein on its surface One of the major concerns repeatedly raised when the COVID 19 vaccines were being deployed was that the spike protein antigen had an extremely high degree of overlap with human tissue e g consider this early 2021 paper It is basic immunology that infectious organisms that partially match human tissue frequently cause autoimmunity to the matching human tissue e g this is what happens in rheumatic fever so it was likely something similar would happen here too It is basic immunology that infectious organisms that partially match human tissue frequently cause autoimmunity to the matching human tissue e g this is what happens in rheumatic fever so it was likely something similar would happen here too The longer the immune system is exposed to something the more likely it is to develop reactivity to it this for example is why repeated exposures to a food allergen can cause food sensitivities Since the synthetic vaccine mRNA was modified so it would resist being broken down that meant its spike proteins would be continually produced for a prolonged period and hence progressively increase the likelihood of an autoimmune disorder Note We still do not know just how long the spike protein persists in the body since this was never properly tested one study found the vaccine mRNA was still present at 60 days and a study of vaccine induced myocarditis found that in 25 of those patients the spike protein persisted in the blood for the duration of the

autoimmune disorder Note We still do not know just how long the spike protein persists in the body since this was never properly tested one study found the vaccine mRNA was still present at 60 days and a study of vaccine induced myocarditis found that in 25 of those patients the spike protein persisted in the blood for the duration of the study and autopsies have found spike protein in the tissue long after vaccination e g at 4 months The vaccines contained both lipid nanoparticles and mRNA both of which were known to stimulate the immune system but had not been sufficiently tested on humans so their potential adjuvant induced autoimmunity was unknown Consider for instance what Dr Robert Malone one of the creators of the mRNA technology shared about the lipid nanoparticles which he began working with in the 1980s Here he discusses his and his wife s repeated attempts to make the delivery of lipid nanoparticles particularly to the lungs less toxic and the results of those experiments with mice and monkeys And what we found was that they the lipid nanoparticles were incredibly inflammatory They acted to recruit polymorphonuclear cells neutrophils recruit macrophage and monocytes and they would cause the destruction by inflammatory process of lung tissue very very toxic and we could not overcome that The group at Genzyme did the same work that we did with a much larger team they produced thousands and thousands of different formulations in different positively charged lipids and they also could never overcome the toxicity They abandoned the technology at Genzyme and we abandoned it in our research lab and went on to doing other technologies for delivery of DNA and RNA we abandoned the cationic lipid technology because it was just too toxic Now flash forward to the present and a research group we had known about and interacted with for a decade at the University of British Columbia excellent liposome researchers that we had known about going back to the 70s and 80s had developed new formulation technology that apparently worked in animals and they did a number of things that were slightly different and came up with something that seemed to work much better in animals which they and others believed would stay at the site where it was injected and would not circulate through the body and that they believed were much less toxic and this was the technology that was used in the current mRNA based vaccine products We now know that they were wrong In essence this means that the lipid nanoparticles function as a strong adjuvant that

positive charges their lipids transfer to cell membranes play a key role in vaccine toxicity This is because the positive charges of those lipids and more importantly the positive charge of the spike protein caused previously separated cells to clump together a process that had been known for decades in the vaccine safety field to trigger both microstrokes and autoimmunity both which often are a priority for vaccine injuries e g I frequently find patients improve if their physiologic zeta potential is improved Note There were also significant concerns regarding the effects of the vaccine s synthetic mRNA on the immune response which Malone explains here The mRNA technology worked by having spike proteins be produced in a cell and then migrate to its surface where the immune system would see them and develop an immune response to the spike protein The problem with this especially considering how innately inflammatory the spike protein was was that it might also trigger the immune system to see the mRNA transfected cell as a foreign invader and develop an immune response to it potentially destroying both the cell and other cells of the same type Note Since the vaccine campaign started pathologists especially those conducting autopsies some of which were compiled here have repeatedly observed highly unusual inflammation in vaccine recipient tissue With a special test some of these investigators confirmed that the attacked tissue had the SARS CoV 2 spike protein but not the nucleocapsid always found in a SARS CoV 2 infection indicating this could have only resulted from the vaccine To quote one of the pathologists summarizing his research A massive lymphocytic infiltration of surrounding non lymphatic organs or tissue with T lymphocytes Lymphocytic infiltration occasionally occurred in combination with intense lymphocytic activation and follicle formation Where these were present they were usually accompanied by tissue destruction This combination of multifocal T lymphocyte dominated pathology that clearly reflects the process of immunological self attack is without precedent Because vaccination was the single common denominator between all cases there can be no doubt that it was the trigger of self destruction in these deceased individuals The above illustrates why it was not a good idea to have cells express an antigen that would trigger the

have cells express an antigen that would trigger the immune system to destroy the cell especially since many of the nanoparticles could be expected to travel through the circulation and end up in the heart As discussed above by Malone the lipid nanoparticles traveled throughout the body which means they could cause the body to develop a variety of different autoimmune conditions depending on which tissues they ultimately arrived at Later it was discovered through a Japanese Freedom of Information Act FOIA request that Pfizer had found the lipid nanoparticles circulated through the body and concentrated in certain organs such as the ovaries since the ovaries regulate menstruation this may explain why menstrual abnormalities are one of the most common side effects of the vaccine affecting almost half of female vaccine recipients So given all of this you might think that the regulators would have been quite concerned about the potential autoimmune risk of this technology However when I read through leaked regulatory documents between Pfizer and the EMA Europe s FDA I noticed that very little was done to evaluate autoimmunity and this did not appear to be a priority for the EMA Thus vaccination with modRNA is expected to induce robust neutralizing antibodies and a concomitant T cell response to achieve protective immunity Nevertheless no further discussion was provided regarding the possibility of autoimmune responses induced by the ModRNA The Applicant is invited to further discuss the risk that the mRNA vaccine can trigger potential autoimmune responses and how they plan to possibly evaluate their occurrence Safety pharmacology program No safety pharmacology studies a more detailed form of toxicology were conducted with BNT162b2 The Applicant refers to that they are not considered necessary according to the WHO guideline WHO 2005 In addition no findings on vital organ functions have been recorded in the repeat dose toxicology studies Thus the absence of safety

of this is similar to how they gave Pfizer a pass on evaluating if the vaccine would cause cancer which leading into the vaccine rollout was understandably one of the largest concerns with experimental gene therapy Genotoxicity No genotoxicity has been provided The components of the vaccine formulation are lipids and RNA that are not expected to have genotoxic potential That being said the novel lipids possess an acetamide moiety which is classified as possible human carcinogen IARC Group 2B with debated genotoxic mechanism which should be discussed further Note Regulators also oddly failed to require the vaccines to be sufficiently tested for their effects on fertility the other major concern with the vaccine a subject Arkmedic has done great work to expose Experiences with the vaccine Since I knew a lot of people were going to ask me about the vaccine I did my best to research it before it was released From doing so I gradually came to suspect that the failure to test the vaccine s greatest theoretical risks meant it was very possible issues had already been discovered and that the manufacturers then decided it was better to just not officially test them so the regulators would not have a reason to veto their application and plausible deniability would exist once the adverse effects were eventually discovered In turn I concluded the most likely problem with this vaccine would be chronic complications e g cancer that took a while to show up and would only be recognized once everyone had long since been vaccinated As the vaccine started to hit the market three red flags jumped out at me All of the PR and marketing stated that if you felt awful after the vaccine that was a good thing and it meant the vaccine was working I had never seen a vaccine be presented in this way by the media before Pfizer s study which was published shortly before the vaccine got approval had a rate of acute adverse effects that was dramatically higher than I d seen with any other vaccine e g 59 experienced fatigue from Pfizer s vaccine whereas around 10 to 15 experience fatigue after an influenza vaccine Many of my colleagues who were first in line to receive the

the vaccine was extremely effective at provoking the immune system and given the other issues that autoimmunity was a real risk of the vaccine Once the vaccine entered my community it took a bit longer to get into my corner of the Midwest I immediately began to have a lot of patients show up with issues from the vaccine A few things were very striking about what I heard Patients said they had never had a similar issue with any other vaccine e g their annual flu shot Areas of pre existing immunity flared For example joints that for years had occasionally experienced an aching arthritis suddenly felt as though they were on fire Likewise old injuries and scars suddenly began to flare and hurt greatly something I had previously learned to associate with severe inflammatory conditions like Lyme disease A variety of other symptoms were reported which I gradually concluded could be linked to either an inflammatory process or microclotting Note I also began seeing very similar symptoms to what my patients were reporting on a variety of online forums This recent posting is the most comprehensive summary I ve seen of those reports Seeing this made me very uneasy as I felt that if I d underestimated the vaccine s acute reactions to this degree it meant I d likely greatly underestimated the chronic ones as well Before long I started having more and more friends from around the country reach out to me sharing that someone they knew had died suddenly after the vaccine most frequently from a heart attack and wanting to know if it could be linked to the vaccine At that point I realized I needed to start documenting everything being reported to me which essentially matched what I was seeing reported online and a year later I published that compilation which went viral and made this Substack become part of the vaccine safety debate Note After the vaccines were launched I also began to hear unusual reports of heart attacks from my colleagues I d never heard

point I began to suspect the primary issue with the vaccines would be autoimmune in nature and or due to the previously mentioned alterations of physiologic zeta potential which led to complications like microclots To investigate this I started contacting rheumatologists and neurologists I knew to find out if they were seeing anything unusual these would be the two specialties most likely to have patients show up with challenging autoimmune conditions A few privately confided that something was amiss but most did not seem open to the possibility there were potential issues with the vaccine and instead kept going back to COVID 19 having a high risk of causing a wide range of complications like autoimmunity I then tried a different tactic and contacted medical students and medical residents I knew to find those who were rotating under a neurologist or rheumatologist I received more candid answers from them many believed they were seeing far too many patients reporting autoimmune complications from the vaccine I then decided I needed to find the time to shadow one of these doctors and was able to do so with the rheumatologist What I saw was very striking it seemed that around 25 to 30 of her patients some of whom were my coworkers had either developed a new autoimmune condition after the vaccine or had a long existing and stable autoimmune condition become much worse e g one was hospitalized and didn t remember most of the hospitalization and frequently required the rheumatologist to change them to a stronger medicine Simultaneously I also began to see unusual autoimmune conditions in my co workers and social circle e g multiple cases of ALS something which typically affects only 1 50 000 people per year One of the most telling stories happened at the very start of the rollout when a close friend received the Moderna vaccine and developed polymyalgia rheumatica this condition typically emerges in 1 1900 people over 50 each year I found her story noteworthy because when she saw her rheumatologist she was told he d already seen quite a few other patients who developed PMR following Moderna Note I also saw certain autoimmune conditions that appeared to have a delayed onset after the vaccine This started after I began receiving consultations for multiple sclerosis and noticed they were all either cases that had long been stable and then

thing Oddly however despite a great deal of evidence linking the vaccine to autoimmunity I have thus far only come across one doctor who was willing to publicly acknowledge this When I asked Dr Pierre Kory who specialized in treating vaccine injured patients he shared that I think autoimmunity is one of the key pathologies that underlies many of their symptoms but they don t always meet the classic criteria for a specific autoimmune disease with the standard autoimmune panels although more specialized autoimmune tests consistently detect a wide range of auto antibodies Note The other key pathology is pervasive microclotting Additionally one common autoimmune disorder that frequently follows vaccination is antiphospholipid syndrome a very rare condition known to dramatically increase one s risks of blood clots infertility strokes and heart attacks I believe this risk is at least partly due to cell membranes where the spike proteins end up being seen by the immune system being largely composed of phospholipids The data on vaccine autoimmunity Numerous datasets exist suggesting there is a high risk of autoimmunity from the vaccine These include An Israeli government study found that 24 2 of those receiving a booster developed an exacerbation of a pre existing autoimmune condition Note COVID 19 vaccine side effects typically worsen with each successive vaccine dose something consistent with an immunological sensitization or a cumulative worsening of the physiologic zeta potential Note COVID 19 vaccine side effects typically worsen with each successive vaccine dose something consistent with an immunological sensitization or a cumulative worsening of the physiologic zeta potential A rheumatologic database published in the BMJ showed that 37 of patients had an adverse response to COVID 19 vaccination and 4 4 of those vaccinated experienced an exacerbation of a pre existing autoimmune condition Note This database only sampled patients with a pre existing

risk averaged 11 while afterward it averaged 25 I must emphasize that these are all massive and unprecedented increases The only two pharmaceuticals I can think of that had a similar ability to create autoimmunity were the HPV and anthrax vaccines Conclusion While I feel terrible for Kelly s adverse reaction I hope that this article serves to illustrate that her development of a new autoimmune condition was not all that uncommon and that doctors should have been aware of these risks before they pushed their patients to vaccinate especially for patients with a tendency to autoimmunity due to pre existing autoimmune disorders Sadly the opposite happened and those with pre existing autoimmune conditions were instead told it was urgent for them to vaccinate since they were immune suppressed and at a higher risk of getting COVID 19 One of the things that s difficult to appreciate about autoimmune conditions unless you have one is just how incredibly impactful and debilitating they can be for one s life For example my friend who developed PMR couldn t function for months and two of the doctors I worked with when the vaccines were introduced suffered debilitating and life threatening complications which caused them to have to leave the facility because they simply could no longer work Ed Dowd and his team have been attempting to quantify the economic impact of these injuries Large numbers of life insurance claims filed for sudden deaths and large numbers of people exiting the workforce due to vaccine induced disability have massive costs to society and most importantly these costs are big enough to threaten the profits of the upper class which may in turn motivate those in power to fix the problem Dowd s conservative estimate was that 18 26 6 million of the American workers who received the vaccines were injured 0 93 1 36 million were disabled and 0 05 to 0 1 300 thousand died One database they identified which shows England s monthly disability clearances sorted

Meike Terhorst joined The Defender In Depth this week to discuss the European Union s EU plans for a European Vaccination Card EVC the plan s similarities to the EU s Digital COVID Certificate the global push toward digital ID and implications for health and medical freedom The EU which pioneered the development of digital vaccine passports will next month launch a test run of its new EVC in five countries Belgium Germany Greece Latvia and Portugal The card purports to foster informed decision making on vaccination and improve continuity of care across the EU and aims to empower individuals by consolidating all their vaccination data in one easily accessible location While the objectives of the program set to be implemented throughout the EU by 2026 appear benign critics argue the EVC is a stepping stone for mandatory vaccinations in the future Some also argue the EVC is connected to large financial interests and plans to limit personal and national sovereignty The plan is to get everybody vaccinated For Terhorst efforts to launch the EVC are at their root about digital ID You get a digital ID where all your vaccination records are stored All your personal details are stored in one place and you can move it easily from one country to another without having to redo or reapply So basically it s about a digital ID and then a link from your personal ID to your medical records on vaccination she said Terhorst said that while the idea of having one s medical records easily accessible and transferrable sounds benign The plan is to get everybody vaccinated and to kind of overrule constitutional rights It was very clear that the object was that anybody within the EU could not say no to vaccination Terhorst said According to Terhorst this contravenes the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which in Chapter 1 Article 3 Right to the integrity of the person encapsulates the key tenets of the Nuremberg Declaration This includes a requirement for the free and informed consent of the person concerned in relation to medical procedures and the prohibition on making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain

perfect and it s all linked together like the banking infrastructure the personal medical records insurance everything links into each other Terhorst said The EVC is based on the World Health Organization s WHO Global Digital Health Certification Network which the EU and WHO co launched in June 2023 to promote a global interoperable digital vaccine passport based on the EU s digital health certificate Noting that plans for the EVC were launched in 2018 before the COVID 19 pandemic Terhorst said This plan is not new It has been in the making for a very long time Terhorst said the EVC threatens to usurp personal and national sovereignty There was a digital roadmap for a digital passport So basically the EU is trying to become a kind of country or federal state that has the capacity to issue a passport to all the EU citizens she said Terhorst also connected the plans to launch the EVC with the amendments to the WHO s International Health Regulations passed in June at the World Health Assembly The amendments contain articles that allow states to enforce medication on anybody during a crisis or emergency or pandemic she said It doesn t say that it has to be done but it gives this permission Terhorst also connected plans for the EVC with efforts in other countries to enact new pandemic preparedness plans She cited the example of New Zealand which last month published an

didn t stop transmission why was it so important I think still we don t know everything but we have to keep on digging and fighting for the truth to come out to really know why it was so important Will vaccines be mandated in Europe Terhorst cited as one example the recent release of the RKI Files in Germany named after the country s Robert Koch Institute the German equivalent of the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The files indicated that political objectives not science guided pandemic decision making in Germany According to Terhorst the files made it very clear that it was a scam the whole COVID 19 lockdown all the measures closing schools etc didn t have a scientific basis And so all the measures were based on political decisions and not on science although the public was told that it was all based on science The release of the files was significant Terhorst said because Germany is not just one of the five countries set to trial the EVC but is also Europe s economic leader and the home country of scandal ridden European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The European Commission is the EU s executive branch Germany has played a very important role in the COVID 19 period Terhors said And of course von der Leyen is German and she is the head of the European Commission She is very much in favor of vaccination and so she will push as much as she can to let this digital vaccination passport be a success and even I think to try to force people to get vaccinated Terhorst cited vaccine related scandals and legal challenges implicating von der Leyen Last month the European Court of Justice ruled that the European Commission s decision to heavily redact key portions of COVID 19 vaccine contracts with pharmaceutical companies during the pandemic violated the commission s transparency obligations This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The Defender is 100 reader supported No corporate sponsors No paywalls Our writers and

recent remarks by Catherine Austin Fitts founder and publisher of the Solari Report and former U S assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development who told The Defender the EVC represents another step toward asserting control of labor and travel with a goal to controlling resources and assets The goal is financial control Fitts said There is no legitimate public health purpose The central bankers are hiding behind a health narrative policies like lockdown are a way to manage inflation and resource demand when monetary policy is highly inflationary It s one big conglomerate which is ruling the world and it s this conglomerate which wants a change of the financial system Terhorst said And the change they want to have is that they can decide how much money you have in your own bank account with the CBDC central bank digital currency So basically and this is I think very important for everybody to realize it s not about health it s about your money Terhorst said They want to make you into a kind of minion as somebody who s not having real rights What the politic is moving towards it s much more towards a government or a political system where you have no rights and also you have no ownership and you have no right to say no Terhorst added Noting that influential organizations such as the WEF and the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation have supported efforts to develop digital ID and digital vaccine passports Terhorst said Such an accumulation of power is just incredible and it s a direct threat for every citizen The threat is that anybody objecting to vaccination especially when there will be a new crisis like we ve seen with COVID 19 then perhaps your bank could say well then you cannot have access to your bank account Terhorst said citing Canadian banks who

Pfizer BioNTech et à passer directement à une application à grande échelle Parmi les autres révélations on trouve des preuves que les décideurs politiques ont ciblé et poussé les enfants et que les décideurs politiques et les scientifiques savaient que les vaccins COVID 19 étaient inefficaces et entraînaient des effets indésirables graves En dépit de ces connaissances et pour des raisons politiques les responsables gouvernementaux ont pris des mesures récompensant les personnes vaccinées et punissant celles qui ne l étaient pas Les dossiers du RKI révèlent également que les décideurs
