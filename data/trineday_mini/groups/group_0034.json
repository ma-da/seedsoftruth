orientation and migration food finding reproduction mating nest and den building territorial maintenance and defense and on vitality longevity and survivorship itself Based on the available evidence the authors of the study urge regulatory agencies to recognize EMFs as a novel form of pollution and develop rules that allow them to be regulated as such In August 2021 The U S Court of Appeals for the D C Circuit ruled in favor of Children s Health Defense CHD in its landmark case against the Federal Communications Commission FCC challenging the FCC s decision not to review its health and safety guidelines regarding 5G and wireless technology The court ruled that the FCC failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its determination that its current guidelines adequately protect against harmful effects of exposure to radiofrequency radiation and failed to review the extensive evidence that was filed with the FCC The court also found that the FCC 2019 decision was arbitrary and capricious in its failure to respond to comments concerning environmental harm caused by RF radiation The court s decision continued to say the FCC completely failed to acknowledge let alone

smartphone to your car without a wire Similar to Wi Fi Bluetooth signals use frequencies of approximately 2 4 GHz which correspond to wavelengths of around 12 centimeters In order to establish a Bluetooth connection a device such as a Bluetooth speaker transmits signals that can be detected by other Bluetooth enabled devices such as a smartphone Once the smartphone discovers the device such

frequencies of 50 or 60 Hz Power lines generally use alternating current AC which is a type of current that periodically reverses directions and continuously changes its magnitude As electrical energy is transferred via the powerlines they emit electric and magnetic fields The electric field is present as long as the power line is operational The magnetic field is dependent on voltage and load current or demand the latter of which is determined by the amount of energy being used at any given time resulting in significantly different field strengths at different points in time High voltage

side of the head People who have used a cordless phone for ten years or more have higher rates of malignant brain tumor and acoustic neuromas It is worse if the cordless phone has been used primarily on one side of the head The current standard for exposure to the emissions of cell phones and cordless phones is not safe considering studies reporting long term brain tumor and acoustic neuroma risks

so the long term consequences of exposures are not known The consequence of prolonged exposures to children whose nervous systems continue to develop until late adolescence is unknown at this time This could have serious implications to adult health and functioning in society if years of exposure of the young to both ELF and RF result in diminished capacity for thinking judgment memory learning and control over behavior The effects of long term exposure to wireless technologies including emissions from cell phones and other personal devices and from whole body exposure to RF transmissions from cell towers and antennas is simply not known yet with certainty However the body of evidence at hand suggests that bioeffects and health impacts can and do occur at exquisitely low exposure levels levels that can be thousands of times below public safety limits Effects on Genes DNA Both ELF and RF exposures can be considered genotoxic will damage DNA under certain conditions of exposure including exposure levels that are lower than existing safety limits Effects on Stress Proteins Heat Shock Proteins Very low level ELF and RF exposures can cause cells to produce stress proteins meaning that the cell recognizes ELF and RF exposures as harmful This is another important way in which scientists have documented that ELF and RF exposures can be harmful and it happens at levels far below the existing public safety standards Effects on the Immune System There is substantial evidence that ELF and RF can cause inflammatory reactions allergy reactions and change normal immune

Electromagnetic Field Radiation 2022 Children may be at greater risk than adults from exposure to RF energy Their bodies and brains are still developing and are more vulnerable to exposures that could cause harm Because their skulls are thinner and their heads are smaller than those of adults children have a relatively greater risk of exposure to the RF energy of cell phones Children also will accumulate many more years of cell phone and wireless exposure than adults Animal research has also shown the potential for health effects of RF radiation to a developing fetus Seomun et al 2021 Significant associations were observed between exposure to ELF MFs and childhood leukemia Furthermore a possible dose response effect was also observed Sage and Burgio 2018 Mobile phones and other

Conclusions Children absorb greater amount of microwave radiation MWR than adults MWR is a Class 2B possible carcinogen as is carbon black carbon tetrachloride chloroform DDT lead nickel phenobarbital styrene diesel fuel and gasoline It seems clear that we would not expose children to these other agents so why would we expose children to microwave radiation Fetuses are even more vulnerable than children Therefore pregnant women should avoid exposing their fetus to microwave radiation Adolescent girls and women should not place cellphones in their bras or in hijabs Cell Phone manual warnings make clear an overexposure problem exists Wireless devices are radio transmitters not toys Selling toys that use them should be banned Government warnings have been issued but most of the public are unaware of such warnings Exposure limits are inadequate and should be revised such that they are adequate BioInitiative 2012 Report Issues New Warnings on Wireless and EMF 2013 While we aggressively

research has not been done Divan et al 2010 The findings of the previous publication were replicated in this separate group of participants demonstrating that cell phone use was associated with

of potential confounders the associations remained Divan et al 2008 Exposure to cell phones prenatally and to a lesser degree postnatally was associated with behavioral difficulties such as emotional and hyperactivity problems around the age of school entry These associations may be noncausal and may be due to unmeasured confounding If real they would be of public health concern given the widespread use of this technology Kheifets et al 2005 Concerns about the potential vulnerability of children to radio frequency RF fields have been raised because of the potentially greater susceptibility of their developing nervous systems in addition their brain tissue is more conductive RF penetration is greater relative to head size and they will have a longer lifetime of exposure

exposure showed that the study persons developed the microwave syndrome after installation of 5G base stations in the neighborhood of their dwellings Most prevalent were symptoms of the nervous system sleeping problems headache fatigue irritability emotional symptoms and concentration attention deficiency Very high RF radiation levels although much lower than limits recommended by ICNIRP and the FCC were measured with the broad band meter Some of the studied persons developed severe symptoms Most persons could move to another settlement without 5G whereby the microwave syndrome alleviated and disappeared within short U S Access Board IEQ Indoor Environmental Quality Project The Board recognizes that multiple chemical sensitivities and electromagnetic sensitivities may be considered disabilities under the ADA if they so severely impair the neurological respiratory or other functions of an individual that it substantially limits one or more of the individual s major life

health policy Furthermore WHO ICNIRP and IEEE ICES should be advocating and supporting research that would generate a reliable scientific evidence on what are the possible cause s of EHS Without such research there is not possible to develop diagnostic methods as well as any possible mitigation approaches There is an urgent need for the WHO to advocate for the national governments to urgently develop a comprehensive and common EHS health policy Hardell et al 2021 In conclusion there are at least three types of electromagnetic fields present in the working room which cause a long term exposure to the workers Exposure to multiple source electromagnetic fields could be the cause for developing EHS related symptoms However the person had been exposed to ELF EMF also at other locations in the building so exposure to RF EMF seems to be the most probable cause to her developed health problems Belpomme et al 2020 Altogether these data strongly suggest that EHS is a neurologic pathological disorder which can be diagnosed treated and prevented Because EHS is becoming a new insidious worldwide plague involving millions of people we ask the World Health Organization WHO to include EHS as a neurologic disorder in the international classification of diseases Stein et al 2020 It is concluded that the mechanisms underlying the symptoms of EHS are biologically plausible and that many organic physiologic responses occur following EMF exposure Patients can have neurologic neuro hormonal and neuro psychiatric symptoms following exposure to EMF as a consequence of neural damage and over sensitized neural responses More relevant diagnostic tests for EHS should be developed Exposure limits should be lowered to safeguard against biologic effects of EMF Spread of local and global wireless networks should be decreased and safer wired networks should be used instead of wireless to protect susceptible members of the public Public places should be made accessible for

These products may increase exposure Gorpinchenko et al 2014 A correlation exists between mobile phone radiation exposure DNA fragmentation level and decreased sperm motility Adams et al 2014 We conclude that pooled results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that mobile phone exposure negatively affects sperm quality West et al 2013 We report a case series of four young women ages from 21 to 39 with multifocal invasive breast cancer that raises the concern of a possible association with nonionizing radiation of electromagnetic field exposures from cellular phones All patients regularly carried their smartphones directly against their breasts in their brassieres for up to 10 hours a day for several years and developed tumors in areas of their breasts immediately underlying the phones European Environment Agency Report 2013 Evidence is increasing that workers with heavy long term use of wireless phones who develop glioma or acoustic neuroma should be compensated Volkow

anxiety like behaviour and spatial memory ability of mice did not change but the depression like behaviour was induced in mice after 4 9 GHz RF exposure In addition the number of neurons significantly reduced and the level of pyroptosis obviously increased in amygdala rather than hippocampus These results suggested that 4 9 GHz RF exposure could induce depression like behaviour which might be associated with the neuronal pyroptosis in amygdala ICBE EMF 2022 Thus urgently needed are health protective exposure limits for humans and the environment These limits must be based on scientific evidence rather than on erroneous assumptions especially given the increasing worldwide exposures of people and the environment to RFR including novel forms of radiation from 5G telecommunications for which there are no adequate health effects studies Nyberg et al 2022 Altogether this evidence establishes a high priority for the European Union towards i replacing the current flawed guidelines with protective thresholds and ii placing a moratorium on 5G deployment so as to iii allow industry independent scientists the time needed to propose new health protective guidelines This 2021 Appeal s relevance becomes even more pressing in the context of the EU plans to roll out the sixth generation of wireless technologies 6G further adding to the known risks of RFR technology for humans and the

of RF radiation which is documented in the research which is discussed above 9 10 21 24 54 55 These two small organizations are producing reports which seem to deny the existence of scientific

the EMR spectrum are defined as MMW This section explores the reported health impacts of MMW a part of the 5G spectrum Redmayne et al 2023 Once the 5G mmW band is internationally operational a significant proportion of the world s population will be exposed to new hazards The intensity and complexity of near field exposure such as when carrying a phone in a pocket or using it next to the

majority of studies report effects of low intensity exposures to both ELF EMF and RFR and a small percentage of published studies report that no effects are seen Hosseini et al 2022 It may be concluded that involvement of ELF EMF and prenatal stress in potential induction of anxiety like behavior via the hippocampus may be different such that ELF EMF may initiate anxiety like behavior by increasing 25 S OHC and PNMDAr2 NMDAr2 in the hippocampus while prenatal stress probably increases anxiety like behavior by elevating corticosterone and decreasing serotonin Seomun et al 2021

explores the biophysical mechanisms by which EMF exposure produces health impacts Panagopoulos et al 2021 The present study reviews the DNA damage and related effects induced by human made EMFs The ion forced oscillation mechanism for irregular gating of voltage gated ion channels on cell membranes by polarized coherent EMFs is extensively described Dysfunction of ion channels disrupts intracellular ionic concentrations which determine the cell s electrochemical balance and homeostasis The present study shows how this can result in DNA damage through reactive oxygen species free radical overproduction Thus a complete picture is provided of how human made EMF exposure may indeed lead to DNA damage and related pathologies including cancer Yakymenko et al 2015 In conclusion our analysis demonstrates that low intensity RFR is an expressive oxidative agent for living cells with a high pathogenic potential and that the oxidative stress induced by RFR exposure should be

metanalyses on the relationship between cancer and RFs particularly those on mobile phones still identify areas of uncertainty that need to be investigated and studies on non cancer effects are growing in number suggesting the possibility of new risks The relative scenarios that will open with the 5G trial are likely to change the overall exposure level of the population as a result of major changes in the network architecture Therefore it is important to adopt a strongly precautionary approach Given the strong concerns of the population the competent institutions should implement

size and seriousness of any brain tumour risk that may exist Reducing exposures may also help to reduce the other possible harms that are not considered in this case study Kheifets et al 2005 Concerns about the potential vulnerability of children to radio frequency RF fields have been raised because of the potentially greater susceptibility of their developing nervous systems in addition their brain tissue is more conductive RF penetration is greater relative to head size and they will have a longer lifetime of exposure than adults This article is based on discussions from the workshop and provides background information on the development of the embryo fetus and child with particular attention to the developing brain an outline of childhood susceptibility to environmental toxicants and childhood diseases implicated in EMF studies and a review of childhood exposure to EMFs It also includes an assessment of the potential susceptibility of children to EMFs and concludes with a recommendation for additional research and the development of precautionary policies in the face of scientific uncertainty The Inadequacy of Federal Exposure Guidelines This section explores the fundamental flaws of current federal RF exposure guidelines Thousands of peer reviewed studies show biological effects induced below the Federal Communications Commission s FCC s exposure limits In a historic win for CHD against the FCC in 2021 the D C Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC s 2019 order to not review its 1996 exposure guidelines was arbitrary and capricious in its failure to respond to record evidence that exposure to RF radiation at levels below the Commission s current limits may cause negative health effects unrelated to cancer Furthermore the court held That failure

sensors and other technologies designed to automate functions and processes by collecting large volumes of fine grained real time data and exchanging that information with other IoT devices via the internet Simply put the IoT is the transformation of everyday objects into internet enabled devices that can talk think act and interact The IoT network has the potential to generate up to 11 trillion in economic value in 2025 and is forecasted to reach over 29 billion devices worldwide by 2030 almost doubling the 15 billion devices in 2023 While IoT technologies differ in design and function they share four main components sensors cloud connectivity data processing and a user interface The sensors are the physical components of IoT devices that collect data about the physical environment of the object including cameras accelerometers gyroscopes thermometers infrared detectors motion sensors pressure gauges smoke detectors and humidity sensors As the sensors collect information it is transferred to a cloud storage system accessed over the internet via wireless communication such as cellular WiFi Bluetooth or satellite Once transferred to the cloud software tools are used to process and analyze the data to accomplish a particular task or function For example data collected from a smart home camera can be processed to identify intruders in a home Once collected and processed it is relayed to the end user via a user interface often through an alert on a smartphone application The user interface can simply relay information to the end user such as alerting the homeowner of the intruder or it can allow the user to affect the physical environment of the sensor such as notifying the authorities The Internet of Everything IoE the second generation of IoT IoT 2

Center to the Federal Trade Commission on the Privacy and Security Implications of the Internet of Things 2013 Electronic Privacy Information Center EPIC The vast quantity of data generated by the Internet of Things creates the risk that this data could be used for purposes that are either unnecessary to the provision of a given service or not initially disclosed to the consumer Smart devices could reveal a wealth of information about consumers location media consumption activity patterns associations lifestyle age income gender race and health information with potential commercial value Companies might attempt to exploit this data by using it to target advertising or selling it directly Because the Internet of Things will generate data from all aspects of consumers lives these types of secondary uses could lead to the commercialization of intimate segments of consumers lives These surveillance enabled increases in power will also facilitate companies ability to influence or direct the behavior of consumers This influence or direction may take many forms and may be accomplished through a variety of consumer devices For example insurance companies might use Event Data

unenhanced humans One concern is that they will view us as a different and inferior life form much as we now regard chimpanzees Loss of individuality is another long term future scenario If BCIs are

Technology Group Bluetooth signals can be intercepted by third party devices within range allowing hackers to access sensitive information such as personal contacts and messages To prevent eavesdropping it is essential to use strong encryption when transmitting sensitive data and to disable Bluetooth when not in use Bluetooth connections can be intercepted by a hacker who poses as a legitimate device to gain access to sensitive information To prevent man in the middle attacks it is important to verify the authenticity of devices before connecting to them and to use secure authentication protocols Bluetooth devices can be configured to be discoverable making them vulnerable to unauthorized access To prevent unauthorized access it is vital to configure devices to be non discoverable and to use strong passwords or PINs to secure them Peker et al 2022 Sensors In our analyzed devices we found that they have vulnerabilities that could be exploited either to track users collect potentially private information e g health related data biometrics related data or in the case of the keyboard that we studied collect sensitive data such as passwords or private identifiable

individual liberty yet conceived It has the potential to trace track and surveil subjects and to compile a complete record of all activity from cradle to grave Michael Rectenwald Turley 2020 Boston University Law Review For decades cinematic and literary works have explored worlds without privacy fishbowl societies with continual omnipresent surveillance For those worried about a post privacy world facial recognition technology and other biometric technology could well be the expanding portal to that dystopia These technologies are rapidly transforming a society predicated on privacy into a diaphanous society where identity and transparency are defining elements Biometric technology is perfectly suited to evade current privacy protections and doctrines because it presents new challenges to the existing legal framework protecting privacy The greatest threat of this technological shift is to democratic activities the very reason that countries such as China have invested so heavily into biometric surveillance systems Is Your Identity at Risk from Biometric Data Collection 2019 BeyondTrust However the most significant issue with biometric data is the static nature of biometric data itself When a password is compromised you can defuse password re use attacks simply by changing the password However you cannot change your biometric data so once it s compromised it can persist as an identity based threat Your eyes face or fingerprints are forever linked to your identity Any future hacks that solely rely on compromised biometric data can be an easy target for

construction of a comprehensive system of identification and tracking 7 Biggest Privacy Concerns Around Facial Recognition Technology 2022 The Civil Liberties Union for Europe Liberties The way facial recognition technology is used is inherently invasive and intrusive As it is done today data collection is realized without the consent or the knowledge of the individuals for instance you can be filmed just walking down the street Being recorded and monitored without one s consent and even knowledge is a clear infringement of one s individual privacy and freedom It takes away the reassurance of being able to move and act freely without the fear of being constantly watched and surveilled Being watched changes the way we behave and also affects our well being Such a gaze may create a feeling of always being surveilled by people which can lead to increased stress and decreased trust between the people and the government If people fear their daily interactions and conversations are being monitored they might avoid criticizing the government for fear of something happening to them or their loved ones Facial recognition technology is of concern because of its potential to become a biometric mass surveillance tool Surveillance especially in the case of demonstrations muzzles freedom of expression and chills activities such as political activism These tools are used to monitor the population and in countries where criticizing the government is not tolerated to the arrest of those who oppose the government Facial Recognition Technology and Law Enforcement Select

the hands of central governments CBDCs Threaten Privacy 2023 International Banker CBDCs are being developed precisely because they provide governments with increased control and power This kind of threat to individual rights will naturally drive people toward private solutions while governments are sure to work hard to thwart such alternatives since they undermine the increased government control and power CBDCs create Some supporters still believe CBDCs can be designed so that privacy is protected but this view is naïve because government officials would not be able to reap the supposed benefits of CBDCs if they enabled anonymous transactions This view also ignores the fact that supposed CBDC benefits won t be realised if people have alternative payment options Governments would not be able to programme citizens spending for instance if people could use cash instead of CBDCs Central Banks Must Not Be Blind To The Threats Posed By CBDCs 2023 Financial Times Central banks could be viewed as political agents if their visibility into payment transactions is used for law enforcement or surveillance purposes What s worse authoritarian or even ostensibly benevolent

privacy violations that are already built into the financial system The United States is often heralded as a free country with substantial protections for civil liberties but the reality often does not live up to such expectations or constitutional dictates And this is especially true in the financial arena Despite this regrettable situation a CBDC would endanger financial privacy to an even

and Machine Learning Artificial intelligence AI refers to a machine s ability to perform cognitive functions such as problem solving learning and reasoning Machine learning ML is an application of AI that allows computers to learn through identifying patterns and trends rather than through explicit programmed instructions AI and ML can analyze large amounts of data at efficiencies and computational powers significantly greater than that of humans Put another way by Taiwanese computer scientist Kai Fu Lee AI is basically run on data and fueled by data The more data the better the AI works The ChatGPT chatbot for example trained on over 45 terabytes of text on the internet including Wikipedia and digitized books Since the term was coined in the 1950s AI has gone through periods of advancement and relative disinterest However in 2023 generative AI an application of AI capable of independently generating unique images texts and videos using ML exploded in popularity According to

most toxic metals on earth and adverse health effects from mercury have been known for centuries The Mad Hatter popularized in the Disney movie Alice in Wonderland personified the idea that hat makers in the early 19th century often went mad which we now know was due mercury compounds used in processing the felt Mercury in all its forms is a potential neurodevelopmental poison The three broad forms of mercury are organic inorganic and elemental i The organic category contains methylmercury a mercury compound found in seafood as well as ethylmercury an ingredient in Thimerosal Certain elemental and organic mercury compounds are known to be potent neurotoxins ii Mercury can severely disrupt the normal neurodevelopmental processes in the human brain causing problems in migration and division of neurons as well as cell degeneration and ultimately cell death iii iv v vi In particular mercury has a high binding affinity for the element selenium which in the human body is found in proteins that protect cells from damaging free radicals of oxygen The brain relies on selenium containing proteins for this antioxidant protection more so than other tissues which helps explain why mercury is neurotoxic at very low levels vii viii ix The so called oxidative stress that results from insufficient antioxidant protection disrupts gene expression All cells contain the same genetic information in their DNA so in order to produce the vastly different cell types in our bodies from blood to bone these genes must be only selectively turned on or expressed One of the chief mechanisms for regulating gene expression is known as methylation which is the binding of a methyl group to a location on a DNA molecule Methylation inhibits the expression of a nearby gene This sort of regulation is known as epigenetic regulation as it involves the modification of DNA without an alteration of the underlying genetic information Oxidative stress brought on by mercury exposure prevents proper methylation and thus epigenetic regulation which can lead to improper development in an organism x xi Other recent findings have also shown that the type of cells that allow synchronization of neural networks during attention called parvalbumin expressing interneurons do not develop if their supply of selenium is disrupted or if they experience oxidative stress xii Studies have shown that developing brains are particularly susceptible to mercury xiii xiv Studies in 1986 and 1989 examined children in a New Zealand population exposed prenatally to mercury through maternal fish consumption When evaluated at four and six years of age the children with moderate to high exposures as measured through the proxy of mercury content in their mothers hair of greater than six parts

Southern Denmark and the Harvard School of Public Health and colleagues published a study based on a population in the Faroe Islands near Denmark This population traditionally has high mercury exposures because of a diet rich in pilot whale meat The researchers found that children with prenatal exposure to mercury displayed cognitive deficits in language attention memory and though less pronounced in visuospatial and motor functions xviii The study overall suggested that mercury has widespread effects on brain function xix Further work with the Faroe Islands cohort produced a relevant 2004 study This research noted that delays in auditory responses an indicator of brain damage resulting from prenatal mercury exposure persisted in subjects at least into their early teens again indicating that some neurotoxic effects from mercury are irreversible xx A review article in 2012 stated that emerging evidence indicates methylmercury may have adverse effects on the neurologic and other body systems at common low levels of exposure and that in children prenatal exposure may be more deleterious than postnatal exposure for most but likely not all neurodevelopmental measures xxi Other recent findings in this vein come from a study with Inuit children in Arctic Quebec The 2012 study reported a correlation between children s mercury exposure concentrations in the womb from their mothers fish heavy diets and later classroom assessments consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD xxii Another 2012 study on subjects recruited in New Bedford Massachusetts also associated prenatal exposure to mercury again through the proxy of maternal hair mercury levels with a greater risk of ADHD related behaviors and at levels as low as one microgram per gram or one part per million xxiii Additional important research in this area is the work that has drawn connections between exposure to mercury during fetal development and apparently permanent reductions in a child s intelligence In a 2005 study Leonardo Trasande of New York University found that between 316 588 and 637 233 children each year have cord blood mercury levels greater than 5 8 micrograms per

novel dangers introduced by 5G technology is its reliance on high frequency millimeter waves MMWs a bountiful and not previously commercialized portion of the electromagnetic spectrum While 5G s enthusiasts are quick to promise support for literally billions of devices there is one catch the shorter millimeter wavelengths cannot travel as far as the lower frequencies used for earlier generations of mobile technology Thus while there were about 300 000 wireless antennas on U S cell towers and buildings as of 2016 a doubling since 2002 5G will require exponentially more millions of small cell towers every 500 feet on every street corner even in the home environment 5G technology will blast through walls and cribs making a mockery of the notion that your home is your castle in which you are supposed to be safe Organizations concerned about the health hazards of wireless radiation note that Right now you don t have to live next to a cell tower but once they have these 5G cell antennas everywhere you won t be able to move away Unfortunately the nowhere to hide aspects of 5G are even more serious because ground based 5G systems will be supplemented by satellite based systems In March 2018 the FCC approved the initial launch of over 4 400 low Earth orbit 5G communication satellites to be followed by thousands more over the next two years with the eventual result being 11 times more satellites orbiting the Earth than currently The satellites will send tightly focused beams of intense microwave radiation at each specific 5G device that is on the Earth while each device then sends a beam of radiation back to the satellite In practical terms this means that in crowded locations such as airports individuals bodies will be penetrated by numerous beams of radiation as they walk or as other people walk around them with their 5G smartphones But even in the home environment 5G technology will blast through walls and cribs making a mockery of the notion

allow us to sweat also respond to 5G radiation much like an antenna that can receive signals Moratorium urgently needed When the FCC endorsed the transition to 5G in 2016 then Chairman Tom Wheeler a former telecom industry lobbyist vowed to allow new 5G technologies and innovations to evolve and flourish without needlessly prescriptive regulations Thus even though 5G represented a radical shift in technology the FCC proposed no further safety studies instead continuing to rely on its outdated excessively permissive and thus widely criticized radiation exposure guidelines that are based primarily on a 30 year old analysis many years before the emergence of most of the digital wireless technology in use today A recent government study by the National Toxicology Program which

base preservative thimerosal was used in infant vaccines and continues to be used in several vaccine preparations including influenza tetanus and meningococcal vaccines most consumers have no idea that mercury is also a commonly used ingredient in other pharmaceutical products including nasal sprays eye drops ear drops and injectable testosterone There are several hundred peer reviewed scientific publications published over the last 7 decades by leading research scientists and public health agencies that have confirmed that thimerosal is a potent neurotoxin It has never been proven safe for medical use and cost effective alternatives exist There are at last count over 100 FDA approved pharmaceutical products which contain mercury The typical amount of mercury in these products is 50 000 ppb To put this in perspective the EPA requires liquid waste which exceeds 200 ppb of mercury to be sent to a special hazardous waste landfill and according to the EPA drinking water cannot exceed 2 ppb of mercury So technically if these products are not used they must be disposed of as hazardous waste What makes the fact that mercury continues to be used in medical products even more disturbing is the fact that Food and Drug Administration FDA has recognized the inherent risks from the use of mercury in medicine since 1975 when they convened an expert panel to review its use in over the counter OTC products The FDA published proposed rules in the Federal Register on January 5 1982 that found mercury containing products were toxic caused cell death and in the case of thimerosal were only as effective as water as a preservative The panel members concluded that all mercury based preservatives used in over the counter products should be labeled as category II not being generally recognized as being safe or effective Despite the expert panel s recommendation the FDA did not actually act on these recommendations until 1998 In the final rulemaking the FDA stated that the safety and effectiveness have not been established for the ingredients mercury based preservatives included in this current final rule and manufacturers have not submitted the necessary data in response to earlier opportunities The agency s experience has been that under these circumstances companies have not submitted data in response to yet another opportunity Consumers will benefit

dollar industry with vaccines accounting for 25 billion in annual sales CDC s decision to add a vaccine to the schedule can guarantee its manufacturer millions of customers and billions in revenue with minimal advertis ing or marketing costs and complete immunity from lawsuits High stakes and the seamless marriage between Big Pharma and government agencies have spawned an opaque and crooked regulatory system Merck one of America s leading vaccine outfits is currently under investigation for deceiving FDA regulators about the effectiveness of its MMR vaccine Two whistleblowers say Merck ginned up sham studies to maintain Merck s MMR monopoly Big money has fueled the exponential expansion of CDC s vaccine schedule since 1988 when Congress grant of immunity from lawsuits suddenly

insatiable pharmaceutical industry has 271 new vaccines under development in CDC s bureaucratic pipeline in hopes of boosting vaccine revenues to 100 billion by 2025 The industry s principle spokesperson Dr Paul Offit says that he believes children can take as many as 10 000 vaccines Public health may not be the sole driver of CDC decisions to mandate new vaccines Four scathing federal studies including two by Congress one by the US Senate and one by the HHS Inspector General paint CDC as a cesspool of corruption mismanagement and dysfunction with alarming conflicts of interest suborning its research regulatory and policymaking functions CDC rules allow vaccine industry profiteers like Dr Offit to serve on advisory boards that add new vaccines to the schedule In a typical example Offit in 1999 sat on the CDC s vaccine advisory committee and voted to add the rotavirus vaccine to CDC s schedule paving the way for him to make a fortune on his own rotavirus vaccine Offit and his business partners sold the royalties to his rotavirus vaccine patent to Merck in 2006 for 182 million Offit told Newsweek It was like winning the lottery A 2009 HHS Inspector General s report found that the CDC certified financial disclosure forms with at least one omission for 97 of committee members and most forms had more than one type of omission The same report stated that as many as 64 of committee members had potential conflicts of interest that CDC did not identify or resolve before certifying their forms In addition to lucrative business partnerships with Merck Offit holds a 1

who is author of the principal study cited by CDC to exculpate mercury preserved vaccines from the autism link invoked whistleblower protection and turned extensive agency files over to Congress Thompson who is still employed at CDC says that for the past decade his superiors have pressured him and his fellow scientists to lie and manipulate data about the safety of the mercury based preservative thimerosal to conceal its causative link to a suite of brain injuries including autism Thimerosal is 50 ethylmercury which is far more toxic and persistent in the brain than the highly regulated methylmercury in fish Hundreds of peer reviewed studies by leading government and university scientists show that thimerosal is a devastating brain poison linked to neurological disorders now epidemic in American children My book Thimerosal Let the Science Speak is a summary of these studies which CDC and its credulous jour nalists swear don t exist Although Thompson s CDC and vaccine industry colleagues have created nine patently fraudulent and thoroughly discredited epidemiological studies to defend thimerosal no published study shows thimerosal to be safe The common canard that US autism rates rose after drug makers removed most thimerosal from pediatric vaccines in 2003 is wrong That same year CDC added flu shots containing massive doses of thimerosal to the pediatric schedule As a result children today can get nearly as much mercury exposure as children did from all pediatric vaccines combined in the decade prior to 2003 Worse thimerosal for the first time is being given to pregnant women in flu shots Furthermore CDC s current autism numbers are for children born in 2002 when kids were still getting thimerosal in their pediatric vaccines The best science suggests that thimerosal s complete removal from vaccines is likely to prompt a significant decline in autism For example a 2013 CDC study in JAMA Pediatrics shows a 33 drop in autism spectrum disorder in Denmark following the 1992 removal of thimerosal from Danish vaccines That paper is among 37 peer reviewed studies linking thimerosal to the autism epidemic Thimerosal has precipitated a

outlets dutifully stoking public hysteria on editorial pages and throughout the 24 hour broadcast cycle With Dr Offit leading the charge CDC drug makers and industry funded front groups parlayed a garden variety annual measles outbreak into a national tidal wave of state legislation to ban religious and philosophical vaccine exemptions The national media frenzy over 159 measles cases left little room for attention to the the autism cataclysm which has debilitated 1 million American children since the pandemic began in 1989 with 27 000 new cases annually CDC refuses to call autism an epidemic In defiance of hard science and common sense CDC and Offit have launched a denial campaign to gull reporters into believing the autism plague is an illusion created by better diagnosis Big

of Appeals Attorneys Robert F Kennedy Jr W Scott McCullough Case Summary On Feb 2 2021 the Children s Health Defense CHD filed a case called a Petition for Review against the Federal Communications Commission FCC challenging the amendment to the Over the Air Reception Devices OTARD Rule The amended rule was adopted by the FCC on Jan 7 2021 and went into effect on March 29 2021 CHD s Petition was joined by four individual petitioners including a physician and the two parents each with two children who have been injured by wireless radiation The case was filed in the U S Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit Robert F Kennedy Jr justly described OTARD as a draconian rule as it will have overreaching implications From the moment CHD became aware that the FCC intended to adopt this rule it was clear to us that allowing it to go into effect without a challenge was not an option In April 2020 CHD started its campaign against OTARD by laying the groundwork for a lawsuit when it filed a 22 page letter with the FCC The letter was joined by a record number of 15 090 people and a staggering number of them 6 231 declared that they and or their children have become injured by wireless radiation Approximately 2 500 people added personal comments many of them substantive with heartbreaking testimonials of sickness and death caused by wireless radiation Parents wrote about their children s sickness with cancer radiation sickness and the aggravating effects of wireless on their children s autism symptoms and seizures They are terrified of the devastating effects the adoption of OTARD will have on their lives CHD s suit filed under the Administrative Procedures Act asserts that the FCC s adoption of OTARD violates constitutional rights and upends long standing common law personal and property rights It leads to due process violations is arbitrary an abuse of discretion and it passed without authority and statutory jurisdiction Related Links Documents Filed with the Court

the D C Circuit ruled in favor of Children s Health Defense CHD in a landmark case against the Federal Communications Commission FCC that challenged the FCC s decision not to review its 1996 RF exposure guidelines The court held that the FCC failed to consider the non cancer evidence of adverse health effects related to wireless technology the environmental impacts of RF radiation and the impact of RF radiation on children the health implications of long term exposure to RF radiation the ubiquity of wireless devices and other technological developments that have occurred since the Commission last updated its guidelines On Feb 2 2020 Children s Health Defense CHD filed a case against the Federal Communications Commission FCC challenging its decision not to review its 25 year old radio frequency emissions RF guidelines which regulate the radiation emitted by wireless technology devices such as cell phones and iPads and infrastructure cell towers Wi Fi and smart meters and to promulgate biologically and evidence based guidelines that adequately protect public health In 1996 the FCC adopted guidelines which only protect consumers from adverse effects occurring at levels of radiation that cause thermal effects temperature change in tissue while ignoring substantial evidence of profound harms from pulsed and modulated RF radiation at non thermal levels The FCC hasn t reviewed its guidelines or the evidence since despite clear scientific evidence of harm and growing rates of RF related sickness In 2012 the Government Accountability Office of Congress published a report recommending that the FCC re assess its guidelines As a result in 2013 the FCC published an inquiry to decide whether the guidelines should be reviewed It opened docket 13 84 for the public to file comments Thousands of comments and scientific evidence by scientists medical organizations and doctors as well as hundreds of comments by people who have become sick from this radiation were filed in support of new rules Nevertheless on December 4 2019 the FCC closed the docket and published its decision affirming the adequacy of its guidelines without proper assessment of the comments or

argued that the FCC ignored evidence of mechanisms of harm their guidelines do not apply to actual use of cell phones and disregard the biological effects of crucial elements of this technology such

review of the evidence complies with the standards set out by the APA and by court decisions The FCC argued that it had reasonably relied on the expert advice of other federal agencies and standard setting bodies in its decision that no evidence of biological and adverse health effects from non thermal levels of wireless radiation exists and therefore that no change to its 1996 RF emissions guidelines were warranted Related Links STAGE 5 CHD Filed Reply Brief The Petitioners Reply Brief which is a response to the FCC s brief was filed on October 19 2021 where the petitioners pointed out

Regarding the 1 25 Oral Arguments in its Case Against the FCC on 5G Wireless Harms In the Media STAGE 6 Filing of the Joint Appendix Nov 14 2020 The Joint Appendix JA is the collection of all the evidence that was referenced in the briefs to support the arguments made The JA is filed with the court after all the briefs have been filed In this case the JA includes 440 documents with a total of approximately 11 000 pages of evidence The table of contents alone is 54 pages long Because of its size the JA was divided into 27 volumes Just printing and filing it with the court cost 15 000 STAGE 5 Petitioners Reply Brief Filed Oct 19 2020 The Petitioners Reply Brief which is a response to the FCC s brief was filed on October 19 2021 The petitioners pointed out that the standard setting bodies the FCC relied upon in reaching its decision are biased industry related organizations While powerful these bodies in fact represent a minority opinion The brief provides evidence showing for example that courts have found ICNIRP on which the FCC relied to be biased and determined that its recommended guidelines and scientists are not credible The petitioners refuted the FCC claim that not much has changed since 1996 and that even if the evidence may have been controversial 20 years ago it is now clear The brief also showed that the FCC used unauthorized materials misconstrued evidence brought by the petitioners and misrepresented other government agencies positions STAGE 4 FCC Respondent Brief Filed Sep 22 2020 The FCC s the Respondent brief was filed on September 22 2020 Respondent is the term used for the defendants in PFR cases The FCC argued that it had reasonably relied on the expert advice of other federal agencies and standard setting bodies in its decision that no evidence of biological and adverse health effects from non thermal levels of wireless radiation exists and therefore that no change to its 1996 RF emissions guidelines were warranted The FCC asserted that its review of the evidence complies with the standards set out by the APA and by court decisions STAGE 3", "chunk_id":

Briefs in Support of Petitioners filed Aug 5 2020 STAGE 2 Petitioners Opening Brief main brief Filed July 29 2020 The Opening Brief in the case was filed on July 29 2020 It is the main brief of the petitioners in the case The brief lays out evidence showing that the FCC s 1996 guidelines which are based on the assumption that non ionizing radiation at non thermal levels levels that do not change temperature in tissue cannot have biological and adverse health effects ignore human biology and are based on an obsolete false and disproven scientific assumption promoted by physicists and engineers The brief cites thousands of studies and medical reports including those conducted by U S government agencies showing clear evidence of harm and references hundreds of testimonials by people who have become sick from radiation within the FCC allowed levels The petitioners also argued that the FCC ignored evidence of mechanisms of harm their guidelines do not apply to actual use of cell phones and disregard the biological effects of crucial elements of this technology such as pulsation modulation and specific frequencies nor do they address the current reality of constant and cumulative effects of exposure to many sources of radiation over many years In the Media STAGE 1 Lawsuit Filed Feb 2 2020 On Feb 2 2020 the Children s Health Defense filed a lawsuit against the Federal Communications

federal government belongs to the states Each state maintains its own constitution statutes and policies and also maintains 3 distinct branches of government the executive the legislature and the judiciary This separation of powers ensures that adequate checks and balances are in place so that one branch does not gain more power than the other two To understand how the CHD legal team navigates the legal system it is important to know how the U S government is structured how the court systems work as well as the foundations of litigation Law 101 provides a brief description of legal terms and basic civil procedure so that you can be informed and understand the law Children s Health Defense CHD accomplishes much of its advocacy through the legal system This section is a primer on U S civics and legal process It discusses natural rights the various governmental authorities the limits on their powers and the types of law promulgated by each It also discusses the basic process involved in a lawsuit some key types of legal documents and the elements of legal analysis argument and reasoning Why is it worth developing a basic understanding of the legal system Here are some thoughts about that question While we are all interconnected and interdependent a certain amount of self sufficiency is essential to a good life and to the extent we are able we should avoid outsourcing core aspects of our life to experts This is as true of our legal rights as it is of our health Just as we are likely to be healthier and happier if we don t allow our physical well being to depend wholly on the expertise of health professionals we re likely to be freer and happier if we don t allow our legal well being to depend wholly on the expertise of legal professionals We need to know what our rights are so we can recognize when they re being trampled we need to understand the limits of governmental power so we can push back when governments exceed those limits Natural Law The Declaration of Independence recognizes the natural rights of human beings and acknowledges that these rights pre exist any governments or laws While many argue that the Declaration is not legally binding its beautiful language is nonetheless at the heart of much meaningful legal advocacy We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness", "chunk_id":

Constitution s division of political power and sovereignty between the national and state governments Under the Constitution the national i e federal government is a government of limited power for example the powers of Congress are enumerated in Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution The Supremacy Clause of the constitution states that in areas where the federal government has authority the federal government reigns supreme that is its laws take precedence over any state laws However the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments of the Constitution protect state sovereignty and make it clear that the states and We the People have power over areas not expressly delegated to the federal government Questions about the appropriate balance of power between the federal and state governments often lurk in the background of litigation Separation of Powers Separation of powers refers to the Constitution s division of political power among the legislative executive and judicial branches of government The legislative branch makes law the executive branch executes the law and the judicial branch interprets and applies the law This means that the executive branch including executive agencies is not supposed to create new laws instead it is limited to implementing laws duly enacted by Congress Of course the line between legislating and executing law is not always clear and many

Religious Exemption From Most Recent Sept 22 2020 The religious exemption repeal in NYS left 26 000 children out of schooling options and radically affected many families I am pleased to publish the Reply Brief we filed earlier this week in support of our appeal of a decision rendered last December by a State Supreme Court lowest state court dismissing our constitutionally based challenge to that

State children who suffered the removal of their religious exemption rights to vaccination in June 2019 On June 13 2019 the New York legislature repealed the 55 year old exemption without even a single public hearing Attorneys Michael Sussman and Robert F Kennedy Jr filed with the Appellate Division Third Department located in Albany The attorneys requested oral argument The lawyers brief criticizes the lower court decision dismissing the case explaining how it failed to apply the correct standard of review The brief also details how lawmakers displayed overt targeted hostility towards those exercising their First Amendment religious rights It further argues that the repeal violated the New York Constitution and unjustly burdened other fundamental rights The requirements of religious tolerance public health and school attendance The 2019 measles outbreak with its failed State response did not provide a legitimate basis for overturning this careful equilibrium The brief convincingly shows that the repeal has devastated thousands of families and has betrayed New York s long history of religious tolerance Read the Appellant s Brief Oct 16 2019 At this time Children s Health Defense and Michael H Sussman Esq have decided not to appeal the denial of the preliminary injunction to the U S Supreme Court in F F on behalf of her minor children v New York Stat e regarding the repeal of the religious exemption in New York State While we strongly believe that the State s actions are unlawful and unjustifiable we do not believe that appealing to the U S Supreme Court at

arguments Aug 23 2019 On Aug 23 Judge Denise Hartman issued a decision denying the preliminary injunction stay sought on behalf of 26 000 children and their families affected by the repeal of vaccine religious exemptions The Judge composed a 34 page opinion which in summary made the following critical points It was established that absent an injunction there would be irreparable harm to the children and families involved The judge stated that she had read and found quite compelling the nearly 400 affidavits submitted and acknowledged that her decision would cause families and students substantial hardship The court did not feel the balance of equities tipped in our favor a second factor to consider in deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction because Her Honor reasoned unvaccinated children pose a threat to others who cannot get vaccinations The court viewed this threat as very significant in her decision The judge concluded that we do not have a strong chance on ultimately succeeding in showing that the repeal violated any constitutional right The court reasoned that there is no constitutional right to a religious exemption and that the legislature had neutral not discriminatory purposes which she found compelling that is protecting public health The court found the comments ambiguous that claimed to show animus toward religion and felt the legislature s purpose was benign not discriminatory toward those of religious faith Aug 15 2019 On Aug 14 attorneys Michael H Sussman and Robert F Kennedy Jr presented oral arguments on behalf of 55

the denial of an education to special needs students in New York who are not fully vaccinated issued the following statement yesterday Looking strategically at the decision from federal Judge Alleyne Ross denying a preliminary injunction in V D v State of New York we made the decision to voluntarily dismiss the action and our notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice was filed on Thursday Aug 22 2019 There was something of a victory out of this litigation despite the denial of our request for a preliminary injunction Many districts had been informing families that New York State Education Department NYSED was telling districts they did not have to provide services to homeschooled children who do not have all mandated vaccinations After the filing of our complaint and motion papers NYSED in its opposition to our motion and in the Aug 16 guidance from the New York State Department of Health reversed that position and is now telling districts to provide services there is an issue with the 6 1 deadline to notice districts but none of these families knew they would need to consider homeschool on 6 1 and NYSED is encouraging districts to provide services to families who provide post 6 1 notice We are looking at additional avenues to address issues regarding children with IEPs so while this specific case has been dismissed work is continuing We continue to be committed to these issues for all children in New York not only children with special needs Aug 19 2019 On Aug 5 a motion was filed for a preliminary injunction to stop the state of New York from

and the plaintiff s reply were filed last week On Monday Aug 19 Judge Allyne Ross denied the request Attorney Kim Mack Rosenberg stated We are of course disappointed in Judge Ross s decision denying a

in the settings mandated by their IEPs We are carefully analyzing the Court s decision and assessing next steps Aug 5 2019 In the IEP litigation a motion was filed for a preliminary injunction on Aug 5 2019 Judge Allyne Ross in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York has set an expedited briefing schedule for this motion The Defendants have to file any opposition papers by Aug 13 at 5 p m and plaintiffs have to file their reply by Aug 15 at 3 p m A hearing date has not been set but all involved know this issue is time sensitive with the start of school in September Plaintiffs argued in their motion that the Court should stay the implementation of the amended New York law especially with respect to students with Individualized Education Programs IEPs who have extensive rights under federal law The amended state law prevents these vulnerable children from going to school and receiving services that the families and districts agree are appropriate and has denied families notice and due process rights they are entitled to under federal law Thus plaintiffs argue the federal law preempts the state law and states law should yield to the federal law

Denied to School Children Sept 21 2020 On Monday September 21st attorneys on behalf of Children s Health Defense and named plaintiffs filed a response in Jane Doe et al v Howard Zucker et al to the New York Department of Health s motion to dismiss The lawsuit challenges NYS policies and procedures that unconstitutionally restrict medically vulnerable children from getting necessary medical exemptions from licensed physicians The DOH contends that the court should dismiss the case arguing that state vaccine policy cannot be questioned as a result of a 1905 Supreme Court case permitting vaccine mandates under state police power Plaintiffs respond that the Supreme Court has many times over acknowledged that medical exemptions are fundamental rights including in the 1905 case itself Plaintiffs note that the regulations at issue unconstitutionally allow school principals to overrule treating physicians and artificially narrow the valid reasons for an exemption DOH s unconstitutional and irrational regulations exclude hundreds of acknowledged illnesses and conditions that vaccines can cause The federal court of the Northern District of New York will review the papers and alert the parties if it wants oral argument In the meantime attorneys will be arguing for a preliminary injunction to stop the state and individual school districts from overruling treating

that your animal has in their blood This immunity can occur naturally from exposure to the disease or from a previous vaccine Most veterinarians are open to running vaccine titers on your dogs but not cats They can run the tests in house which costs them very little and can charge you a lot for them However and this is a big however it is important to ask for end point titers not vaccine titers End point tests are quantitative meaning they measure the level of antibodies present in your dog s blood If the level is high this shows that the dog is protected for many years so the test does not need to be repeated annually Vaccine titers merely give you a yes or no as to whether antibodies are present or not They do not tell you the level of antibodies and therefore how long protection can

your pet is not protected when in fact it is This is because laboratories routinely set different standards for vaccine titers versus end point titers Isn t my puppy protected through the mother s antibodies If the mother has been vaccinated she will transmit antibodies to her puppy through the colostrum in her milk These maternal antibodies begin to wane when the puppy is about 12 weeks old virtually disappearing around 16 weeks of age What s fascinating is that if a puppy is vaccinated early at 4 8 weeks or even later immunity from the mother s milk can neutralize the vaccine s effect and the puppy will need further vaccines When is it best to do core vaccines one and done If you decide to vaccinate your dog the only vaccines holistic vets usually recommend are the core vaccines rabies distemper and parvo It is best to vaccinate your puppy against parvo and distemper at 16 weeks old when the mother s antibodies are gone If vaccinated at 16 weeks the distemper and parvo shots should give your dog a lifetime of immunity Note however that this means your pup is vulnerable to getting distemper or parvo between 12 and 16 weeks old In addition it takes approximately 10 to 20 days for a vaccine to be effective It is always a matter of risk versus benefit I discuss with owners the pros and cons of waiting and only administering one vaccine at 16 weeks old I sometimes administer homeopathic nosodes of the parvo and distemper viruses to tide the pup over I recommend they stay away from dog parks and visit only dogs that you know are healthy What about the rabies vaccine An animal gets rabies from contact with saliva from a rabid animal usually but not exclusively from a bite I would not inoculate a puppy with the rabies vaccine at the same time as the distemper and parvo vaccines More antigens create more problems Rabies vaccines are mandated by law in all states except Hawaii and the mandated frequency of rabies boosters varies by state All states

identical with the same potency They are merely labeled differently This includes the Purevax feline rabies vaccines Most vets will not perform rabies titers They insist that the pet receive a booster Many vets will fire you from their practice if you do not comply When I first started practicing veterinarians recommended that dogs get their first rabies vaccine at six months old They now recommend your pup receive it at three months old I believe this to be too early The immunity doesn t last as long and the younger they are the greater the toxicity risk Pups can handle the vaccine better at six months and the immunity lasts longer if given later I recommend that if your dog is not vaccinated to never leave them outside unattended It is important that if possible you not let your pet out of your sight while at the veterinary hospital as well I ve seen many instances where veterinarians vaccinate pets without the owner s knowledge or consent Some veterinarians may have you sign waivers if you do not wish to vaccinate your pet for rabies and some states will allow medical waivers although most vets will not give you one It is a reality that if vets write too many waivers the state medical board may investigate them so there is little incentive for vets to accommodate you or your pet Beyond the parvo distemper and rabies vaccines the rest in my opinion are generally ineffective and needlessly dangerous This includes the Bordetella influenza canine infectious hepatitis leptospirosis and Lyme vaccines and the many others Big Pharma has come up with Since NO vaccine is safe and many of them are not effective it is important to minimize exposure and choose wisely Do not let yourself be bullied or manipulated by fear At the very least tell your vet you need to do some research before you vaccinate It seems convenient to give my pup all its vaccines at once Is this a good idea No Mixing together vaccines creates chaos in the body Because of all the vaccine injury I see on a

the case for typical 5 or 6 in 1 vaccines for dogs Your pet should not receive any vaccine while they are under anesthesia as they may not be able to mount an adequate immune response How will I know if my pet has been injured as a result of a vaccine Every disease has a cause or a trigger In my experience the majority of diseases in pets begin with a vaccine injury It is quicker and easier to recognize vaccine injury in pets than in humans and the most reliable evidence for me is the timeline I generally see vaccine injuries within six weeks of the time of the inoculation Most diseases we see in pets are autoimmune and most autoimmune diseases are related to vaccines Each vaccine produces specific symptom patterns In rabies for example the target is the central nervous system so seizures are common sequelae of a rabies vaccine With parvo you will find inflammatory bowel disease following a vaccine I see this all the time My pet has been fully vaccinated Are there detox protocols to minimize damage Different holistic veterinarians have different protocols I specialize in classical homeopathy which takes an individualized approach so there is no universal protocol I ve found that various homeopathic medicines remedies can undo damage done by vaccines In my opinion homeopathy has the best results in reversing and truly curing vaccine injury If I don t give my dog any vaccines what precautions should I take around other animals If your pet has never been vaccinated it is best not to take them to dog parks or public areas where there are unknown or unvaccinated animals Dogs recently adopted from shelters can be incubating a virus like parvo or distemper without yet showing any symptoms If you know the owners of the other dogs and you know the dogs are

What about heartworm prevention medication Heartworm is a terrible disease but its prevalence depends on exposure You must always consider the risk vs benefit Mosquitoes are the hosts that transmit heartworm So for an animal that has high exposure to mosquitos I d give the minimum medication as infrequently as possible to protect my dog I never use any heartworm preventives that are long acting or combined with flea and tick preventives There are some natural products that are touted as being effective However some of my holistic colleagues who have used them have seen breakthrough cases of heartworm so I do not recommend these products I have never seen a cat either indoor or outdoor get heartworm disease although it has been cited rarely in the literature Should I administer flea and tick medication Flea and tick medications are by definition toxic They are poisons meant to kill the fleas and the ticks I would stay far away from any of them As with any medicine or medical procedure it is important to first assess exposure and risk For example your indoor apartment cat will most likely not get fleas or ticks If you only leash walk your dog on cement or asphalt your dog is at very low risk of infestation If you carry your chihuahua around in a bag outside of your home again they are at very low risk It is important to use common sense If your animal does have fleas the new topical spot on products are particularly dangerous for the environment for your pets and for yourself and your family as you absorb the drugs when you touch your cats or dogs In fact drug makers specifically instruct you to wear protective gloves when applying the treatment and to wash your hands with soap and water immediately if it touches your skin Be very wary of long acting injectable drugs that stay in an animal s system for a year Less is always better I recommend only natural products both on the animal and in the environment for flea and tick control Food grade

human vaccines I wish I could tell you Vaccine inserts provide practically no information about what they contain I have called numerous pharmaceutical companies asking for that information but each time they have said the information is proprietary and they cannot disclose it Big Pharma benefits from pet vaccines just as it does with vaccines for people Many animals receive annual vaccinations and some of them twice a year for their entire life This generates money not only from the vaccines but more importantly and lucratively from all the diseases created by the vaccine that your pet will get downstream Cancer treatments in pets for example can cost at least 30 000 I need to board my pet but all places require full vaccinations Are there any other options Your pets tend to do better living in their own home I usually recommend searching for reliable pet sitters Look outside of the box for pet sitters friends neighbors or others who don t necessarily do this for a living Many animal lovers are happy to have the extra income Also it tends to be less expensive especially if you have multiple pets Often small doggie daycares run out of private homes don t require vaccines for clients Ask friends from the dog park or search on apps like Nextdoor to find and vet local people who pet sit at their home or yours Cats of course do better in their own home If you can t find

Safety Print The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program of Health and Human Services HHS has awarded over 5 billion billion for vaccine injuries since 1988 Common sense dictates that these 7 Steps to Vaccine Safety must be taken 1 Subject vaccines to same rigorous approval process as other drugs Vaccines are regulated by the FDA s CBER division as biologics and are not always put through the same level of safety testing as new pharmaceuticals which are regulated under CDER Vaccines which are given to healthy patients should be tested more rigorously than drugs because they are not given to treat an existing disease Inadequate testing currently ensures that the true risk benefit assessments for the safety and cost of vaccines are impossible to calculate accurately These vaccines are given to about 4 million American infants annually Typical Drug Approval Process Typical Vaccine Approval Process Prelicensure follow up for adverse events often takes years For example Lipitor 4 8 years Enbrel 6 6 years Botox 4 25 years Prelicensure follow up for adverse events may take as little as 2 5 days For example HepB Engerix GSK 4 days HepB Recombivax Merck 5 days Polio PVI Sanofi Pasteur 2 days Hib Pedvax Merck 3 days Hib Hiberix GSK 4 days Hib ActHib Sanofi Pasteur 30 days Requirement for trials to be done against an inactive placebo with the exception of drugs for life threatening diseases cancer etc where the placebo is typically the current standard of care Trials not done against an inactive placebo Trials of vaccinated compared to unvaccinated children are not performed Placebo is often Saline A sugar pill designed to look like the active pill Another inactive substance or base Placebo is often Another vaccine but not always for the same disease An adjuvant or preservative like aluminum or mercury that is not inactive A group of vaccines Safety follow up is incentivized by education and lawsuits There are free market checks and balances to produce safer drugs Lack of any product liability for vaccine manufacturers provided by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act eliminates market incentives to produce safer vaccines 2 Mandatory reporting of

safety follow up serious side effects may be missed entirely putting the public at risk examples of the past importance of safety follow up include hormone replacement therapy Vioxx and amphetamines There has never been a comparative study of broad health outcomes in vaccinated vs unvaccinated populations The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act NCVIA requires healthcare providers to report Any adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further doses of the vaccine or Any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination But in practice this doesn t happen There is no consequence for failing to report an injury There is no mechanism for prosecution of non compliance and therefore no incentive for a busy doctor to report vaccine safety problems The Vaccine Safety Datalink VSD is a collaborative project between CDC s Immunization Safety Office and eight private health care organizations The VSD was started in 1990 to monitor safety of vaccines and conduct studies about rare and serious adverse events following immunization However research is

vaccine to millions of children Immunity from liability for the manufacturers Inclusion in the Vaccines for Children program However prior to 2012 ACIP did not use evidence based guidelines to evaluate their vaccine recommendations Evidence Based Practice is the conscientious explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of the individual patient It means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research The final ACIP guidelines published in November of 2013 outlined clearly for the first time a standardized plan to evaluate the quality and strength of the research behind each recommendation for a vaccine for each population ACIP s recommendations include the populations timing spacing number of doses boosters and appropriate ages for each vaccine to be administered The CDC s infant schedule given to approximately 4 million babies a year was largely adopted before these guidelines were in place Vaccines recommended before the adoption of evidence based guidelines should not have been grandfathered in Earlier ACIP recommendations should be thoroughly reviewed in

Childhood Immunization schedule and stated No studies have compared the differences in health outcomes between entirely unimmunized populations of children and fully immunized children Furthermore studies designed to examine the long term effects of the cumulative number of vaccines or other aspects of the immunization schedule have not been conducted The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has paid out over 3 8 billion in compensation to victims of vaccine injury The children and adults who have been compensated for injuries have never been studied to determine why they were injured in an effort to make vaccines safer for everyone Preventing vaccine injuries should be tackled as zealously as we tackle preventing infectious diseases Vaccine safety science particularly long term safety science is inadequate to ensure children s safety or to accurately assess risks for purposes of informed consent 6 Support fully informed consent and individual rights to refuse vaccination The American Academy of Pediatrics statement on the ethics of informed consent includes the following stipulation patients should have explanations in understandable language of the existence and nature of the risks involved and the existence potential benefits and risks of recommended alternative treatments including the choice of no treatment In the case of vaccination informed consent is often ignored completely in real world settings By law all health care providers in the United States who administer to any child or adult any of the following vaccines diphtheria tetanus pertussis measles mumps rubella polio hepatitis A hepatitis B Haemophilus influenzae type b Hib influenza pneumococcal conjugate meningococcal rotavirus human papillomavirus HPV or varicella chickenpox shall prior to

when multiple vaccines are administered on the same day many parents report that they got the Vaccine Information Sheet VIS as they left and there was no explanation of information before a vaccine was given It is also rare that medical history is thoroughly discussed to identify contraindications to a vaccine For example a patient with a family history of autoimmunity is likely at increased risk for an autoimmune reaction after vaccination The following are examples of the types of information that patients may learn after the fact from the Vaccine Information Sheets Severe events have very rarely been reported following MMR vaccination and might also happen after MMRV These include Deafness long term seizures coma lowered consciousness brain damage Or this from the Polio VIS and several others As with any medicine there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death Lack of informed consent encompasses vaccine advertising as well While television drug ads disclose the side effect risks of that drug at length vaccine advertising does not The patient again is at a disadvantage 7 Overturn all liability protections of vaccine makers including the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 NCVIA granting freedom from liability for deaths and injuries to vaccine manufacturers In the 1970s claims for serious adverse events following vaccination were rising with vaccine manufacturers making large payouts to injured individuals and their families Consequently vaccine makers threatened to end production unless liability protection was provided To seek compensation for vaccine injuries the NCVIA requires individuals to file a claim with the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP created by the bill The VICP was ostensibly intended to be a non adversarial system for victims of vaccine injury and their families to pursue compensation although parents who have undergone this process attest that it is anything but non adversarial The VICP places numerous roadblocks to victims seeking compensation for vaccine injuries including Extremely short windows for filing claims Claimants must file within 24 months of death and 36 months of injury for non table injuries For table injuries the window is even shorter most often within a matter of hours typical

Kennedy Jr and I m the Chairman of the Children s Health Defense and I made this video primer because in a dozen states across America today state legislatures and governors are considering passing vaccine mandates and the facts in this video are facts that every political leader who s trying to decide whether to vote for or against those mandates ought to understand I want to start by saying that I am fiercely pro vaccine I had all six of my children vaccinated I believe that vaccines have saved millions of lives But I want vaccines that are as safe as possible I want science that is robust and I want to make sure that we have a regulatory agency that has unquestioned integrity and freedom of conflicts of interest and we don t have those things today The vaccine ingredient that got me involved in this controversy was thimerosal which of course is a mercury based preservative that is still in 48 million flu shots annually One of the characteristics of mercury is that it tends to injure boys instead of girls or over girls Science indicates the reason for that is because testosterone tends to amplify the neurotoxic impacts of the mercury molecule and estrogen tends to wrap that molecule and protect the female brain This video indicates some of the human impacts of the continued use of thimerosal in American flu shots Trace Amounts Excerpt I was six and a half months pregnant with twins a boy and a girl I went in for a routine exam and at the end of the exam as I was about to leave my doctor said You know I really would like you to stop by the nurse s station and get a flu shot Against my better judgment I went ahead and let them give me the shot Within five to six hours after the shot I started getting severe cramps and bleeding I immediately went back to the hospital where my doctor was and he said You are having a miscarriage I lost my son and my daughter ended up at 18 months diagnosed with severe autism She regressed in my womb I had her baby teeth analyzed and baby teeth form in the womb her baby teeth had tons of mercury in them My doctor was so horrified by what happened he said I m not giving any more flu shots to pregnant women Any toxicologist will tell you that if you inject mercury or aluminum into a little baby or a child or a pregnant woman there s going to be bad consequences including neurodevelopmental damages But my

will be shocking to any pediatrician any public health regulator and any politician who is now considering vaccine I m going to start by talking about this study that was published in February of 2017 of this year One of the leaders of the team is Dr Peter Aaby Dr Aaby is one of the world s foremost authorities on vaccines particularly vaccines in Africa This study was a study of the DTP vaccine diphtheria tetanus and pertussis the most popular vaccine in the world and a vaccine that s given to virtually every vaccinated child in Africa Because of a quirk in the way that the vaccines were administered in the nation of Guinea Bissau it allowed Dr Aaby and his team to do the kind of study vaccine safety advocates in this country have advocated for many many years It is a vaccinated versus unvaccinated study and what they found was the vaccinated children had 10 times the death rate of unvaccinated children But the things that the vaccinated children were dying of were things you would never associate with vaccines What the scientists concluded was that the vaccine while it was protecting children from diphtheria tetanus and pertussis had wrecked their immune system so that they were dying of these unrelated illnesses And here s what they concluded All currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria tetanus or pertussis This is rather shocking The interesting thing and the frightening thing about this study is that this was data that was 30 years old Nobody noticed that this vaccine had been killing 10 times the number of kids And the relevant question for us this study begs is there a surveillance system in this country that would send off an alarm if the same thing was happening here from our current vaccine program Or is there a safety testing program that would assure that this can t happen And the answer I m about to show you is no I m going to start with this slide and this slide shows a short list of vaccine adverse events In other words these are injuries that are acknowledged by the government and by the manufacturer to be caused by vaccines How do we

Court So the courts have decided yes your injury was caused by the vaccine and we are going to pay you money for that These include autoimmune diseases encephalopathy that is brain damage seizure disorder death Below the line is another list that really overlaps with the top list These are the injuries that the manufacturer is saying These could be caused by our vaccine And they include autoimmune diseases asthma eczema juvenile diabetes Now look at this according to the CDC one in six children now has a developmental disorder The same injuries associated with vaccines This is an epidemic And according to HHS it gets worse 54 of children have some kind of chronic illness In 1986 Congress passed the Vaccine Act and gave blanket immunity to vaccine companies for injuries caused by vaccines And for some of these new vaccines they can make up to a billion dollars a year in profits or even more This is what happened in 1986 there were 11 vaccines on the schedule but today there are 53 jabs Look what happened at the same time in 1988 only 12 8 of kids had chronic disease today 54 So the rise was coterminous with the expansion of the vaccine schedule Question one who is responsible then for vaccine safety In every other sector in this country it s the manufacturer and distributor of the product who is responsible for safety With an automobile it would be the automobile manufacturer with a drug like Phen fen or Vioxx when those drugs were found to be unsafe the company was responsible And of course that responsibility and that liability keeps the company concerned and focused on safety So this is the language of the Vaccine Act No person may bring a civil action against any vaccine administrator or manufacturer in a State or Federal court for damages arising from a vaccine related injury and death So no matter how sloppy the line protocols no matter how dangerous the ingredient no matter how grievous the injury to your child you can t sue the manufacturer for an injury caused by vaccines So what are the consequences to having the only consumer product in America that s completely liability free First of all there s no incentive among

the consequences to having the only consumer product in America that s completely liability free First of all there s no incentive among manufacturers to conduct safety studies In fact there s a disincentive because there s a provision in the Vaccine Act that says essentially that the only way that a manufacturer can be liable is if they know of a side effect from that vaccine and they fail to warn So their incentive is to do everything that they can to not learn of any side effects That s one consequence The second is that there s a liability free market of 74 million American children The third is that there is a very strong incentive to develop more and more and more vaccines because the profits are so enormous and the costs are almost nothing Here are the results in detail 11 vaccines in 1986 Fifty three vaccines that our children are being given today under the schedule and here s the future 270 vaccines that are already in the pipeline Thousands of clinical trials that are developing new vaccines for the industry and a vaccine industry that is projecting vaccines as a 90 billion profit center over the next few years So if the manufacturers have been lifted of any responsibility for vaccine safety well who s responsible Well the Vaccine Act did not want to leave a vacuum So it said that HHS is responsible Health and Human Services Department and that specifically FDA CDC NIH and HRSA would be the agencies responsible There s two stages before a vaccine comes to market First the FDA has to license the vaccine Then CDC has to add it to the schedule The FDA is the agency that is in charge of the initial step of licensing the vaccine and here s what FDA says that it does It says Vaccines undergo rigorous and extensive testing to determine their safety Is that true Let s see Let s first look at what FDA requires for regular drugs Now for most other drugs the safety testing is indeed rigorous and that kind of testing takes several thousand people who are given the drug and then the same number of people who usually similarly situated people who are given a pill that looks exactly like that drug but it s inert and neither the researchers nor the patients know which ones got the saline drug and which ones got the real drug so it s double blind Then the researchers look at both of those groups", "chunk_id":

and that s how they figure out whether or not the drug is safe For example with Lipitor the safety review period was 4 8 years and the placebo group received a sugar pill that looked exactly like a Lipitor pill With Enbrel which is another prescription drug the safety review period was 6 6 years and the placebo group was a saline injection But look what they do with vaccines Vaccines are characterized by FDA not as drugs but as biologics and that gives FDA the capacity to fast track them without all of that rigorous and bothersome testing These are the two hepatitis B vaccines that are the only two that are approved for one day old children So these vaccines are given to virtually every child that s born in this country in a hospital today Here was the safety review period four days That means if a baby had a seizure and died on the fifth day it never happened it wouldn t ever be reported no one will ever know because they only look at them for four days This one got five days And then look at this there was no placebo So what are they measuring it against How do they even tell whether the test group had an unusual number of illnesses unless there s a placebo group to test them against Of course they can t it s not real safety science Yet this is the only testing that these vaccines received so whoever approved these vaccines was not making an evidence based decision They were making a decision based upon something else Here s the polio vaccine for two month old children the safety review was 48 hours Look at the placebo group they tested against the DTP vaccine This is the vaccine that was causing so many injuries that it caused Congress to pass the Vaccine Act because manufacturers were saying We re getting sued so much that we re going to go out of

they were tested against not a placebo This one was tested against six vaccines at the same time That s not going to tell you anything about the safety of this vaccine prior to licensing which means that the only thing that we re left with to determine whether vaccines are safe or not are post licensing surveillance studies And what I m going to show you is that the post licensing surveillance is next to worthless The central mechanism for post licensing vaccine safety surveillance is called the VAERS system the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System VAERS last year alone said that 59 117 Americans were injured by vaccines and that doesn t tell the whole story According to HHS this number represents fewer than 1 of adverse events which are reported What would it look like if we were actually capturing all vaccine injuries According to HHS s own calculations it would be close to six million Americans injured by vaccines every year And in 2010 the HHS actually commissioned a study that confirmed these astronomical levels of vaccine injury The HHS wanted to determine whether or not it was feasible to automate the VAERS system so they hired an outside consulting group who came in and automated a system for one of the HMOs What they found when they looked at how many people were actually getting injured a true number not reported by volunteers but taken from medical records of the 376 452 individuals who were vaccinated 35 000 of them had some kind of adverse reaction That s one in ten That s very very far from the one in a million number that the industry commonly uses when it talks about vaccine injury And it s a number that most public health officials and most Americans would consider completely unacceptable What happened to this system Did HHS and CDC say This is science that the public needs to know about so that we can ensure the safety of the vaccine supply No they did the opposite They literally stopped answering the phone calls for those consultants

stopped answering the phone These consultants had bad news and they didn t want to hear it Understandably there s going to be a lot of people out there who are going to want to dismiss what Robert F Kennedy Jr says about the adequacy or inadequacy of vaccine safety science at HHS But it s not just me saying that this is what the Institute of Medicine says about vaccine safety science at HHS The Institute of Medicine IOM top scientists in the country who are brought together to review the vaccine safety science at HHS This is their job these are very prestigious individuals and they re paid for by the Federal government Here s what IOM says in 1991 IOM reviewed a single vaccine the DTP vaccine They found that there were 22 injuries or diseases that had been reported to be caused by that vaccine Of those 22 the existing literature the scientific literature supported causation in six of them Existing literature acknowledged that six of those diseases were in fact caused by the DTP With four of those diseases the literature rejected causation But look at this number with 12 of those diseases there was no literature It had never been studied And what kind of disease are we talking about Meningitis neurological damage learning disabilities and autoimmune diseases Because of the lack of science they were handicapped in being able to make any kind of assessment about whether this vaccine was dangerous or safe So that was 1991 but look what happened three years later In 1994 IOM came back and looked at four other vaccines they found that there were 54 illnesses that had been reported to be associated with those vaccines But for 38 there was no literature It simply had never been studied So the IOM here is saying We don t have the ability to assess the safety of vaccines

that hypothesis IOM s report was extensive and it was a 700 page report and I selected this because this deals with an injury that we ve all heard about and that there s a lot of controversy about which is autism This page was looking at whether the DTP vaccine can cause autism And what they found at the end of that is that the evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between DTP and autism So what they re saying here is that they couldn t find any study of the relationship between DTP and autism but in fact they acknowledge in the first paragraph they did find that there was one study out there but that study found that DTP does cause autism But IOM decided to reject that study because it provided data from a passive surveillance system and lacked an unvaccinated comparison population Well that system that it relied on was the VAERS system It s HHS s own system What IOM is saying here is HHS is so slovenly and reckless at gathering data on vaccine safety that we cannot use the one system that they have because it s so unreliable So what does CDC do with this information Do they come clean with the American public Does it say to the American public We need to do our job We need to go out and commission these studies and find out whether there are any associations between DTaP vaccine and autism No this is what they do This is CDC s website Vaccines do not cause autism And what does it cite A 2011 Institute of Medicine study this study CDC is counting on the fact that nobody is going to go out and read the 700 page report that it s citing there and find out that s not what the report says at all This is a lie Now I want you to watch a 2008 interview with Dr Bernadine Healy who was the former head of NIH This is the time when we do have the opportunity to understand whether or not there are susceptible children perhaps genetically perhaps they have a metabolic issue mitochondrial disorder immunological issue that makes them more susceptible to vaccines plural or to one particular vaccine or to a component of vaccine like mercury So we now in these times have to I think take another look at that hypothesis not deny

ago to try and tease that out and find out if indeed there is that susceptible group Why is this important A susceptible group does not mean that vaccines aren t good What a susceptible group will tell us is that maybe there is a group of individuals or a group of children that shouldn t have a particular vaccine or shouldn t have vaccine on the same schedule I do not believe that if we identified a susceptibility group if we identified a particular risk factor for vaccines or if we found out that maybe they should be spread out a little longer I do not believe that the public would lose faith in vaccines It is the job of the public health community and of physicians to be out there and to say Yes we can make it safer Because we are able to say this is a subset we re going to deliver it in a way that we think is safer So I think the public would respect that I think the government or certain public health officials in the government have been too quick to dismiss the concerns of these families without studying the population that got sick I haven t seen major studies that focus on 300 kids who got autistic symptoms within a period of a few weeks of a vaccine I think that the public health officials have been too quick to dismiss the hypothesis as irrational without sufficient studies of causation The reason why they didn t want to look for those susceptibility groups was because they re afraid that if they found them however big or small they were that would scare the public away Reporter It sounds like you don t think the hypothesis of a link between vaccines and autism is completely irrational Healy So when I first heard about it I thought that doesn t make sense to me The more you delve into it if you look at the basic science if

the question has not been answered So as you just heard Dr Healy s central point is that if we really want to know the safety profile of individual vaccines and the vaccine schedule there s one study that we need in order to do that That is a vaccinated versus unvaccinated study But despite Dr Healy s call for that in 2008 by 2013 the Institute of Medicine found that studies designed to examine the long term effects of the cumulative number of vaccines or other aspects of the immunization schedule have never been conducted The good news is that CDC has the database with a capacity to do that study The CDC s Vaccine Safety Datalink has the health records and the vaccination records of 10 million people including hundreds of thousands of children In 2011 IOM said It is possible to make this comparison through analysis of patient information contained in large databases such as the VSD And why is the CDC not conducting these obvious kind of studies Well maybe it s because they don t like the results when those kind of studies are conducted For example in the African study that I opened this presentation with where vaccinated kids had 10 times the death rate of unvaccinated kids or this study that was done in April of this year and it s a study of about 700 homeschool kids ages 6 to 12 The study found that the vaccinated children had less chicken pox and less pertussis but that they had 30 times the levels of allergic rhinitis as unvaccinated children 3 9 times the allergies ADD 4 2 times Autism 4 2 times For this study that was published in 2012 which was a randomized study that compared children who received placebo to those who received a flu shot What they found was that the flu shot group and the placebo group had the same rate of flu infections But again the flu shot group had 4 4 times higher rate of non influenza infection So the flu shot was not giving the children protection against the flu but it was influencing in a bad way their immune systems to make them much more vulnerable to other illnesses This is a CDC study that was done in 1999 secretly of its own vaccine safety database What they found was astonishing It looked at children who had

11 35 CDC never published this version of the study never let the public know about these risks and effectively closed the vaccine safety database to almost any independent researcher Now that study was known as the Verstraeten study and after that study came out CDC panicked and began producing numerous studies in house Those studies are almost all epidemiological studies and in my line of business which is environmental law epidemiological studies are regarded as the weakest form of studies We have an old saying that says Statistics don t lie but statisticians do You could make an epidemiological study that proves for example that sex doesn t make you pregnant How do you do that You get rid of all the pregnant people before you study the population And then you can have a population where a lot of people are having sex and none is getting pregnant and you can prove that sex doesn t make you pregnant That s one of the gimmicks that CDC used in creating this new wave of epidemiological studies So we knew there was tremendous corruption inside of that department but in 2014 we had a senior scientist in the CDC come forward and acknowledge that corruption Dr William Thompson is a current employee at CDC He s a 17 year veteran of vaccine safety programs he is the lead author or a leading co author on virtually all of the landmark studies that CDC has performed to

DOJ requests I kept hard copies of all documents in my office and I retained all associated computer files So now we re going to show you that the governmental groups that are assigned with the responsibility of licensing the vaccines and adding them to the schedules are bedeviled by massive conflicts of interest that incentivize them to overlook that lack of scientific safety data So FDA is charged with the initial licensing phase of the vaccines and the specific committee charged with that responsibility is called the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee it s a mouthful The acronym is also a mouthful VRBPAC There was an investigation of VRBPAC in 20 by the US Government Reform Committee of Congress and here s what they found is that The overwhelming majority of members both voting members and consultants have substantial ties to the pharmaceutical industries which is making huge profits on those vaccines Here are the specific conflicts that Congress found at FDA Three of the five FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirus vaccine in December had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine One of the five voting members had a 9 million contract for a rotavirus vaccine One of the five voting members was the principal investigator for a Merck grant to develop a rotavirus vaccine One of the five voting members received approximately one million dollars from vaccine manufacturers toward vaccine development These are not independent arbiters of science who are looking out for our children These are people who are looking out for themselves Once FDA licensed the vaccine then it goes over to the CDC and CDC needs to decide whether or not to add that vaccine to the schedule This committee has really the frightening power to create a liability free captive market of 74 million American children with guaranteed payment to the manufacturers This committee has the power to create billions of dollars in profit for the pharmaceutical industry Of all the committees in the country of all the committees in the world this is the one committee that should be

States Congress and they found the same kind of conflicts of interest in CDC as they had initially found in FDA They said CDC grants blanket waivers to ACIP members that allow them to deliberate on any subject regardless of their conflicts for the entire year ACIP routinely used working groups where pharma insiders would effectively craft vaccine policy ACIP reflects a system where government officials make crucial decisions affecting American children without the advice and consent of the governed Here are some specific conflicts that Congress found The chairman of the advisory committee served on Merck s immunization advisory board Another member shares the patent on a vaccine under development for the very same disease that he voted on and he had a 350 000 grant from Merck to develop this vaccine and was a consultant for Merck So you start out with having no good science and handing that no good science to this group of pharmaceutical industry insiders Until 2011 they acknowledged they were not using evidence based guidelines That means most of the vaccines almost all the vaccines that are currently on the schedule that your children are taking were added to that schedule not because of evidence not because of science but some other reason ACIP recommendations have transformed the vaccine market from a 1 billion industry in 1 to a 44 billion industry in 2017 And 44 billion buys a lot of corruption In 2009 the HHS Inspector General conducted a new investigation and here s what they found CDC had a systematic lack of oversight There were no changes 97 of committee members conflict disclosures had omissions 58 had at least one unidentified potential conflict CDC has an 11 5 billion budget and look almost 5 billion of that is allocated to purchase and promote vaccines and only 20 million to study vaccine safety That pays for a couple of studies CDC effectively is a vaccine company It owns 56 vaccine patents The scientists who work for FDA and the CDC can receive royalties of 150 000 a year on vaccines that they develop so this is the last agency that ought to be regulating vaccines And yet we are trusting this agency with the health of our

Here s an example of the revolving door at CDC The former CDC Director from 2002 to 2009 when many of these vaccines were approved and many of these studies these phony studies were being formulated was Julie Gerberding She oversaw numerous vaccine studies many of which were recently deemed unreliable by IOM And in 2010 she became a year after leaving the CDC she was rewarded let s say with the Presidency of Merck s vaccines division with an estimated 2 5 million in annual salary and lucrative stock options Here s another unspoken conflict within HHS After HHS licenses recommends and promotes vaccines with virtually no safety data HHS is then statutorily required and vigorously defends against any claim that vaccines cause harm The Vaccine Act says In all proceedings brought by filing a petition in Vaccine Court the Secretary of HHS is named as the defendant So the HHS because it s defending vaccine injury cases has a built in incentive rather than studying vaccines for safety to kill any studies that may show that a vaccine is unsafe This isn t just theoretical this actually happens in real life and I ll show you an example In 2009 the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee which was a committee that was made up of scientists public health officials was looking at the wave of autism and thousands of parent complaints that said Our child got autism from the vaccine They recommended to HHS to study that relationship The Chairman of that committee who was Dr Tom Insel who was the head of the National Institute of Mental Health came in and made the statement that I m concerned about the optics If we say Yes we think it s important to look at this and to provide additional information it implies that we believe that there is a relationship between autism and vaccines and in some ways this runs opposite to what HHS may define through the HRSA process So he killed the approved study in 2010 leaving us no answers to this question I have to say this that it s a misnomer to call the Vaccine Court a court It s a government program All filings are submitted under seal in secret The plaintiffs the people who are injured by a vaccine must

things First we need to require that the vaccines go through the same rigorous approval process as other drugs We need to require mandatory reporting of vaccine adverse events and that means

a resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases Any individual of any age who received a covered vaccine and believes he or she was injured as a result can file a petition Parents legal guardians and legal representatives can file on behalf of children disabled adults and individuals who are deceased According to the vaccine injured and their loved ones the program has failed miserably as a litigious broken system where the injured are up against a government vaccine program government owned vaccine patents government health officials who administer the program and government paid attorneys from the Department of Justice There is no judge no jury of your peers and no discovery Claimants feel the system is set up for their claims to fail Contrary to what the government and media would like us to believe vaccine injury in this country is hardly rare More than 30 000 adverse events are now reported annually to the official federal monitoring program for vaccine safety with some 200 000 cases listed since 1990 Many experts however believe the injuries are underreported by a factor of ten because the system of collecting adverse events is not required by law This means that up to two million Americans may have experienced an adverse event during that time Thankfully most events roughly 85 were considered mild localized pain and swelling low grade fever etc but the rest were far more serious including encephalopathy brain damage seizure disorders chronic arthritis and neurodevelopmental disorders including many parents argue autistic regression To put it another way

that indemnifies the medical pharmaceutical industry from lawsuits compensates those injured and promotes safer vaccines NVICP was seen as beneficial to increasing public trust in vaccines and honoring the social compact much like our society looks after veterans because they fought to defend the collective good Congress made it fundamentally clear that compensation must be swift generous and awarded in a non adversarial manner In exchange parents of vaccine injured children petitioners must file in NVICP first before suing in civil court They petition against the Department of Health and Human Services HHS and not vaccine manufacturers The government recognizes certain vaccine induced outcomes which appear on the Vaccine Injury Table including death anaphylaxis chronic arthritis seizure disorder encephalopathy vaccine strain measles vaccine strain polio and paralytic polio Injuries must manifest within hours or days though some have a thirty day window If families meet the exacting requirements for a table injury they have a presumption of compensation For non table injuries however they must show causation based on a preponderance of the evidence What s more petitioners have to file within three years of the first symptoms an unfair rule that is contrary to the American court system and does not respect states rights of tolling for minors Many people know of NVICP through its Omnibus Autism Proceeding which took over eight years to litigate More than 5 000 vaccine autism claims were filed and the cases were tested under two theories Mercury induced autism and MMR vaccine induced autism Six test cases were heard All of them lost To date HHS insists that no claims have been compensated for autism within the program CRITICALLY NEEDED REFORMS HHS has turned a basic administrative compensation process into a highly adversarial lengthy expensive traumatic and unfair imitation of a court trial for vaccine victims and their attorneys charges Barbara Loe Fisher of the National Vaccine Information Center who was instrumental in drafting the original law She is not alone Even the program s former Chief Special Master Gary Golkiewicz said the

companies to produce safer vaccines while allowing them to make products that are mandated by the Federal government for schoolchildren without any liability whatsoever The program should be eliminated but if Congress won t go along it must take steps to reform NVICP including Extend the Statute The brief statute of limitations is considerably shorter than most legal actions in civil court involving injury to minors Petitioners must file no more than 36 months after the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of the significant aggravation of such injury after the administration of the vaccine If a claim is brought beyond that date it will be dismissed and barred from further action in courts of law Children s Health Defense Executive Director Lyn Redwood RN MSN learned this the hard way Nobody informed me that my son s vaccines contained mercury she says Unfortunately by the time we found out and realized he was suffering with autism induced by mercury neurotoxicity we were outside the statute of limitations Level the Playing Field The legal deck is stacked against petitioners from the start Attorneys for HHS work for the Justice Department and have at their disposal all the money power and access to experts that our Government can command Special Masters who hear cases are DOJ employees Meanwhile petitioners are denied access to government data that would be provided under normal discovery rules in civil court This must stop And though NVICP is required to cover reasonable attorney s fees and costs delayed and below market reimbursements deter many of the most experienced lawyers and medical experts from participating NVICP must increase fees for petitioners attorneys and speed up payments And the program must stop using injury award funds to finance studies that help keep many injuries off table Children s Health Defense finds it reprehensible that NVICP money has financed one sided studies used to turn away claims Revitalize the

than doubling the possibility of injury Despite this only one new table injury has been added anaphylaxis within four hours of hepatitis B vaccine On the contrary in the early 1990s HHS eliminated most table injuries despite the NVICP s mission to provide a presumptive no fault administrative remedy HHS removed residual seizure disorder from the table for example nullifying presumptive compensation for children with seizures immediately after the DPT vaccine As a result nearly all DPT seizure disorder cases became off table requiring lengthy litigation with varying results HHS also redefined encephalopathy to exclude most cases from on table compensation That s why 90 of all NVICP claims must be hard fought in litigation and why three quarters of all cases are dismissed Children s Health Defense believes that if an injury meets the preponderance of evidence that vaccines were implicated then the injury must be added to the table immediately and NVICP must inform all claimants previously denied for the same or similar injury that their claim is now recognized as compensable We also call for an advisory panel to periodically evaluate the injury table constituted of 30 parents vaccine injured There must be fair and open hearings every two years into vaccine neurodevelopmental disorder connections in order to keep up with the science and hold the government to safety standards with the most recent data available Eliminate Table Injury Hearings If the claimant s medical evidence substantiates an injury that meets the requirements on the table of injuries their petition must be approved without hearing discovery or delay This would make NVICP the true no fault non adversarial program Congress intended in to be Increase Awards Petitioners are entitled up to 250 000 in the event of a vaccine related death and a maximum of 250 000 for pain and suffering These caps have not changed since 1986 The death claim should be raised to 1 000 000 and the pain and suffering cap eliminated NVICP must also begin paying without limitation medical physical occupational therapy rehabilitation medical monitoring special diets supplements educational tutorial therapy

NVICP site The good news is that most petitioners can begin by filing a short form claim on their own which doesn t require a lawyer If your case goes to trial you can find an attorney to represent you Evidence Needed If you plan on filing a claim begin gathering all your documentation now including medical records vaccine records test results and even emails between you and your pediatrician

treat autism Successful Cases Recent cases have won substantial awards of millions of dollars over the lifetime of the individual Many children with ASD have also won compensation although the

Vaccination Without Parents Taking Away the Last Barrier Protecting Innocent Children from Big Pharma By Children s Health Defense Team Link copied At the recently concluded annual meeting of the American Medical Association AMA in Chicago AMA delegates adopted a doozy of a new policy The powerful trade group agreed to develop model legislation that pressures state legislatures into allowing minors to override refusenik parents on vaccination In 2000 the Supreme Court reasserted the fundamental right of parents to oversee the care custody and control of their children a right recognized by states until children reach age 18 Where vaccines are concerned the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act passed in 1986 legally requires health care providers to distribute vaccine information materials to the parent or legal guardian of any child to whom the provider intends to administer a vaccine prior to the administration of such vaccine emphasis added Does it trouble the AMA that its pronouncement goes against legal precedent as well as social custom Apparently unconcerned about chipping away at parental rights AMA representatives are gung ho about the organization s new policy position Not only do they want minors as young as 12 to be able to consent to vaccination regardless of their parents flawed beliefs while still expecting parents to pay for the vaccines they also believe that doctors should be the ones declaring a child mature enough to consent to vaccination A question that anyone familiar with the AMA s history should be asking is why would we trust the AMA to make such vital decisions in parents stead one fourth of the AMA s total revenues were CPT related the medical services coding system representing double what the organization received from

2011 Forbes pointed out that the AMA reaps huge financial rewards through its Current Procedural Terminology CPT medical services coding system used by health care providers payers and facilities

time notably in the reproductive health arena For services related to contraception and sexually transmitted infections health providers are only too happy to shout down parental objections arguing that young people s need for confidential medical services is more important than parents right to be informed of their child s condition Now researchers are laying down the train tracks to make the same case for vaccines In 2014 top tier adolescent health experts described parental consent as a barrier to vaccination and called for strategies that increase the ability of unaccompanied minors to receive vaccines within the context of legal ethical and professional guidelines Did the zealous school nurse who recently administered a human papillomavirus HPV vaccine to an 11 year old boy without

totalitarian medical pharmaceutical police state almost since its inception in the mid 1850s While such rhetoric is strong it seems clear that on vaccine issues the AMA is only too willing to stake out a draconian policy position After the AMA announced its intent to ignore parents wishes one conservative writer underscored the contradictions So while individuals need to be 21 years old before they are allowed to drink and 18 years old before they are allowed to purchase cigarettes and elect a president children at any age can make a decision to partake in vaccinations regardless of the

total budget Further Pharma directly funds populates and controls dozens of CDC programs through the CDC foundation A British Medical Journal editorial excoriates CDC s sweetheart relationship with

the agency conducts research that has potential to cut into profits HHS partners with vaccine makers to develop approve recommend and pass mandates for new products and then shares profits from vaccine sales HHS employees can personally collect up to 150 000 annually in royalties for products they work on For example key HHS officials collect money on every sale of Merck s controversial HPV vaccine Gardasil which also yields tens of millions annually for the agency in patent royalties Furthermore under the 1986 Act that created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program HHS is the defendant in Vaccine Court and is legally obligated to defend against any claim that a vaccine causes injury Despite high hurdles for recovery HHS pays out hundreds of millions of dollars annually over 4 billion total to Americans injured by vaccines Hence if HHS publishes any study acknowledging that a vaccine causes a harm claimants can use that study against HHS in Vaccine Court In June 2009 a high level HHS official Tom Insel killed a 16 million dollar budget item to study the relationship between vaccines and autism by the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee Insel argued that petitioners would use these studies against HHS in vaccine court Such conflicts are a formula for agency capture on steroids Instead of a regulator and a regulated industry we now have a partnership

Instead of a regulator and a regulated industry we now have a partnership says Dr Michael Carome a former HHS employee who is now the director of the advocacy group Public Citizen Carome says that these financial entanglements have tilted HHS away from a public health perspective to an industry friendly perspective In 1986 Congress awash in Pharma money the pharmaceutical industry is number one for both political contributions and lobbying spending over the past 20 years enacted a law granting vaccine makers blanket immunity from liability for injuries caused by vaccines If vaccines were as safe as my family members claim would we need to give pharmaceutical companies immunity for the injuries they cause The subsequent gold rush by pharmaceutical companies boosted the number of recommended inoculations from twelve shots of five vaccines in 1986 to 54 shots of 13 vaccines today A billion dollar sideline grew into the 50 billion vaccine industry behemoth Since vaccines are liability free and effectively compulsory to a captive market of 76 million children there is meager market incentive for companies to make them safe The public must rely on the moral scruples of Merck GlaxoSmithKline Sanofi and Pfizer But these companies have a long history of operating recklessly and dishonestly even with products that they must market to the public and for which they can be sued for injuries The four companies that make virtually all of the recommended vaccines are all convicted felons Collectively they have paid over 35 billion since 2009 for defrauding regulators lying to and bribing government officials and physicians falsifying science and leaving a trail of injuries and deaths from products they knew to be dangerous and sold under pretense of safety and efficacy Doesn t it require a kind of cognitive dissonance to believe that vaccines are untainted by the greed negligence and corruption that bedevil every other pharmaceutical product For American kids born in 1986 only 12 8 had chronic diseases That number has grown to 54 among the vaccine generation those born after 1986 in lockstep with the expanding schedule No safety testing Such concerns only deepen when one considers that besides freedom from liability vaccine makers enjoy another little known lucrative loophole vaccines are the only pharmaceutical or medical products that do not need to be rigorously safety tested To win an FDA license companies must safety test virtually every other drug for years in randomized comparisons against an inert placebo Yet not a single vaccine currently

science that is driving the research It seems plain wrong to me that Democratic controlled legislatures across the country are frantically passing coercive mandates for pharmaceutical products for which no one knows the risks Furthermore safety testing which typically requires five or more years for other medical products often lasts only a few days with vaccines not nearly long enough to spot cancers or chronic conditions like autoimmune disease e g juvenile diabetes rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis allergic illnesses e g food allergies allergic rhinitis eczema asthma or neurological and neurodevelopmental injuries e g ADD ADHD narcolepsy epilepsy seizure disorders and autism Manufacturers inserts accompanying every vial of mandated vaccines include warnings about these and over 400 other injuries including many serious immune neurological and chronic illnesses for which FDA suspects that vaccines may be the cause Federal law requires that the package insert for each vaccine include only those adverse events for which there is some basis to believe that there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event Many of these illnesses became epidemic in American children after 1986 coterminous with the exploding vaccine schedule For American kids born in 1986 only 12 8 had chronic diseases That number has grown to 54 among the vaccine generation those born after 1986 in lockstep with the expanding schedule Evidence including HHS s own surveillance reports manufacturers inserts and peer reviewed studies link all of these injuries to vaccines However the associations are not definitive because CDC has failed to conduct the necessary randomized studies to prove or disprove causation HHS has directed the Institute

autism Then as today many parents with autistic children were claiming that vaccines were a cause of their child s autism and DTP DTaP vaccines were are a popular suspect On its website CDC declares that Vaccines don t cause autism citing IOM s comprehensive 2011 2012 literature review of vaccination safety science However the IOM study and the follow up HHS study in 2014 both say that CDC has never performed a study to support CDC s claim that DTaP does not cause autism The same is true for Hep B Hib PCV 13 and IPV The only vaccine actually studied with regard to autism is MMR and a senior

ignored its statutory obligations to study vaccine injuries and improve vaccine safety In 1986 Congress recognizing that drug companies no longer had any incentive to make vaccines safe ordered HHS to study vaccine injuries work to improve vaccine safety and report to Congress on its progress every two years A year ago I brought a lawsuit that forced HHS to admit that in 36 years it had never

because you re afraid of what it might show the absence of press scrutiny leaves industry no incentive to improve vaccine safety Media malpractice The suppression of critical safety science documented by the IOM would not be possible without a mass epidemic of media malpractice Mainstream and social media outlets which collectively received 9 6 billion in revenues from pharmaceutical companies in 2016 have convinced themselves they are protecting public health by aggressively censoring criticism of these coercively mandated zero liability and untested pharmaceutical products But the absence of press scrutiny leaves industry no incentive to improve vaccine safety Muzzling discussions of government corruption and deficient safety science and abolishing vaccine injuries by fiat is not a strategy that will solve the growing chronic disease epidemic The children who comprise this badly injured generation are now aging out of schools that needed to build quiet rooms and autism wings

Bayer Needs More Than an Aspirin to Cure Its Monsanto Sized Headache By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied In a special telephone meeting on Thursday August 23 Bayer AG s CEO Werner Bauman tried to reassure the German conglomerate s principal shareholders who were concerned about the recent drop in the company s stock Bayer s stock fell dramatically after an unfavorable verdict against Bayer s St Louis subsidiary Monsanto Bauman expressed his confidence in Monsanto and predicted a sunny future for its flagship herbicide Roundup He told his top tier investors that Bayer had performed an adequate due diligence on Monsanto before purchasing the troubled company for 66 billion this past June At the time of its purchase Monsanto told its German suitors that a 270 million set aside would cover all its outstanding liabilities arising from Monsanto s 5 000 Roundup cancer lawsuits Bauman did concede to anxious shareholders that Monsanto had withheld internal papers relevant to the case Bayer never saw those internal Monsanto documents prior to the purchase The source of the brouhaha was the August 10 289 million verdict by a San Francisco jury in favor of Dwayne Lee Johnson a California public school groundskeeper who said his terminal non Hodgkin s lymphoma resulted from exposure to the Monsanto weedkiller That single jury award consumed 100 percent of Monsanto s set aside and more On news of the verdict Bayer watched its stock plummet 14 percent and forfeited 16 billion in shareholder value On news of the verdict Bayer watched its stock plummet 14 percent and forfeited 16 billion in shareholder value Now Bayer is facing a cascade of new Roundup cases and a possible rash of shareholder lawsuits by its own investors alleging that Bayer failed to disclose its true liabilities It s no surprise that Monsanto kept secrets from Bayer Johnson s jury heard evidence that for four decades Monsanto maneuvered to conceal Roundup s carcinogenicity by capturing

entire fields including newly planted corn canola and soy genetically altered to thrive in the toxic mist that killed all neighboring weeds Then around 2006 Monsanto started marketing Roundup as a

evidence Here are some of the worst examples In 2015 the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC determined that glyphosate the active ingredient in Roundup was an animal carcinogen and a probable human carcinogen In 2017 the California Environmental Protection Agency EPA followed suit listing glyphosate as a carcinogen under Proposition 65 While Judge Bolanos allowed Monsanto s lawyers to tell the jury that federal EPA and some European health agencies disputed the IARC findings she blocked us from mentioning California s decision to list glyphosate as a carcinogen declaring that it would bias the jury The surreal incongruity of a California state court silencing California s own environmental agency while crediting the findings of foreign health agencies and a demonstrably corrupt federal EPA struck us as strange Because of the judge s rulings Monsanto s attorneys were able to paint IARC as a lonely and therefore unreliable outlier in its conclusions on glyphosate Judge Bolanos also forbade us from showing the jury evidence of Monsanto s fraudulent scheme to win regulatory approval for Roundup In the mid 1970 s when Monsanto first sought to license Roundup the company hired a corrupt consultant Industrial Bio Test Laboratories IBT to conduct toxicology studies on the active ingredient glyphosate The EPA approved glyphosate for sale in 1974 based on IBT Labs jiggered data IBT Labs made little effort to conceal the fact that its science was fraudulent One EPA reviewer dryly observed that it was hard to believe the scientific integrity of the studies when they said they took specimens of the uterus from male rabbits A subsequent EPA review found that producing falsified data for Monsanto and other corporations was IBT s

relevant to our case When the EPA asked Monsanto to retest glyphosate safety in the wake of the IBT scandal the company s own 1983 study found a statistically significant number of benign and malignant kidney tumors in male mice exposed to high amounts of glyphosate This study prompted EPA to classify glyphosate as a possible human carcinogen in 1985 Monsanto protested that its researchers had made errors in performing the mouse study despite anemic evidence that this was indeed the case Under extreme political pressure from Monsanto s allies in Ronald Reagan s cabinet EPA folded and withdrew the cancer classification on the condition that Monsanto re perform the mouse test Monsanto promised to do so but once the EPA cancelled the cancer classification the company reneged refusing to test glyphosate s carcinogenicity for 40 years Judge Bolanos ordered that the jury should hear nothing of this important tale and allowed Monsanto to tell the jury that EPA had always believed Roundup to be non carcinogenic In one noteworthy email exchange between an academic and Daniel Goldstein a Monsanto employee Goldstein joked that the company has been playing whack a mole to kill or derail carcinogenicity and toxicity studies of Roundup and its associated GMOs for years At Monsanto s request Judge Bolanos deemed any mention of GMOs off limits in our case She believed that even a mention of that hot topic would inflame the jury against Monsanto We therefore could not show the jury Monsanto s inculpatory whack a mole memo Judge Bolanos ban on any reference to GMOs also allowed Monsanto to get away with its unrebutted assertion that Roundup is great for the soil We couldn t show the abundant evidence of the damage to soils and ecosystems for the Roundup GMO combination Most

Monsanto executive William Heydens killed the product research because a further study was not likely to help us meet the project objective The project objective was maintaining Roundup s market dominance Monsanto s choice to illegally hide the results of the TNO study from the EPA and to abandon the research were directly relevant to punitive damages but the jury never learned about those events During the trial we showed the deposition of Monsanto s markets supervisor Kirk Azevedo Azevedo was an idealist who joined Monsanto after watching a speech by Monsanto CEO Robert Shapiro promising to make Monsanto a template for green technology and ethical corporate culture When Azevedo invoked the speech during an office strategy discussion his direct boss told Azevedo that Shapiro s speech was PR window dressing We are about making money you need to get that straight Strangely Judge Bolanos decided to order us not to talk about the Azevedo testimony on summation even though she had earlier ruled it admissible Finally Judge Bolanos gave a curative instruction telling the jury that Monsanto had never manufactured Agent Orange This statement was simply not true however the judge deemed the instruction necessary to neutralize potential bias from statements made by dismissed jurors about Agent Orange in front of their fellow jurymen In his Thursday phone conference Bauman dismissed all the evidence heard at trial about Monsanto s reprehensible behavior telling his investors it was taken out of context Johnson s jury heard the same lame assertions from Monsanto s

Science vs CDC on Scary Flu Shot Promotions By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied Every year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and pharmaceutical companies mount an aggressive campaign in the mainstream media to persuade Americans to get their flu shots Flu shots are big business industry analysts estimate that within the next five years the U S flu vaccine market will be worth almost 3 billion annually And profit margins are growing as manufacturers increase price premiums for the newer four strain vaccines The U S expects to distribute roughly 166 million doses for the 2017 18 flu season up from 146 million doses in the previous year As pharmaceutical companies bombard American consumers with ubiquitous billboards drugstore enticements and radio announcements to get your flu shot now the CDC has advised the industry to hike demand through the use of a recipe of scare mongering messaging See Figure 1 CDC recommends creating concern anxiety and worry among the American public Using spokespeople like Paul Offit and Peter Hotez as well as its extensive media partnerships and captive bureaucrats at CDC the pharmaceutical industry has effectively banished the scientific debate about flu shot safety and efficacy from the public square What ARE the scientific facts about the flu shot The science indicates significant risks and low efficacy both in the U S and internationally In 2010 for example Australia suspended its influenza vaccination program for children under five after one in 110 children experienced convulsions and other serious reactions within hours of getting their flu shots In Italy in 2014 authorities suspended half a million doses of an influenza vaccine containing a proprietary adjuvant after 13 suspicious deaths occurred in

serious harm to both children and adults influenza vaccines which contain neurotoxic and carcinogenic ingredients such as thimerosal and formaldehyde as well as bacterial endotoxin lead the pack in U

Influenza Immunization presentation made to the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine Overstatement and deception CDC s strategy to use fear to ramp up flu vaccine sales requires the agency to exaggerate both flu risks and vaccine efficacy Pharmaceutical companies and public health officials vastly overstate flu cases and deaths in order to market influenza as a threat of great proportions Simple fact checking shows that since October 2017 only 14 7 of the almost 447 000 flu specimens tested by clinical laboratories working with CDC have tested positive for influenza This proportion has remained relatively constant for the past two decades According to the British Medical Journal s Peter Doshi Even the ideal influenza vaccine can only deal with a small part of the flu problem because most flu appears to have nothing to do with influenza Actual influenza deaths not only rank lower than the major killers such as heart disease and cancer but also are lower down in the mortality rankings than ulcers and hernias Recent peer reviewed studies suggest that the shots may actually make people more susceptible to serious problems Incredibly even though most flu is not influenza and flu vaccine effectiveness is as low as 10 public health authorities keep telling everyone from six months of age on up including pregnant women that the flu shot is better than nothing and the best tool we have However there are many unanswered questions about influenza vaccines that warrant rigorous investigation Recent peer reviewed studies suggest that the shots may actually make people more susceptible to serious problems as with the recently recalled dengue vaccine and that getting flu shots year after year may be lowering subsequent vaccine effectiveness as well as

Donahue et al linking spontaneous abortions in women to flu vaccines The study reviewed data for the 2010 11 and 2011 12 flu seasons Women vaccinated with the inactivated influenza vaccine IIV in the 2010 2011 season had 3 7 fold greater odds of experiencing a spontaneous abortion within 28 days than women not receiving the vaccine Over the entire study period 2010 to 2012 the odds for a spontaneous abortion for vaccinated women were 2 0 times greater than for those women not receiving the flu vaccine Both figures showed a statistically significant increase in miscarriages when women received their flu shot The median gestational age for spontaneous abortion was 7 weeks in the affected pregnancies Most alarmingly in women who received the H1N1 vaccine in the previous flu season the odds of spontaneous abortion in the 28 days after receiving a flu vaccine were 7 7 times greater For every flu season starting in 2010 2011 there has been an H1N1 type virus included in regular flu shots in the United States For the current 2017 18 flu season the CDC still recommends that all flu vaccines contain H1N1 This study raises concerns whether this particular strain of influenza antigen is safe during pregnancy The vast majority of the flu vaccines in the years of the study were multi dose formulations containing 25 micrograms of mercury via the preservative thimerosal In those years out of approximately 150 million flu shots given in the U S annually less than 50 million or 34 of those vaccines available for pregnant women were thimerosal free For many years health officials have warned pregnant women to avoid eating mercury containing tuna And even before this latest study some government scientists were questioning the wisdom of pressuring women to receive mercury laden flu shots in any trimester of pregnancy Dr George Lucier Associate Director National Toxicology Program from 1969 2000 said The developing fetus should NEVER be exposed to any amount of mercury period In the words of senior CDC epidemiologist Dr William Thompson So I don t know why they still give it the flu shot to pregnant women like that s the last person I would give mercury to

overwhelming science shows clearly that this preservative is neurotoxic and deadly and that it may be particularly dangerous to the fetus during pregnancy When given to pregnant women mercury transports specifically to the placenta and into the fetus which does not have any mechanism for detoxification Ablesohn et al In fact it has been shown that mercury levels in cord blood are on average 70 higher than those in maternal blood Stern et al The new study confirms the findings of a previous study by Goldman Using CDC s VAERS database Goldman showed a similar uptick in spontaneous abortions due to the flu shot specifically during the time when pregnant women were receiving both the seasonal flu shot and the pandemic H1N1 flu shot In fact the rate of miscarriages increased 11 fold in 2009 when the H1N1 vaccine was added to the recommended schedule During this time period pregnant women who received both shots were typically exposed to 50 micrograms of mercury via thimerosal The maternal flu shot given specifically in the first trimester of pregnancy has also recently been implicated in autism spectrum disorder ASD in a paper by Zerbo et al from insurance giant

even those without thimerosal administered during pregnancy can induce an inflammatory response in the mother and potentially cause harm to the fetal brain during critical windows of neurodevelopment including harm associated with autism A study by Christian in 2011 found an increase in two inflammatory markers C reactive protein CRP and tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF a in pregnant women given a seasonal flu vaccine Increases in these inflammatory compounds indicate a significant level of inflammation which was identified during the first two days following vaccination It is unclear for this study how many of these flu shots contained mercury but there is good reason to be alarmed by these findings A 2014 study by Alan Brown M D and his colleagues of over 1 2 million pregnant women found that elevations in CRP the same marker of inflammation that increases after flu vaccination are associated with a 43 greater risk of having a child with autism An earlier study by Lisa Christian Ph D and her colleagues found that pregnant women suffering from depression developed a more marked inflammatory response to influenza vaccines than women who did not have symptoms of depression Researchers found that depression during pregnancy has also been associated with an increased risk of autism The CDC s current recommendation that all pregnant women receive flu shots is a dangerous proposition according to California Institute of Technology Professor Paul Patterson a neuroscientist whose research has included immune activation during pregnancy In his research Dr Patterson reported that any immune activation during pregnancy whether from an infection or a vaccine can cause damage in the developing fetal brain In 2008 Scientific American Mind quoted Patterson criticizing the CDC s policy of administering flu vaccines during pregnancy I don t think they have considered this risk In fact I know they have not considered this risk Patterson elaborated If you take it seriously and vaccinate everybody then what is going to happen Researchers cannot yet predict how often a prenatal immune response might lead to fetal brain damage but even if it happens less than 1

studies cited by CDC to exculpate vaccines from the autism epidemic Thompson who still works at CDC released the raw data sets that he says his bosses at CDC ordered him to conceal Those data show that black boys who received the MMR vaccine prior to three years old as the CDC recommends were 3 36 times more likely to receive an autism diagnosis than those who received the vaccine after 3 years of age This effect was not observed in other race categories Nevertheless when the CDC scientists published their results in Pediatrics in 2004 they omitted the damaging data fraudulently declaring there was no risk of autism from the MMR vaccination In August 2014 Dr Thompson issued a press release through his attorney stating I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism The buried data were disturbing but hardly surprising The most reliable studies in the scientific literature indicate that African Americans are more susceptible to vaccine injury and may also have increased susceptibility to neurological disorders such as autism A 2010 nationwide study of CDC s Autism and Developmental Disability Monitoring Network found autism incidence about 25 higher in African Americans than Caucasians A 2014 study published in Pediatrics showed higher rates of all categories of autism among African Americans in Los Angeles County compared to Caucasians with the incidence of severe autism elevated by 263 among foreign born blacks and 152 for U S born blacks as compared to U S born whites A 2010 study in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health

experiment on nearly 1500 black and hispanic infants using an unlicensed measles vaccine without disclosing to parents that the drug was a high potency experimental vaccine designed to overwhelm the baby s maternal immune system CDC only halted its secret experiment in 1991 when companion clinical trials conducted in Africa and Haiti showed increased death rate and severe immune system disorder among female infants who received the vaccine Those children died within two years after the vaccination A mistake was made It shocked me then CDC Director Dr David Satcher told the LA Times We need to move to a new level of assurance so people can trust what we re doing CDC denies that any Los Angeles black children were injured by the unlicensed vaccine but has not produced any studies to confirm that claim In 1972 a government whistleblower Peter Buxton revealed that for the previous forty years beginning in 1932 both CDC and the U S Public Health Service PHS conducted the so called

outfits with censoring truthful public health posts and for fraudulently misrepresenting and defaming CHD CHD is a non profit watchdog group that roots out corruption in federal agencies including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC the World Health Organization WHO and the Federal Communications Commission FCC and exposes wrongdoings in the Pharmaceutical and Telecom industries CHD has been a frequent critic of WiFi and 5G Network safety and of certain vaccine policies that CHD claims put Big Pharma profits ahead of public health CHD has fiercely criticized agency corruption at WHO CDC and FCC According to CHD s Complaint Facebook has insidious conflicts with the Pharmaceutical industry and its captive health agencies and has economic stakes in telecom and 5G Facebook currently censors CHD s page targeting its purge against factual information about vaccines 5G and public health agencies Facebook acknowledges that it coordinates its censorship campaign with the WHO and the CDC While earlier court decisions have upheld Facebook s right to censor its pages CHD argues that Facebook s pervasive government collaborations make its censorship of CHD a First Amendment violation The government s role in Facebook s censorship goes deeper than its close coordination with CDC and WHO The Facebook censorship began at the suggestion of powerful Democratic Congressman and Intelligence Committee Chairman Representative Adam Schiff who in March 2019 asked Facebook to suppress and purge internet content critical of government vaccine policies Facebook and Schiff use the term misinformation as a euphemism for any statement whether truthful or not that contradicts official government pronouncements The WHO issued a press release commending Facebook for coordinating its ongoing censorship campaign with public health officials That same day Facebook published a warning label on CHD s page which implies that CHD s content is inaccurate and directs CHD followers to turn to the CDC for reliable up to date information This is an important First Amendment case that tests the boundaries of government authority to openly censor unwanted critique of government Attorneys

neither independent nor fact based to create oppositional content on CHD s page literally superimposed over CHD s original content about open matters of scientific controversy To further silence CHD s dissent against important government policies and its critique of Pharmaceutical products Facebook deactivated CHD s donate button and uses a variety of deceptive technology i e shadow banning to minimize the reach and visibility of CHD s content In short Facebook and the government colluded to silence CHD and its followers Such tactics are fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment which guarantees the American public the benefits to democracy from free flow of information in the marketplace of ideas It forbids the government from censoring private speech particularly speech that criticizes government policies or officials As Justice Holmes famously said the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market The current COVID pandemic makes the need for open and fierce public debate on health issues more critical than ever Mark Zuckerberg publicly claims that social media platforms shouldn t be the arbiters of truth This case exposes Zuckerberg for working with the government to suppress and purge unwanted critiques of government officials and policies The court will decide whether Facebook s new government directed business model of false and misleading warning labels deceptive fact checks and disabling a non profit s donate button passes muster under the First and Fifth Amendments the Lanham Act and RICO Those

Chickenpox The Dirty Dozen Facts You Should Know Before Vaccinating By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied CHD NOTE Several weeks ago our Chairman Robert F Kennedy Jr was asked to participate in a debate about vaccines with Dr Robert James Riewerts from Kaiser Permanente While Mr Kennedy has vowed to debate anyone anywhere on the subject of vaccines and the safety research needed the two weren t actually in the same location or even allowed to speak with each other directly In the course of the discussion Dr Riewerts said many confusing statements regarding the facts about vaccines The show will air in mid October Until then Mr Kennedy is clearing up some of the confusion with the facts In our debate Dr Riewerts claimed that wild type chickenpox or varicella kills 1 100 people This is incorrect Here are some actual facts with citations about chickenpox Prior to varicella vaccine licensure chickenpox was a mild childhood disease that presented as a rash and slight fever Contracting chickenpox as a youth conferred lifetime immunity to chickenpox and protection against heart disease atopic diseases and cancers including glioma brain and spinal tumors 1 Before Merck introduced the varicella vaccine 4 million people contracted chickenpox annually with 100 deaths half of those deaths were in children CDC reports Death occurred in approximately 1 in 60 000 cases not 1 100 as per Dr Reiwart 2 Half the deaths were in adults who missed the infection in childhood 3 In adults chickenpox presents as pneumonia or can reactivate as shingles herpes zoster According to Dr Jane Seward of the CDC Chickenpox in adults has twenty times the risk of death and 10 15 times the risk of hospitalization as chickenpox in children 4 Shingles is twice as deadly as chickenpox 5 and can also cause debilitating pain called post herpetic neuralgia or PHN and blindness Merck s varicella vaccine and booster cost 100 each The total cost to theoretically save 50 children is approximately 1 billion dollars or 20 million per child life saved i e 1 billion in vaccine costs based on 100 for the initial vaccine and 100 for the booster for 4 million children annually plus a 50 vaccine administration fee for both vaccines divided by 50 childhood deaths For reference the maximum compensable value of a child s life is 250 000 in the Vaccine Court 6 CDCs clinical studies on Merck s vaccine indicated that due to waning immunity the single dose varicella vaccine was only 44 effective 7 By eliminating the boosting effects of regularly circulating wild type chickenpox widespread vaccination would increase shingles rates among adults and children with a history of chickenpox and precipitate a shingles epidemic 8 The Research Analyst for the Antelope Valley Varicella Active

CDC Director Julie Gerberding continued to support the CDC recommendation that every child get vaccinated for Chickenpox Merck rewarded Gerberding for this billion dollar gift by naming her as President of its Vaccine division 9 The United Kingdom and other nations refused to recommend the universal vaccination of children due to predictions that loss of exogenous outside boosting would create a shingles epidemic over decades 8 Merck s reaction to the shingles epidemic that it created was to market a new shingles vaccine Zostavax which is linked to a long list of side effects including asthma exacerbation polymyalgia rheumatica congestive heart failure pulmonary edema 10 and death 11 In 2018 FDA posted a warning that immunocompromised persons and pregnant should avoid children for up to six weeks after vaccination since vaccinated individuals can transmit the disease through viral shedding a phenomena never mentioned by advocates of excluding unvaccinated children

Exposing Pharma s Real End Game of Drug Dependency vs Curing Disease Could Goldman Sachs Report Be Exposing Pharma s Real End Game of Drug Dependency vs Curing Disease By Children s Health Defense Team Link copied Children s Health Defense Note This important article exposes how Goldman Sachs looks at the business model of cure vs no cure for diseases The report asks the question Is curing patients a sustainable business model CHD is working to change this model Together the U S government and American families are spending billions on medications therapy insurance education housing etc to address the epidemics of chronic childhood diseases These include autism ADHD diabetes juvenile rheumatoid arthritis cancer allergies including deadly peanut allergies autoimmune conditions obesity and more The costs are staggering A recent government survey found that 1 in 45 children ages 3 through 17 have been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder ASD The estimated average lifetime cost to care for a child with autism is 1 4 million if they do not have intellectual disability An estimated 1 in 5 persons with autism also has intellectual disability This increases the average lifetime cost of care to 2 3 million CHD is calling for a new paradigm that tries to stop the rise of chronic disease and cure those who are suffering now Since these epidemics are occurring in children the long term consequences of so many sick children could be dire for our nation and economy in the future The rise in chronic illness in children is coterminous with the vaccine schedule In 1986 there were 11 vaccines and 12 8 of our nation s children had a chronic illness In 2017 there were 54 vaccines and 2011 figures report an astonishing 54 of children suffer from chronic illness or developmental disability many of which have been associated with vaccine injuries CHD believes the U S plan must be to do everything possible now to prevent chronic diseases in children and it should start with investigating our broken vaccine program cures could be bad for business in the long run Is curing patients a sustainable business model On April 10th Goldman Sachs GS released a report called The Genome Revolution In it GS asked Is curing patients a sustainable business model People with chronic illnesses and those who have loved ones suffering with ongoing conditions will find the

aspects of gene therapy genetically engineered cell therapy and gene editing However such treatments offer a very different outlook with regard to recurring revenue versus chronic therapies analyst Salveen Richter wrote in the note to clients Tuesday While this proposition carries tremendous value for patients and society it could represent a challenge for genome medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow Richter cited Gilead Sciences treatments for hepatitis C which achieved cure rates of more than 90 percent The company s U S sales for these hepatitis C treatments peaked at 12 5 billion in 2015 but have been falling ever since Goldman estimates the U S sales for these treatments will be less than 4 billion this year according to a table in the report GILD is a case in point where the success of its hepatitis C franchise has gradually exhausted the available pool of treatable patients the analyst wrote In the case of infectious diseases such as hepatitis C curing existing patients also decreases the number of carriers able to transmit the virus to new patients thus the incident pool also declines Where an incident pool remains stable eg in cancer the potential for a cure poses less risk to the sustainability of a franchise CNBC reported that GS analysts didn t immediately respond to a request for comment The Children s Health Defense is addressing the chronic health issues plaguing our children by educating our communities leaders and federal agencies to bring about meaningful change on the most important issue of our lifetime the health and well being of

Forward By Lyn Redwood RN MSN Link copied On Wednesday January 9th I attended Science Day Presentations in the Jennifer Robi vs Merck and Kaiser Permanente case in Los Angeles Superior Court I want to report to our community on the outcome of this important event and provide some personal commentary It is difficult to describe the feelings of elation and frustration that I experienced during the full day of furious arguments that began at 9 30 am before Judge Maren Nelson Due to the restrictions of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act my son and thousands of children like him have never been able to have their injuries acknowledged in a court of law This day gave families around the globe whose children s health was permanently harmed by the HPV vaccine a glimmer of hope that their injuries and suffering would finally be acknowledged The frustration I felt came from the obvious fact that the science relied on by our federal agencies to approve the HPV vaccine was criminally inadequate and that Jennifer s injuries and those of the thousands of others like her could have been prevented Prior to Science Day plaintiffs attorneys worried that because Judge Nelson threw out a 472 million 2017 jury verdict against Johnson Johnson for causing ovarian cancer in women exposed to its asbestos containing baby powders the Court might not be very receptive to their arguments here However Judge Nelson gave scrupulous attention to the science presentations by both sides and clearly seemed to be approaching the Robi case with an open mind A red letter day After 20 years of advocating for vaccine safety this was the first time that I ve watched vaccine science issues adjudicated in a true court of law It was truly a red letter day Jennifer s lawyers brilliantly laid bare Merck s anemic case for Gardasil dissecting the science in withering presentations challenging both the efficacy and safety of the Gardasil vaccine and then chronicling the horrifying agency and

powered Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate AAHS adjuvant over stimulated the immune systems of vaccine recipients tipping them into autoimmune conditions in which their redlining immune defenses begin attacking their bodies own organs This autoimmune process causes a cascade of illnesses that in Jennifer Robi s case resulted in damage and deterioration in diverse organ systems throughout her body Victims like Jennifer are left exhausted as the body fights off disease on multiple fronts Pennock explained that vaccine makers add aluminum adjuvants to weak antigens and a long

gave the court an explosive 50 minute presentation of 112 disturbing slides describing the parade of deceptive canards that composed Merck s clinical trials Kennedy described a series of fraudulent gimmicks employed by Merck to deceive regulators during the clinical trials including the use of a spiked extremely toxic AAHS placebo rather than a true inert placebo that is standard for control groups in blue ribbon safety studies for other pharmaceutical products Using a poisonous placebo in the control group allowed Merck to mask the cascade of injuries suffered by girls in the Gardasil group during the clinical trials Half the girls in the Gardasil group and half the girls in the spiked placebo group suffered serious injuries including several deaths in the first seven months of the clinical trials yet Merck was able to claim that reactions in the study group were similar to the reactions in the placebo group and that therefore the vaccine was safe Merck reported most of these

in the target cohort of 9 12 year olds may not have in fact tested the vaccine that Merck went on to inject into millions of young children around the world Kennedy told the judge that this is not just scientific malpractice it is outright fraud Merck s control groups did not reflect the target population for its drug Another tactic utilized by Merck was to purge the study group of anyone with the slightest vulnerabilities to the vaccine or its ingredients despite the fact that the vaccine would ultimately be marketed to girls with the very vulnerabilities excluded during the clinical trials This precaution allowed the company to mask effects that occur only in vulnerable subgroups Mr Kennedy drew laughter from the large court room audience when he described how Merck had prescreened the study subjects to exclude people with allergies immunological or nervous disorders more than 4 lifetime sexual partners genetic vulnerabilities to cancer or to any other medical condition or with any hint of general infection a history of alcohol or drug abuse or a serious or chronic illnesses and so forth Finally Merck told its researchers to exclude any individual with any condition which in the opinion of the researchers might interfere with the study objective The remaining participants were an elite club of super healthy individuals You couldn t get into the clinical trials unless you were a superhero Kennedy told Judge Nelson You had to be eligible for the Avengers The problem of course is that none of the people receiving the vaccine under CDC s mandate are screened for these vulnerabilities In other words Merck s control groups did not reflect the target population for its drug The mayhem caused by Gardasil Even these flimflams could not conceal the

heartbreaking 50 of the subjects in both the study group and the spiked placebo group experience a serious adverse event within the seven months of the trial death rates among girls in the study were

never referred to it in their briefs and that study was republished elsewhere after the original journal retracted it under pressure from its pharmaceutical advertisers Sangiamo argued that the

Postulate The standard testing for COVID 19 utilizes a technology that its discoverer warned should never be used for diagnosis This technique known as PCR has led to massively inaccurate and

instead of deaths and hospitalizations and the result is an unprecedented negative impact upon society that is futile and unnecessary It is futile in the naïve assumption that SARS CoV 2 can be contained in the population and unnecessary since deaths and hospitalizations and attendant consequences therefrom are back to pre pandemic levels It is imperative that tracking data upon which

Infection Fatality Ratio has declined to a range that is within the bounds of deaths attributed to seasonal influenza in moderate to severe years Physicians for Informed Consent PIC published in June 2020 an article COVID Assessing Infection Severity data from the CDC published in May 2020 showing the following Mortality of SARS CoV 2 based on symptomatic cases was 0 4 Since 35 of cases were estimated by the CDC at the time to be asymptomatic the overall CFR case fatality rate was 0 26 Comparison with CFR reports from seasonal influenza and influenza pandemics range from 0 1 to 2 25 The latter figure was for the 1918 1920 pandemic but the CFR for seasonal influenza in 1957 1960 was 0 28 higher than the 0 26 for COVID reported by the CDC in May 2020 This decrease in IFR was predictable to a certain degree as initial figures for mortality were simple calculations based upon the number of deaths from COVID divided by the number of cases diagnosed with the latter number determined from testing among sick individuals only and including those believed clinically to have COVID despite a negative PCR test Once widespread testing became adopted the denominator total number believed to be infected became rapidly larger Some evidence has suggested furthermore that the virus has become relatively attenuated and less severe in its clinical impact a development that would not be unusual for a pandemic virus It has become clear that IFR rates are far lower than initial projections and fears which were derived from initial modeling data that proved to be orders of magnitude higher than reality Even as this reality was recognized the basis for mitigation practices shifted from using IFR rates and hospitalization numbers as the primary determinant to sole reliance upon case number data There is reason to believe this is the opposite of what should be done then such school closings are unnecessary and counterproductive This current case number fixation

has created a world where on a daily basis the number of reported cases is featured in headlines all over the country in newspapers on internet posts and shared on social media In one example in early September in the Greensboro North Carolina newspaper it was reported that a particular school where testing was done to monitor asymptomatic children one child tested positive with the standard PCR based test procedure and the school was immediately closed If the number of cases is inaccurate and wildly inflated for which we will see below there is compelling evidence then such school closings are unnecessary and counterproductive The same problem applies to other mitigation practices that are based exclusively upon case numbers It has been documented by Dr Scot Atlas among others that the number of deaths from mitigation for COVID has now significantly exceeded that from COVID itself This is attributed to increased rates of depression suicide drug overdoses etc Further data have shown that excess total mortality rates comparing current with past years total mortality are not significantly higher than usual past rates This of course begs another question far too involved to discuss here the possibility that part of the perception of the impact of COVID is based upon shifting usual numbers of deaths from influenza that are peculiarly lower than usual to a diagnosis of COVID This in turn begs another question about the possible impact upon numbers of COVID deaths being inflated artificially because of the additional reimbursements to hospitals for COVID codes for hospitalizations and deaths But even assuming that putative deaths from COVID are not artificially inflated deaths from mitigation for COVID has exceeded those from COVID itself Four recent sources delve into the PCR testing phenomenon in detail and together make a compelling argument that the standard form of diagnostic testing for COVID PCR is just as its discoverer Kary Mullis argued prior to his death in 2019 grossly inaccurate and should not be used for diagnosis Needless to say this is a shocking suggestion but I believe the evidence strongly supports this conclusion Now we will discuss briefly the basics about PCR testing and show why it is imperative that ongoing public health mitigation measures shift from using PCR case numbers to accurate non inflated data from hospitalizations

applied to the prevailing diagnostic test being used in the United States as well as most of the world It is essential to understand in order to draw valid conclusions about the significance or lack thereof of the COVID PCR test Basics of PCR PCR is a chemical reaction to identify tiny bits of DNA the primary form of material in human genes which in turn comprise chromosomes Due to the infinitesimally small size of the particles they must be amplified or made exponentially larger in order to work with them This amplification process is what Kary Mullis discovered and consists of multiplying sequentially by doubling the material present So 2 becomes 4 then becomes 8 then 16 and so forth As noted PCR multiplies DNA The genetic material that comprises the virus for COVID as well as most other viruses is RNA an even smaller particle It must be converted to DNA in order to utilize the PCR process This is accomplished by action of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase RT in the first of four steps involved in the process RT thus allows a single strand of RNA to be translated into a complementary strand of DNA The product of RT acting on RNA is called RT PCR this simple decision to frame results of the PCR testing as the basis for the entire case numbers tracking upon which virtually all public health measures are being based is almost incomprehensible Another term is Real time PCR a variation of PCR that allows analysis of the amplified or multiplied DNA during the typical number of 40 cycles Fluorescent dye is added in some techniques to facilitate interpretation and obtain test results more rapidly The ultimate end point of a PCR test is a result that is being arbitrarily defined as positive or negative The extraordinary implications of this simple decision to frame results of the PCR testing as the basis for the entire case numbers tracking upon which virtually all public health measures are being based is almost incomprehensible Dr

quoted in the Harvard Magazine 8 3 20 as saying that Current PCR testing detects virus long after the infected person has stopped transmitting the virus He further states That means the results are virtually useless for public health efforts to contain the raging epidemic emphasis added PCR Amplification or Cycles Most PCR tests are set to run at 40 cycles a few at 37 North Carolina uses a cutoff of 37 cycles This is important to remember as we develop the implications of this process Tests with thresholds so high may detect not only live virus but also simple genetic fragments leftover from past infection that poses no risk for current exposure to others According to the NY Times article citing virologist Dr Juliet Morrison any test with a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive in other words will read positive when the individual is not infectious He recommends a more reasonable cutoff of 30 to 35 cycles Dr Mina would use a threshold of 30 or lower A CDC calculation suggests that it would be extremely difficult to detect any live virus in a sample above 33 cycles Another source suggested that if a threshold of over 40 cycles is used everyone tested would be

the basic flaws inherent in using PCR for diagnosis it must be pointed out that in addition to the problems discussed above with varying numbers of cycles or amplifications being used in different states or even in different health systems in one state it would be quite easy and simple to manipulate the number of positive results with this form of testing by simply changing the number of cycles to a higher number to produce the appearance of worsening or to a lower one to produce lower infection numbers Remember that some experts say that if over 40 amplifications be used 100 of people tested would be positive Because the diagnostic test that is the foundation of testing for COVID is a PCR test an individual who gets tested in a facility or area that is using a test setting the cutoff at 37 cycles for example and has a positive result might fly to another area where repeat testing using a 30 cycle test would likely be negative So the same individual who had COVID in location one does not have it after flying to the second location This reveals the absurdity of the PCR based test Evidence that COVID Pandemic is fundamentally over Dr Edwards goes through a number of slides showing how deaths and hospitalizations from COVID across the United States as well as across other countries generally have declined to pre pandemic levels And yet in the face of the documentation of deaths and other collateral damage from the response to COVID exceeding those from the virus itself these grossly misleading and inflated case numbers are the basis for most policy guidelines When one understands the clear and well documented fallacy of utilizing PCR based testing for diagnosis it is inconceivable that policymakers continue to rely upon this technology whose discoverer warned should not be done Continuing to do this suggests an ulterior motivation to do so Increasing numbers of people are awakening to the reality of this fallacious practice as demonstrated by a recent mass

for a Coronavirus vaccine promises to be world wide A good example of this inappropriate application of unnecessary mitigation is described in an Op Ed by Daniel Horowitz on Sept 8 2020 Horowitz cites a report by Dr Andrew Bostom a cardiovascular and epidemiology researcher who posted a spreadsheet on Twitter of all the cases in 17 state university systems up to September 4 2020 There were more than 11 000 students testing positive for COVID and deemed to represent cases but zero hospitalizations And yet schools and colleges are closing down left and right in response to such reports of clusters of cases For those who are skeptical that such a misleading practice might continue for non medical or unscientific reasons one only needs to consider that the market for a Coronavirus vaccine promises to be worldwide numbering in the billions and probably for more than one dose as well as needed for yearly administration The same thing applies to a potential new drug for early treatment It is relevant that a widely touted early combination treatment for COVID with zinc azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine has been widely discussed and promoted by front line physicians who have reported remarkable success in reducing mortality rates and hospitalizations by 50 to 90 percent among sick COVID patients in many thousands of patients in over six countries and in the hot zone COVID area in New York City has been suppressed This in the face of a number of controlled studies showing that such a combination when used early is safe effective and inexpensive Studies cited by those imposing restrictions on this treatment were either designed to fail treatment reserved for late in the clinical course or in one case using toxic doses of hydroxychloroquine or contained fraudulent data and was retracted shortly after publication The latter example was published in Lancet one of the world s leading academic journals Opposition even to allowing physicians to prescribe

three pandemic coronaviruses that can infect humans SARS MERS and now SARS CoV 2 As the news of deaths in China South Korea Italy and Iran began to saturate every form of media 24 7 we became familiar with a new term COVID 19 To be clear the name of the newly identified coronavirus is SARS CoV 2 short for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 This virus is associated with fever cough chest pain and shortness of breath the complex of symptoms that form the diagnosis of COVID 19 The Trump administration declared a public health emergency on January 31 2020 then on February 2 placed a ban on the entry of most travelers who had recently been in China On February 4 Alex Azar the Secretary of Health and Human Services HHS issued a declaration of public health emergency and activated

rushing to the get in line Calls for testing to see if a person is or isn t infected began soon after the emergency was declared but performing those tests was initially slow due to an inadequate number of test kits As the kits became available those developed by the CDC had a defect The reagents reacted to the negative control sample making the test inaccurate and the kits unusable In various countries thousands of test kits purchased from China were found to be contaminated with the SARS CoV 2 viruses No one really knows how that happened but theories spread like wildfire Could the test

methods include a swab of the nasal passages or by inserting a long uncomfortable swab through the nose to scrape the back of the throat Specimens have also been obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage from sputum and from stool specimens The call for mandatory testing has been gathering steam and becoming ever more onerous In Washington state Governor Inslee has declared Individuals that refuse to cooperate with contact tracers and or refuse testing those individuals will not be allowed to leave their homes to purchase basic necessities such as groceries and or prescriptions Those persons will need to make arrangements through friends family or state provided family support personnel But what do the results really mean Who should be tested On May 8 2020 the CDC has listed specific

Types of testing RT PCR PCR short for polymerase chain reaction is a highly specific laboratory technique The key to understanding PCR testing is that PCR can identify an individual specific virus within a viral family However a PCR test can only be used to identify DNA viruses the SARS CoV2 virus is an RNA virus Therefore multiple steps must be taken to magnify the amount of genetic material in the specimen Researchers used a method called RT PCR reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to specifically identify the SARS CoV 2 virus It s a complicated process To read more about it go here and here If a nasal or a blood sample contains a tiny snip of RNA from the SARS CoV 2 virus RT PCR can identify it leading to a high probability that the person has been exposed to the SARS CoV 2 virus However and this is important a positive RT PCR test result does not necessarily indicate a full virus is present The virus must be fully intact to be transmitted and cause illness And what makes this testing even more confusing is that the FDA admits that The detection of viral RNA by RT PCR does not necessarily equate with an infectious virus RT PCR testing The importance of timing Even if a person has had all the symptoms associated with a coronavirus infection or has been closely exposed to persons who have been diagnosed with COVID 19 the probability of an RT PCR test being positive decreases with the number of days past the onset of symptoms According to a study done by Paul Wikramaratna and others For a nasal swab the percentage chance of a positive test declines from about 94 on day 0 to about 67 by day 10 By day 31 there is only a 2 chance of a positive result For a throat swab the percentage chance of a positive test declines from about 88 on day 0 to about 47 by day 10 By day 31 there is only a 1 chance of a positive result In other words the longer the time frame between the onset of symptoms and the time a person is tested the more likely the test will be negative Repeat testing of persons who have a negative test may eventually confirm the presence of viral RNA but this is impractical Additionally repeated testing of the", "chunk_id":

go from negative to positive then back to negative again as the immune system clears out the coronavirus infection and moves to recovery And what makes this testing even more confusing is that the FDA admits that The detection of viral RNA by RT PCR does not necessarily equate with an infectious virus Let s break that down You ve had all the symptoms of COVID19 but your RT PCR test for SARS CoV 2 is negative Does that mean you re good to go you can go to work go to school or you can travel Does that mean your influenza like illness was caused by some other pathogen possibly one of the four coronaviruses that have been in circulation for 60 years Does that mean the result is a false negative and you still have the infection but it isn t detectable by current tests Does that mean it was a sample that was inadequately taken due to the faulty technique by the technician Does that mean you have not been exposed and you are susceptible to contracting the infection and you need to stay in quarantine So what does a positive test actually mean And that s the problem No one knows for sure Another type of testing Antibodies According to the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics FIND more than 200 serologic blood tests to test for antibodies are either now available or in development There are two primary types of antibodies that are assessed for nearly any type of infection IgM and IgG While several new testing devices are being touted as a home test they are not the same as a home pregnancy test or a glucometer to test your blood sugar The blood spot or saliva specimen can be collected at home it must then be sent to a laboratory for analysis It can take a few days or longer to get the results With so many tests in the pipeline the ability to test at home will be changing over time The first antibody to rise is IgM It rises quickly after the onset of the infection and is usually a sign of an acute or current infection The IgM levels diminish

of an IgG antibody is more difficult This antibody is an indicator of a past infection The test is often not specific enough to determine if the past infection was caused by the SARS CoV 2 virus or one of the four common coronaviruses that cause influenza like illness The FDA says Because serology testing can yield a negative test result even if the patient is actively infected e g the body has not yet developed in response to the virus or may be falsely positive e g if the antibody indicates a past infection by a different coronavirus this type of testing should not be used to diagnose an acute or active COVID 19 infection Similarly the CDC says the following regarding antibody testing If you test positive A positive test result shows you have antibodies as a result of an infection with SARS CoV 2 or possibly a related coronavirus It s unclear if those antibodies can provide protection immunity against getting infected again This means that we do not know at this time if antibodies make you immune to the virus If you have no symptoms you likely do not have an active infection and no additional follow up is needed It s possible you might test positive for antibodies and you might not have or have ever had symptoms of COVID 19 This is known as having an asymptomatic infection ie you have a healthy immune system An antibody test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID 19 If you test negative If you test negative for antibodies you probably did not have a previous infection However you could have a current infection because antibodies don t show up for 1 to 3 weeks after infection Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies and some people may not develop antibodies An antibody test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID 19

spread of this virus is the only way we will be able to get out from under this H R 6666 would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services HHS acting through the Director of the CDC to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing and then to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals The contact tracers would be authorized to test people in their homes and as necessary quarantine people in place Where do they intend to do this testing Besides mobile units to test people in their homes the bill identifies eight specific locations where the testing and

Government Cover up of a Mercury Autism Scandal By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied KEEPING UP THE PRESSURE RFK Jr addressing the media during a February 15 press conference in Washington DC on the ongoing vaccine science corruption within our government agencies In the 12 years since the publication of Deadly Immunity Mr Kennedy has remained steadfast in his insistence that when it comes to vaccine safety and protecting the health of our children we must do better Children s Health Defense note With the ongoing mainstream media blackout on questions regarding vaccine safety we want to remind our followers of the publication and subsequent retraction of Robert F Kennedy Jr s 2005 article Deadly Immunity in Salon The history of repression of crucial vaccine safety data runs deep The article laid out the scientific link between thimerosal and childhood neurological disorders and published explosive excerpts from the transcripts from the CDC s secretive June 2000 Simpsonwood conference which brought together government public health officials vaccine manufacturers and professional medical associations The article was groundbreaking at the time and received lots of media attention for uncovering the cozy relationship between government and industry at the expense of children s health Even though a dozen years have passed the article s facts have stood the test of time An important read for people new to the movement and long time advocates alike In June 2000 a group of top government scientists and health officials gathered for a meeting at the isolated Simpsonwood conference center in Norcross Georgia Convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the meeting was held at this Methodist retreat center nestled in wooded farmland next to the Chattahoochee River to ensure complete secrecy The agency had issued no public announcement of the session only private invitations to fifty two attendees There were high level officials from the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration the top vaccine specialist from the World Health Organization in Geneva and representatives of every major vaccine manufacturer including GlaxoSmithKline Merck Wyeth and Aventis Pasteur All of the scientific data under discussion CDC officials repeatedly reminded the participants was strictly embargoed There would be no making photocopies of documents no

indicate a link between thimerosal and speech delays attention deficit disorder hyperactivity and autism Since 1991 when the CDC and the FDA had recommended that three additional vaccines laced with the preservative be given to extremely young infants in one case within hours of birth the estimated number of cases of autism had increased fifteenfold from one in every 2 500 children to one in 166 children Even for scientists and doctors accustomed to confronting issues of life and death the findings were frightening You can play with this all you want Dr Bill Weil a consultant for the American Academy of Pediatrics told the group The results are statistically significant Dr Richard Johnston an immunologist and pediatrician from the University of Colorado whose grandson had been born early on the morning of the meeting s first day was even more alarmed My gut feeling he said Forgive this personal comment I do not want my grandson to get a thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on But instead of taking immediate steps to alert the public and rid the vaccine supply of thimerosal the officials and executives at Simpsonwood spent most of the next two days discussing how to cover up the damaging data According to transcripts obtained under the Freedom of Information Act many at the meeting were concerned about how the damaging revelations about thimerosal would affect the vaccine industry s bottom line We are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits said Dr Robert Brent a pediatrician at the Alfred I duPont Hospital

officials and executives at Simpsonwood spent most of the next two days discussing how to cover up the damaging data In fact the government has proved to be far more adept at handling the damage than at protecting children s health The CDC paid the Institute of Medicine to conduct a new study to whitewash the risks of thimerosal ordering researchers to rule out the chemical s link to autism It withheld Verstraeten s findings even though they had been slated for immediate publication and told other scientists that his original data had been lost and could not be replicated And to thwart the Freedom of Information Act it handed its giant database of vaccine records over to a private company declaring it off limits to researchers By the time Verstraeten finally published his study in 2003 he had gone to work for GlaxoSmithKline and reworked his data to bury the link between thimerosal and autism Vaccine manufacturers had already begun to phase thimerosal out of injections given to American infants but they continued to sell off their mercury based supplies of vaccines until last year The CDC and FDA gave them a hand buying up the tainted vaccines for export to developing countries and allowing drug companies to continue using the preservative in some American vaccines including several pediatric flu shots as well as tetanus boosters routinely given to eleven year olds

Frist Even many conservatives are shocked by the government s effort to cover up the dangers of thimerosal Rep Dan Burton a Republican from Indiana oversaw a three year investigation of thimerosal after his grandson was diagnosed with autism Thimerosal used as a preservative in vaccines is directly related to the autism epidemic his House Government Reform Committee concluded in its final

The FDA and other public health agencies failed to act the committee added out of institutional malfeasance for self protection and misplaced protectionism of the pharmaceutical industry The story of how government health agencies colluded with Big Pharma to hide the risks of thimerosal from the public is a chilling case study of institutional arrogance power and greed I was drawn into the controversy only reluctantly As an attorney and environmentalist who has spent years working on issues of mercury toxicity I frequently met mothers of autistic children who were absolutely convinced that their kids had been injured by vaccines Privately I was skeptical I doubted that autism could be blamed on a single source and I certainly understood the government s need to reassure parents that vaccinations are safe the eradication of deadly childhood diseases depends on it I tended to agree with skeptics like Rep Henry Waxman a Democrat from California who criticized his colleagues on the House Government Reform Committee for leaping to conclusions about autism and vaccinations Why should we scare people about immunization Waxman pointed out at one hearing until we know the facts

nursing I have never seen so many damaged sick kids Something very very wrong is happening to our children More than 500 000 kids currently suffer from autism and pediatricians diagnose more than 40 000 new cases every year The disease was unknown until 1943 when it was identified and diagnosed among eleven children born in the months after thimerosal was first added to baby vaccines in 1931 Some skeptics dispute that the rise in autism is caused by thimerosal tainted vaccinations They argue that the increase is a result of better diagnosis a theory that seems questionable at best given that most of the new cases of autism are clustered within a single generation of children If the epidemic is truly an artifact of poor diagnosis scoffs Dr Boyd Haley one of the world s authorities on mercury toxicity then where are all the twenty year old autistics Other researchers point out that Americans are exposed to a greater cumulative load of mercury than ever before from contaminated fish to dental fillings and suggest that thimerosal in vaccines may be only part of a much larger problem It s a concern that certainly deserves far more attention than it has received but it overlooks the fact that the mercury concentrations in vaccines dwarf other sources of exposure to our children What is most striking is the lengths to which many of the leading detectives have gone to ignore and

and that the developing brains of infants are particularly susceptible In 1977 a Russian study found that adults exposed to much lower concentrations of ethylmercury than those given to American children still suffered brain damage years later Russia banned thimerosal from children s vaccines twenty years ago and Denmark Austria Japan Great Britain and all the Scandinavian countries have since followed suit You couldn t even construct a study that shows thimerosal is safe says Haley who heads the chemistry department at the University of Kentucky It s just too darn toxic If you inject thimerosal into an animal its brain will sicken If you apply it to living tissue the cells die If you put it in a petri dish the culture dies Knowing these things it would be shocking if one could inject it into an infant without causing damage Internal documents reveal that Eli Lilly which first developed thimerosal knew from the start that its product could cause damage and even death in both animals and humans In 1930 the company tested thimerosal by administering it to twenty two patients with terminal meningitis all of whom died within weeks of being injected a fact Lilly didn t bother to report in its study declaring thimerosal safe In 1935 researchers at another vaccine manufacturer Pittman Moore warned Lilly that its claims about thimerosal s safety did not check with ours Half the dogs Pittman injected with thimerosal based vaccines became sick leading researchers there to declare the preservative unsatisfactory as a serum intended for use on dogs In the decades that

cells in concentrations as low as one part per million 100 times weaker than the concentration in a typical vaccine Even so the company continued to promote thimerosal as nontoxic and also

animal vaccines But tragically that same year the CDC recommended that infants be injected with a series of mercury laced vaccines Newborns would be vaccinated for hepatitis B within twenty four hours of birth and two month old infants would be immunized for haemophilus influenzae B and diphtheria tetanus pertussis The drug industry knew the additional vaccines posed a danger The same year that the CDC approved the new vaccines Dr Maurice Hilleman one of the fathers of Merck s vaccine programs warned the company that six month olds who were administered the shots would suffer dangerous exposure to mercury He recommended that thimerosal be discontinued especially when used on infants and children noting that the industry knew of nontoxic alternatives The best way to go he added is to switch to dispensing the actual vaccines without adding preservatives For Merck and other drug companies however the obstacle was money Thimerosal enables the pharmaceutical industry to package vaccines in vials that contain multiple doses which require additional protection because they are more easily contaminated by multiple needle entries The larger vials cost half as much to produce as smaller single dose vials making it cheaper for international agencies to distribute them to impoverished regions at risk of epidemics Faced with this cost consideration Merck ignored Hilleman s warnings and government officials continued to push more and more thimerosal based vaccines for children Before 1989 American preschoolers received eleven vaccinations for polio diphtheria tetanus pertussis and measles mumps rubella A decade later thanks to federal recommendations children were receiving a total of twenty two immunizations by the time they reached first grade As the number of vaccines

still at a critical stage of development infants routinely received three inoculations that contained a total of 62 5 micrograms of ethylmercury a level 99 times greater than the EPA s limit for daily exposure to methylmercury a related neurotoxin Although the vaccine industry insists that ethylmercury poses little danger because it breaks down rapidly and is removed by the body several studies including one published in April by the National Institutes of Health suggest that ethylmercury is actually more toxic to developing brains and stays in the brain longer than methylmercury Officials responsible for childhood immunizations insist that the additional vaccines were necessary to protect infants from disease and that thimerosal is still essential in developing nations which they often claim cannot afford the single dose vials that don t require a preservative Dr Paul Offit one of CDC s top vaccine advisers told me I think if we really have an influenza pandemic and certainly we will in the next twenty years because we always do there s no way on God s earth that we immunize 280 million people with single dose vials There has to be multidose vials But while public health officials may have been well intentioned many of those on the CDC advisory committee who backed the additional vaccines had close ties to the industry Dr Sam Katz the committee s chair was a paid consultant for most of the major vaccine makers and was part of a team that developed the measles vaccine and brought it to licensure in 1963 Dr Neal Halsey another committee member worked as a

failed to represent all the available scientific and medical research CDC officials are not interested in an honest search for the truth Weldon told me because an association between vaccines and autism would force them to admit that their policies irreparably damaged thousands of children Who would want to make that conclusion about themselves Under pressure from Congress and parents the Institute of Medicine convened another panel to address continuing concerns about the Vaccine Safety Datalink Data Sharing program In February the new panel composed of different scientists criticized the way the VSD had been used in the Verstraeten study and urged the CDC to make its vaccine database available to the public So far though only two scientists have managed to gain access Dr Mark Geier president of the Genetics Center of America and his son David spent a year battling to obtain the medical records from the CDC Since August 2002 when members of Congress pressured the agency to turn over the data the Geiers have completed six studies that demonstrate a powerful correlation between thimerosal and neurological damage in children One study which compares the cumulative dose of mercury received by children born between 1981 and 1985 with those born between 1990 and 1996 found a very significant relationship between autism and vaccines Another study of educational performance

Olmsted of UPI undertook one of the more interesting studies himself Searching for children who had not been exposed to mercury in vaccines the kind of population that scientists typically use as a control in experiments Olmsted scoured the Amish of Lancaster County Pennsylvania who refuse to immunize their infants Given the national rate of autism Olmsted calculated that there should be 130 autistics among the Amish He found only four One had been exposed to high levels of mercury from a power plant The other three including one child adopted from outside the Amish community had received their vaccines At the state level many officials have also conducted in depth reviews of thimerosal While the Institute of Medicine was busy whitewashing the risks the Iowa legislature was carefully combing through all of the available scientific and biological data After three years of review I became convinced there was sufficient credible research to show a link between mercury and the increased incidences in autism says state Sen Ken Veenstra a Republican who oversaw the investigation The fact that Iowa s 700 percent increase in autism began in the 1990s right after more and more vaccines were added to the children s vaccine schedules is solid evidence alone Last year Iowa became the first state to ban mercury in vaccines followed by California Similar bans are now under consideration in thirty two other states But instead of following suit the FDA continues to allow manufacturers to include thimerosal in scores of over the counter medications as well as steroids and injected collagen Even more alarming the government continues to ship vaccines preserved with thimerosal to developing countries some of which are now experiencing a sudden explosion in autism rates

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the meeting was held at this Methodist retreat center nestled in wooded farmland next to the Chattahoochee River to ensure complete secrecy The agency had issued no public announcement of the session only private invitations to fifty two attendees There were high level officials from the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration the top vaccine specialist from the World Health Organization in Geneva and representatives of every major vaccine manufacturer including GlaxoSmithKline Merck Wyeth and Aventis Pasteur All of the scientific data under discussion CDC officials repeatedly reminded the participants was strictly embargoed There would be no making photocopies of documents no taking papers with them when they left The federal officials and industry representatives had assembled to discuss a disturbing new study that raised alarming questions about the safety of a host of common childhood vaccines administered to infants and young children According to a CDC epidemiologist named Tom Verstraeten who had analyzed the agency s massive database containing the medical records of 100 000 children a mercury based preservative in the vaccines thimerosal appeared to be responsible for a dramatic increase in autism and a host of other neurological disorders among children I was actually stunned by what I saw Verstraeten told those assembled at Simpsonwood citing the staggering number of earlier studies that indicate a link between thimerosal and speech delays attention deficit disorder hyperactivity and autism Since 1991 when the CDC and the FDA had recommended that three additional vaccines laced with the preservative be given to extremely young infants in one case within hours of birth the

do not want my grandson to get a thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on But instead of taking immediate steps to alert the public and rid the vaccine supply of thimerosal the officials and executives at Simpsonwood spent most of the next two days discussing how to cover up the damaging data According to transcripts obtained under the Freedom of Information Act many at the meeting were concerned about how the damaging revelations about thimerosal would affect the vaccine industry s bottom line We are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits said Dr Robert Brent a pediatrician at the Alfred I duPont Hospital for Children in Delaware This will be a resource to our very busy plaintiff attorneys in this country Dr Bob Chen head of vaccine safety for the CDC expressed relief that given the sensitivity of the information we have been able to keep it out of the hands of let s say less responsible hands Dr John Clements vaccines advisor at the World Health Organization declared that perhaps this study should not have been done at all He added that the research results have to be handled warning that the study will be taken by others and will be used in other ways beyond the control of this group In fact the government has proved to be far more adept at handling the damage than at protecting children s health The CDC paid the Institute of Medicine to conduct a new study to whitewash the risks of thimerosal ordering researchers to rule out the chemical s link to autism It withheld Verstraeten s findings even though they had been slated for immediate publication and told other scientists that his original data had been lost and could not be replicated And to thwart the Freedom of Information Act it handed its giant

repealed by Congress in 2003 but earlier this year Frist slipped another provision into an anti terrorism bill that would deny compensation to children suffering from vaccine related brain disorders

thimerosal from the public is a chilling case study of institutional arrogance power and greed I was drawn into the controversy only reluctantly As an attorney and environmentalist who has spent years working on issues of mercury toxicity I frequently met mothers of autistic children who were absolutely convinced that their kids had been injured by vaccines Privately I was skeptical I doubted that autism could be blamed on a single source and I certainly understood the government s need to reassure parents that vaccinations are safe the eradication of deadly childhood diseases depends on it I tended to agree with skeptics like Rep Henry Waxman a Democrat from California who criticized his colleagues on the House Government Reform Committee for leaping to conclusions about autism and vaccinations Why should we scare people about immunization Waxman pointed out at one hearing until we know the facts It was only after reading the Simpsonwood transcripts studying the leading scientific research and talking with many of the nation s pre eminent authorities on mercury that I became convinced that the link between thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood neurological disorders is real Five of my own children are members of the Thimerosal Generation those born between 1989 and 2003 who received heavy doses of mercury from vaccines The elementary grades are

Other researchers point out that Americans are exposed to a greater cumulative load of mercury than ever before from contaminated fish to dental fillings and suggest that thimerosal in vaccines may be only part of a much larger problem It s a concern that certainly deserves far more attention than it has received but it overlooks the fact that the mercury concentrations in vaccines dwarf other sources of exposure to our children What is most striking is the lengths to which many of the leading detectives have gone to ignore and cover up the evidence against thimerosal From the very beginning the scientific case against the mercury additive has been overwhelming The preservative which is used to stem fungi and bacterial growth in vaccines contains ethylmercury a potent neurotoxin Truckloads of studies have shown that mercury tends to accumulate in the brains of primates and other animals after they are injected with vaccines and that the developing brains of infants are particularly susceptible In 1977 a Russian study found that adults exposed to much lower concentrations of ethylmercury than those given to American children still suffered brain damage years later Russia banned thimerosal from children s vaccines twenty years ago and Denmark Austria Japan Great Britain and all the Scandinavian countries have since followed suit You couldn t even construct a study that shows thimerosal is safe says Haley who heads the chemistry department at the University of Kentucky It s just too darn toxic If you inject thimerosal into an animal its brain will sicken If you apply it to living tissue the cells die If you put it in a petri dish the culture dies Knowing these things it would be shocking if one could inject it into an infant without causing damage Internal documents reveal that Eli Lilly which first developed thimerosal knew from the start that its product could cause damage and even death in both animals and humans In 1930 the company tested thimerosal by administering it to twenty two patients with terminal meningitis all of whom died within weeks of being injected a fact Lilly didn t bother to report in its study declaring thimerosal

became sick leading researchers there to declare the preservative unsatisfactory as a serum intended for use on dogs In the decades that followed the evidence against thimerosal continued to mount During the Second World War when the Department of Defense used the preservative in vaccines on soldiers it required Lilly to label it poison In 1967 a study in Applied Microbiology found that thimerosal killed mice when added to injected vaccines Four years later Lilly s own studies discerned that thimerosal was toxic to tissue cells in concentrations as low as one part per million 100 times weaker than the concentration in a typical vaccine Even so the company continued to promote thimerosal as nontoxic and also incorporated it into topical disinfectants In 1977 ten babies at a Toronto hospital died when an antiseptic preserved with thimerosal was dabbed onto their umbilical cords In 1982 the FDA proposed a ban on over the counter products that contained thimerosal and in 1991 the agency considered banning it from animal vaccines But tragically that same year the CDC recommended that infants be injected with a series of mercury laced vaccines Newborns would be vaccinated for hepatitis B within twenty four hours of birth and two month old infants would be immunized for haemophilus influenzae B and diphtheria tetanus pertussis The drug industry knew the additional vaccines posed a danger The same year that the CDC approved the new vaccines Dr Maurice Hilleman one of the fathers of Merck s vaccine programs warned the company that six month olds who were administered the shots would suffer dangerous exposure to mercury He recommended that thimerosal be discontinued especially when used on infants and children noting that the industry knew of nontoxic alternatives The best way to go he added is to switch to dispensing the actual vaccines without adding preservatives For Merck and other drug companies however the obstacle was money Thimerosal enables the pharmaceutical industry to package vaccines in vials that contain multiple doses which require additional protection because they are more easily contaminated by multiple needle entries The larger vials cost half as much to produce as smaller single dose vials making it cheaper for international agencies to distribute them to impoverished regions at risk of epidemics Faced

based vaccines for children Before 1989 American preschoolers received eleven vaccinations for polio diphtheria tetanus pertussis and measles mumps rubella A decade later thanks to federal recommendations children were receiving a total of twenty two immunizations by the time they reached first grade As the number of vaccines increased the rate of autism among children exploded During the 1990s 40 million children were injected with thimerosal based vaccines receiving unprecedented levels of mercury during a period critical for brain development Despite the well documented dangers of thimerosal it appears that no one bothered to add up the cumulative dose of mercury that children would receive from the mandated vaccines What took the FDA so long to do the calculations Peter Patriarca director of viral products for the agency asked in an e mail to the CDC in 1999 Why didn t CDC and the advisory bodies do these calculations when they rapidly expanded the childhood immunization schedule But by that time the damage was done At two months when the infant brain is still at a critical stage of development infants routinely received three inoculations that contained a total of 62 5 micrograms of ethylmercury a level 99 times greater than the EPA s limit for daily exposure to methylmercury a related neurotoxin Although the vaccine industry insists that ethylmercury poses little danger because it breaks down rapidly and is removed by the body several studies including one published in April by the National Institutes of Health suggest that ethylmercury is actually more toxic to developing brains and stays in the brain longer than methylmercury Officials responsible for childhood immunizations insist that the additional vaccines were necessary to protect infants from disease and that thimerosal is still essential in developing nations which they often claim cannot afford the single dose vials that don t require a preservative Dr

for his research on the hepatitis B vaccine Indeed in the tight circle of scientists who work on vaccines such conflicts of interest are common Rep Burton says that the CDC routinely allows scientists with blatant conflicts of interest to serve on intellectual advisory committees that make recommendations on new vaccines even though they have interests in the products and companies for which they are supposed to be providing unbiased oversight The House Government Reform Committee discovered that four of the eight CDC advisers who approved guidelines for a rotavirus vaccine had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine Offit who shares a patent on one of the vaccines acknowledged to me that he would make money if his vote eventually leads to a marketable product But he dismissed my suggestion that a scientist s direct financial stake in CDC approval might bias his judgment It provides no conflict for me he insists I have simply been informed by the process not corrupted by it When I sat around that table my sole intent was trying to make recommendations that best benefited the children in this country It s offensive to say that physicians and public health people are in the pocket of industry and thus are making decisions that they know are unsafe for children It s just not the way it works Other

advisory bodies regarding aggressive recommendations for use of thimerosal in child vaccines If federal regulators and government scientists failed to grasp the potential risks of thimerosal over the years no one could claim ignorance after the secret meeting at Simpsonwood But rather than conduct more studies to test the link to autism and other forms of brain damage the CDC placed politics over science The agency turned its database on childhood vaccines which had been developed largely at taxpayer expense over to a private agency America s Health Insurance Plans ensuring that it could not be used for additional research It also instructed the Institute of Medicine an advisory organization that is part of the National Academy of Sciences to produce a study debunking the link between thimerosal and brain disorders The CDC wants us to declare well that these things are pretty safe Dr Marie McCormick who chaired the IOM s Immunization Safety Review Committee told her fellow researchers when they first met in January 2001 We are not ever going to come down that autism is a true side effect of thimerosal exposure According to transcripts of the meeting the committee s chief staffer Kathleen Stratton predicted that the IOM would conclude that the evidence was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relation between thimerosal and autism That she added was the result

risk of autism we need to conduct and publicize additional studies to assure parents of safety Douglas formerly served as president of vaccinations for Merck where he ignored warnings about thimerosal s risks In May of last year the Institute of Medicine issued its final report Its conclusion There is no proven link between autism and thimerosal in vaccines Rather than reviewing the large body of literature describing the toxicity of thimerosal the report relied on four disastrously flawed epidemiological studies examining European countries where children received much smaller doses of thimerosal than American kids It also cited a new version of the Verstraeten study published in the journal Pediatrics that had been reworked to reduce the link between thimerosal and autism The new study included children too young to have been diagnosed with autism and overlooked others who showed signs of the disease The IOM declared the case closed and in a startling position for a scientific body recommended that no further research be conducted The report may have satisfied the CDC but it convinced no one Rep David Weldon a Republican physician from Florida who serves on the House Government Reform Committee attacked the Institute of Medicine saying it relied on a handful of studies that were fatally flawed by poor design and failed to represent all the available scientific and medical research CDC officials are not interested in an honest search for the truth Weldon told me because an association between vaccines and autism would force them to admit that their policies

medical records from the CDC Since August 2002 when members of Congress pressured the agency to turn over the data the Geiers have completed six studies that demonstrate a powerful correlation between thimerosal and neurological damage in children One study which compares the cumulative dose of mercury received by children born between 1981 and 1985 with those born between 1990 and 1996 found a very significant relationship between autism and vaccines Another study of educational performance found that kids who received higher doses of thimerosal in vaccines were nearly three times as likely to be diagnosed with autism and more than three times as likely to suffer from speech disorders and mental retardation Another soon to be published study shows that autism rates are in decline following the recent elimination of thimerosal from most vaccines As the federal government worked to prevent scientists from studying vaccines others have stepped in to study the link to autism In April reporter Dan Olmsted of UPI undertook one of the more interesting studies himself Searching for children who had not been exposed to mercury in vaccines the kind of population that scientists typically use as a control in experiments Olmsted scoured the Amish of Lancaster County Pennsylvania who refuse to immunize their infants Given the national rate of autism Olmsted calculated that there should be 130 autistics among the Amish He found only four One had been exposed to high levels of mercury from a power plant The other three including one child adopted from outside the Amish community had received their vaccines At the state level many officials have also conducted in depth reviews of thimerosal While the Institute of Medicine was busy whitewashing the risks the Iowa

preserved with thimerosal to developing countries some of which are now experiencing a sudden explosion in autism rates In China where the disease was virtually unknown prior to the introduction of thimerosal by U S drug manufacturers in 1999 news reports indicate that there are now more than 1 8 million autistics Although reliable numbers are hard to come by autistic disorders also appear to be

years public health advocates have vainly urged the CDC and WHO to conduct studies comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated populations to measure overall health outcomes Now a team of Scandinavian scientists has conducted such a study and the results are alarming That study funded in part by the Danish government and lead by Dr Soren Wengel Mogensen was published in January in EBioMedicine Mogensen and his team of scientists found that African children inoculated with the DTP diphtheria tetanus and pertussis vaccine during the early 1980s had a 5 10 times greater mortality than their unvaccinated peers The data suggest that while the vaccine protects against infection from those three bacteria it makes children more susceptible to dying from other causes The scientists term the study a natural experiment since a birthday based vaccination system employed for the Bandim Health Project BHP in Guinea Bissau West Africa had the effect of creating a vaccinated cohort and a similarly situated unvaccinated control group In the time period covered by this study Guinea Bissau had 50 child mortality rates for children up to age 5 Starting in 1978 BHP health care workers contacted pregnant mothers and encouraged them to visit infant weighing sessions provided by a BHP team every three months after their child s birth Beginning in 1981 BHP offered vaccinations at the weighing sessions Since the DPT vaccine and OPV oral polio immunizations were offered only to children who were at least three months of age at the weighing sessions the children s random birthdays allowed for analysis of deaths between 3 and 5 months of age depending on vaccination status So for example a child born on January 1 st and weighed on April 1st would be vaccinated but a child born on February 1 st would not be vaccinated until their following visit at age 5 months on July 1 st In the primary analysis DTP vaccinated infants experienced mortalities five times greater than DTP unvaccinated infants Mortalities to vaccinated girls were 9 98 times those among females in the unvaccinated control group while mortalities to vaccinated boys were 3 93 times the controls Oddly the scientists found that children receiving the oral polio vaccine simultaneously with DTP fared much better than children who did not The OPV vaccine appeared to modify the negative effect of the DTP vaccine reducing mortalities to 3 52 times those experienced among the control group Overall mortalities among vaccinated children were 10 times the control group when children received only the DTP

simultaneously with DTP fared much better than children who did not The OPV vaccine appeared to modify the negative effect of the DTP vaccine reducing mortalities to 3 52 times those experienced among the control group Overall mortalities among vaccinated children were 10 times the control group when children received only the DTP Mogensen and his colleagues hypothesize that the DTP vaccine might weaken a child s immune system against non target infections They conclude Though protective against the target disease DTP may increase susceptibility to unrelated infections DTP was associated with 5 fold higher mortality than being unvaccinated No prospective study has shown beneficial survival effects of DTP The Mogensen study supports the conclusions of previous investigations into child survival following vaccination An earlier study by Dr Peter Aaby of the introduction of DTP in rural Guinea Bissau indicated a 2 fold higher mortality among vaccinated children Aaby et al 2004a The Aaby report is one of several early studies that documented vaccination status and followed children prospectively All of them indicated that DTP vaccinated children died at rates far exceeding mortality amongst the control group A meta analysis of all eight known studies found a two fold higher mortality for DTP vaccinated compared to DTP unvaccinated Aaby et al 2016 Appendix A In 2014 The World Health Organization WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization SAGE conducted its own literature review of the potential non specific effects NSEs of several vaccines including DTP and found that the majority of studies reported a detrimental effect of DTP Higgins et al 2014 Strategic Advisory Group of Experts of Immunization 2014 due to its penchant for increasing susceptibility to unrelated infections SAGE recommended further research Moreover Mogensen and his colleagues observe that the studies reviewed by SAGE probably underestimated the lethal effect of the DTP vaccine because of unusually high mortality in the control groups Unvaccinated children in these studies have usually been frail children too sick or malnourished to get vaccinated and the studies may therefore have underestimated the negative effect of DTP The Mogensen study sought to avoid this pitfall by using controls selected by birthday and by eliminating underweight children and orphans from both the study group and the control group It included only children who were breastfed All the infants were healthy at the time of vaccination Nevertheless the Mogensen authors point out that even in their study the unvaccinated children had slightly worse nutritional status and travelled more biases that would tend to increase mortality They conclude that The estimate from the natural

DTP3 is used globally as an indicator of the performance of national vaccination programs The authors close with a bracing rebuke to public health regulators It should be of concern that the effect of routine vaccinations on all cause mortality was not tested in randomized trials All currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria tetanus or pertussis Though a vaccine protects children against the target disease it may simultaneously increase susceptibility to unrelated infections Those words should serve as a cold water wake up call to the World Health Organization WHO the CDC and other public health officials The public in both poor and rich countries has a right to scientifically based evidence that international vaccine programs are as safe as possible and that they have been thoroughly safety tested The best metrics for measuring safety are studies comparing health outcomes of vaccinated versus unvaccinated cohorts Yet both the CDC and the WHO have aggressively discouraged the pursuit of such studies Finally it s important to note that the DTP vaccine used in Guinea Bissau in the early 1980s almost certainly contained high concentrations of both mercury and aluminum Vaccine makers first created the combined diphtheria tetanus and pertussis vaccine in the 1940s mixing in an aluminum adjuvant and a mercury preservative thimerosal from its inception At that time the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended DTP for mass use in children Prior to 1990 DTP was the only thimerosal containing vaccine recommended for infants Five manufacturers supplied UNICEF with the DTP vaccines used in West Africa in the late 1970s and early 1980s One of these Biken of Japan described the industry standard in its 1987 lab report Outline of Method of Manufacture The preparation of DTP also contains thimerosal as a preservative By the early 1980s a cascade of lawsuits filed across the United States on behalf of vaccine injured children were driving DTP manufacturers from the market and threatening to shut down production of the DTP shot and other vaccines That threat led the U S Congress to bestow legal immunity on vaccine makers via the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Program in 1986 followed in December 1987 by the rollout of Vaccine Court Following the recommendation by

had uneventfully experienced measles as children and had recovered completely These national leaders reaped many benefits by getting measles in childhood accruing lifelong immunity and protection against cardiovascular disease among other benefits but that has not stopped them from fomenting public panic about measles or pushing for more vaccine mandates This week the Senate followed up with its own similar hearing The Health Education Labor and Pensions HELP Committee said that the hearing s purpose was to consider what is driving preventable disease outbreaks but rather than examine this question fully or fairly the event featured a hand picked line up of speakers who are one and all promoters of a no ifs ands or buts vaccine party line Many studies illustrate both types of vaccine failure primary and secondary as well as the concerning potential for vaccinated individuals to transmit disease to others Congressional hearings on vaccine safety in the early 2000s were more

generation vaccination is increasing the number of susceptible individuals in the population over time In 2017 Korean researchers warned that measles susceptibility is increasing in that country

less effective than naturally acquired immunity Other investigators observing the same patterns are scratching their heads For example Australian researchers noted last year that countries with sustained measles control have now demonstrated that measles specific antibodies decline with time since vaccination and helplessly concluded that the implications are unclear Other notoriously ineffective vaccines These phenomena do not apply just to measles vaccination but to many other types of vaccines as well As described by Children s Health Defense previously flu shots which are

on Italian Facebook by misapplying a nineteenth century law of chemistry called Avogadro s number Silvestri misinterpreted Avogadro s law which applies only to gases and cannot calculate nanoparticle

aware that aluminum adjuvants in vaccines harm their meat had enough clout to successfully lobby for uncontaminated veterinary vaccines One of the study s most sobering findings was the detection of organic inorganic composites that represent a nano bio interaction between the inorganic particulate matter and the organic protein vaccine components Gatti and Montanari believe that the immune system is permanently damaged by these composite particles which constitute a bigger sized compound that is not biodegradable and can induce adverse effects including both immediate and deferred autoimmune problems The Questions We Should Be Asking Dr Gatti has considered several hypotheses about the origins of the vaccine contamination including shoddy line protocols in the manufacturing process According to Gatti The facilities need to be really clean to ensure that dust and pollutants do not find their way into the vaccines If the labs do not have proper filtration then this kind of contamination is very possible And unfortunately there are no regulations requiring manufacturers to do this kind of quality control even though the manufacturers know that there is something wrong In short the manufacturers see no need to spend more money on quality control Gatti and Montanari see an urgent need for more studies of the association between the debris and vaccine related adverse events We still don t know whether the kinds of adverse events that result from vaccines are the result of the aluminum adjuvants or the nano bio interactions or something else That is why it is so important to study the effects of the nano bio materials inside the blood and body Exposure via injection is known to induce toxicity reactions as compared to inhalation or ingestion A study in mice found that exposure route was a crucial factor influencing toxicity and that orally administered compounds exhibited a decrease of toxicity as compared with injection route Scientists agree that

Another point is that the barrage of toxic adjuvants and ingredients in vaccines including aluminum and thimerosal formaldehyde antibiotics and adjuvant systems involving squalene and polysorbate 80 have a synergistic action thus enhancing their aggressive potential Toxicologists know that with toxins one plus one rarely equals two but in Dr Gatti s words always a higher number Finally Dr Gatti observes that the contaminants might not be homogenously distributed within a given batch of vaccines For example the bottom of the batch might be more contaminated than the top which could explain why some people don t have reactions and other people do Drs Gatti and Montanari outline a number of research topics that should form the basis of serious efforts to improve vaccine safety

Elimination of Mercury From Thimerosal Containing Vaccines By Children s Health Defense Team Link copied To the editor In a study in The Lancet Pichichero et al 1 argued that ethylmercury administered to infants through vaccines is eliminated rapidly from the blood and effectively excreted in stool Our analysis of this data combined with a more recent analysis2 of mercury excretion in baby hair suggests a more worrisome interpretation one that offers support for the hypothesis3 linking early mercury exposures with autism Our calculations suggest that Pichichero et al overstated the significance of their excretion findings Although their data support a rapid rate of ethylmercury elimination from blood instead of similarly rapid stool elimination their findings demonstrate slow stool excretion in many infants suggesting that significant amounts of ethylmercury from vaccines may be retained in infant tissue Most methyl mercury is eliminated from the body through stool and ethyl mercury from vaccines most likely follows the same path Both mercury species must pass out of the blood to allow excretion in feces or in lesser amounts hair 4 Nevertheless elimination from blood also allows for mercury transport into tissue without prompt excretion Our analysis of mercury excretion in autistic and control baby hair demonstrated that although mercury was excreted at high rates in hair of normal infants hair of autistic infants contained very little mercury only 0 47 mcg g versus 3 63 mcg g in controls This finding raises the possibility of increased mercury retention in the tissue of autistic infants who also had higher rates of prenatal mercury exposure Pichichero et al provide data specific to infant mercury excretion through feces They measured mercury concentrations in stool of 22 normal infants exposed to thimerosal in vaccines ages two and six months and found a range of 23 141 nanograms of mercury per gram of stool dry weight The authors interpreted these levels mere parts per billion as positive evidence of mercury elimination But these mercury concentrations are extremely low not nearly enough to allow rapid excretion Infant dry weight stool volumes have been measured at between 1 3 grams per kilogram kg per day 5 Based on the 50th percentile weight progression from 3 5 8 kg in the zero six month period infant stool volumes may be expected to range from 6 18 grams dry weight per day Taking the stool concentration range for mercury from Pichichero et al we calculated the time required for an infant to excrete the

Gupta Flu Misinformation and Coronavirus Fears My Letter to Dr Sanjay Gupta By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied CHD note this article was originally published on April 16 2020 Dear Sanjay Last week your CNN producer Matthew Reynard notified me that CNN is featuring me in a documentary about vaccine misinformation As usual Mr Reynard did not point out a single factual assertion by me that was incorrect I carefully source all of my statements about vaccines to government databases or peer reviewed publications CNN uses the term vaccine misinformation as a euphemism for any statement that departs from the Government Pharma orthodoxy that all vaccines are safe necessary and effective for all people I respectfully point out that CNN and particularly you Sanjay are today among the most prolific broadcasters of vaccine misinformation I have always admired you Sanjay Your obvious talents aside you seem to be genuinely compassionate and to value integrity Earlier in your career you showed a courageous willingness to challenge Big Pharma s vaccine orthodoxies However I respectfully point out that CNN and particularly you Sanjay are today among the most prolific broadcasters of vaccine misinformation Over the last several years I cannot recall seeing a single substantial CNN segment on vaccines that did not include easily verified factual misstatements CNN s recent special Pandemic was a showcase of erroneous assertions about the flu vaccine Since I don t like to think that you deliberately mislead the public particularly about critical public health choices I have taken the time to point out some of your most frequent errors I hope you will take time to read this This critique has special relevance during the current coronavirus crisis not to mention its important implications for the roles of government and press in a democracy CNN and other media outlets treat CDC NIH and WHO pronouncements as infallible truths In fact regulatory capture has made these agencies subsidiaries of Big Pharma and the lies that CDC has been telling us about flu are now muddying the debate over coronavirus Furthermore of the mere 257 cases that could reasonably be blamed on the flu in CDC s mortality data only 7 percent were laboratory confirmed cases of influenza 1 CNN assertion In your annual flu shot promotions you routinely parrot CDC s estimates of overall

deliberately conflating flu deaths with pneumonia deaths This device is deceitful since most of these fatalities are unrelated to the flu and therefore impervious to flu vaccines In 2005 the British Medical Journal BMJ Editor Dr Peter Doshi published a comprehensive rebuke of CDC s annual ritual of exaggerating flu mortalities entitled Dissecting CDC s Deception Are US Flu Death Figures More PR

reported pneumonia and influenza deaths in 2001 at 62 034 Yet less than half of one percent of those were actually attributed to influenza Furthermore of the mere 257 cases that could reasonably be blamed on the flu in CDC s mortality data only 7 percent were laboratory confirmed cases of influenza That s 18 lab confirmed influenza cases out of 62 034 pneumonia and influenza deaths or just 0 03 percent according to HHS s own National Center for Health Statistics NCHS Subtracting pneumonia the true number of influenza associated deaths from 1979 to 2002 averaged 1 348 according to the NCHS data CNN routinely reports figures forty times this number Dr Doshi charges the CDC with deliberately lying about annual flu deaths to work in manufacturers interest by conducting campaigns to increase flu vaccination He warns that by arbitrarily linking flu with pneumonia current data are statistically biased By faithfully parroting CDC inflated numbers with no due diligence CNN has made itself complicit in this annual charade making it difficult now to accurately assess the relative risk of COVID 19 as compared to flu and therefore rationally measure an appropriate response 2010 meta

a dangerous proposition according to California Institute of Technology Professor Paul Patterson a neuroscientists whose research has included immune activation during pregnancy In his research Dr Patterson reported that any immune activation during pregnancy whether from an infection or a vaccine can cause damage in the developing fetal brain and an increase risk of autism In 2008 Scientific American Mind quoted Patterson criticizing the CDC s policy of administering flu vaccines during pregnancy I don t think they have considered this risk he said In fact I know they have not considered this risk Patterson elaborated If you take it seriously and vaccinate everybody then what is going to happen Researchers cannot yet predict how often a prenatal immune response might lead to fetal brain damage but even if it happens less than 1 percent of the time vaccinating an entire population of pregnant women could affect thousands of children Research by Goldman in 2013 documented a 11 fold increase in fetal loss reports following the 2009 2010 pandemic flu season when pregnant women received two flu vaccines during pregnancy the seasonal flu vaccine and the H1N1 vaccine In a study

rates for older Americans significantly increased in the 80s and 90s during the same time that influenza vaccination rates for elderly Americans dramatically increased In a 2013 BMJ commentary Dr

significantly lessened risk from influenza and also a higher risk of infection from non influenza viruses Furthermore the flu vaccine depletes capacity to fight off future flu infections In April 2010 a study by Skowronek et al published in the journal PLoS Medicine reported the unexpected finding from four epidemiologic studies in Canada that receipt of the influenza vaccine for the 2008 2009 season while apparently effective in reducing the risk of illness due to the seasonal flu was associated with an increased risk of illness due to the pandemic influenza A H1N1 swine flu virus during the spring and summer of 2009 The scientists suggested that this finding could be due to the difference in the way the vaccine affects the immune system compared with natural infection Under this hypothesis repeated vaccination effectively blocks the more robust complex and cross protective immunity afforded by prior infection When unvaccinated people are infected with the seasonal influenza virus they often develop a robust cell mediated immunity that not only protects against that strain of the virus but is also cross protective against other strains People who ve annually received the influenza vaccine on the other hand may have lost multiple opportunities for infection induced cross immunity This is because the vaccine is designed to stimulate a strong antibody response or humoral immunity but does not confer the same kind of robust cell mediated immunity as natural infection NIH researchers in their 2005 study also acknowledged the superior effectiveness of naturally acquired immunity at reducing mortality pointing out that senior citizens who contracted the H3N2 influenza pandemic infection demonstrated a robust immunity in subsequent flu seasons when compared to vaccinated individuals The sharp decline in influenza related deaths among people aged 65 to 74 years in the years immediately after the 1968 flu pandemic was most likely due to the acquisition of natural immunity to these viruses from natural infections Another study published in 2011 in the Journal of Virology confirmed that annual influenza vaccination indeed hampers the development of a

following influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period The authors recommended that potential mechanisms for this association warrant further investigation While most studies have looked at only one or two flu seasons a CDC funded study published in September 2014 in Clinical Infectious Diseases considered the long term effects of repeated annual vaccination by looking at five years of vaccination data The CDC researchers found that the more that people had been vaccinated in prior years the less effective the vaccine is at preventing the most recent season s dominant H3N2 virus As they put it vaccine induced protection was greatest for individuals not vaccinated during the prior 5 years Essentially the immune system remembers the original infection and puts out a rapid defense against it at the expense of developing a new but more appropriate response specifically to the currently infecting strain The CDC scientists warned that their data raises relevant questions about the potential interference of repeated annual influenza vaccination and possible residual protection from previous season vaccination the authors called for further studies 10

the data demonstrated a 20 percent higher risk of an autism spectrum disorder among children of mothers receiving the flu vaccine during the first trimester That risk was statistically significant The P value 01 indicates a 99 percent likelihood that the result isn t due to chance However after completing this analysis the authors made a series of adjustments that have drawn criticism from other scientists Most controversial was their questionable decision to apply a statistical device called the Bonferroni Correction to their data Statisticians use the Bonferroni Correction in very specific circumstances where they seek to reduce the chance for false positives in calculations involving multiple comparisons The impact of the Bonferroni Correction is nearly always conservative it dampens signals in data sets In doing so it creates the risk of missing true associations When applied to the first trimester flu vaccine dataset the Bonferroni Correction reduced the significance of the association from 99 percent to 90 percent Despite the fact that the adjusted result was still considered marginally statistically significant the authors then made a second dodgy judgment by declaring that this association could be due to chance These sweeping decisions allowed the authors to arrive at the questionable conclusion that There was a suggestion of increased ASD risk among children whose mothers received influenza vaccinations early in pregnancy first trimester although the association was insignificant after statistical correction for multiple comparisons The researchers summed up with an acknowledgement of the uncertainty of their conclusion We believe that additional studies are warranted to further evaluate any potential associations between first trimester maternal

Lanphear describes himself as a proponent of childhood vaccines It is likely that the authors like me were biased toward not showing influenza vaccination was associated with ASD he said That is because many of us in public health are convinced of the benefits of childhood vaccines that is we are biased towards vaccines providing benefits Because we are biased toward vaccinations we might be willing to overlook what appears to be a small association maybe even without being conscious that we are doing it Before the authors applied the Bonferroni Lanphear said there was a statistically significant association of influenza vaccination during the first trimester with the development of ASD If you want to be cautious or skeptical and conclude that first trimester influenza vaccination was not associated with the development of ASD the Bonferroni correction allows you to do that If on the other hand you want to be careful not to miss a possible association of influenza vaccination and the development of ASD you can also reach the conclusion based on this study that first trimester influenza vaccination was associated with a 10 percent to 20 percent increase in the risk of ASD Critics of the study suggest that the authors used a number of other devices that may have reduced the autism signal even before applying the Bonferroni Dr Brian Hooker a biologist at Simpson

the Unites States The California EPA has proclaimed thimerosal as a human reproductive toxicant The agency stated that the scientific evidence that thimerosal is a reproductive toxicant is clear and

administered to infants children and pregnant women in the Unites States The California EPA has proclaimed thimerosal as a human reproductive toxicant The agency stated that the scientific evidence that thimerosal is a reproductive toxicant is clear and voluminous and includes severe mental retardation or malformations in human offspring who were poisoned when their mothers were exposed to ethyl mercury or thimerosal while pregnant Under the CDC s flu vaccine recommendations average sized pregnant women could be exposed to organic mercury that exceeds the EPA safety guidelines by a factor of 3 5 The fetus could potentially be exposed to a dose of mercury 200 times the EPA guidelines The authors of the JAMA Pediatrics article have not responded to our questions about whether they had the data to perform a separate analysis of thimerosal containing vaccine exposures Dr Lanphear speculates that since the authors had the children s medical records they probably had the ability to identify the particular vaccine by lot number and differentiate the mothers who had received a thimerosal vaccine from those who had not Dr Hooker agreed The authors apparently elected not to separate out the mothers who received non thimerosal flu shots during pregnancy from those who received thimerosal containing flu shots he said This decision is troubling because if most of the autism cases were found in children who did receive thimerosal exposure in utero we would have valuable information about the risk long suspected of giving mercury vaccines to pregnant women Is the Risk of Autism Worth the Benefits Received from a Flu Shot Zerbo and his co authors reported that If influenza vaccination during the first trimester of pregnancy causes ASD our results suggest that it would amount to 4 additional ASD cases for every 1 000 women vaccinated about 4 000 children annually by our calculations So does the flu shot yield net benefits great enough to make up for the 4 000 added cases of autism CDC s rationale for recommending the flu shot for all pregnant women during any stage of pregnancy arose from concerns that the growing fetus can reduce the mother s lung capacity during pregnancy placing her at an increased risk for pneumonia or other complications if she were to develop the flu However research has not supported these concerns The largest study to date in approximately 50 000 pregnant women over five flu seasons found no difference in the risk for developing influenza illness among those who received the vaccine during pregnancy compared to those who did not Infants born to mothers who received the vaccine also had the same risk for influenza or pneumonia as infants born to unvaccinated women The authors reported that hospitalization admissions

pregnancy is troubling because flu vaccines have never been subjected to appropriate safety testing In 1998 a Food and Drug Administration working group recommended that preclinical reproductive toxicity studies should be conducted for every vaccine indicated for immunization of pregnant women These toxicity studies have never been performed The vast majority of flu vaccines administered to pregnant women are labeled as pregnancy category C drugs This is the information provided by the manufacturers of a popular influenza vaccine Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Fluzone It is also not known whether Fluzone can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity Fluzone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed Accumulating research indicates that flu vaccines administered during pregnancy can induce an inflammatory response in the mother that can cross the placenta and potentially cause harm to the fetal brain during critical windows of neurodevelopment including harm associated with autism A study by Christian in 2011 found an increase in two inflammatory markers C reactive protein CRP and tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF α in pregnant women given a seasonal flu vaccine Increases in these inflammatory compounds indicate a significant level of inflammation which was identified during the first two days following vaccination There is good reason to be alarmed by these findings A 2014 study by Alan Brown MD and his colleagues of more than 1 2 million pregnant women found that elevations in CRP the same marker of inflammation that increases after flu vaccination are associated with a 43 percent greater risk of having a child with autism An earlier study by Lisa Christian PhD and her colleagues found that pregnant women suffering from depression developed a more marked inflammatory response to influenza vaccines than women who did not have symptoms of depression Researchers found that depression during pregnancy has also been associated with an increased risk of autism The CDC s current recommendation that all pregnant women receive flu shots is a

If you take it seriously and vaccinate everybody then what is going to happen Researchers cannot yet predict how often a prenatal immune response might lead to fetal brain damage but even if it happens less than 1 percent of the time vaccinating an entire population of pregnant women could affect thousands of children In a study published in the British Medical Journal in 2014 Giuseppe Traversa and colleagues assessed maternal fetal and neonatal outcomes of women given the influenza A H1N1 vaccine The outcomes of more than 86 000 pregnancies revealed that vaccinated women had significantly higher rates of gestational diabetes and eclampsia Eclampsia is the development of seizures in a woman with severe toxemia a condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein loss in the urine Eclampsia is fatal in 2 percent of women and can result in long term health problems in those who survive Fetal complications including neurological damage and death are also common Both gestational diabetes and eclampsia are related to inflammation and immune dysregulation making the connection to the immune stimulation of the flu vaccine very plausible Research by Goldman in 2013 documented a 11 fold increase in fetal loss reports following the 2009 2010 pandemic flu season when pregnant women received two flu vaccines during pregnancy the seasonal flu vaccine and the

Inappropriate I asked Sander Greenland by email to explain the Bonferroni Correction in the context of the flu study Here is what he wrote back Bonferroni is a multiple comparisons adjustment for reducing the risk of false positive findings when engaging in statistical fishing expeditions among many unrelated associations It is appropriate only when any of the following are true those associations are equally important likely and expected to be zero absent based on external a priori considerations the cost of any false negative is minor compared to the cost of any false positive and the associations are independent unrelated to one another In return for the reduce risk of false positives multiple comparison adjustments like Bonferroni dramatically increase the risk of missing real associations false negatives So even if there were no other objections Bonferroni as used by the authors with N 8 is simply erroneous Using Bonferroni in this study was wrong for several other reasons First the authors specifically wanted to test if influenza vaccination during pregnancy was a risk factor for ASD this was not a fishing expedition as assumed by Bonferroni violating a above Second the overall association of influenza vaccination anytime during pregnancy depends completely on the associations within each trimester so violates the Bonferroni assumption of independence violates c above Third the first trimester is expected to be the period of greatest vulnerability for the developing fetus and so is a pre specified hypothesis In other words before the study the stakeholders expected a priori an association which also violates a Finally we need to be confident that vaccines are safe the costs of wrongly concluding that the influenza vaccine is safe rivals the costs of wrongly concluding that it causes harm which violates the Bonferroni assumption b that wrongly concluding harm is more costly than wrongly concluding safety", "chunk_id":

By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied Dec 4 to Dec 10 is National Influenza Vaccination Week and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC is pushing hard for children and adults to get immunized against the flu Colorful advertisements warn us to get our flu shots from the walls of our doctor s offices pharmacies and grocery stores According to the CDC getting the flu shot is a matter of life and death Flu shots we are told save lives At the same time government officials have been lamenting that influenza vaccination rates are concerningly low in the U S and seem to be falling Fewer than 50 percent of Americans currently heed the government s call to get their annual flu shot Part of the reluctance seems to stem from questions about efficacy raised by data coming directly from the CDC Why get a flu shot if the flu shot does not work In February the CDC revealed that the 2014 2015 influenza vaccine had an efficacy rate of only 19 percent If that was not bad enough in June the CDC s committee that advises on immunization practices announced that nasal spray flu vaccines should not be used in the 2016 2017 flu season because in the CDC s own words no protective benefit could be measured from taking them While this disappointing news may have come as a surprise to parents who had been told by their doctors that the nasal spray vaccines were safe and effective it was not a surprise to health safety advocates and environmentalists who have raised scientifically based efficacy concerns for nearly as long as the government has been promoting flu vaccines Indeed numerous peer reviewed scientific studies have shown that the flu vaccine is not effective either at reducing the flu or reducing flu related deaths When a team of researchers at the National Institutes of Health compared flu vaccine rates with influenza related illness over a 19 year period from 1980 to 1999 they found that deaths from the flu increased as vaccination rates increased In conclusion the increase in elderly influenza vaccination coverage in the U S after 1980 was not accompanied by a decline in influenza related mortality the researchers concluded A study led by a researcher at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and published in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine found that increasing vaccination coverage did not correlate

Cochrane Collaboration s exhaustive reviews of existing medical literature are considered the gold standard in unbiased scientific research In 2010 when the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the published literature on the efficacy of influenza vaccination in preventing the flu in healthy adults researchers noted that industry sponsored studies were much more likely to report conclusions favorable to influenza vaccines than studies funded from public sources and that reliable evidence on influenza vaccine is thin but there is evidence of widespread manipulation of conclusions A Cochrane review of the use of the flu vaccine in healthy adults found that influenza vaccination shows no appreciable effect on working days lost or hospitalization The quality of the evidence in favor of the flu vaccine is so poor that Tom Jefferson a British epidemiologist based in Rome who was then head of the Vaccine Field Group at the Cochrane Collaboration told two journalists writing

recommendation just doesn t make sense CDC data suggest flu shots may take more lives than they save Not only are there serious questions about the efficacy of the flu vaccine there is evidence to suggest that getting the vaccine every year may cause damage to the immune system In a peer reviewed study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in March 2016 a team of Canadian researchers found that people who were vaccinated against the flu three years in a row were actually at higher risk of being infected with the flu Also troubling is the number of adverse reactions reported to the CDC after flu vaccination The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System known as VAERS allows doctors and individual patients to report poor health outcomes following vaccination CDC uses VAERS to track analyze and make vaccine safety information available to the public Though it is estimated that the majority of adverse reactions even serious ones are not reported to VAERS scientists consider it a useful tool for detecting signals about possible adverse reactions to certain vaccines About 13 percent of the some 30 000 post vaccine events reported to VAERS are considered serious associated with disability hospitalization life threatening illness or death according to the U S Department of Health and Human Services Data culled from VAERS by Stephanie Seneff PhD a senior research scientist at MIT reveals a mortality rate following the flu vaccine that public health officials might find surprising 560 deaths attributed to flu shots between 1990 and 2016 But VAERS data grossly underestimates the actual number of adverse outcomes as with any passive reporting system VAERS receives reports for only a small fraction of actual adverse events The degree of underreporting varies widely according to the government website A 2013 article in Neurology Clinical Practice calculated that only between 1 and 10 percent of adverse reactions are actually reported by physicians Applying that

include Guillain Barré a debilitating illness in which the immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system as well as post vaccination shoulder related injury SIRVA which can cause paralysis and chronic pain and may necessitate surgery How many people actually die from the flu The CDC claims that in a bad flu season as many as 36 000 people will die from the flu and some 200 000 will be hospitalized Those scary numbers motivate people to get the flu vaccine But are they accurate Apparently not according to the CDC which admits that it has no method to accurately estimate annual flu deaths States are not required to report deaths from influenza in people older than eighteen In order to inflate the number of flu complications and deaths the CDC includes influenza like illnesses pneumonia and even heart problems brain swelling and sepsis By lumping deaths from pneumonia a bacterial infection together with deaths from influenza a viral infection the threat from the flu an uncomfortable but short lived illness among otherwise healthy children and adults can be exaggerated enough to justify calls for universal vaccination As it turns out only one third of people with influenza like illnesses actually test positive for an influenza virus against which vaccines are designed to protect This means that any estimate of flu deaths is inflated by at least two thirds If the CDC tabulated deaths from the flu based on death certificates there would be very few even among older adults Thimerosal in flu vaccines One of the greatest concerns with influenza vaccines is that they contain thimerosal a mercury based preservative According to the CDC 48 million of the 168 million flu vaccines available this year contain mega doses of thimerosal In 2003 the U S Food and Drug Administration acting director for the Office of Vaccines Research and Review William Egan PhD admitted in testimony before a Congressional committee that thimerosal which was grandfathered into

and vaccine companies met to discuss what they described as theoretical concerns about the risks of thimerosal containing vaccines The lead Simpsonwood speaker Thomas Tom Verstraeten was a junior

neurodevelopmental disorders in children His earliest tables never reported or published but obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the autism advocacy organization SafeMinds demonstrated striking and statistically significant effects supportive of a causal relationship between vaccine mercury exposure and childhood developmental disorders especially autism These initial analyses dubbed Generation Zero by SafeMinds found consistently elevated risks 2 11 times higher in the high exposure groups compared to the zero exposure group with the strongest effects for the highest levels of mercury exposure at the earliest time of exposure Between February 2000 and November 2003 Verstraeten and his CDC supervisors produced four further rounds of analyses that with each

thimerosal is or was harmful but at least I feel we should use sound scientific argumentation and not let our standards be dictated by our desire to disprove an unpleasant theory Verstraeten by then working at GlaxoSmithKline published the thimerosal data in Pediatrics in 2003 The publication used the later generations of analyses featuring reworked exclusion criteria exposure measures and statistical models However Verstraeten contested the notion that he or the CDC had watered down the original results In a letter to the editor of Pediatrics in 2004 he described the study s results as neutral stating The bottom line is and has always been the same an association between thimerosal and neurological outcomes could neither be confirmed nor refuted and therefore more study is required

other CDC researchers with Director Julie Gerberding who later became a top Merck executive at the helm proceeded to hastily publish a handful of poorly designed epidemiological studies to shore up the Simpsonwood consensus Authored by industry funded scientists the studies examined a single neurodevelopmental outcome autism and seemingly absolved thimerosal of any responsibility for causing it Most of the studies intentionally used data from non U S populations with far lower exposure to thimerosal including Sweden the Danish general population Danish psychiatric departments and the UK This made it easier to disguise potential associations between thimerosal and neurodevelopmental disorders Despite many solid critiques of these and other gerrymandered studies the CDC continues to trot them out as evidence of thimerosal s putative safety to this day Although the CDC claims that it tries to accommodate requests from independent investigators to use VSD data in practice AHIP s private

favorable studies using VSD data often comparing one vaccine with another to ensure a result of no significantly elevated risk in the group of interest In 2001 one year after Verstraeten shared his VSD based thimerosal findings at Simpsonwood the CDC outsourced VSD management and coordination to a private company America s Health Insurance Plans AHIP giving AHIP responsibility for maintaining

the Appropriations Committee The bill would eliminate the majority of vaccine medical exemptions that protect medically fragile children California law currently supports these exemptions More than 600 Californians showed up to give public comment in opposition of SB276 The hearing lasted five hours Fewer than 60 people showed up to give public comment in support only one in a million California

pretense of addressing measles cases in 2019 However there have only been 11 measles cases among California s 9 million children There have been 51 cases of the measles across California wrote the Assembly Health Committee in a post hearing statement It is worthwhile to note that 40 of these cases were in adults In other words only one in a million California children have contracted and

a sufficient proportion of a population is immune to an infectious disease through vaccination and or prior illness to make its spread from person to person unlikely In the hearing Pan stated that the denominator is not the entire state of California It is certain schools The CDC makes no mention of a community being defined as a school If each school is an isolated community of germs Pan may want to talk about building walls His statement presumes children don t ever interact with children from other schools and ignores the fact that these children have adult teachers and staff They also have parents Adults are unlikely to have had the ten vaccines required for children to attend school Paradoxically the CDC blames travelers from foreign countries for bringing this year s measles cases So

serum sickness Further vaccination puts him in harm s way Clearly the CDC guidelines are too narrow stated the California Medical Board CMB in a letter written to Senator Pan the author of SB276 Health Committee member McCarty concurred with the CMB in the hearing giving Pan one more chance to address the narrow list of medical exemptions If SB276 is signed into law the only ways to protect a biologically diverse child would be to home school or embark on independent study Since that is impossible for most two income families many parents said they would leave California if SB276 passes

include conditions widely known to pre dispose children to vaccine injury prior vaccine injuries such as Guillain Barré paralysis autoimmune diseases neurological disorders asthma seizures tics and

be granted if they meet criteria established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP or American Academy of Pediatricians AAP The addition of ACIP and AAP criteria may appear to broaden exemptions however if you Google ACIP contraindications to vaccination you get the CDC site which cites ACIP In other words ACIP and CDC are one and the same The AAP only has one contraindication which is also superfluous to CDC contraindications a history of anaphylaxis life threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose or to a vaccine component If anyone listens carefully to Senator Pan when speaking he avoids vaccine injury lexicon To him vaccine injuries are events He continues to use the word reaction instead of the more accurate term injury to imply that new onset conditions whether permanent or severe are temporary and mild He even said in the hearing if a prolonged seizure occurred more than 6 days after a vaccine there would be no risk to that child from further vaccination if there is no documentation for that family member for example if the relative has died or is alive with inaccessible medical records or if that family member chooses to be

Senator Pan is not so generous with his personal definition of family history He refuses to define family history leaving everyone guessing as to what the term would or would not include However he is very clear on a few conditions that in his judgment would be disallowed First family history only counts if it looks real to Senator Pan He said if someone has a first degree relative with a history

Pan stated that the public health officer will give the benefit of the doubt to children if their event could have been caused by a prior vaccine If we don t know we want to give the latitude However Pan later stated If we know another cause for the events then there would be no medical exemption Senator Pan also said that autism and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome SIDS were not caused by vaccines These comments were over the top for parents whose child died or started exhibiting symptoms of autism after a vaccine Unable to remain quiet in the face of more false statements from Senator Pan the gallery of parents fell into a frenzy of hisses that drew ire from Chairman Wood He noted the outburst but failed to comprehend why parents were upset by Pan s callous comments If you recall the film

Deaths With Semantic Sleight of Hand By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied Vaccine scientists and the public health community cautiously and occasionally will admit that vaccines can cause adverse reactions just like any other medication or biological product Although experts are less willing to openly disclose the fact that adverse reactions can and do include death one has only to look at reports to the U S Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS to see that mortality is a possible outcome From 1990 through 2010 for example VAERS received 1 881 reports of infant deaths following vaccination representing 4 8 of the adverse events reported for infants over the 20 year period Moreover analysts acknowledge that VAERS as a passive surveillance system is subject to substantial underreporting A federal government report from 2010 affirms that VAERS captures only about 1 of vaccine adverse reports On the international frontier the public health community with the World Health Organization WHO in the vanguard previously used a six category framework to investigate and categorize serious adverse events following immunization AEFI including death Guided by this tool public health teams examined temporal criteria and possible alternative explanations to determine whether the relationship of an AEFI to vaccine administration was very likely certain probable possible unlikely unrelated or unclassifiable In 2013 the WHO s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety discarded the prior tool ostensibly because users sometimes found it difficult to differentiate between probable possible and unlikely categories The WHO enlisted vaccine experts to develop a simpler algorithm that would be more readily applicable to vaccines The resulting four category system now invites public health teams to classify an AEFI as either consistent inconsistent or indeterminate with a vaccine related causal association or as unclassifiable Despite the patina of logic suggested by the use of an algorithm the final outcome of the case investigation depends on the personal judgment of the assessor emphasis added especially according to the tool s proponents when the process yields answers that are both consistent and inconsistent with a causal association to immunization In a 2017 letter in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics Drs Jacob Puliyel an India based pediatrician and member of India s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization and Anant Phadke an executive member of the All India Drug Action Network raise important questions about the revised tool They describe an Orwellian Catch 22 situation wherein it is nearly impossible to categorize post vaccine deaths as vaccine related This is because the revised algorithm does not allow users to classify an AEFI as consistent with causal association with vaccine unless there is evidence showing that the vaccine caused a statistically significant increase in deaths during Phase III

licensure become coincidental or unclassifiable Drs Puliyel and Phadke describe what happened in India when the country s National AEFI committee assessed 132 serious AEFI cases reported between 2012 and 2016 including 54 infant deaths that followed administration of a pentavalent all in one vaccine intended to protect recipients against diphtheria tetanus pertussis hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b infections For babies who survived hospitalization the committee classified three fifths 47 78 of the AEFI as causally related to vaccines with 47 of the incidents viewed as product related and 13 as error related but they rated nearly all 52 54 of the deaths as either coincidental 54 or unclassifiable 43 despite mounting evidence that pentavalent and hexavalent vaccines are increasing the risk of sudden unexpected death in infants doctors who naïvely accept biased reports on vaccine safety are losing the trust of the public and in the process endangering public health The absurdity and negligence inherent in the ultimately subjective WHO checklist have not escaped the attention of others in India and beyond In a series of comments published in the journal Vaccine in response to the 2013 publication of the revised tool commenters issued the following scathing remarks Even if a healthy child dies within minutes following vaccination and there is no alternate explanation for the AEFI even then the powers that be could easily declare that death as coincidental and not due to the vaccine thanks to the new AEFI This is dangerous science Amongst the 20 items of their checklist no less than 15 75 are devoted to refute a vaccine induced causality emphasis in original After all and as the authors confess with an astonishing ingenuousness the main point is to maintain public confidence in immunization programs People understand that there are no true coincidences only events that have been made to appear to be coincidental by either a genuine lack of

appeared the editors eagerly promoted it by making it free By early December 2019 the number of downloads reached close to 24 000 On October 23 2019 I received an email stating that academic publisher

that each observation identifies whether a woman received the HPV vaccine and whether that woman had ever been pregnant To confirm that overall trends were not influencing the results I added time trends to the statistical analysis and the results remained Women who received the HPV vaccine were less likely to have ever been pregnant Misinterpretation of Data Extrapolation of results that the number of pregnancies due to the vaccine are unfounded and supported by findings from studies by an author that uses VAERS database that relies on self reported adverse events without verification makes the results dubious The data I use come from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES which is a non random survey of people living in the United States By design each

alike Modern day scientists have been amassing evidence of mercury s toxicity for decades with a growing focus in recent years on the metal s association with neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder ASD A new review article in the multidisciplinary journal Environmental Research pulls together a wide body of literature with the aim of summing up current research and emerging trends in mercury toxicology Geir Bjørklund the study s lead author is the founder of Norway s non profit Council for Nutritional and Environmental Medicine and has published prolifically on topics related to heavy metals autoimmune disorders and ASD Multiple avenues of exposure Exposure to mercurial compounds remains widespread despite feeble attempts to ban some uses Bjørklund et al s review covers all three categories of mercury elemental organic and inorganic Exposure to volatile elemental mercury can come about as a result of occupational contact or vapor from dental amalgam fillings Organic mercury the most frequent form of exposure according to Bjørklund and colleagues exists as methylmercury in fish and ethylmercury in the vaccine preservative thimerosal Coal fired power plants send inorganic mercury into the environment where the toxic metal works its way up the marine food chain Because mercury plays no constructive metabolic role whatsoever humans have not evolved effective mechanisms to excrete it Children with ASD have a particularly hard time detoxifying and excreting mercury Interconversion between various forms of mercury also occurs For example elemental and organic mercury can cross the blood brain barrier and bioaccumulate in the form of inorganic mercury Studies also have described mixed exposure in the brain to both organic and inorganic mercury compounds Because mercury plays no constructive metabolic role whatsoever humans have not evolved effective mechanisms to excrete it Children with ASD have a particularly hard time detoxifying and excreting mercury Multiple mechanisms of toxicity Mercury exerts toxicity through a number of different mechanisms and has effects at both the molecular and cellular levels For their purposes

discussion of the essential trace element selenium which plays an important antioxidant role among other functions The authors note that mercury is highly selenophilic binding to selenium with an extraordinarily high affinity when compared with the affinity for sulfur The welcome implication spelled out by the authors which has been known to researchers for nearly half a century is that selenium has a high capability to reduce the toxicity of mercury compounds The authors list several mechanisms whereby selenium can minimize mercury induced toxicity such as by improving mercury s excretion or sequestration and strengthening antioxidative activity Autism researchers have identified a significant elevation of mercury together with a significant decrease in the selenium levels in red blood cells of patients with ASD when compared to healthy controls These researchers agree that selenium has an important role to play in reducing mercury toxicity in ASD patients Translating research into action It has been over a decade and a half since a seminal publication in Medical Hypotheses described autism as a novel form of mercury poisoning and showed how every major characteristic of autism has been exhibited in cases of documented mercury poisoning Ten years later Kern and colleagues published a detailed consideration of parallels between mercury intoxication and the brain pathology in autism in Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis A 2017 publication in Molecular Neurobiology by autism expert Dr Richard Frye and others reviews associations between mercury exposure and ASD subtypes even at doses well below the current reference levels considered to be safe Thus Bjørklund and coauthors are far from alone in synthesizing the evidence base and drawing attention to the global public health epidemics of mercury toxicity and autism The CDC authors concluded that there are many commonalities and similarities in the mechanisms of toxic action of methylmercury and ethylmercury particularly regarding their association with neurotoxicity and neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD Last year CDC toxicologists published a comprehensive review that specifically focused on the two forms of organic mercury The CDC authors concluded that there are many commonalities and similarities in the mechanisms of toxic action of methylmercury and ethylmercury particularly regarding their association with neurotoxicity and neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD Both forms of organic mercury cause DNA damage or impair DNA synthesis affect cell

Link copied This week I am publishing in book form the world s first comprehensive review of the scientific literature relevant to the issue of whether thimerosal a mercury based vaccine preservative is safe to inject into humans I assembled this book Thimerosal Let the Science Speak with the help of Dr Mark Hyman New York Times best selling author of The Blood Sugar Solution and medical director of the UltraWellness Center and public health expert Dr Martha Herbert assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and pediatric neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital We mobilized a crack team of nearly a dozen independent scientists writers and researchers who spent close to three years scouring the medical literature to gather and digest nearly every published peer reviewed article on thimerosal safety 1 They managed to collect hundreds of relevant articles yet were unable to find even a single publication credibly demonstrating thimerosal s safety A preponderance of toxicological pharmacological epidemiological animal and human studies implicate thimerosal as a threat to human health In fact we feel there is a strong consensus among the many research scientists who have published peer reviewed articles in the field on thimerosal that the chemical should not be injected into children Thimerosal is about half ethylmercury by weight There is debate about the degree of toxicity of ethylmercury compared to the much better studied methylmercury which all agree is a potent neurotoxin and for which the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency have exposure guidelines But that debate is similar to quarreling over whether uranium is less toxic than plutonium They are both toxic The U S Governement s Institute of Medicine performed a comparative analysis and concluded Ethylmercury should be considered equipotent to methylmercury as a developmental neurotoxin Exposure to both should therefore be minimized Nevertheless today we continue to expose millions of babies and pregnant women in this country and elsewhere to ethylmercury via thimerosal meanwhile attempting to shield them from its close cousin methylmercury We first circulated the book to government regulators leading scientists and policy makers beginning in August 2013 We then sat on the book for almost a year while the HHS Health and Human Services and the agency s National Vaccine Program Office along with the FDA and the CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considered the book s contents We met spoke and corresponded with these agencies frequently It was our hope that government officials would take seriously the science that demonstrates thimerosal s neurotoxicity We hoped they would quietly remove thimerosal from the remaining vaccines and other medical products it is in or replace thimerosal with proven safer alternatives such as the preservative 2 phenoxyethanol 2 PE presently used in an inactivated

inactivated polio vaccine We were reluctant to release the book fearing that it might scare people and reduce vaccine coverage The regulators have now made it clear they will not act so we are left with no option but to publish in the hope that a healthy public debate will lead to a credible publicized improvement in vaccine safety and ultimately in vaccine coverage Even prior to the book s release I have been met with a cascade of denunciations from a variety of journalists and columnists Sadly since these comments have come before the book s release it is clear that the journalists have not read the book nor the science behind it documented across hundreds of references In fact most of the criticisms have focused on how thimerosal has been linked to autism That is not the subject of the book nor is that claimed within the book These journalists have summarily rejected the possibility of any evidence of harm before reviewing the actual science or the content of the book It s my hope now that we might move this debate to a higher plane People who advocate for safer vaccines should not be marginalized or denounced as anti vaccine I am fiercely pro vaccine I had all six of my children vaccinated I believe that vaccines have saved the lives of hundreds of millions of humans over the past century and that broad vaccine coverage is critical to public health But I want our vaccines to be as safe as possible Studies show that a major threat to the kind of widespread vaccine coverage needed to protect global health is public doubt about vaccine safety and mistrust of vaccine regulators Certain government officials and overworked journalists dismiss the public s legitimate questions about thimerosal as the fruit of mindless paranoia promulgated by conspiracy theorists On the contrary compelling peer reviewed science from the 1930s on into today supports the popular skepticism regarding thimerosal As we show in Thimerosal Let the Science Speak thimerosal

the counter topical medications 2 There were many dozens of these including products that many of us remember well such as the red skin staining mercurochrome antiseptic ointment The ban was finally implemented in 1998 Ironically shortly after the FDA had first called for the removal of thimerosal from topical application the CDC began dramatically increasing its use in injectable vaccines in the late 1980s and early 1990s Potential mercury exposure from vaccines more than doubled from a historical 100 micrograms to 237 5 micrograms by the age of two years A child in the 1990s could have been exposed to as much as 62 5 micrograms of mercury all at once contained across three different vaccines during a single doctor visit at two four six and or fifteen months of age 3 In 1999 ongoing concern over thimerosal s safety in vaccines finally spurred the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP and the U S Public Health agencies which include the CDC the FDA the National Institutes of Health NIH and the Health Resources and Services Administration HRSA to call for its removal from childhood vaccines as a precautionary measure The final thimerosal containing lots of vaccines did not expire however until 2003 Although thimerosal was phased out in U S pediatric vaccines elsewhere in the world vaccines continue to contain this questionable preservative Just as thimerosal largely left the pediatric vaccine schedule prenatal exposure to it increased though in an insidious and potentially even more dangerous fashion through the flu vaccine In 2002 the CDC began recommending annual flu vaccines for healthy infants between the ages of six and 23 months of age Not long after in 2004 the recommendations were extended to pregnant women in all stages of pregnancy And in 2010 the CDC advised that every American including pregnant women and young children beginning at six months of age get an annual flu shot Many multi dose flu vaccines contain thimerosal American children born today if their parents follow the annual flu shot guideline may receive upwards of 187 5 micrograms of mercury by their eighth birthday Although less than the 237 5 micrograms of potential vaccine mercury exposure by age two back in the 1990s the potential and intentional prenatal exposure has become higher in the past decade than at any time in history The evidence of thimerosal s

thimerosal can cause bodily injury including brain damage The argument is not whether it causes autism which is not clearly proven although this curiously been the focus of recent criticism of the book which no one had read to date The issue is whether thimerosal is a neurotoxin and belongs in any medical products including vaccines Thimerosal has given us not only a public health peril but also a journalistic crisis The most troubling aspect of the thimerosal debate has been a widespread reluctance of science journalists to actually read the scientific literature or to distinguish between established science and the scientific establishment Instead journalists have almost universally adopted the predictable talking points of government regulators and the vaccine industry Dan Schulman wrote a piece for the Columbia Journalism Review blaming journalists fear and laziness for the crisis in a telling expose of this media scandal back in 2005 Schulman wrote Journalists agree that the thimerosal story is one of the most explosive they ve ever encountered Some reporters who have portrayed this as an ongoing scientific controversy have been discouraged by colleagues and their superiors from pursuing the story A reporter for a major media outlet who did not want to be identified for fear of retribution told me that covering the thimerosal controversy had been nearly career ending The reporter has decided against pursuing stories on thimerosal at least for the time being For some reason giving any sort of credence to the side that says there s a legitimate question here I don t know how it becomes this untouchable story I mean that s what we do so I don t understand why this story is more touchy than any story I ve ever done In recent days many respected science writers without ever reading our book or talking to its authors have chosen to vilify me personally as anti science and anti vaccine rather than engaging in an honest thoughtful and

science For 30 years as a litigator and environmental advocate I have fought to make rigorous science the driver of public policy I have fought on behalf of a scientific approach to policy in the global warming arena in the tobacco wars and in my many battles with pesticide and chemical companies with legal skirmishes ranging from the Hudson River to Alaska s Cook Inlet from the West Virginia coalfields to the Louisiana oil patch from the Caribbean island of Vieques to Puget Sound I have fought these battles on issues including acid rain ozone coal ash particulates PCBs lead mercury hydrocarbons pesticides and numerous other poisons that have been the subject of the hundreds of cases I ve argued against polluters and their crooked tobacco scientists and biostitutes For many years I ve been puzzled by the bland and apparently baseless insistence by public health regulators and members of the press that it is safe to inject mercury one of the world s most neurotoxic elements into young children and pregnant women Their knee jerk defense of thimerosal is all the more odd given that most U S vaccine makers have already switched to thimerosal free injections in pediatric vaccines administered to American children Two major vaccine manufacturers even made offers back in 1999 to the CDC to produce completely thimerosal free vaccines in place of the thimerosal preserved vaccines still available at that time after the official recommendation of their removal from the market 4 The CDC declined the offer and instead allowed the childhood vaccines preserved with thimerosal to stick around until their expiry four years later The CDC s refusal to allow or assist in the transition to thimerosal free formulations is baffling We are publishing this book to make that task easier for the agency with regard to the multi dose flu vaccines routinely administered these days some 15 years later We also hope the book will help dissuade the press from accepting the

objective consideration of the scientific literature on this topic demonstrates that contrary to government pronouncements a possible thimerosal autism connection is far from a settled question The fact that this topic is largely unresolved arises in part from the astonishing unwillingness of government agencies to open the treasure trove of vaccine safety data stored in the national Vaccine Safety Datalink database or to encourage legitimate studies exploring the possibility that thimerosal might in some cases contribute to autism causation The role of journalism in a democracy requires that reporters do more than simply broadcast the point of view of the government and corporate officials Science writers who have been grinding it out for decades against anti science flat earthers in the climate change wars should understand that a conscientious journalist cannot report on science simply by polling selected cohorts or government regulators He or she must do the hard work of reading real science and asking provocative questions On June 28 2005 a group of world renowned scientists sent a letter to the New York Times chiding the paper for its practice of marginalizing scientists and others who explored the connection between environmental mercury and brain injury The scientists were led by Dr Ezra Susser chair of the epidemiology department at Columbia s Mailman School of Public Health and other department members weighed in including Dr W Ian Lipkin Dr Mady Hornig a highly regarded neurologist and epidemiologist Dr Michaeline Bresnahan These researchers wrote Whether mercury in any form has anything to do with brain injury can and should be resolved with rigorous studies and respectful discourse not moral indictments and denunciations The Times

ruthless and impenetrable power over the world s educational institutions and scientific research Dr Exley is the British university s Professor of Bioinorganic Chemistry He is the world s most notable expert on aluminum poisoning Unfortunately for Dr Exley his recent work has focused on the pharmaceutical industry s dramatic expansion of its use of aluminum as an adjuvant in medicines including vaccines over the past two decades Pharma embarked on that trend largely without critical attention to aluminum s well documented adverse impacts on human cells and organs A few brave independent scientists have moved to fill this vacuum Dr Chris Exley is by far the most renowned and prolific Exley believes that a better understanding of the neurological and physiological effects of injected aluminum is crucial to public safety and public confidence in vaccination programs around the globe Exley s research efforts have documented grave toxic effects of aluminum exposures on

would wither I sent a personal check for 15 000 to Exley via Keele I never expected that my donation would be rejected I ve never heard of any university returning a donation from a private individual with no corporate conflicts Furthermore Keele had already gained notoriety throughout academia for ethical elasticity when cash donations are at stake In 2018 University officials made the extremely

Montgomery ruling where it comes to vaccinations and their possible risks and this is a very serious matter indeed When further investigating this subject I found that there was relatively little research being undertaken into the risks of vaccination so I was most gratified to have discovered Professor Exley and his stellar research into aluminium a common vaccine ingredient Inspired by conversations with Professor Exley and others I decided to launch my own vaccine education site aimed specifically at students whom I know from experience are not given the full facts about vaccinations but rather are often aggressively bullied into them instead You can see my site here www striveuk webs com Since 2015 I have not only continued to follow and admire Professor Exley s great work but he has also become a good personal friend So you can imagine my shock and disappointment when I learned last year that Keele was making it difficult for him to receive research donations to continue his vital research It did seem eventually he was able to resolve this issue with Keele about which I was very pleased and relieved and so I was utterly astonished and horrified when I learned of the most recent development that Keele had returned a generous research donation to Professor Exley from Robert F Kennedy Jr because it might fuel research that would spark negative media attention Professor Exley shared this information with longstanding colleague and confidante Professor John Sloboda and Professor Sloboda my father shared it with me Having read the letter you sent to Mr Kennedy regarding rejecting his donation I find it to be quite devastating to my perceptions of Keele and everything I believed it stood for and has stood for many decades in my family s history This letter openly states that allowing Professor Exley to receive funding from certain high profile sources to continue his critical and world class research might a upset other funders I

families want nothing more than the recognition and support they deserve for submitting to a procedure they believed would protect their children s health but in fact did just the opposite Professor Exley is one of the few scientists brave enough to carry out such research and Keele should be offering their unerring praise and support Instead they treat him in his words as a pariah This saddens

and therefore overwrought and disconnected But my experience with these women is inconsistent with those patronizing assessments Over the past two years I ve met or communicated with several hundred

educated Many of them are doctors nurses schoolteachers pharmacists psychologists Ph D s and other professionals Many of them approached the link skeptically and only through dispassionate and diligent investigation became convinced that Thimerosal laced vaccines destroyed their children s brains As a group they have sat through hundreds of meetings and scientific conferences and studied

undeniable connection between mercury and Thimerosal and a wide range of neurological illnesses In response to the overwhelming science CDC and the pharmaceutical industry ginned up four European studies designed to disguise the link between autism and Thimerosal Their purpose was to provide plausible deniability for the consequences of their awful decision to allow brain killing mercury to be injected into our youngest children Those deliberately deceptive and fatally flawed studies were authored by vaccine industry consultants and paid for by Thimerosal producers and published largely in compromised journals that neglected to disclose the myriad conflicts of their authors in violation of standard peer review ethics As I ve shown elsewhere see www robertfkennedyjr com these studies were borderline fraud using statistical deceptions to mislead the public and regulatory community The CDC and IOM base their defense of Thimerosal on these flimsy studies their own formidable reputations and their faith that journalists won t take the time to critically read the science The bureaucrats are simultaneously using their influence energies and clout to derail defund and suppress any scientific study that may verify the link between Thimerosal and brain disorders These would include epidemiological studies comparing the records of vaccinated children with those of unvaccinated populations like the Amish or home schooled kids who appear to enjoy dramatically reduced levels of autism and other neurological disorders The federal agencies have refused to release the massive public health information accumulated in their Vaccine Safety Database VSD apparently to keep independent scientists from reviewing evidence that could prove the link They are also muzzling or blackballing scientists who want to conduct such studies Ironically it is the same voices that once blamed autism on bad parenting and uninvolved moms that are now faulting these mothers for being too involved Due to this campaign of obfuscation and public deception Thimerosal based vaccines continue to sicken millions of children around the world and potential treatments like the

mothers to complete three follow up surveys and when their child reaches age five the 65 item Social Responsiveness Scale SRS which assesses autistic behaviors Key Results Ryu and colleagues present available data for 458 26 of the 1 751 mother child pairs originally recruited into the MOCEH study What are their key findings First the researchers report a significant linear relationship between mercury exposure and autistic behaviors as indicated by a scaled score called an SRS T score Strikingly they find that with a doubling of blood mercury levels at four time points late pregnancy cord blood and at two and three years of age SRS T scores are significantly higher Ryu et al also look specifically at SRS T scores greater than or equal to 60 Sixty and above is the accepted threshold for detecting mild to moderate deficits of social behavior related to autism scores of 76 or more are in the severe range In these analyses the same linear relationship holds for late pregnancy and birth i e cord blood With a doubling of blood mercury levels at these two time points there is a 31 and 28 increase respectively in the risk of an SRS T score of 60 or more Finally the researchers identify a stronger association between late pregnancy mercury exposure and autistic behaviors in five year old boys versus five year old girls perhaps due to mercury s endocrine disrupting properties

the authors note almost in passing that they measured total mercury instead of methylmercury but they discount any potential relevance of ethylmercury from thimerosal containing vaccines In support of this dismissive stance they cite a 2014 meta analysis that failed to find any material associations between thimerosal exposure and ASD or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD They do not mention that the authors of the meta analysis actually urged readers to interpret their results with caution since the number of epidemiological studies on this issue is limited and still at an early stage Ryu and coauthors also repeat the canard that methylmercury is the only form of organic mercury capable of inducing neurotoxic effects because of ethylmercury s shorter blood half life compared to methylmercury This statement is disingenuous in light of the well documented fact that methylmercury and ethylmercury share numerous mechanisms of toxicity Moreover strong evidence from infant primates shows that injected thimerosal has a much slower half life in the brain than in the blood and infants exposed to injected thimerosal accumulate harmful inorganic mercury an end product of thimerosal in the brain to a far greater extent than infants exposed to orally ingested methylmercury Due to these differences blood mercury levels are not a suitable indicator of injected thimerosal s potentially adverse effects on the brain Finally it is biologically plausible that simultaneous exposure to both forms of mercury ethyl and methyl may result in additive and synergistic neurotoxic effects The Korean Context Interestingly fully a third of Ryu s study population 32 5 had an SRS T score of at least 60 versus about 18 of U S children In 2011 a South Korean study of over 23 000 seven to twelve year old children made headlines by reporting a national ASD prevalence of 2 64 or 1 in 38 children The Republic of Korea s immunization rates have been steadily climbing along with autism rates since the 1990s with nearly universal 98 99 coverage for example for measles and DTP3 in one year olds Is it simply a coincidence that neuro psychiatric conditions represent the single

Debunking the Myths About Thimerosal By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied People ask me questions about mercury toxicity all the time I ve spent over ten years researching and writing about the mercury

the country and the introduction is by Harvard University neurologist Martha Herbert M D Ph D Dr Hyman and Dr Herbert are just two of a team of the nation s most outstanding researchers and clinicians who have helped me gather scientific data on Thimerosal What is Thimerosal Thimerosal is a mercury based preservative used in vaccines and other medicines Developed by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly in 1928 over the years Thimerosal has been used in a variety of medical products including topical antiseptics nasal sprays eye drops immune globulin products and vaccines What is the problem with Thimerosal Thimerosal is about 50 percent ethyl mercury by weight Thimerosal exposure has been linked to attention disorders speech delays language delays Tourette Syndrome misery disorder seizures epilepsy Sudden Infant Death Syndrome narcolepsy heart disorders neurological disorders asthma and allergies Over 165 peer reviewed scientific studies show a link between Thimerosal and neurological injuries Unfortunately there s a lot of misinformation about Thimerosal out there It s time to debunk the myths Myth My doctor says vaccines don t contain mercury anymore that the Thimerosal has been phased out Fact Thimerosal has not been removed from childhood vaccines In 2001 the Institute of Medicine reviewed the use of thimerosal containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders and recommended that thimerosal be removed from vaccines administered to sensitive populations The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices ACIP chose not to follow the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine Today Thimerosal is still in approximately one third to one half of the flu vaccines produced annually and administered to pregnant women and infants access the government s list of Thimerosal containing flu vaccines This means that the developing fetus as well as babies as young as six months are being exposed to mercury in vaccines There is also Thimerosal in the diphtheria tetanus vaccine and in one vaccine to protect against meningitis access the government s list of vaccine ingredients The CDC recommends flu shots for pregnant women six month olds and children in every year of life Pregnant women often instructed by their doctors to get two influenza vaccines if their pregnancy spans more than one flu season

removed as it was moved around Here s how it worked In 1999 after realizing that the cumulative amount of mercury a child was exposed to via vaccines had never been tallied the Public Health Service PHS the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP and vaccine manufacturers recommended Thimerosal be removal from all childhood vaccines Thimerosal was then in three childhood vaccines against diphtheria pertussis and tetanus DTaP against Haemophilus influenzae type B Hib and against hepatitis B However instead of r equiring immediate removal the CDC allowed the pharmaceutical companies to save money by using up their inventories of mercury containing vaccines By 2003 the industry had finally used up stocks of thimerosal containing vaccines and Thimerosal is no longer used in these three vaccines At the same time mercury was finally phased out of the DTaP Hib and Hep B vaccine the CDC added the mercury containing flu vaccine to the childhood schedule At that time almost all flu vaccines contained 25 micrograms mcgs of mercury recommended to children in every year of life Myth If the CDC still allows Thimerosal in vaccines given to pregnant women then it must be safe Fact NO amount of mercury is safe for humans Thimerosal containing vaccines are especially unsafe for pregnant women Mercury is one of the most toxic substances known to man Studies have also shown that thimerosal causes debilitating brain injuries and miscarriages when pregnant women have been exposed to mercury methyl and ethyl from accidental poisonings The FDA has never tested or approved thimerosal for use in pregnancy Myth But the ethyl mercury in Thimerosal is less toxic than the methyl mercury in fish After all humans can drink ethyl alcohol even though methyl alcohol is poisonous Fact The science shows that ethyl mercury is actually more toxic than methyl mercury While this is a common argument it is simply untrue In order to exonerate thimerosal its defenders sometimes parrot the debunked industry canard that the ethyl mercury in thimerosal is less persistent in the body and therefore less toxic than methyl mercury in fish However they cannot cite a single published scientific study to

harm Fact The term trace amounts means less than 1 microgram mcg Thimerosal containing flu shots contain what in biochemical terms is actually a massive dose of mercury 25 mcg Why do I call that massive Because the Environmental Protection Agency s maximum exposure limits for methyl mercury is 1 microgram per 1 kilogram of bodyweight which means a baby would have to weigh 550 pounds to safely absorb 25 micrograms of mercury At these levels a growing fetus in a mother receiving the flu shot could get up to a million times the EPA s safe levels Myth A trace amount of Thimerosal would not be harmful Fact There is no known safe exposure level to mercury Even if the flu shot contained only 1 microgram it would still be double the amount deemed safe by EPA for a nine pound baby Furthermore the ethyl mercury in vaccines is fifty times more toxic and twice as persistent in the brain as the methyl mercury in fish for which EPA established those standards Myth My doctor can t get me a Thimerosal free flu vaccine Fact Flu vaccines without mercury are widely available Even though doctors continue to use multi dose flu vaccines that contain Thimerosal Thimerosal free flu vaccines are available People receiving flu vaccines should be able to request and receive Thimerosal free vaccines Unfortunately some doctors insist that it is too inconvenient or too expensive to order Thimerosal free vaccines If your doctor refuses to give you a Thimerosal free vaccine find a different doctor Myth It s too difficult to remove Thimerosal from vaccines Fact Thimerosal can be easily removed from vaccines Thimerosal was quickly and easily removed from the three childhood vaccines in the United States shortly after the CDC requested its removal Most European nations have also banned Thimerosal without any noticeable impact on vaccine cost or supply Myth Epidemiological studies prove that Thimerosal was not a cause of brain damage or health problems in children Fact Despite

this one and this one No one who actually takes the time to examine the scientific literature can rationally conclude that mercury in any form is safe for humans Myth The government has never admitted that Thimerosal containing vaccines cause autism Fact In 2008 top public health officials at HHS conceded that vaccines caused autism In 2008 the family of eight year old Hannah Polling was compensated for autism due to vaccine injury Since Hannah s father was himself a doctor and her mother a nurse and a lawyer this case garnered an unusual amount of attention The government s expert Dr Andrew Zimmerman said that the vaccines had caused a metabolic overload that triggered Hannah s autism The court ordered Hannah s medical records and details about the case to be sealed However the United States government has awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to dozens of other vaccine injured children with autism diagnoses as detailed in this article published in the Pace Environmental Law Review Officials at the CDC and the FDA have also conceded that vaccines might cause autism In 2008 the late Dr Bernadine Healy former head of National Institutes of Health said on CBS News We can t dismiss a link between vaccines and autism because we have never studied the children who were fine and who suddenly lost learned skills and regressed into autism following vaccination What s a

or unsafe If our exposure does not exceed an agency determined threshold we assume there is little cause for concern How do regulatory agencies determine these thresholds There is considerable evidence to suggest that safety limits are often arbitrary and do not accurately flag risks A new study published in Environmental Research by a group of researchers in upstate New York underscores this point Lead author Dr Brooks Gump of Syracuse University and coauthors call attention to problems associated with low levels of background exposure to lead and mercury at concentrations notably lower than those deemed elevated by federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the Environmental Protection Agency EPA The authors report on results from the Environmental Exposures and Child Health Outcomes EECHO study an ongoing study involving African American and white children ages 9 11 in low and middle income urban neighborhoods Although the EECHO study s primary purpose is to investigate the influence of environmental toxicant exposures on cardiovascular risk indices the Environmental Research paper focuses on interesting associations between

levels and ASD symptoms especially social skills attention to detail and imagination in the subgroup of children who showed sustained vagal tone during acute stress This latter result matches findings from a 2003 study in which autistic children displayed an excessively controlled vagal system suggestive of autonomic hyperarousal The authors point to the need for further research to elaborate on mercury s role in triggering greater frequency of autism spectrum symptoms in children who exhibit atypical parasympathetic activity Comments In a separate publication about the EECHO study the authors explicitly note their assumption that the majority of total mercury in whole blood was methylmercury via fish consumption adding that they did not carry out mercury speciation to verify their assumption This is a notable limitation of the study because measurement of blood levels of heavy metals assesses recent or ongoing exposure to heavy metals but is not an accurate method of determining whether the organs tissues or bones are storing these toxicants Many US children still receive thimerosal containing flu shots on an annual basis these contain significant amounts of ethylmercury which moves more quickly into tissues and organs than methylmercury The authors point to the need for further research to elaborate on mercury s role in triggering greater frequency of autism spectrum symptoms in children who exhibit atypical parasympathetic activity Despite this oversight the authors emphasize the importance of paying attention to low levels of background metal exposure because background exposures affect a much larger proportion of children This comment calls into question the relevance of safety thresholds for highly toxic substances Just as Ralph Nadar

red blood cells of unknown origin and inorganic foreign particle debris in aggregates clusters and independent particulates The composition of those clusters the researchers observe are consistent with burnt waste Further analyses of those particles revealed them to be non biocompatible and bio persistent foreign bodies composed of lead stainless steel chromium tungsten nickel iron zirconium

vaccines started by accident about 15 years ago when Germany s University Hospital of Mainz asked us to analyze samples of an anti allergy vaccine they administered The vaccination had caused painful swellings around the injection point and the formation of wheals that refused to subside We analyzed the samples of both vaccines and wheals and found solid particles inside both of them Those particles should not have been there Dr Gatti explains that the discovery of vaccine impurities shocked the researchers We had never questioned the purity of vaccines before In fact for us the problem did not even exist All injectable solutions had to be perfectly pure and that was an act of faith on which it seemed impossible to have doubts For that reason we repeated our analyses several times to be certain In the end we accepted the evidence The revelations at Mainz caused the scientists to wonder if the debris problem might be more widespread and whether it might help explain a slew of

neuropathy somnolence and apnea According to Gatti No satisfactory explanation has been given as to why these adverse events occur These questions prompted the researchers to investigate material contamination in vaccine products Dr Gatti and her husband Dr Stefano Montanari are well known as the discoverers of nanopathologies diseases caused by micro and nano particles Dr Gatti speculated about the fate of the inorganic vaccine contaminants in the human body The particles be they isolated aggregated or clustered are not supposed to be there Our tissues perceive these foreign bodies as potential enemies The biological reactions are expected to be fairly complicated with macrophages that try to engulf them the way they do normally with bacteria and parasites to form a protein corona Unfortunately though the particles we found in vaccines are not biodegradable So all the macrophages efforts will be useless and depending on the exact chemicals involved the particles may be especially toxic Cytokines and pro inflammatory substances in general are released and granulated tissue forms enveloping the particles This provokes inflammation which in the long run if locally persistent is known to be a precursor to cancer Asked to explain how the contamination got into the vaccines Dr Gatti replied That s a question we can t answer We would need to inspect the laboratories where vaccines are produced but no pharmaceutical company would allow us to do so Gatti told me that she contacted Sanofi Pasteur a manufacturer of one of the contaminated vaccines The company s only reaction was to dismiss her findings as impossible Gatti speculates that the companies ignore this type of contamination because regulators are focused only on biological impurities in the manufacturing process She said Generally speaking the good manufacturing procedures those laboratories are bound to follow are focused on organic and biological matter but disregard inorganic

Mitochondria and the Omnibus Autism Proceedings By Louis Conte Link copied Robert F Kennedy Jr Chairman of Children s Health Defense CHD and Rolf Hazlehurst the father of a vaccine injured child have petitioned Michael Horowitz the Inspector General of the Department of Justice DOJ to investigate the conduct of two DOJ attorneys Vincent Matanoski and Lynn Ricciardella The two attorneys represented the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program NVICP otherwise known as the Vaccine Court in the Omnibus Autism Proceedings OAP The alleged actions of the two attorneys in the OAP were fraudulent and obstructed justice Kennedy and Hazlehurst have also written to the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee and the Senate s Committee on the Judiciary requesting that the conduct of Matanoski and Ricciardella be investigated What is the NVICP The 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program NVICP to ensure that children were quickly compassionately and fairly compensated for vaccine injuries The 1986 Act passed by Congress and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan effectively granted vaccine manufacturers freedom from civil tort liability A petitioner who asserts that their child has suffered a vaccine injury must file a petition for compensation against the Secretary of Health and Human Services HHS in the NVICP The Secretary of HHS is defended by DOJ attorneys from the Civil Torts Branch As originally conceived the NVICP was intended to a be a non litigious compensation program that was supposed to lean toward fairly compensating vaccine injured children Petitioners were to meet a preponderance of the evidence level of proof to establish that a vaccine injury occurred to merit compensation This burden of proof is much less than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard that must be met in a criminal proceeding However the program has not functioned as Congress envisioned and now functions in a manner that many observers feel is not favorable to petitioners What Were the Omnibus Autism Proceedings OAP and Why Are They Important Now Special Masters not judges preside over cases in the NVICP In 2002 the Special Masters of NVICP consolidated 5 400 petitioner claims asserting that vaccine injury caused their children s autism into the Omnibus Autism Proceedings OAP The Special Masters then established hearings that would address the 5 400 cases through six test cases Originally there were to be nine test cases These test cases would be used to test three theories of autism causation via vaccine injury 1 Did thimerosal the mercury preservative used in vaccines cause autism 2 Did the MMR vaccine cause autism and 3 Did a combination of thimerosal and the MMR cause autism The Hazlehurst case and the Cedillo cases were test cases Another particularly strong test case that of Child Doe 77 was removed as", "chunk_id":

Zimmerman to conceal evidence of his true opinion from the Special Masters who presided in the Vaccine Court and the petitioners who were seeking justice and compensation The evidence that Matanoski and Ricciardella concealed was a report authored by Dr Zimmerman showing how vaccines may cause autism in a subset of children with underlying mitochondrial issues Dr Andrew Zimmerman is regarded as perhaps the world s leading pediatric neurologist in the field of autism research He was selected by DOJ as an expert witness and submitted a report on the OAP test case Cedillo v HHS in which he rendered the opinion that the MMR vaccine did not cause autism in the Cedillo case However he informed the DOJ attorneys that his opinion should not be considered a blanket opinion which covered all of the OAP test cases Indeed in Child Doe 77 Zimmerman filed a report in which he offered the opinion that vaccines did cause this child child s autism because Child Doe 77 had an underlying mitochondrial condition Zimmerman s report further stated that vaccines could well trigger a regression ending in autism in a subset perhaps a small subset of children with a pre existing

autism and it is likely that a significant percentage of children with autism have mitochondrial dysfunction Studies indicate that the percentage of people with autism who have underlying mitochondrial issues could be between twenty and fifty percent Dr Andrew Zimmerman a neurologist with the Kennedy Krieger Institute at Johns Hopkins found that the mitochondrial dysfunction in Child Doe 77 was an underlying co factor that along with vaccines that resulted in her regression into autism While Dr Zimmerman opined in his report that such events are rare more research needs to be done to determine the true scope of the nexus between mitochondrial issues and vaccine injury Zimmerman s full opinion was devastating to the government s case Zimmerman authored reports on two cases Cedillo v HHS and Child Doe 77 v HHS Zimmerman wrote that vaccines did not cause autism in the case of Cedillo but found differently in Child Doe 77 Zimmerman made clear to the two attorneys that his Cedillo report was not intended to be a blanket finding that applied to all the other OAP cases However Matanoski and Ricciardella selected portions of the Zimmerman report on the Cedillo case that

Inquisition tribunal before which he repudiated his theory that the Earth the immovable center of the Universe according to contemporary orthodoxy revolves around the sun Had he not recanted his life would be forfeit We like to think of Galileo s struggles as the quaint artifact of a dark ignorant and tyrannical era where individuals challenged government anointed superstitions only at grave personal risk Dr Judy Mikovits story shows that stubborn orthodoxies anointed by pharmaceutical companies and corrupt government regulators to protect power and profits remain a dominant force in science and politics A pioneer in the field of human retrovirology By any standard Dr Judy Mikovits was among the most skilled scientists of her generation She entered professional science from the University of Virginia with a BA degree in chemistry on June 10 1980 as a protein chemist for the National Cancer Institute NCI working on a life saving project to purify interferon The quality of her work and her reliable flashes of genius soon propelled her to the apex of the male dominated world of scientific research At NCI Mikovits began what would become a twenty year collaboration with Dr Frank Ruscetti a pioneer in the field of human retrovirology While heading up the lab of Robert Gallo in 1977 Ruscetti made scientific history by co discovering with Bernie Poiesz the first human retrovirus HTLV 1 human T cell leukemia virus A retrovirus is a stealth virus that like HIV enters the host without alerting the immune systems It may then lie dormant for years without causing harm Before killing a person a retrovirus will usually destroy their immune system As a result many retroviruses cause cancer With an escalating understanding of retrovirus behavior the Ruscetti Mikovits collaboration and Mikovits s award winning PhD thesis from George Washington University in 1991 changed the paradigm of HIV AIDS treatment turning the disease from a death sentence into a manageable condition Integrity before personal ambition From the outset the most daunting obstacle to Mikovits career advancement was her scientific integrity She always placed it ahead of personal ambition Judy Mikovits never meant to wade into a public health brawl She never considered herself a renegade or revolutionary Judy s relatives mainly worked in government or law enforcement They believed in the

down precipitated her departure from Upjohn and her return to NIH and graduate school Judy s war on BGH eventually led to Upjohn abandoning the product A new retrovirus a ticking timebomb In 2009 now in academia Mikovits and Ruscetti who was still at NCI led a team that discovered a strong association between a previously unknown retrovirus and myalgic encephalomyelitis commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome ME CFS Predictably the retrovirus was also linked to certain blood cancers Collaborators had named it Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Related Virus XMRV when they first detected in DNA sequences in prostate cancer a few years earlier The medical community had dealt with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome which strikes mostly women in bad faith since its appearance in the mid 1980s The medical establishment derided ME CFS as yuppie flu and attributed it to the inherent psychological fragility of career women pursuing professions in high pressure corporate ecosystems Mikovits found evidence for the retrovirus in approximately 67 percent of women afflicted with ME CFS and in a little less than 4 percent of the healthy population On October 8 2009 Mikovits and Ruscetti published their explosive findings in the journal Science describing the first ever isolation of the recently discovered retrovirus XMRV and its association to ME CFS Her revelation about ME CFS immediately triggered angry reactions from jealous cancer power centers stubbornly resistant to science that attributed cancer and neuroimmune diseases to viruses The blowback grew even grimmer when Mikovits subsequent research suggested that the new retrovirus originally found in mice had somehow jumped into humans via contaminated vaccines Even more troubling to the medical establishment Dr Mikovits research revealed that many of the female patients afflicted with XMRV had children with autism Suspecting XMRV might be passed from mother to child as with HIV Mikovits tested seventeen of the children

who discovers that his town s popular and lucrative public baths were actually sickening the visitors who flocked to them for rejuvenation Discharges from local tanneries had infected the spas with lethal bacteria When the doctor goes public with the information local merchants joined by government officials their allies in the liberal minded independent press and other financially interested parties move to muzzle him The medical establishment pulls his medical license the townsfolk vilify and brand him an enemy of the people Ibsen s fictional doctor experienced what social scientists call the Semmelweis reflex This term describes the knee jerk revulsion with which the press the medical and scientific community and allied financial interests greet new scientific evidence that contradicts an established scientific paradigm The reflex can be particularly fierce in cases where new scientific information suggests that established medical practices are actually harming public health The real life plight of Ignaz Semmelweis a Hungarian physician inspired the term and Ibsen s play In 1847 Dr Semmelweis was an assistant professor at Vienna s General Hospital maternity clinic where around 10 percent of women died from puerperal birth bed fever Based on his pet theory that cleanliness could mitigate transmission of disease causing particles Semmelweis introduced the practice of mandatory hand washing for interns between performing autopsies and delivering babies The rate of fatal puerperal fever immediately dropped to around 1 percent Semmelweis published these findings Rather than building a statue to Semmelweis the medical community unwilling to admit culpability in the injury of so many patients expelled the doctor from the medical profession His former colleagues tricked Dr Semmelweis into visiting a mental institution in 1865 then committed him against his will Semmelweis died mysteriously two weeks later A decade afterward Louis Pasteur s germ theory and Joseph Lister s work on hospital sanitation vindicated Semmelweis s ideas Modern analogs abound Modern analogs abound Herbert Needleman of the University of Pittsburgh endured the

pharmaceutical manufacturers He warned that the vaccine was dangerous and could induce neurological injuries His CDC superior warned Dr Morris I would advise you not to talk about this When vaccine recipients began reporting adverse reactions including Guillain Barré Dr Morris disobeyed that order and went public He declared that the flu vaccine was ineffective and potentially dangerous and said

Among the vaccine s victims were 500 cases of Guillain Barré including 200 people paralyzed and thirty three dead Furthermore the incidence of swine flu among vaccinated was seven times greater than among those who were unvaccinated according to news reports According to his New York Times obituary Dr Morris said The producers of these influenza vaccines know they are worthless but they go on selling them anyway He told the Washington Post in 1979 It s a medical ripoff I believe the public should have truthful information on the basis of which they can determine whether or not to take the

justify its recommendations that pregnant women get flu shots which are laden with far more mercury than what s found in a can of tuna The CDC has long answered that nettlesome question with the controversial claim that ethylmercury in vaccines is not toxic to humans Now two CDC scientists have published research decisively debunking that assertion As it turns out there is no good mercury and bad mercury Both forms are equally poisonous to the brain The CDC study Alkyl Mercury Induced Toxicity Multiple Mechanisms of Action appeared last month in the journal Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology The 45 page meta review of relevant science examines the various ways that mercury harms the human body Its authors John F Risher PhD and Pamela Tucker MD are researchers in the CDC s Division of Toxicology and Human Health Sciences Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry This scientific paper is the one of most important pieces of research to come out of the CDC in a decade Paul Thomas M D a Dartmouth trained pediatrician who has been practicing medicine for 30 years said It confirms what so many already suspected that public health officials have been making a terrible mistake in recommending that we expose babies and pregnant women to this neurotoxin I regret to say that I gave these shots to children The CDC led us all to believe that it was perfectly safe Among the findings of the CDC s new study Methylmercury the highly regulated neurotoxin found in fish and ethylmercury found in medical products including influenza and tetanus vaccines ear drops and nasal sprays are similarly toxic to humans Methylmercury and ethylmercury share common chemical properties and both significantly disrupt central nervous system development and function Thimerosal is extremely toxic at very low exposures and is more damaging than methylmercury in some studies For example ethylmercury is even more destructive to the mitochondria in cells than methylmercury The ethylmercury in thimerosal does not leave the body quickly as the CDC once claimed but is metabolized into highly neurotoxic forms Despite this stark rejection of a decade of CDC

the realm of criminal endangerment Handley the founder of Generation Rescue a vaccine safety advocacy group condemns the CDC for misleading the medical establishment The CDC knows that pediatricians and physicians rely on its public pronouncements when they make treatment decisions for their patients how can we escape the conclusion that the agency is knowingly causing the poisoning of tens of millions of American children Handley stated For example CDC s webpage still parrots the now discredited industry canard that Thimerosal contains ethylmercury which is cleared from the human body more quickly than methylmercury and is therefore less likely to cause any harm However the new study makes the opposite conclusion Thimerosal is quickly metabolized in vivo in a living organism due to its reactions with protein and non protein thiols so the effects of thimerosal reported in numerous articles are very likely the result of exposure to the metabolite ethylmercury Ignoring the agency s own scientific evidence the CDC s webpage stubbornly insists that the two types of mercury to which people may be exposed methylmercury and ethylmercury are very different The new CDC study directly contradicts this assertion There are many commonalities similarities in the mechanisms of toxic action of methylmercury and ethylmercury The study meticulously details identical toxicity pathways

many other large scale food poisonings have occurred involving ethylmercury fungicides in Iraq in 1956 and 1960 in Pakistan in 1961 and in Russia in the 1960s as well These episodes resulted in maladies ranging from basic tissue injury to heart and brain injury and even death Derban reported in 1974 on 144 cases of mercury poisoning from the use of ethylmercury fungicide on a southern Ghana state farm Multiple other studies based on these poisoning events showed as stated in a 1977 study by David Fagan that the long term neurological consequences produced by the ingestion of either methyl or ethyl mercury based fungicides are indistinguishable A 1979 case report concerned a fifteen year old boy who had eaten the meat of a pig that had fed on ethylmercury fungicide treated seed Documented effects on the boy included debilitating brain damage and loss of coordination with high toxicity for the brain as well as the spinal motor neurons peripheral nerves skeletal muscles and heart muscle The boy died about one month after becoming ill Ethylmercury s use as pesticide was eventually banned in many countries including the United States and those in the European Union and for good reason A 1977 study gauged ethylmercury chloride s relative toxicity as a pesticide as the fifth most toxic of thirty substances tested with a score of 12 7 That grade score almost matched that of DDT at 14 2 an infamous pesticide banned in 1972 In 1977 Fagan reported on 13 children suffering from exomphalos a rare abdominal wall defect that allows the intestines to protrude from the abdomen

based on research from outbreaks of poisonings and other research from the Faroe Islands and the Seychelles the EPA established a safe reference dose for methyl mercury RfD An RfD is defined as an estimate of a daily exposure to the human population including sensitive subgroups that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of adverse effects when experienced during a lifetime according to the EPA The EPA adopted for methylmercury an RfD of 0 1 microgram of mercury per kilogram of the individual s body weight per day Other health agencies set their own recommended limits for methylmercury exposure including the FDA in 1979 the World Health Organization in 1989 and the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ATSDR in 1999 The highest of these limits was the WHO s at 0 47 microgram per kilogram of body weight per day In 1999 the US Congress directed the EPA to contract with the nonprofit independent National Research Council NRC to prepare recommendations on an updated and appropriate RfD The EPA commissioned the National Academy of Sciences NAS and the NRC to carry out a study on toxicological effects of methylmercury compounds The goal was to review the process used by the EPA to establish national safety standards The committee evaluated the literature which demonstrated methylmercury compounds high toxicity to brain tissue even at minute levels The NAS ultimately agreed with the EPA s originally conceived RfD which remains in place today An RfD has never been established for ethylmercury The CDC has crossed ethical and perhaps even legal boundaries by purposefully blocking efforts by the National Institute of Environmental Health Science s NIEHS National Toxicology Program NTP to test ethylmercury for toxicity a process that would have lead to maximum exposure guidelines In 2000 the FDA nominated thimerosal to the NTP for toxicity testing However CDC officials derailed the review telling the NTP committee that There is a great concern within CDC about continued attacks from anti vaccine groups questioning the integrity of CDC activities and recommendations regarding the use of thimerosal containing vaccine In response to CDC pressure the NTP put thimerosal on permanent deferred status Thimerosal has therefore never been tested for safety or toxicity Ethyl Mercury Exposure Levels Based on Methyl Mercury Guidelines A

Webster wrote Available information on the developmental neurotoxic effects of MeHg methylmercury particularly the neurobehavioral effects indicates that the fetus and infant are more sensitive to adverse effects of MeHg It is therefore recommended that pregnant women and women of childbearing age be strongly advised to limit their exposure to potential sources of MeHg Based on results from human and animal studies on the developmental neurotoxic effects of methylmercury the accepted reference dose should be lowered to 0 025 to 0 06 MeHg microgram kg day What might this mean for a fetus

Vaccine Manufacturers and FDA Regulators Used Statistical Gimmicks to Hide Risks of HPV Vaccines New study Vaccine Manufacturers and FDA Regulators Used Statistical Gimmicks to Hide Risks of HPV Vaccines By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied A new study published in Clinical Rheumatology exposes how vaccine manufacturers used phony placebos in clinical trials to conceal a wide range of devastating risks associated with HPV vaccines Instead of using genuine inert placebos and comparing health impacts over a number of years as is required for most new drug approvals Merck and GlaxoSmithKline spiked their placebos with a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant and cut observation periods to a matter of months Researchers from Mexico s National Institute of Cardiology pored over 28 studies published through January 2017 16 randomized trials and 12 post marketing case series pertaining to the three human papillomavirus HPV vaccines currently on the market globally In their July 2017 peer reviewed report the authors Manuel Martínez Lavin and Luis Amezcua Guerra uncovered evidence of numerous adverse events including life threatening injuries permanent disabilities hospitalizations and deaths reported after vaccination with GlaxoSmithKline s bivalent Cervarix vaccine and Merck s quadrivalent or nine valent HPV vaccines Gardasil and Gardasil 9 Pharmaceutical company scientists routinely dismissed minimized or concealed those injuries using statistical gimmicks and invalid comparisons designed to diminish their relative significance Of the 16 HPV vaccine randomized trials only two used an inert saline placebo Ten of the sixteen compared the HPV vaccine against a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant and four trials used an already approved aluminum containing vaccine as the comparison Scientific researchers view double blind placebo trials as the gold standard for testing new drugs To minimize bias investigators randomly assign patients to either a treatment group or a control placebo group and then compare health outcomes The standard practice is to compare a new drug against a pharmacologically inert placebo To minimize opportunities for bias neither patients nor researchers know which individuals received the drug and which the placebo However in clinical trials of the various HPV vaccines pharmaceutical researchers avoided this kind of rigor and instead employed sleight of hand flimflams to mask the seriousness of vaccine injuries Of the 16 HPV vaccine randomized trials only two used an inert saline placebo Ten of the sixteen

to mask the cascade of similar adverse reactions among the groups that received the vaccines Although both placebo and study groups suffered numerous adverse events in these studies there were minimal differences between the two groups The similar adverse outcomes in both groups allowed industry researchers and government regulators to claim that the vaccines were perfectly safe despite manifold disturbing reactions The Mexican researchers meta review confirms the difficulty of ascertaining vaccine attributable differences from this mess the researchers identified only a few indications of significantly increased systemic adverse events in the HPV vaccine group vs the control group across the 16 pre licensure trials The HPV promoters found it more difficult to employ deceptive devices in the 12 post marketing safety reviews and the Mexican authors summarize some of the more noteworthy findings In Spain they found a ten fold higher incidence of vaccine related adverse events following HPV vaccination compared to other types of vaccines In Canada they found an astonishing one in ten rate of hospital emergency department visits among HPV vaccinated individuals within 42 days after immunization Still the industry researchers did what they could to minimize these injuries The Mexican reviewers criticize the authors of the various post marketing studies for failing to ask essential questions to evaluate the many serious adverse events or to elaborate on their often troubling findings Abbreviated Trial Times Typically FDA requires drug companies seeking approval for a new drug to observe health outcomes in both the placebo and study groups for 4 5 years Vaccine manufacturers take advantage of FDA regulatory loopholes that allow fast tracking of vaccines and cut

of 13 023 received a so called spiked placebo loaded with an aluminum adjuvant amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate or AAHS The large size of this spiked placebo group suggests that the decision to keep the saline placebo group small was strategic Putting aside the thorny ethical question of whether study participants were told that they were being injected with a neurotoxin with probable associations with Alzheimer s dementia and other forms of brain disease the inclusion of both saline and aluminum placebos provided these researchers a chance to do some genuine science But the FDA webpage shows the troubling gimmick that was then employed by the FDA and Merck which seems deliberately designed to blur datasets in order to mask adverse effects during the clinical trials

women experienced injection site swelling in the Gardasil group compared to the saline group 25 4 vs 7 3 In fact by all five measures both the Gardasil recipients and the aluminum placebo recipients fared two to three times worse than the saline recipients When it came time for Merck to report on the occurrence of more serious reactions Systemic Adverse Reactions and Systemic Autoimmune Disorders

that there are no observable differences between the Gardasil and AAHS saline groups But despite the researchers efforts to paper over adverse effects they were not able to conceal the devastating health injuries to their human guinea pigs The bottom line of these trials reveals a shocking truth An alarming 2 3 of both their study and control groups had indicators of autoimmune diseases These data are even more alarming when one considers that the observation period was curtailed after only six months With this level of risk it would seem that no loving parents would allow their daughter to receive this vaccine particularly given the comparatively low risk posed by HPV in countries with appropriate cervical cancer screening tests Even in countries such as India where cervical cancer mortality is high due to late detection leading Indian physicians argue that comprehensive screening should be the country s top priority rather than the panacea of HPV vaccination Consider the math According to the National Institutes of Health NIH an estimated 2 4 women per 100 000 die of cervical cancer in the US each year On the other hand the FDA s Table 2 above shows that 2 3 per 100 girls and women developed an incident condition potentially indicative of a systemic autoimmune disorder after enrolling in the Gardasil clinical trial It is difficult to understand how any rational regulator could allow more than two in 100 girls to run the risk of acquiring a lifelong autoimmune disorder particularly when Pap smears are already doing an effective job of identifying cervical abnormalities The NIH notes that the incidence and death rates for cervical cancer in the US declined by more than 60 after introducing Pap smear screening Based on the numerical outcomes of that study the Mexican researchers calculated the likelihood of being actually helped or harmed by the 9 valent HPV vaccine Their worrisome finding is that the number needed to harm is just 140 whereas

inescapable implication is that aluminum adjuvants may be a principal culprit in the flood of injuries reported for the various HPV vaccines This conclusion if true requires reevaluation of the use of aluminum adjuvants in several other vaccines including some given to infants Aluminum adjuvant levels have mushroomed since the 2003 removal of thimerosal from three pediatric vaccines The following chart prepared by Dr Sherri Tenpenny illustrates the stunning amount of aluminum in vaccines Multiple peer reviewed studies have connected aluminum exposures to a range of autoimmune and neurological disorders including dementia and Alzheimer s disease that have become epidemic coterminous with these aluminum exposures A review in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition warns of dangerous accumulation of aluminum in the brain when as in the case of vaccination protective gastrointestinal mechanisms are bypassed It s time to go back to the drawing board on HPV vaccines and aluminum

Contracts Secret Operation Warp Speed Using CIA Linked Contractor to Keep COVID 19 Vaccine Contracts Secret By Whitney Webb Link copied Last Tuesday while most Americans were distracted by the first U S presidential debate NPR quietly reported that the U S government s Operation Warp Speed a public private partnership launched by the Trump administration to rapidly develop and distribute a COVID 19 vaccine had taken the unusual step of awarding contracts to vaccine companies not directly but through a secretive defense contractor Though NPR named the defense contractor South Carolina based Advanced Technology International ATI they declined to explore the company s deep ties to the CIA Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense and how ATI is helping to lead those agencies efforts to militarize health care and create a surveillance panopticon that not only monitors the world around us but our physiology as well The secret vaccine contracts awarded through ATI as part of Warp Speed total approximately 6 billion accounting for the majority of Operation Warp Speed s 10 billion budget Both Paul Mango Health and Human Services HHS deputy chief of staff for policy and Robert Kadlec HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response ASPR personally signed off on the contracts Operation Warp Speed which officially involves the combined efforts of HHS and the military to deliver over 300 million COVID 19 vaccines to Americans by next January is a highly secretive program dominated by military personnel most of whom have no experience in health care or vaccine production The Trump administration has often compared Warp Speed to the Manhattan Project which produced the atomic bomb Several unsettling revelations about the true nature and scope of Warp Speed including the out sized role of ATI began to emerge starting last Monday Yet most of this new information was not covered by US news outlets due to the media frenzy surrounding the first presidential debate and the subsequent news that President Trump and several other politicians and White House officials had tested positive for COVID 19 NPR noted that the decision to use a nongovernment intermediary like ATI to issue the coronavirus vaccine contracts as opposed to the government itself directly awarding those contracts allows Operation Warp Speed to bypass the regulatory oversight and transparency of traditional federal contracting mechanisms This means that among other things the vaccine contracts awarded under Operation Warp Speed are unlikely to be publicly released in the near future if ever The report from NPR also noted that the Congressional Research Service reported just last year that using such intermediaries to award contracts can result

this unorthodox way of issuing contracts known as other transaction agreements OTAs often argue that utilizing this alternative method for awarding contracts significantly hastens the process However the Congressional Research Service also noted that the Department of Defense DOD which has been increasingly relying on OTAs in recent years has never tracked the information necessary to determine if OTAs are actually faster than traditional contracting methods This suggests that claims regarding the alleged speed advantage of OTAs are based on assumptions rather than data based evidence Johnson Johnson Novavax Pfizer and Sanofi are among the companies that have received these covert vaccine contracts through the OTA authorized by Operation Warp Speed and managed by ATI Many of these companies particularly Johnson Johnson have been involved in scandals related to selling and marketing products they knew to be unsafe to the public This makes the lack of oversight and their exemption from federal regulations including safety regulations an issue of concern regarding their participation in Warp Speed This concern is further compounded by the fact that on September 21 HHS Secretary Alex Azar told FOX Business that all Operation Warp Speed vaccine manufacturers would be exempt from liability for any damages their vaccines may cause and that those who administer their vaccines would also not be liable for damages Under the PREP Act which is a provision in Congress any treatment or vaccine for purposes of a national emergency pandemic like this actually comes with liability protection Both the product as well as those who administer it or provide it Azar stated during the televised interview The PREP Act that Azar referenced was originally signed into law in

September 11 2001 As journalist Margie Burns noted in a 2002 article the rise of homeland defense as a centerpiece of US government policy including the push to create a new homeland security agency began with former State Department official Richard Armitage s alleged coining of the term in 1997 in a National Defense Policy document In the years that followed this pivot toward seeing the American homeland as a future battlefield was heavily promoted by a web of media outlets owned by South Korean cult leader and CIA asset Sun Myong Moon including the Washington Times Insight Magazine and UPI All published numerous articles either penned by ANSER analysts or that heavily cited ANSER reports and employees regarding the need for a greatly expanded homeland security apparatus In October 1999 at David s behest ANSER created the Institute for Homeland Security ANSER IHS Though fully funded and established at that time but for reasons still unclear the ANSER IHS was not formally launched until April 2001 The Institute s first director was Randall Larsen who was at that time and still is today a close associate of current HHS ASPR Robert Kadlec Though ANSER has never explained the reason behind the lengthy delay in officially launching ANSER IHS it is possible that the timing was related to the introduction of H R 1158 in March 2001 That bill called for the creation of the National Homeland Security Agency which was the foundation of the later Department of Homeland Security One month after ANSER IHS was created Insight Magazine published an article in May 2001 entitled

Civilian Biodefense Studies now the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security O Toole at the time was on the ANSER IHS board of advisers As previously detailed in the Engineering Contagion series several of those involved in Dark Winter had foreknowledge of the 2001 anthrax attacks and Dark Winter itself originated what became the initial yet false narrative for those attacks that Iraq and Al Qaeda were working together to conduct acts of bioterrorism on US soil However the anthrax used in the attacks was quickly determined to have either originated from a US military lab or a US defense contractor ANSER s convenient gamble that the US government would imminently pivot toward homeland security soon after April 2001 paid off tremendously Thanks largely to the fear stoked by 9 11 and the 2001 anthrax attacks the Department of Homeland Security was created and ANSER IHS quickly became the first government think tank that is federally funded research and development center Not long after its formal creation as an agency DHS established its Science and Technology S T Directorate in 2003 with the mission to protect the homeland by providing officials with state of the art

ANSER DHS declined to renew ANSER s federally funded research and development center contract in October 2016 They instead awarded that contract to the RAND Corporation which created a new research and development center with a different set of focus areas aligned more closely with current DHS priorities ANSER s apparent plans for restructuring following the loss of this critical contract included its decision to acquire ATI which took place just a few months later in February 2017 The acquisition of ATI gave ANSER access to the key OTA research consortia that ATI manages ensuring that ANSER s board of former intelligence officials military officers and defense industry executives continued to wield considerable influence over the direction of government funded research projects Per the press release the acquisition was aimed at combining ANSER s government problem solving heritage with ATI s technical expertise allowing ANSER to continue to execute thought leadership independent of commercial influences over the important defense technology developments being overseen by ATI Thus whatever decisions are being made by ATI with respect to these secretive Operation Warp Speed vaccine contracts it is ultimately ANSER that is signing off on them Mess hall Given that Operation Warp Speed s official purpose is to use taxpayer funds to produce accelerate and distribute a medical treatment i e vaccine to Americans there is no reason for such extreme secrecy and also no reason for the excessive role of the military and secretive contractors like ATI and ANSER in the execution of this public health effort While the officially stated purpose of Warp Speed makes the extreme secrecy involved seem not just unnecessary but absurd it is worth noting that several recent revelations regarding Warp Speed s structure strategy and execution strongly suggest that the reason for the operation s covert nature is because its scope goes well beyond its publicly stated purpose

playing such a major role in Warp Speed was related to its expertise in logistics and supply chains the recent release of the operation s vaccine distribution strategy makes no direct mention of the military s role in those aspects of Warp Speed So noticeable was the disconnect that soon after the release of the official distribution strategy the Department of Defense clarified the military s role in the operation by publishing an interview on its website with Lt Gen Ostrowski who is leading Warp Speed s efforts to supply produce and distribute vaccines Per Ostrowski the reason the military is playing such an outsize role in Warp Speed is because of the military s program management and contracting expertise Yet as this article has shown Warp Speed contracts are being funneled through secretive contractors to avoid scrutiny and are apparently not being made available to HHS the civilian agency supposedly co leading Warp Speed alongside the military Such examples of extreme secrecy and conflicting statements appear to be just scratching the surface of what Operation Warp Speed truly aims to accomplish An upcoming series of investigative reports produced by this author in collaboration with Ryan Cristián and Derrick Broze of The Last American Vagabond will explore in depth this operation and the individuals leading it in order to expose Operation Warp Speed as the most

Allergy Epidemic By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied The global prevalence of allergic diseases is skyrocketing affecting 30 to 40 of the world s population Allergic conditions include food allergies anaphylaxis asthma eczema allergic rhinitis allergic conjunctivitis and reactions to drugs and insects Often these burdensome conditions start young are overlapping and have the potential to be severe or fatal A study of children with peanut allergy for example found that the median age of onset was 12 months 40 to 60 of peanut allergic children had concurrent asthma atopic dermatitis and or other food allergies and over a third 35 had experienced anaphylaxis upon initial peanut exposure Anaphylactic outcomes are worse when multiple allergic conditions are present an escalating number of children have been hospitalized for food allergies or have visited an emergency department for primarily food related anaphylaxis over the past couple of decades In the U S food allergies are widespread and are the most common cause of anaphylaxis in children One in 13 American children about two per classroom has at least one food allergy and food allergies increased by 50 from 1997 to 2011 An analysis of New York City school system data showed that the incidence of epinephrine administration for severe food allergy increased threefold from 2007 to 2013 Likewise an escalating number of children have been hospitalized for food allergies or have visited an emergency department for primarily food related anaphylaxis over the past couple of decades Similar trends are playing out all over the world As each new decade ushers in higher childhood allergy rates researchers mostly have scratched their heads citing the poorly operationalized hygiene hypothesis or feebly asserting that the reasons for the increase remain unclear A few investigators have pointed to possible risk factors such as cesarean delivery and novel food technologies However given that the hallmark of allergic disease is an altered immune response it stands to reason that vaccines which purposefully set out to reprogram immunity are major contenders as allergy triggers A perfect storm In her 2011 book The Peanut Allergy Epidemic Heather Fraser assembles persuasive scientific and historical evidence that lays the blame for the mass peanut allergy phenomenon and the steep rise in childhood allergies of all types on the extensive and sudden changes made to childhood vaccine programs in the U S and elsewhere in the late 1980s According to Fraser a series of critical factors synergistically converged during this time period to create a perfect storm and launch the allergy and chronic illness epidemics that have been ongoing ever since These factors include Abrupt and massive expansion of the

the day of birth This includes both the hepatitis B vaccine and synthetic vitamin K injection Changes in vaccine technology Changes include production of recombinant genetically engineered vaccines and conjugate vaccines which couple a weak vaccine antigen to a protein carrier both of which actively go after immunologic memory and non antibody immune response Vastly increased use of aluminum adjuvants which stimulate a stronger immune response that can easily veer into the realm of immune dysregulation Increased vaccine coverage Only about half of American two year olds in the late 1980s had completed their recommended series of vaccines but a decade later about nine in ten 19 35 month olds were receiving all or most recommended vaccines vaccinated children had a significantly greater odds of having a diagnosed allergic condition compared to unvaccinated children A study conducted in 2012 and published in 2017 in the Journal of Translational Science compared chronic health problems in vaccinated and unvaccinated 6 to 12 year olds in other words children born between 2000 and 2006 The results lend credence to Fraser s thinking about vaccination and allergy trends Among many striking results the authors found that vaccinated children had a significantly greater odds of having a diagnosed allergic condition compared to unvaccinated children 10 4 versus 0 4 for allergic rhinitis 22 2 versus 6 9 for other allergies and 9 5 versus 3 6 for eczema and other forms of atopic dermatitis Other studies also have linked vaccines to atopic conditions and allergic sensitization Allergy as an inevitable response to vaccination To grasp how the chain of vaccine related events initiated roughly 30 years ago has bred today s worldwide allergy epidemics one has to understand that vaccines by their very nature induce an unnatural immune response This property of vaccines is called immunogenicity Pharmaceutical researchers note that it can be tricky to achieve wanted immunogenicity while avoiding unwanted immune responses that later result in clinically adverse consequences Considering this question Fraser calls attention to an important 1991 paper in The Quarterly Review of Biology that put forth the plausible view of allergy as an evolutionary form of immunological defense against commonly allergenic toxins including metals and carcinogens From this

the body Fraser elegantly connects vaccines to this view of allergy as an evolved immunological response to toxins She and other writers have pointed out that awareness of the association between injected toxins and allergic reactions goes back to at least the early 20 th century when a French physiologist coined the term anaphylaxis to describe what happened to a dog injected twice with a hive inducing marine toxin the dog died within minutes of the second injection administered three weeks after the first Later a 1940s study described how tetanus vaccine could induce allergy in humans In fact the medical literature is replete with terms such as bystander effects and vaccine induced allergic responses to non target antigens all of which describe vaccines almost guaranteed ability to produce unwanted immunogenicity in the form of allergy Notwithstanding the fact that vaccines also contain a plethora of worrisome ingredients immunogens preservatives adjuvants antibiotics and manufacturing by products in addition to carrier proteins and live or inactivated viruses and toxins Fraser believes that vaccines skewing of the immune system as a whole is the most significant contributor to subsequent allergy The era of food allergy began with the post millennial generation the same faction who received new immunizations during early childhood The role of aluminum Because of its powerful immune stimulating effects aluminum is the one vaccine ingredient that perhaps should be singled out for its pivotal role in creating allergies As one research group recently noted aluminum adjuvants induce Th2 responses to coadministered antigens and potentially to unrelated environmental allergens thus providing bystander responses that contribute to allergic disease The probability of sensitization may be even greater with simultaneous administration of multiple aluminum containing vaccines Another study from 2016 bluntly stated The era of food allergy began with the post millennial generation the same faction who received new immunizations during early childhood Many of these vaccines contain alum an adjuvant known to induce allergic phenotypes A recent case report measured serum immunoglobulin E IgE levels in two children before and after the children received aluminum containing vaccines IgE are the immune system antibodies that together with histamine

allergy toward a more frequently persistent rather than transient condition Moreover dangerous manifestations of allergy such as anaphylaxis may be even more widespread than we know because anywhere from 21 to 57 of cases of anaphylaxis are misclassified and given a less severe diagnostic code As a result children s quality of life suffers and once rare items like epinephrine autoinjectors are becoming a fixture at schools and summer camps Although many researchers recognize the importance of avoiding excessive activation of the immune system in early life the rush to overload the vaccine

encompassing power they ve ever had which is the fear of pandemics and today we have an inflection of new technologies that give the government the capacity to impose controls on populations that have never been imaged before in any time in history by any tyrant in history Senta Depuydt President CHD Europe and Mary Holland vice chair CHD and Tina Choy board member CHD Europe lead in celebrating

Heckenlively JD Link copied Dr Judy Mikovits didn t intend to become one of the most controversial scientists of the twenty first century But uncovering inconvenient truths which threaten big money does come with consequences In late October of 2011 Dr Mikovits was riding her bike down Harbor Boulevard and through the sand dunes of McGrath State Park in Oxnard California when a white pickup truck with Nevada plates pulled in front of her and parked by the side of the road The driver was a large man with a beard his brown hair tucked under a baseball cap He had a rifle mounted in the back window As Judy passed him he was holding up his cell phone as if taking pictures If that wasn t bad enough the man did this several more times pulling ahead of her parking letting her ride past him in what seemed to be some sort of bizarre dance before finally driving away When Dr Mikovits arrived at the Pierpont Bay Yacht Club she told her friends what had happened and they knowing the intense issues surrounding Judy s xenotropic murine leukemia virus related virus XMRV study were terrified for her The episode had shaken her Judy knew that billions of dollars were on the line and when such amounts are involved people could resort to extreme measures to obtain whatever the desired outcome might be Judy s research was pointing towards vaccines as a likely source of exposure Why was the XMRV study causing such an uproar XMRV is a retrovirus like HIV but potentially infecting ten to twenty million people in the country At its height HIV infected only about a million people While not as life threatening as HIV XMRV does create havoc with the immune systems of those more susceptible and Judy s research was pointing towards vaccines as a likely source of exposure Other researchers such as Ben Berkout in the January edition of Frontiers in Microbiology wrote One of the most widely distributed biological products that frequently involved mice or mouse tissue at least up until recent years are vaccines especially vaccines against viruses It is possible that XMRV particles were present in virus stocks cultured in mice or mouse cells for vaccine production and that the virus was transferred to the human population by vaccination i At the time Judy had been fired by her previous employers the powerful Whittemore family of Nevada who first claimed insubordination on Judy s

the October incident with the man in the white pickup truck Judy and her husband David had become suspicious of other events For instance suspecting then later confirmed that Judy was under active surveillance by Nevada and California law enforcement a long unoccupied home nearby had recently been rented For no apparent reason the renters angled their floodlights directly onto Judy s house On another occasion in early November there was a pounding on her front door at 5 00 a m David answered the door and was confronted by a man claiming to have a legal document to serve on Dr Mikovits David told the man Judy had already left and to come back later He never did Suspecting more harassment and needing to get away Judy slipped out onto a boat for a few days using the time to find an attorney who could practice in both Nevada and California Several days after returning home three police cars descended on her house to arrest her and search her house Her alleged crime was taking her own notebooks for which she was the principal investigator By law a principal investigator is supposed to retain all notebooks However Judy did not have them Another researcher had secured them in

Sotomayor in a withering dissent of Judge Scalia s historic decision in Bruesewitz v Wyeth Scalia and his corporatist brethren interpreted the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 NCVIA to shield Big Pharma with full immunity from liability for vaccine injuries Their decision removed all incentives for pharmaceutical corporations to make vaccines safe and Americans forfeited their seventh amendment right to jury trial against vaccine companies that harmed them no matter how negligent RBG and Sotomayor said that Scalia s opinion caused considerable violence to the statutory texts misconstrued the legislative history and draws all the wrong conclusions from NCVIA Congress the lady justices observed intended to exempt vaccine manufacturers from tort liability only upon a showing by the manufacturer in each case that the vaccine was properly manufactured and labeled and that the side effects stemming from the vaccine s design could not have been prevented by a feasible alternative design that would have eliminated the adverse side effects They pointed out that tort suits including discovery were the only force incentivizing drug companies to make vaccines safe They said Tort suits uncover unknown drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks promptly By construing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Act to pre empt all design defect claims the majority s decision leaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one neither the FDA nor any other federal agency nor state and federal juries ensures vaccine safety There is no reason they added to think that Congress intended in the vaccine context to eliminate the traditional incentive and deterrence functions served by tort liability Nothing in the text structure or legislative history remotely suggests that Congress intended that result Scalia s decision made vaccines immensely profitable and gave blanket immunity to the 72 mandated doses of unnecessary untested risky zero

the Director of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities gave evasive answers to lawmakers pressing her on this point After considerable badgering she finally stated We have not studied vaccinated versus unvaccinated children That was perjury Verstraeten found a dramatic link between mercury containing hepatitis B vaccines and several neurological injuries including

Datalink VSD in 1999 I summarize Verstraeten s secret findings on slide 2 Verstraeten found a dramatic link between mercury containing hepatitis B vaccines and several neurological injuries including autism and prepared the study for publication CDC shared Verstraeten s analysis with the then four vaccine makers but kept it secret from the American public The data in CDC s 1999 Verstraeten study clearly inculpated thimerosal as the principle culprit behind the autism epidemic removing all unvaccinated children to bury the autism signal before publishing a sanitized version purporting to exculpate the vaccine Burying the results The world s largest vaccine maker GlaxoSmithKline GSK then whisked Verstraeten off to a sinecure in Brussels and CDC handed his raw data to his CDC boss Frank DeStefano and another researcher Robert Davis who served as a vaccine industry consultant Those two men tortured the data for 4 years removing all unvaccinated children to bury the autism signal before publishing a sanitized version purporting to exculpate the vaccine The CDC then cut off public access to the VSD and to this day aggressively blocks any attempts by researchers to study health outcomes in vaccinated vs unvaccinated populations Contemporary emails among CDC officials obtained under the FOIA and the transcripts from a secret 2000 meeting between government regulators and

the country to ask that they investigate the role vaccines may have played in the symptoms recently described in children that bear resemblance to Kawasaki Disease Physicians involved with diagnosing and treating these children have also compared the symptoms they re seeing to those of toxic shock syndrome Currently termed pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome PIMS the symptoms include fever rash eye redness abdominal pain nausea and diarrhea which can also be associated with adverse vaccine reactions Please feel free to use the facts here to create your own letter to the public health officials in your community Dear Health Commissioner Children s Health Defense represents thousands of parents whose children suffer chronic disease and a range of comorbidities that put them at particular risk from coronavirus Many of these children were vaccine injured and their parents have diminished faith in public health officials They feel that regulatory agencies put the interests of the pharmaceutical companies and the vaccine program ahead of public health and routinely withhold information that might cast those interests in an unfavorable light Any lack of candor by regulatory officials naturally feeds suspicion and the mistrust and polarization that will ultimately bedevil public faith in vaccines and jeopardize a unified response to the COVID emergency I am writing therefore to plead with you to be fierce in your investigation and honest in your disclosures I urge that you to thoroughly investigate the potential role of vaccination whether beneficial or detrimental in the etiology of these illnesses and make public the vaccine status of the injured children Coronavirus and Kawasaki Disease The potpourri of symptoms striking newborns and teenagers alike has prompted clinicians to draw comparisons to the rare childhood inflammatory condition called Kawasaki disease KD as well as to toxic shock syndrome a condition resulting from poisoning by bacterial toxins Years before COVID 19 came on the scene the CDC estimated that about 5 450 children primarily under age five are hospitalized for KD each year in the U S the equivalent of about 15 every day While rare compared to other childhood diseases KD attracts concern as the leading cause of pediatric acquired coronary artery disease with life threatening aneurysms being a possible outcome By early May while affirming that the new syndrome was Kawasaki like some researchers were suggesting that It s really beyond that and were hypothesizing that the condition may be linked to

illness could be a late stage inflammatory reaction to SARS CoV 2 infection doctors baptized the apparently new inflammatory syndrome as pediatric multi system inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID 19 later settling on the more acronym friendly pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome PIMS The children being diagnosed with PIMS are displaying some symptoms fever rash and eye redness that are generic not just to KD but also to many childhood illnesses and to vaccine reactions In countries that routinely give BCG vaccines to infants for tuberculosis protection clinicians have described BCGitis acute inflammation at the site of prior BCG inoculation as a useful tool for early KD diagnosis because it is such a widespread and telltale reaction Some aspects of the PIMS symptom picture are unusual for KD these include shock a high prevalence of severe abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms markers of cardiac injury higher than typically seen with Kawasaki disease and inflammation of the heart muscle rather than the coronary arteries Also atypically three fourths of those affected are over age five including 16 between ages 15 and 19 In the midst of theories is there any consensus This is not the first time that scientists have tried to pin the blame for KD on a coronavirus In 2005 in the aftermath of the early 2000s SARS outbreak that first propelled human coronaviruses into popular awareness Yale University researchers reported identifying a New Haven coronavirus HCoV NH in the respiratory secretions of eight children with KD as well as one child with a respiratory tract infection Noting the longstanding suspicion that an elusive infectious agent or an abnormal immune response to infection might be the cause of KD the Yale authors proposed consideration of HCoV NH as a candidate However describing human coronaviruses as ubiquitous they admitted to being stumped as to why KD would arise only in a relatively small number of children There was no follow up publication Other researchers proposed that KD could be the manifestation of an unusual degree of immune activation caused by bacterial and viral protein toxins acting as superantigens an explanation that tied together KD and toxic shock syndrome Proponents of the superantigen theory zeroed in on meningococcal bacteria in particular suggesting that a toxin

2010 most vaccine recipients experienced skin redness over half reported high fever and six children developed KS researchers saw only one case of KS in the control group who received four other vaccines for seven diseases but not Bexero In addition Bexero produced reports of sudden infant death syndrome SIDS Commenting on synergistic effects researchers noted Bexero s association with more

in the world to start administering three doses of Bexero to infants in their first year of life Kawasaki disease and Kawasaki like symptoms are commonly associated with vaccines Glaxosmithkline s Bexeo vaccine for example causes Kawasaki disease in an astonishing three of every 1000 vaccinated children according to the manufacturer s product insert UK researchers were also the first to publish a report about the new COVID 19 related inflammatory syndrome in April 2020 Last year Canadian researchers identified KD as a condition of interest for pediatric vaccine safety surveillance citing ongoing reports of KD to passive systems monitoring adverse events following immunization AEFI Case reports outside the U S have described a temporal association between KD and a wide variety of

independent or combined effect of rotavirus vaccination with a concomitantly received immunization Two studies one conducted in Singapore and one in the U S have highlighted an association between the 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV13 and KD The Singapore researchers looked at all young children under age two hospitalized for KD in their hospital from 2010 to 2014 considering children

PCV13 vaccinated infants and toddlers the likelihood of developing KD was 1 94 times higher than for those who received PCV7 again representing a finding deserving of further investigation Could Mercury be Playing a Role Another vaccine related factor that could be contributing to some of what gets labeled as KD or KS is mercury About 1 3 of current flu shots used in New York State still contain bolus doses of Thimerosal a mercury based preservative CDC recommends flu shots to six month old children and once every year afterwards We ask you to make public the flu shot status for the children effected by Kawasaki symptoms and how many of them received mercury containing flu vaccines In a letter to the editor of Immunologic Research published in 2016 Italian researchers observed that rates of KS had surged by 10 20 times during the decade and a half coinciding with the largest use of thimerosal in vaccines routinely given to infants by 6 months of age According to the authors about a fifth of reported cases manifested KS symptoms the same day of vaccination which raised the suspicion that even single doses of thimerosal containing vaccines might exert immunoexcitotoxic mechanisms in children In addition to the mercury in vaccines the Italian authors directed readers attention to the association between environmental mercury pollution and KD as well as the concordance between KD symptoms and the presentation of acrodynia a now forgotten childhood condition associated with chronic poisoning from mercury containing teething powders A summary of acrodynia AD in a 2008 publication illustrates the conspicuous overlap with KD The onset of AD is characterized by high fever lasting more than 5 days a varying rash such as erythematous plaques or appearing as

subset of the children exposed to thimerosal or other forms of mercury goes on to develop KS these researchers writing in 2012 identified a genetic variation or single nucleotide polymorphism that makes some children more susceptible to thimerosal induced autoimmunity and coronary arterial lesions observed in KS Tough questions that deserve an answer Circling back around to PIMS and its strange parallels with Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome it is clear that there are a number of questions that need to be asked Are there bona fide reasons to suspect a link with COVID 19 other than the fact that flawed PCR testing is producing positive results in some but by no means all affected children while another subset has SARS CoV 2 antibodies At the Yale hospital where doctors are currently treating up to six pediatric cases a Yale professor has cautioned against leaping to conclusions stating It s crazy we re seeing things in both adults and children that we have never seen with any infectious disease before But before attributing rare and complicated things to COVID 19 I think we have to step back and learn more about it Does COVID 19 offer a ready made answer to a complex problem Seeking to understand the ailment in a broader context another doctor reminds us that 12 to 15 cases of KD were occurring daily well before COVID 19 he asks whether COVID 19 may simply

Could the same hold true for the Kawasaki like illness being attributed to COVID 19 What kinds of toxins might children be overexposed to while cooped up at home without fresh air or sunlight Given that KD and toxic shock syndrome have both been linked to toxins this is a question that warrants answers Is anyone assessing affected children s recent vaccination history As the large body of research linking KD and vaccines suggests a child s vaccination experiences such as the timing of prior vaccination the specific vaccines administered whether the child received multiple vaccines all at once and whether they received thimerosal containing vaccines such as influenza vaccines can provide important clues Examining children s prior and possibly recent influenza vaccine history is particularly pertinent because a 2018 CDC supported study found an increased risk of acute respiratory illness non influenza in influenza vaccinated children compared to children who had not received a flu vaccine In adults a study published by the U S military in early 2020 also highlighted this issue showing that soldiers who had received an influenza vaccine had a 36 increased risk of subsequent coronavirus infection As studies are also proving that unvaccinated children are healthier perhaps we should also be asking whether any KD or PIMS even occurs in unvaccinated children Could components of vaccines be functioning as superantigens triggering an unusual degree of immune activation Scientists who have studied the distinctive immune system characteristics of children with KD acknowledge that the antigenic stimulation set in motion by vaccines and other biologics has the capacity to create immunologic interference Related to the previous question is it possible that the inflammatory syndrome we are seeing in children if new represents the result of pathogen priming a mechanism that other researchers euphemistically describe as immune enhancement Children s Health Defense recently reported on this phenomenon in the context of the ill fated Dengvaxia vaccine Pathogen priming can arise when the proteins in viral vaccines or viruses are so similar homologous to

haywire when they later encounter SARS CoV 2 At this juncture it is likely close to impossible to determine whether PIMS is brand new and whether it is related to COVID 19 Certainly the increasing descriptions of COVID 19 as a whole body rather than merely respiratory disease have persuaded some clinicians that SARS CoV 2 is capable of attacking blood vessels and multiple organs On the other hand neither PCR nor antibody testing for SARS CoV 2 is terribly reliable and a significant proportion of affected children has tested negative on one or both Why therefore have most researchers along with the entire mainstream media decided to go on record with their belief that the new pediatric syndrome is linked to COVID 19 Speaking to the Senate Health Education Labor Pensions Committee on May 12 Dr Anthony Fauci cited the Kawaski like inflammatory syndrome as a reason to throw cold water on legislators desire to reopen schools this fall while continuing to beat the drum for a rushed and dangerous COVID 19 vaccine Although it is possible the novel coronavirus is playing some contributive role in this rare illness in children it is also quite possible that it is playing absolutely no role and is rather an expedient cover story that may needlessly frighten parents about a rare disease about 5 000 cases a year that before COVID 19 few were talking about Answers to these questions

you get that you die So Merck s deal is that it s going to remove that black card from the deck But in order to play the game and make sure that Merck removes the black card everybody who participates has to put in 420 because that s the cost of the three dose Gardasil vaccine So here s Gardasil by the numbers So the cost of the three jab series average is about 420 There are 76 million children who essentially have been mandated by CDC to receive these vaccines A blockbuster product from Merck and global revenues from this vaccine today are about 2 3 billion dollars It s the third largest product in the company s inventory The cost of saving one American life is 18 3 million dollars People could argue whether or not that s a reasonable value of a human life What I would say was is that the criteria that we should use for evaluating reasonableness is there a cheaper way to save more lives And people would argue that Pap smears are the most effective way that 80 percent of cervical

killing an American citizen Prior to marketing the vaccine the FDA licenses the vaccine and in that licensing process Merck had to show that the vaccine was safe According to Federal regulations the word safety means relative freedom from harmful effects taking into consideration the character of the product in relationship to the condition of the recipient at that time So what is the condition of the recipients of that target group for this vaccine And this vaccine targets millions of preteens and teens for whom the risk of dying from cervical cancer is practically zero Cervical cancer s median age of death is 58 It is first diagnosed at age 50 median A teenage girl or boy has zero chance of dying of this illness Which means the threshold for giving this medication is very very high Secondly it is mandated in some jurisdictions So the government is actually government officials are actually coming in and ordering people to take this medical intervention So we have to be sure that the threshold for risk the risk profile for that medical intervention should be very very low Third unlike other medical interventions Gardasil recipients are perfectly healthy So when you give medication to a healthy individual you have to make sure that the risk profile is practically zero And in order to determine risk there is a standardized protocol And it s called double blind placebo studies What does that mean It means that the drug company that s trying to license this product gives the medication to one group of people maybe 5 000 or 10 000 people and gives a placebo an inert placebo either an identical looking pill that is inert it s either saline or sugar to a similarly situated group of 5 000 or 10 000 people and it s double blind meaning that neither the patients nor the researchers knew who got the placebo and who got the actual medication And you can see here here s what the NIH says about the National Institute for Health placebos an inactive substance that

really outrageous frauds that Merck committed during the clinical trials This is an insert that is part of every vaccine package And you can go on the Internet right now and look up that Merck product and search and find these two tables In the initial table you can see a there are three columns and this is a table that just looks at injuries at the vaccine site for redness and itching and bruising and pain at the vaccine site and they use one there were 5 000 girls 5 088 girls who got the Gardasil vaccine Number two there were 3 470 girls who got the AAHS control what is that That is the adjuvant in the vaccine That is a toxic neurotoxin that s put in the vaccine to make it more long lasting to provoke an immune response in the subject of the vaccine And most people believe that it is that aluminum adjuvant that is causing all of these injuries in the girls who are getting the vaccine And there were 3 470 people who received just the neurotoxin with no antigens and no other vaccine components And you have a third group which is the placebo group What I want you to look at is at these numbers That in the Gardasil and AAHS control there is virtually the same number of injuries And

worse than death and that affect people and debilitate for a lifetime in many cases And if you look at the bottom of the Gardasil group an astonishing 2 3 percent of the girls in the clinical study

is protocol 18 The reason protocol 18 is critical is because that was the basis for FDA giving Merck the license to produce and market the vaccine Why is that Because protocol 18 is the only one in which the target audience for this vaccine 11 and 12 year old girls was actually tested and had a control group The other ones looked at big cohorts of women were 16 to 25 year old and 16 to 26 year old women Protocol 18 looked at girls and boys from ages 9 to 15 It was a total of 1200 children and almost 600 controls That is a very very tiny group of people to study in order to determine the safety of a product is going to be marketed to billions of children around the world Now I m going to show you one of the key fraudulent flimflams that Merck used to get this license FDA said they approved Gardasil based on protocol 18 because protocol 18 was of particular interest because it s the only protocol in which Merck used a true saline placebo instead of the aluminum adjuvant as a control That s what Merck told FDA and the CDC but Merck was lying It actually did not use a true saline placebo It used what Merck called the carrier solution Which is all of the components of the vaccine except for the aluminum and the viral particles the antigen Among the compounds that we know were in the carrier solution are Polysorbate 80 which we have no idea what the safety profile is because it s never been tested for safety independently in vaccines Sodium borate", "chunk_id":

and all food products in the United States and is banned altogether in Europe genetically modified yeast there s no safety test ever been done on it in vaccines L histidine the same and possibly DNA fragments I say possibly because we know there are DNA fragments in the final vaccine we don t know how they got there And Merck has lied about the DNA fragments from the outset And despite these potentially toxic components of compounds that are in the vaccine the 596 children that were given the carrier solution fared much better in the other than any other cohort in the study The girls and boys who receive the carrier solution were the only significant cohorts with no serious adverse events for the first 15 days And here s another one of the gravamen of the fraud that Merck committed in its Gardasil trials but it turns out in the protocol 18 study it appears Merck cut the amount of aluminum that was given to the vaccine group in half They tested a completely different formulation If true we theorize that they took the aluminum out to reduce the number of injuries and to mask the really bad safety profile of this vaccine And since the protocol 18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation the trial itself constitutes rank scientific fraud Here s another bag of tricks that was used by Merck in order to skew the clinical trials results in favor of Gardasil Merck and its researchers use what they call exclusion criteria for example people who had zero allergies people who had prior genital infections were thrown out of the clinical trials People who had over four sex partners in their entire lives were excluded from the trials Anybody who had a history of immunological or nervous system disorders people with chronic illnesses and seizure disorders people with other medical conditions people who had reactions to vaccine ingredients including the aluminum yeast and the benzonase or anybody with a history of alcohol and drug abuse If you really wanted to know

Then Merck had one catch all exclusion category which was any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives Well that gave Merck and its paid investigators complete control to throw people out of the study who they thought might make the study look not successful All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit the study to people who were like All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit this study to people who were like an elite club of superheroes the people who get the vaccine are not the same people they tested on They tested it on the Avengers They didn t test it on you know Joe Bag of Donuts the people are actually receiving this vaccine in day to day life And by doing that they were able to mask whatever injury might show up in a larger and more vulnerable population who are actually receiving the vaccine Experts used an arsenal of sloppy protocols to again hide vaccine injuries Among these Merck gave report cards the daily journal report cards only to 10 percent of the people who they tested the vaccine on and told those people only make reports for 14 days after the injection And the report cards were only designed to collect jab site information So redness itching bruising fever And they ignored altogether the autoimmune diseases and menstrual cycle problems and fertility problems and pain and dizziness and seizures and all of the other things that we ve now seen are associated with the vaccine In fact there are numerous girls who report that they were injured that they attempted to report those injuries to Merck and that Merck rebuffed them Furthermore Merck gave extraordinary discretion to its researchers to determine what was a vaccine injury in what was not a vaccine injury and because there was no inert placebo it was completely within their discretion If a girl came back with seizures or autoimmune disease or menstrual cycle

lied about that death in its official reports of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System It told the system that Christina s doctor had told Merck that her death was the result of a virus And the doctor adamantly denies that Merck has refused to remove the misinformation from the VAERS system Furthermore Merck lied to the girls who participated in these studies telling them No 1 that the placebo was saline and that it contained no other ingredients And No 2 that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe What did this do for Merck It made it so the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine Because they believed that the vaccine that they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries they did experience maybe a month or two months or three months after the vaccine must be simply coincidental and had nothing to do with the vaccine Despite all of these efforts by Merck to discourage those from reporting vaccine injuries during the clinical trials half of the girls in the Gardasil group and half of them in the aluminum adjuvant group reported serious injuries after receiving the vaccine In order to conceal the link between these injuries and the vaccine Merck invented a brand new medical metric that had never been heard of before called new medical conditions and it dismissed all of these new injuries which affected 50 percent of the girls who received the vaccine and the adjuvant as new medical conditions unrelated to the vaccines simply sad coincidences Many of these diseases were serious diseases blood lymphatic diseases anemia endocrine diseases autoimmune diseases G I Crohn s disease

rest of your life and you have a 1 in 2 chance of having some other serious medical condition So now let s look at Merck s central claim which is that the Gardasil vaccine will prevent cervical cancer Merck s in a sweet position here let s face it because the target group vaccine is 11 year olds and the median age of death for cervical cancer is age 58 Merck essentially is making this bargain It s telling the 11 year old girl if you take our vaccine 47 years from now you won t die of cervical cancer And of course that truth is you can t make a vaccine that proves that it s going to prevent cancer 47 years from now There s no way to test for that So Merck used a shortcut It said we re going to prove that it prevents these what it called surrogate end points The best thing that Merck had come up with was CIN2 and CIN3 lesions which it called precancerous lesions even though most of those lesions never mature into cancer So how can you call something precancerous when it was never going to turn into cancer And here s what a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology said about Merck s scheme CIN3 is an imperfect diagnosis of precancer and an intermediate surrogate for cancer Their own attorneys told them for these products the indication is the surrogate not the ultimate Promotion cannot make any claim vis a vis the ultimate end point based upon the fate of a surrogate endpoint Merck has another problem Recent peer reviewed scientific studies indicate that perhaps only a third of cervical cancer cases are even associated with the HPV vaccine That would completely put the lie to Merck s claims that Gardasil is going to eliminate cervical cancer altogether So now we have a really dubious deal because we need to put that black card back in the deck because now we have doubts about whether or not this vaccine can prevent cervical cancer at all But the news gets worse Gardasil may actually cause cancer Gardasil s insert states Gardasil has never

evaluated for potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity And Gardasil s ingredients include possible carcinogens including human DNA And look at this This is Merck s own pre clinical trial records and those records show that girls or women who already had HPV had been exposed at some point in their life to it actually had a negative efficacy of 44 6 percent What is negative efficacy It means those girls had a 44 6 increased risk of getting those precancerous lesions To make things even worse there are recent scientific studies that suggest a phenomena of what is known as type replacement some 200 different strands of HPV some of them are more cancerous than others and the current HPV vaccine goes after 9 of those 200 viral types What these studies indicate is by eliminating those particular strains of the virus it opens up an ecological niche in the woman so that more lethal and virulent viruses can actually colonize that spot and dramatically increase the risk of cervical cancer So now Merck s deal is looking really grim Not only do we have a one in 40 chance of getting an autoimmune disease and a 50 percent chance of getting some serious medical condition but now the cancer risk has been reinserted and actually amplified And now let s look at some of the non cancer injuries that Merck found in its preclinical studies The miscarriage rate in the preclinical studies after Gardasil doubled the background rate The birth defects in the Gardasil group were five times the rate of birth defects from the control group As to reproductive disorders an astonishing 10 9 percent of the women in the pool group reported reproductive disorders within seven months of receiving Gardasil compared to 1 2 percent in the placebo group The death rate in the Gardasil group and the clinical trials was 8 5 per 10 thousand Death risk from this vaccine according to Merck s own studies is 37 times the risk of dying from cervical cancer Oh now look at the deal that Merck has offered us they ve actually increased our risk of dying by 37 times So now let s look at post licensing surveillance So Merck can argue that we might have missed something in our pre

voluntary system that simply does not work It s broken In fact in 2010 HHS hired another federal agency the agency for healthcare research quality and a group of Harvard researchers to study Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and those researchers found fewer than 1 percent of adverse events of vaccines are ever reported But even under that system Gardasil has distinguished itself as the most dangerous vaccine ever invented In fact when you compare it to Menactra which is a meningitis vaccine that s given to the same age group teenagers Gardasil had an 8 5 times more emergency room visits 12 5 times more hospitalizations 10 times more life threatening events and 26 5 times more disabilities than Menactra The vaccine court which is within HHS has made awards for numerous deaths and very very serious injuries from the Gardasil vaccine So HHS itself admits that this vaccine kills people and it s given compensation to the families that were injured The same wave of serious injuries and deaths that have been seen in nations around the globe when they adopt mandates for the Gardasil vaccine Even Gardasil s own insert the package insert that the company provides acknowledges that the injuries that can be caused by this vaccine include death pancreatitis fatigue malaise immune system disorders autoimmune diseases anaphylaxis musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders nervous system disorders acute disseminated encephalomyelitis that s brain injuries Guillain Barré syndrome and other neuron diseases paralysis seizures Transverse myelitis and vascular disorders In Australia

regional pain syndrome and an undeniable causal relationship between persistent pain and the vaccination Japanese researchers found that the adverse event rate for the HPV vaccine was as high as nine

symptoms of injuries caused by the Gardasil vaccine and the association announced there was no proof that this vaccine even prevents cervical cancer Alarmingly Merck s own studies indicate that the Gardasil vaccine may disproportionately impact Asian women For example in protocol 19 there were 8 deaths among 3800 women and 7 those were Asians That was 87 percent for Asian women while only 31 percent of study participants were Asian Denmark in 2015 announced the opening of five new HPV clinics to treat women who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine The day that they announced that opening there were 1300 applicants for treatment in those clinics In Colombia in 2014 800 girls in the town Carmen de Bolivar were grievously injured by Gardasil vaccine Protests erupted all over Columbia The attorney general of Colombia ordered the National Health Service of that country to immediately begin treating girls who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine and 2017 Colombia s highest Constitutional Court ruled that the HPV vaccine would no longer be considered mandatory in Colombia and ordered that girls who showed symptoms after receiving the vaccine be given appropriate medical care Pompilio

Merck This is what the FDA is telling the public about vaccine safety it says that vaccines are regulated by FDA and undergo a rigorous review of laboratory and clinical data to ensure the safety efficacy and purity and potency of these products But this is a very different story the FDA is acknowledging in house and this comes from a 2007 document this is the year that Gardasil got its license from the FDA FDA s inability to keep up with scientific advances mean that American lives are at risk FDA is evaluations and methods have remained largely unchanged over the last half century The world looks to FDA as a leader today Not only can the agency not lead it cannot even keep up with the advances in science But the most troubling problem at FDA is it has nothing to do with incompetence It has to do with corruption The panel within FDA that licenses new vaccines and anoints them as safe is called the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee the acronym is VRBPAC And in 2000 Congress investigated VRBPAC because of charges of corruption from outside the agency And here s what the congressional committee found the overwhelming majority of members both voting members and consultants have substantial ties to the pharmaceutical industry Conflicts of interest rules employed by FDA have been weak enforcement has been lax Committee members with substantial ties to pharmaceutical companies are given waivers to participate in committee proceedings In many cases significant conflicts of interest are deemed to be in conflict at all And here are some specific examples of the conflict of the advisory committee that approves vaccines Three out of five FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirus vaccine in December of 1997

they will put it on the recommended list which means it becomes essentially mandatory for 76 million American children A listing on CDC s recommended list is the holy grail for vaccine companies It means a bonanza of wealth for those companies If ACIP votes to add your vaccine to the recommended list it means mandating the vaccine to millions of American children half of those are paid for by

industry It is outrageous that industry apparently is allowed to punish the CDC if the agency conducts research that has the potential to cut into profits Corruption is systemic at FDA too shockingly 45 percent of FDA s budget comes from the industry Pharmaceutical companies pay billions of dollars in fees annually to FDA to fast track drugs Between 2000 2010 pharmaceutical companies paid 3 4 billion dollars to FDA to get drug approvals and those payments by industry have caused FDA and CDC to treat the vaccine makers not as a regulated entity but as partners and clients and friends According to Michael Carome who is a former HHS employee Instead of a regulator and regulated industry we now have a partnership that relationship has tilted the FDA away from public health perspective to an industry friendly perspective And that s why your doctor does not know the truth about Gardasil This is another thing your doctor probably doesn t know The government agency NIH actually developed the key component for the Gardasil vaccine and NIH owns part of the patent and receives royalties on it Not only does NIH the agency receive millions and millions of dollars annually from the vaccine but also the individual scientists who worked on the vaccine within the agency are entitled to make one hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year in royalty payments from Merck Oh every time your pediatrician sells one of those four hundred and twenty dollar vaccines to your child or you NIH scientists and HHS scientists and the agencies themselves are making money on that transaction And that s why your doctor doesn t know what s happening because he s getting his information or her information from those agencies So there are many many other shocking conflicts that I don t have time to talk about today between Merck and the other regulated vaccine makers and the industry that s supposed to be protecting the public from that regulated industry I just want to talk for a moment about one example From 2002 to 2009 Julie Gerberding was the director of CDC and she oversaw all all of this crooked science that went into the approvals in 2006 and 2007 of Merck s Gardasil vaccine She was rewarded by Merck When she left the agency in 2009 she was hired by Merck as the president of its vaccine division and Merck gave her a salary of 2 5 million dollars a year and 38 million dollars in stock options And that kind of dough buys a lot of loyalty from regulators They know what s at the end of the line for them if they behave and if they do what Merck and the other company has asked them", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:childrenshealthdefense.org_news_rfk-jr-video-and-facts-about-gardasil.txt:16:12a92af9f53f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx":

believing that it may someday save her life doesn t know about the risk and perils and the inefficacy that are attended to that vaccine cause that regulators from whom he s getting or she s getting her information have been corrupted by this company And most of you probably know this is a difficult issue for people like myself who are concerned with vaccine injuries to address because the press will not cover these issues because there s 5 4 billion dollars that go from these companies to advertising on TV and radio and newspapers and on the web every year and nobody wants to lose advertising revenue And the Congress has been bought off the regulatory agencies have been captured and we can t use the courts because you can t sue a vaccine maker for injuring yourself or your child We ve figured out ways around those laws and we re going to sue Merck And if you are Merck and you re listening to this tape We re going to come for you and we re gonna get justice for these

Poul Thorsen is subject of a 22 count indictment by the US Department of Justice for wire fraud and money laundering in connection with more than 1 million in research grants that he allegedly pilfered from CDC as he was ginning up fraudulent studies to prove that vaccines don t cause autism 2 His crimes have won him a slot on HHS s most wanted list 3 Oddly US Officials have not requested an extradition order against Thorson despite a treaty providing for extradition between the US and Denmark Thorsen has also been disgraced and dismissed by his former employer Aarhus University 4 As of 2014 Denmark s university hospital system has permanently expelled him from practice The fact that he is roaming free and is easy to find despite the US Federal indictment does not imply Thorsen s innocence as Willingham suggests Rather it suggests a lack of enthusiasm by HHS and CDC to press for his capture and extradition The agency undoubtedly fears that a public trial would expose the pervasive corruption throughout CDC s vaccine division and the fragility of the science supporting CDC s claims about thimerosal safety Dr Thorsen is one of the co authors and data manager for two leading foreign studies offered by CDC as the foundation of its claims that vaccines do not cause autism Only purposeful misstatement or journalistic sloth can account for Willingham s declaration that Thorsen s conclusions have not been called into question For over a decade myriad critics have exposed those studies as brazen fraud Thorsen s thimerosal study Madsen et al 2003 5 is one of the

phase out of thimerosal it required for the first time that outpatient autism cases be reported on the government s national health registry Prior to 1993 only inpatient cases were reported representing approximately 7 of the total The new requirements increased the reported autism cases by thirteen fold 7 Furthermore the registry s inpatient body count prior to 1993 omitted the patients at Copenhagen s largest autism clinic which housed 20 of the national total After 1993 the clinic s patients were included 8 Finally Denmark enlarged the diagnostic criteria for autism in 1994 increasing the potential number of autism cases in the registry by up to 25 fold 9 Dr Thorsen and his cronies took advantage of the artificial rise caused by the new registry rules to fraudulently conclude that real autism incidence had increased following thimerosal s ban This of course was craven chicanery but the fraud got worse Despite the cheats in the Madsen et al 2003 paper the Registry data still showed a pesky drop in autism rates between 1999 and 2001 in 7 9 year old children This was significant since these children were the first generation born after Denmark s thimerosal phase out in 1992 Leaked CDC documents show that the authors responded to this with an audacious breach of established protocols deleting that entire year class from the final published version of the study That maneuver constituted scientific fraud of the highest order CDC scientists deliberately manipulated the final dataset to prevent public disclosure of the decrease in autism since it did not support the study s conclusion that there was no association between thimerosal and autism Secret CDC emails obtained by SafeMinds via former Congressman Dave Weldon show that the decision to omit the

That study employed CDC s trademark ruse of including many children who were too young to receive the autism diagnosis which at that point usually occurred at age four CDC epidemiologists have consistently used this ploy in their phony autism studies to dampen the autism signal and exonerate the vaccine 33 The 2002 Madsen et al MMR study also included a substantial number of unvaccinated children and employed a suite of other statistical gimmicks to mask the association with the MMR vaccine Having trained as a foreign visiting scientist in CDC s sophisticated fraud during his

The Message of Measles What The New Yorker Wouldn t Publish Robert F Kennedy Jr s Response to The Message of Measles What The New Yorker Wouldn t Publish By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied CHD NOTE In late August 2019 New Yorker magazine published an article written by staff writer Nick Paumgarten entitled The Message of Measles In the article Mr Paumgarten criticized Robert F Kennedy Jr s beliefs and advocacy After contacting numerous New Yorker editors the magazine has refused to publish Mr Kennedy s response If his response had been published New Yorker readers would know that the latest published science supports that vaccines are contributing to the chronic disease epidemic in children and that government officials systematically obscure the risks while exaggerating the benefits of vaccines including the MMR They would also be reminded that the government has no right to coerce healthy Americans to submit to risky medical procedures The gravamen of Nick Paumgarten s article in the New Yorker on the measles vaccine is his argument that the people he derisively terms anti vaxxers are irrational since the risks of vaccines are so low and the rewards so enormous In my experience virtually all so called anti vaxxers are parents of vaccine injured children whose personal tragedies provoked them to look closely at the complex science supporting that risk reward assertion and to rationally conclude that government officials with well documented conflicts of interest with the 50 billion vaccine industry systematically obscure the risks while exaggerating the benefits of vaccines including the MMR In fact no one can say scientifically that any one of the 70 vaccine doses currently recommended for American children saves more lives than it costs Mr Paumgarten falls into this trap by parroting the industry canard that measles will kill 1 in 1000 infected Americans But CDC s mortality and morbidity data suggest that measles fatalities in the pre vaccine era were 1 500 000 population wide 1 in 10 000 among infected individuals In fact no one can say scientifically that any one of the 70 vaccine doses currently recommended for American children saves more lives than it costs That question can only be answered by studies that compare long term health outcomes in vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations Despite concerns over inadequate safety science by the Institute of Medicine the ultimate arbiter of vaccine safety science captive regulators at HHS have refused to perform such studies and have exempted vaccine makers from performing randomized placebo controlled tests prior to licensing HHS requires such studies for virtually all other pharmaceutical products That means that no one knows vaccine risk profiles Mr

42 days of the injection and 55 suffered respiratory illnesses symptoms that might persuade rational consumers to choose the infections over the vaccine Merck acknowledges that an astonishing 26 of post pubertal females might develop arthritis and arthralgia from the MMR The MMR s package insert includes an almost two page listing of over 60 adverse reactions ranging from vomiting and

injuries Merck acknowledges that an astonishing 26 of post pubertal females might develop arthritis and arthralgia from the MMR A 2017 letter published in the British Medical Journal cited research showing that children receiving the MMR vaccine had five times the seizure rate of children with measles infections A 2004 JAMA study found that an additional 1 in 640 children has seizures after MMR compared to unvaccinated children about 5 of these will progress to epilepsy HHS s voluntary post marketing surveillance program on vaccines VAERS reports over 89 000 adverse reactions to MMR through March 31 2018 including 445 deaths However VAERS is a voluntary and notoriously ineffective system VAERS captures fewer than 1 of vaccine injuries according to a 2010 HHS funded study performed by another federal agency the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality AHRQ If you multiply the known adverse events from the MMR by 100 you get 44 500 deaths and 8 900 000 injuries making the measles vaccine far worse than measles That AHRQ pilot study reported a possible reaction for 2 6 of vaccinations When CDC officials saw these alarming figures they quickly cancelled a machine counting system

True History Behind Salon s Retraction of my Deadly Immunity Article By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied Key Facts Salon removed my piece Deadly Immunity years after its publication Salon cited no new factual mistakes to support its retraction Parroting CDC Pharma talking points Salon s Editor at Large Joan Walsh explained that Salon had simply lost faith in the science that links thimerosal to brain injuries Salon cited no science to support its opinion it simply adopted the opinion of the pharmaceutical cartel Rolling Stone which co published the article found nothing of merit in Salon s explanation for its retraction and continues to stand by the piece Salon s Editor Kerry Lauerman suggested that he removed the piece to help launch a pro CDC pro thimerosal book by Salon s in house writer Seth Mnookin The six original corrections to Deadly Immunity in 2005 addressed minor errors mainly editing gaffs made by Salon and Rolling Stone editors None of those errors were material to the article s central proposition Salon s founder and former Editor in Chief David Talbot faults Salon for caving in to the pharmaceutical cartel In January 2011 Salon deleted my article Deadly Immunity from its website six years after its publication 1 My critics have widely cited the Salon retraction to discredit me and my insistence that thimerosal is a potent neurotoxin that should not be in medicines In recent years newspaper editors and television producers have repeatedly cited Salon s action as justification for their decisions to not run my editorials articles and letters to the editor or to allow me to talk about vaccine safety on the air For this reason I now briefly review the history of Salon s withdrawal I published Deadly Immunity simultaneously in Rolling Stone and Salon online on June 16 2005 The article laid out the scientific link between thimerosal and childhood neurological disorders and published for the first time explosive excerpts from the transcripts of CDC s secretive June 2000 Simpsonwood conference which brought together vaccine makers and the government public health officials who regulate mandate and distribute vaccines The transcripts revealed conference participants discussing an unpublished CDC study linking thimerosal exposure to brain injuries including autism and debating strategies for keeping the secret from the public Both Salon and Rolling Stone scrupulously fact checked the article The Simpsonwood transcripts are now available online so that any reader can directly verify the accuracy of my recounting 2 During the

s central propositions Four were minor clarifications or corrections of inadvertent editing or punctuation errors and one was a wrong name applied to a congressional staffer The only error to rise above the level of trivial nitpicking was the assertion that a six month old infant could receive a level of mercury from vaccines that was 187 times greater than the EPA s limit for daily exposure to methylmercury a related neurotoxin As the email record exchanges with editors from the time period confirm that error along with most of the others was made by Rolling Stone and Salon editors as they cut my 16 000 word submission to 4 700 words 4 In the days after the publication of the correction in both Rolling Stone and Salon editor Joan Walsh apologized to me in writing for introducing those errors themselves By the time Salon retracted my article six years later its editor had apparently forgotten Salon s role in creating the errors Under a barrage of criticism from the very government health regulators who had participated in Simpsonwood Rolling Stone and Salon hastily corrected the 187 times calculation to state that the child would only receive a dose 40 greater than EPA s daily maximum safe exposure I was on a wilderness trip at the time so both publications printed the errata without consulting me When I returned I argued forcefully that this correction was deceptive and should not be allowed to stand Although the original calculation was slightly off it was far closer to the truth than their correction Here s the math the Environmental Protection Agency s guideline for protecting against methyl mercury exposure is 0 1 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day Using that guideline A 7 pound child on its day of birth was exposed to 12 5 micrograms of mercury or 38 times the EPA guideline was exposed to 12 5 micrograms of mercury or At two months a 12 pound baby would receive 117 times the EPA level a 12 pound baby would receive At 4 months weighing 15 lbs the child received another 50 micrograms which is 74 times the EPA guideline weighing 15 lbs the child received another 50 micrograms which is At 6 months weighing 17 lbs the typical exposure was 62 5

79 lbs Body Weights are taken from the CDC data tables cdc gov nchs Based on EPA s maximum recommended daily exposure for methyl mercury Since mercury accumulates in the body these exposures cumulatively exceed the EPA guidelines by far more than the 187 times estimate originally published by Salon and Rolling Stone Finally the 40 over figure that Salon used in its correction makes no sense whatsoever in relation to the EPA guideline To this day I m not sure where they came up with that number After two weeks of badgering by me Salon and Rolling Stone issued a mangled clarification of their earlier correction that had introduced the forty percent figure Keep in mind that 40 over is only 1 4 times the EPA guideline Incidentally the true risk to children from these exposures far exceeds the 187 magnifier I say this because the EPA based its guideline on the risk of orally ingesting METHYL mercury which we know from primate studies is less persistent in the brain than the ETHYL mercury in vaccines Furthermore the neurotoxicity of ethylmercury is greatly amplified when combined with the aluminum adjuvant that is present in pediatric vaccines The danger of course would be even higher for smaller babies Six years later Salon precipitously took down the piece on Sunday January 16 2011 during the Martin Luther King Jr holiday weekend My only prior warning was an email

take my calls protesting the retraction In a published note explaining the retraction Salon s editor at large Joan Walsh never mentioned any new errors that Salon may have found in my piece Nor does she cite any scientific studies Instead she parrots CDC s talking points that thimerosal is safe citing continued revelations of the flaws and even fraud tainting the science 6 linking thimerosal to neurological disorders That vague proclamation serves as Salon s official rationale for defenestrating my article Walsh dutifully promised in the future to exercise critical pursuit of others who continue to propagate the debunked and dangerous autism vaccine link A careful reading of Walsh s statement shows that Salon did not attribute fraud to me Neither Lauerman nor anyone else at Salon ever cited a factual error that caused Salon to remove my piece And despite my requests the publication has never provided me the specific errors that led its editors to take this extreme measure Mnookin s book is a patently erroneous recitation of Pharma CDC talking points It is devoid of any serious scientific analysis Mnookin simply insists that thimerosal is safe and then engages in an overheated and venomous pop psychological screed against vaccine safety advocates Mnookin s devotes an incoherent chapter to criticizing me in The Panic Virus The True Story Behind the Vaccine Autism

was open to a wide range of views particularly those that were controversial or contested within the mainstream media Removing your article from the Salon archives was a violation of that spirit and smacks of editorial cowardice If I had been editor at the time I would not have done so and I would have offered you the opportunity to debate your critics in Salon s pages In my day Salon did not

Courts Have Ruled Cell Phones Cause Brain Tumors On Jan 13 2020 Turin s Court of Appeals confirmed a 2017 decision determining that a former Telecom Italia worker s acoustic neuroma a benign tumor in the ear was caused by his mobile phone use This is the sixth time that an Italian court has affirmed a causal link between cell phone use and brain tumors including decisions by the High Court of Italy The Appellate court reached its decision after a review of the evidence and after receiving the opinion of two court appointed experts The experts referred the court to studies indicating that individuals who speak on their phones for an average of 30 minutes a day for at least 10 years increase their risk of developing head tumors After considering this evidence the Appellate court in Turin stated There are solid elements to affirm a causal role between the exposure of the person to radiofrequencies from mobile phones and the disease that arose studies provided by the defense which denied a causal link were mostly industry funded and therefore should be given less weight because of conflicts of interest Crucially the Turin court stated that the studies provided by the defense which denied a causal link were mostly industry funded and therefore should be given less weight because of conflicts of interest Studies by members of the International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection ICNIRP and the European Commission s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks SCHENIHR also suffer from conflicts of interest according to the Turin court because these organizations likewise receive funding from industry The World Health Organization s WHO s International EMF Project and many countries around the world have adopted the industry funded ICNIRP s recommendations as their safety guidelines Thus these statements by the court calling out the influence of industry funding and conflicts of interest are extremely significant The Turin court s ruling affirmed the decision of the court of Ivera from 2017 Roberto Romeo age 57 used his cell phone for three to four hours of each working day for 15 years He was diagnosed with acoustic neuroma in 2010 and his acoustic nerve had to be removed As reported in The Guardian A medical expert estimated the damage to Romeo at 23 of his bodily function prompting the judge to make a

Acoustic neuroma is also known as vestibular schwannoma because it develops on the Schwann cells covering the nerve Of note the U S government s 25 million National Toxicology Program cell phone study found that exposure to cell phone radiation caused schwannoma type tumors Newsweek mistakenly reported the Ivrea case as the first Italian ruling linking cell phones and acoustic neuromas but it was in fact the second The first ruling made by a court in Brescia on December 10 2009 and affirmed by the High Court of Italy in 2012 granted worker s compensation to an industrial plant s financial manager Mr Marcolini who developed a tumor after using cell and cordless phones for five to six hours a day for 12 years Marcolini was diagnosed as having a benign tumor on the trigeminal nerve which controls facial muscles and sensations As in Turin the Brescia court ignored industry funded studies declaring them to be biased and instead relied on the expert opinion of Swedish professor Lennart Hardell an oncology specialist and cancer epidemiologist with a focused interest in environmental risk factors for cancer The next third ruling to link cell phone use and acute nerve disease was made by a Florence court in April 2017 The Florence court ordered INAIL to compensate a salesperson who developed an acoustic neuroma after using the phone for two to three hours a day on the job for 10 years An occupational hazard On January 30 2019 an Italian court in the city of Monza ruled that exposure to cell phone radiation caused an airport employee s acoustic neuroma brain tumor The employee

absence of absolutely conclusive scientific evidence Over a period from 1994 to 2010 the airport employee s job had exposed him to high levels of radiofrequency and microwave radiation from a variety of antennas and high frequency equipment including altitude signal repeaters weather radars satellite antennas and airplane equipment In addition the performance of his job required the use of numerous radiation emitting devices including mobile phones two always on PCs and signal repeaters GSM and DECT Holding the phone on the left side of his head the employee used a Siemens DECT cordless phone a Nokia and later a Samsung cell phone for more than four hours a day with phone sessions lasting up to 45 consecutive minutes Several times the employee and his colleagues reported the high levels of electromagnetic fields EMFs and radiation to their employer asking for the EMFs and radiation to be measured but higher ups ignored these requests In the Italian legal system judges can appoint technical experts called court technical experts CTUs In the Monza case the experts and technical advisers assigned to evaluate the case conducted research into acoustic neuroma and its risk factors Basing their determination on the duration of exposure exposure to high frequency EMR for a considerable number of hours per day for over 10 years the types of devices used the type of pathology and their review of the literature they determined the evidence to be sufficient for a causal link even in the absence of absolutely conclusive scientific evidence They also referenced the Brescia court s decision and the studies cited in that decision Their conclusion was that the development of the left auditory nerve neuroma was related to the employee s workplace exposures and that the tumor had caused a reduction in the employee s mental and physical health Thus in case after case Italian courts have determined that the radiofrequency and microwave radiation emitted by cell phones can cause acoustic neuroma type brain tumors The importance of these decisions should not be underestimated particularly given the courts recognition that when exposure to electromagnetic

About Vaccine Safety By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied A note from the Children s Health Defense Team In June of this year at the invitation of the Rochester Minnesota Post Bulletin Children s Health Defense Chairman Robert F Kennedy Jr submitted the following article for publication The newspaper had invited Mr Kennedy to submit an editorial after he complained about inaccuracies in the paper s reports on the Somali measles outbreak While initially agreeing to publish the article Post Bulletin executive editor Jay Furst ultimately declined to run the piece The paper made the decision in late September following almost four months of revisions discussions and email exchanges with Mr Kennedy Furst explained that after five months of trying the publication had been unable to find any public health official or pro vaccine advocate willing to write a rebuttal or refute the facts outlined by Mr Kennedy Mr Furst explained that Minnesota public health officials shown the article had made a generalized complaint that it was inaccurate but that they refused to be specific about their claims or to provide citations None of the many public health officials and vaccine advocates contacted by the newspaper were willing to go on record or to provide a rebuttal editorial Nevertheless Mr Furst explained that because of the controversial nature of this issue the editors felt that they could not run the article without a companion rebuttal piece Once again public debate regarding the safety of the 46 billion vaccine industry has been muzzled Mr Kennedy says that Mr Furst was genial diligent and professional in all their interactions and genuinely apologetic about the outcome According to a Minnesota Department of Health press release the state s measles outbreak was over by the end of August with 79 confirmed measles cases and no reported deaths or disabilities This winter Minneapolis area health officials reported 76 measles cases among Somali Americans Mainstream media outlets most recently John Oliver in a 28 minute rant vilified Somali Americans for low vaccine rates and blamed Andrew Wakefield MD and the so called anti vaccine movement for misleading Somalis about vaccine safety Like most other journalists Oliver never explained the story behind this story the children of Minneapolis s Somalis suffer the highest known rate of severe autism in the world

black boys who received the MMR vaccine prior to three years old as the CDC recommends were 3 36 times more likely to receive an autism diagnosis than those who waited This effect was not observed in other race categories Nevertheless when the CDC published the study results in Pediatrics in 2004 the agency omitted the destroyed data fraudulently declaring it found no risk of autism from the MMR vaccination A recent Mayo Clinic study shows that Somalis antibody response to the rubella component of the MMR vaccine is twice as high as among Caucasians That finding may support parental reports of regression of Somali children into autism after vaccination A 2014 study published in Pediatrics showed higher rates of autistic disorder among African Americans in Los Angeles County compared to Caucasians The relative risk of severe autism was 152 higher among U S born blacks as compared to U S born whites and an astonishing 263 higher among foreign born blacks Perhaps most tellingly a 2010 study in Stockholm Sweden replicated an earlier study by the same team showing a 4 to 5 times increased risk of severe autism in Somali children compared to non Somali children The Minnesota Somali

"Studies Link Heavy Metals to the Explosion of Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Declining IQ in American Children Studies Link Heavy Metals to the Explosion of Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Declining IQ in American Children By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied A silent pandemic of neurodevelopmental toxicity is disabling a generation of children around the world This is the verdict of neurology experts Philippe Grandjean and Philip Landrigan in a 2014 report in Lancet Neurology The staggering tsunami of developmental disabilities now affects at least one in six children in the U S and millions more worldwide Two new studies suggest that the most common of these illnesses autism spectrum disorder ASD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD and tics are related to each other and may share common causation The culprit Environmental toxins particularly heavy metals About 11 or one in nine 4 17 year olds have received an ADHD diagnosis and in some states as many as 19 The most recent ASD estimates in the U S from 2014 data report a prevalence of one in 45 children representing a significant increase compared to 2011 2013 Adding to the worry scientists and physicians are increasingly seeing children with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders Children with comorbid diagnoses i e more than one disorder often have greater levels of emotional behavioral and educational impairment and the need for more intensive treatment Notably ASD and ADHD frequently co occur The current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM V recognizes this trend by allowing for a combined diagnosis whereas prior versions DSM IV and DSM IV TR barred simultaneous ADHD and ASD diagnoses Neurodevelopmental disorders overlap even in the general population A new UK based study in the Journal of Attention Disorders explores undiagnosed ADHD and ASD in a population of mostly female adult volunteers drawn from the general population The researchers included only participants who had never received a diagnosis of ADHD ASD dyslexia or another mental disorder Participants completed four online questionnaires that measured ADHD and ASD traits The researchers classified one fifth 20 of the participants as having ADHD despite their lack of a prior diagnosis A substantial proportion 4 3 of undiagnosed participants also had a score indicative of at least mild autism The investigators noted considerable overlap between ADHD and ASD traits particularly for pragmatic language knowing what to say how to say it when to say it and generally how to act around others during conversation and for attention related skills An intriguing correlation between seemingly contradictory measures of distractibility ADHD and hyperfocus ASD

the International Review of Neurobiology also found an overlap in neurodevelopmental disorders The study s authors note that 85 to 90 of patients with Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders have comorbidities and manifest an overlapping spectrum of sensory behavioral cognitive and sleep related problems that have a major impact on their functioning and quality of life These comorbidities commonly include ADHD ASD obsessive compulsive disorder OCD and mood and anxiety disorders These data support prior studies showing that the rate of Tourette syndrome in autistic children is almost seven times higher 6 5 than the rate for children drawn from the general population 0 95 share a common mechanism and represent a comorbid condition that links nervous system injuries to immune system damage Many other studies of comorbidities have suggested that ADHD is comorbid with a wide range of other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders including dyslexia depression oppositional defiant disorder and eating disorders One group of researchers has even postulated that ADHD and allergic rhinitis share a common mechanism and represent a comorbid condition that links nervous system injuries to immune system damage This suggests that perhaps a single toxic culprit may be causing both kinds of damage simultaneously All of these studies raise the question of whether these concurrent disorders represent a neurodevelopmental continuum that transcends traditional diagnostic boundaries Multiple metals Multiple studies have pointed to heavy metals as the leading culprit in the cascade of neurodevelopmental disorders Moreover the effects of heavy metals on cognition and behavior are synergistic Co exposure to multiple metals can result in increased neurotoxicity compared to single metal exposure in particular during early life Research indicates for example that ADHD and problems such as sleep disturbances are more prevalent in children who live near coal ash which contains metals such as lead mercury and arsenic children with ASD have significantly higher blood levels of arsenic and mercury compared to healthy controls and autistic children have higher levels of mercury lead and aluminum in their hair compared to matched controls environmental toxins are causing widespread brain injury and loss of function across a generation of children Where are we

disorders Harvard researcher David Bellinger has noted the urgency of paying more attention to subclinical effects For example many environmental toxins decrease IQ Bellinger states Even a modest impact that does not push a child s neurodevelopment into the range of clinical concern cannot be dismissed as benign because if the exposure is prevalent the total number of IQ points lost in the population as a whole might be large and the reduction in the intellectual resources available to a society substantial Citing Bellinger s work a group of Oregon researchers reports that a 5 point decrease in mean IQ would increase the cognitively impaired population by 57 Far from being little adults children are uniquely vulnerable to environmental toxins Not only is the human brain exquisitely sensitive to the impacts of environmental toxicant exposures during development but it can serve as the canary in the coal mine for such exposures Yet even though U S children s

B vaccine on their first day of life The infants toddlers and young children receiving this vaccine face little to no chance of hepatitis B infection but the vaccines impose significant risks including the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders autoimmune illness and even death In the 0 1 age group there is at least a 20 1 ratio of reported vaccine injuries deaths associated with hepatitis B

B vaccination mandates fail to honor young children s liberty equal protection and health unless their mothers harbor the virus determined by routine prenatal blood testing newborns are probably the least likely human beings on the planet at risk of actually getting hepatitis B The U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP strongly recommend that newborn babies get the hepatitis B vaccine on their first day of life About 12 million doses are administered to American babies in any given year However unless their mothers harbor the virus determined by routine prenatal blood testing newborns are probably the least likely human beings on the planet at risk of actually getting hepatitis B Infection risks are also extremely low for young school age children but in all but two states Alabama and South Dakota three to four doses of hepatitis B vaccine are not only recommended but mandated for preschool attendance K 12 education or both New cases of hepatitis B were low in the 1970s they began climbing in the early 1980s coincident with the HIV AIDS epidemic but then started falling again Although the CDC first began recommending hepatitis B vaccination on a limited basis in 1982 for the small population of at risk adults and infants of infected mothers the agency attributes the decline in hepatitis B cases during the 1980s and early 1990s to reduction of transmission among men who have sex with men and injection drug users as a result of HIV prevention efforts At the time hepatitis B was a relatively obscure infection

From the beginning hepatitis B vaccines have had their critics who question the public health logic of across the board hepatitis B vaccination for infants and children Whereas the young people being vaccinated face little to no chance of hepatitis B infection the vaccines impose significant risks including the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders autoimmune illness and even death In the decade from 1991 to 2001 when hepatitis B vaccines contained the mercury based preservative thimerosal vaccine exposure in early infancy resulted in an estimated 0 5 1 million U S children being diagnosed with learning disabilities representing lifetime costs in excess of 1 trillion Other hepatitis B vaccine ingredients including aluminum adjuvants and yeast as well as the vaccines use of recombinant DNA technology have been linked to a variety of adverse outcomes In 1986 five years before the CDC began pushing for vaccination of all newborns the nation documented fewer than 280 cases of hepatitis B infection in children under age 14 by 2006 the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS had received over 23 000 reports of adverse events related to hepatitis B vaccination in the 0 14 age group including nearly 800 deaths In congressional testimony in 1999 the father of a five week old who died immediately following a hepatitis B shot described a 20 1 ratio of VAERS reports compared to cases of hepatitis B infection in the 0 1 age group likely an underestimate due to VAERS underreporting Given that the vaccine has been shown by the CDC itself to wear off well before the age of any likely exposure to hepatitis B virus the father concluded that hepatitis B mandates for newborns represented a teaming up of ravenous corporate greed and mindless bureaucracy against common sense The

made by New York University legal scholar Mary Holland in a far reaching discussion of hepatitis B vaccine mandates in the Yale Journal of Health Policy Law and Ethics published in 2013 As Holland explains the 1905 Supreme Court decision that set the stage for vaccine mandates Jacobson v Massachusetts did so in response to the markedly different one disease one vaccine context of smallpox Although the Court upheld smallpox mandates in most cases noncompliant individuals faced no worse than a relatively small monetary fine Subsequent courts however have used Jacobson to justify results that the original decision did not condone vaccination mandates exclusively for children with no imminent disease outbreaks and with serious penalties for noncompliance not just forfeiture of the right to an education but also outcomes such as social isolation parents loss of custodial rights child neglect sanctions against parents and even forced vaccination neither the federal government nor states have alleged that hepatitis B transmission among preschoolers is a serious threat to public health Holland finds the constitutionality of hepatitis B vaccine mandates for preschoolers questionable particularly in light of other legal precedents What might happen if today s Supreme Court were to evaluate a legal challenge to a state s hepatitis B mandate Although the Court s historical track record displays a legal tug of war between limits set on individual liberty and support for individuals fundamental claims to bodily integrity and autonomy Holland suggests that the Court s fairly reasoned answer to each of the following six questions ought to be a clear no Is there a sufficient public health necessity to impose a preschool hepatitis B vaccination mandate Holland observes that neither the federal government nor states have alleged that hepatitis B transmission among preschoolers is a serious threat to public health Does a vaccination mandate for preschoolers constitute a reasonable means of addressing hepatitis B in broader society At least two factors undermine the presumption of reasonableness including shockingly inadequate safety testing in the targeted age groups infants and young children and poor long term efficacy The prelicensure clinical trials for GlaxoSmithKline s Engerix B vaccine monitored about 5 000 subjects adults and children

vaccine involved a grand total of 147 infants and children monitored for five days after each dose Is a hepatitis B vaccination mandate proportionate to the risk of disease i e do disease risks outweigh vaccine risks Holland states that this would be very difficult to prove since incidence of the disease in the preschool population is exceedingly low yet the risks of adverse events from the vaccine including anaphylaxis encephalopathy and death are well documented Does the government provide for harm avoidance and offer a fair process for allowing medical exemptions Medical exemptions were one of the core requirements established by the 1905 Jacobson decision A federal policy that arm twists parents into vaccinating their newborns whose medical history is largely a blank slate makes harm avoidance almost impossible Is the hepatitis B vaccination mandate non discriminatory A mandate imposed on young children not primarily for their benefit can be construed as arbitrary and discriminatory in application Do parents have a liberty interest in being able to refuse an unwanted medical intervention Holland notes that the Court has repeatedly acknowledged that the right to bodily integrity and to refuse unwanted medical treatment is deeply rooted in the historical traditions of the United States Prescient Justices Holland s conclusion is straightforward The hepatitis B vaccination mandate has failed to honor young children s liberty equal protection and health In support of this conclusion she cites comments by three past Supreme Court Justices over the century since Jacobson Justice Harlan foresaw in 1905 that mandates might be exercised in such arbitrary unreasonable manner or might go so far beyond what was reasonably required for the safety of the public as to authorize or compel the courts to interfere for the protection of such persons In 1942 Justice Jackson cautioned that There are limits to the extent to which a legislatively represented majority may conduct biological experiments at the expense of a minority And in 1990 Justice Stevens discussed the sanctity and individual privacy of the human body as obviously fundamental to liberty adding that every violation of a person s body is an invasion of his or her liberty Holland also reminds us that the millions of doses of hepatitis B vaccine administered to babies every year represent a

Kennedy Jr Link copied Children s Health Defense Team Note The lessons learned from the ongoing saga of thimerosal are significant to all who care about vaccine safety want justice for the injured and to prevent future harm The government has said they corrected the thimerosal issue and want us to believe the case is closed But has the public been fooled with swapping one heavy metal toxicity for another While thimerosal is still in some flu shots and is especially harmful to pregnant women infants and children there are increasing amounts of aluminum exposures from vaccines as more shots are added to the schedule Like early reports about mercury now children s toxic profiles show alarming amounts of aluminum And the problems don t end with heavy metals There are other vaccine contaminants that can cause harm like retroviruses formaldehyde and aborted human fetal tissue In short we are in desperate need of an agency that can protect our citizens especially children from vaccine injuries How can the controversy and handling of thimerosal containing vaccines instruct us as we move forward for real reform Thimerosal is the infamous mercury containing preservative in use to this day in some vaccines and also in dozens of other pharmaceutical products approved by the Food and Drug Administration FDA 1 3 Public health agencies government regulators and medical trade groups have repeatedly declared thimerosal to be safe 4 5 but the published peer reviewed science argues that nothing could be further from the truth For anyone who bothers to investigate thimerosal s appalling record there is a vast still accumulating and compelling body of research that contradicts the public health establishment s deceptive safety claims Thimerosal is almost 50 percent ethylmercury by weight Ethylmercury is an organic mercury compound with toxicity mechanisms similar to methylmercury 6 the hazardous type of mercury in seafood The danger posed by both types of mercury was evident in earlier eras when fungicides containing either ethyl or methylmercury poisoned farmers sometimes on a large scale from the 1950s through the 1970s 7 8 Of the two compounds the ethylmercury in vaccines is far more toxic to and persistent in the brain where it has a propensity to accumulate as inorganic mercury 9 10 with an estimated half life of as long as twenty seven years 11 History of thimerosal

under the trade name Merthiolate later that year they did not consider the possibility of mercury induced brain damage Eli Lilly researchers reported in 1931 that animals seemed to tolerate high doses of thimerosal However many of those animals died of evident mercury poisoning just days after the study ended Also noteworthy is the fact that in early animal toxicity studies and many later research efforts researchers did not assess socialization behaviors or perform cognition tests In other words they did not consider the possibility of mercury induced brain damage During this same time period the Eli Lilly researchers reported on the first injections of thimerosal into humans The unlucky recipients of large doses of Merthiolate were twenty two patients hospitalized during a 1929 epidemic of meningococcal meningitis in Indianapolis The thimerosal had no apparent therapeutic benefit and all twenty two patients died seven of them within one day of thimerosal administration The researchers nevertheless described the experiment as a success and a published paper stated that these large doses did not produce any anaphylactoid or shock symptoms neither of which is associated with toxic mercury exposure However the clinician who treated the meningitis patients apparently was not convinced of thimerosal s efficacy stating Beneficial effects of the drug were not definitely proven Moreover any short term neurological or other deleterious effects of the thimerosal would likely have been masked by or attributed to the patients meningitis infections For decades Eli Lilly promoted its confident version of the Indianapolis results as evidence of thimerosal s safety paving the way for thimerosal s inclusion in various antiseptic products including nasal sprays eyewashes vaginal spermicides and diaper rash treatments This escalation of thimerosal use in consumer products occurred despite numerous studies from the 1930s showing that thimerosal was not in fact highly germicidal and actually was more effective at destroying human cells than killing pathogens Thimerosal never measured up to its supposed raison d être of safely preventing microbial contamination and

vaccine in their first eighteen months The DTP vaccine contained fifty micrograms of thimerosal per shot translating into one hundred micrograms of mercury exposure by eighteen months In 1986 after more and more people began suing vaccine manufacturers for serious vaccine injuries primarily related to the DTP vaccine Congress took the unprecedented step of granting vaccine manufacturers full immunity from lawsuits The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 established a compensation program as an alternative remedy to judicial action for specified vaccine related injuries 13 By making it impossible for vaccine injured plaintiffs to sue pharmaceutical companies the result whether intended or unintended was to eliminate any financial incentive to make vaccine safety a priority By making it impossible for vaccine injured plaintiffs to sue pharmaceutical companies the result whether intended or unintended was to eliminate any financial incentive to make vaccine safety a priority Beginning in 1989 the CDC s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP began steadily increasing the types and total number of vaccines required for school attendance including thimerosal containing vaccines By 1999 the expanded vaccine schedule called for children to receive nineteen vaccine injections by age two eleven of which contained thimerosal Children born in the 1990s could be injected therefore with up to 237 5 micrograms of mercury by their second birthday and as much as 62 5 micrograms at a single doctor s visit In my book Thimerosal Let the Science Speak

damaged sick kids Something very very wrong is happening to our children School nurses were not the only ones to call attention to the mounting evidence that thimerosal containing vaccines were having neurotoxic effects In response to pressure from Congress and the public the FDA conducted a review in the late 1990s that found that the amount of mercury in the childhood vaccine schedule surpassed some federal safety guidelines Accordingly the U S Public Health Service USPHS and the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP issued a lukewarm statement in 1999 about thimerosal s potential risks The statement s authors called for the phase out of thimerosal containing vaccines as expeditiously as possible while still avowing that the large risks of not vaccinating children far outweigh the unknown and probably much smaller risk if any of cumulative exposure to thimerosal containing vaccines over the first 6 months of life 15 Simpsonwood cabal A year later June 7 8 2000 the CDC convened a secret scientific review panel of over fifty experts who began backpedaling from the AAP USPHS pronouncement 16 The group that met at the Simpsonwood Retreat Center near Atlanta included high ranking CDC and FDA representatives state and international public health officials vaccine company representatives and others At the outset the meeting s chair immunologist Richard Johnston expressed regret that the group had not met to consider the data sooner in advance of the public health decisions to phase out thimerosal that were made last summer Further betraying his preconceptions Johnston stated that there was no evidence of a problem only a theoretical concern that young infants developing brains were being exposed to an organomercurial Despite these apparent attempts to make the association go away Verstraeten was obligated to present the troublesome finding of linear and statistically significant dose related relationships between thimerosal exposure and neurodevelopmental

less than persuaded by Verstraeten s results Some such as John Clements of the World Health Organization s Expanded Program on Immunization focused more on the public relations implications Clements stated I hear the majority of the consultants say that they are not convinced there is a causality direct link between Thimerosal and various neurological outcomes The research results have to be handled and even if this committee decides that there is no association through freedom of information that will be taken by others and will be used in other ways beyond the control of this group My mandate is to make sure that 100 000 000 are immunized with DTP Hepatitis B and if possible Hib this year next year and for many years to come and that will have to be with Thimerosal containing

17 While acknowledging that the signal deserved further investigation and raised some perhaps disquieting possibilities Stehr Green concluded that there was not anything close to sufficient evidence to support a finding of a causal relationship Pediatrician William Weil observed that the number of kids getting help in special education is growing nationally and state by state at a rate we have not seen before Attendee William Weil a pediatrician representing the AAP noted that even accepting Stehr Green s assertion that Verstraeten hadn t proven a link to neurodevelopmental disorders it was alarming that he hadn t disproven it and there was insufficient evidence he pointed out to reject a possible causal relationship He stated that the possibility that the associations could be causal has major significance for public and professional acceptance of thimerosal containing vaccines Weil also observed that the number of kids getting help in special education is growing nationally and state by state at a rate we have not seen before Another of his observations was that thimerosal in vaccines represented repeated acute exposures and that the earlier you work with the central nervous system the more likely you are to run into a sensitive period for one of these neurodevelopmental effects Finally Weil pointed out the limitations of epidemiological studies calling for further indepth animal and developmental neurotoxicity studies and stating Some of the really gutsy questions from a person who is very concerned about neurodevelopment cannot be answered out of this At the same time Weil cautioned others not to overly minimize or play with the VSD data Weil was the only reviewer present to rate the association between thimerosal and the neurodevelopmental outcomes as

autism and four out of the five were done on foreign populations with minimal exposure to thimerosal Three of the five studies were published in a compromised journal Pediatrics which receives a significant portion of its revenue from vaccine makers In 2002 the AAP dutifully retired its 1999 joint statement on thimerosal 23 In January 2013 the AAP went even further in several articles in Pediatrics going on record in favor of exempting thimerosal from an international treaty on the elimination of avoidable mercury exposures 24 The notion that trace amounts of a substance as highly toxic as mercury might be benign is exceedingly misleading Fallacy of trace amounts Even when vaccines do not contain thimerosal as a preservative manufacturers use it in some single dose and multidose vaccines to impede bacterial growth during the manufacturing process 5 The CDC states that when thimerosal is used this way it is removed later in the process and only trace amounts remain no more than one microgram per dose 25 The notion that trace amounts of a substance as highly toxic as mercury might be benign is exceedingly misleading In a seminal 2014 publication in the prestigious journal Lancet Neurology toxicology experts Philippe Grandjean and Philip Landrigan observed that the developing human brain is uniquely vulnerable to mercury and other neurotoxins often at much lower exposure levels than had previously been thought to be safe 26 Discussing methylmercury the Lancet authors also noted that developmental neurotoxicity occurs at far lower exposure levels than the concentrations that affect adult brain function Other investigators have argued that there may be no meaningful safety threshold for methylmercury 27 Given the body of research indicating that ethylmercury is more toxic than methylmercury and that both have comparable mechanisms of toxicity it stands to reason that warnings about the risks of lower exposure levels would also apply to ethylmercury A 2012 Italian study showed that ethylmercury containing thimerosal diminished the viability of human cells in the lab at a concentration one fiftieth that of methylmercury 28 Although thimerosal s apologists like to state that ethylmercury disappears from the bloodstream more quickly than methylmercury this is no evidence that it has cleared the body Ethylmercury migrates more rapidly to and then lingers in the organs 29 A study that analyzed hair samples from babies first haircuts found that children with autism who had received thimerosal preserved vaccines excreted lower

development 30 Open season on pregnant women Thimerosal passes more easily from a mother s bloodstream through the placenta than does methylmercury 31 Fetal cord blood mercury levels are typically about double the mother s mercury blood levels 32 This is cause for concern for developing babies in light of the CDC s 2004 recommendation that all pregnant women in any trimester get flu shots By 2012 2013 uptake of flu shots during pregnancy had steadily increased to approximately 50 percent 33 Manufacturers still preserve millions of flu shots with massive bolus doses of thimerosal about thirty six million flu shots containing twenty five micrograms of mercury in the 2017 2018 flu season 34 meaning that children born since 2004 have been increasingly likely to be exposed to thimerosal in utero A 2017 CDC study reviewing data from the 2010 11 and 2011 2012 flu seasons linked spontaneous abortions to flu vaccines finding that women vaccinated with the inactivated influenza vaccine had 3 7 fold greater odds of spontaneous abortion within twenty three days than women not receiving the vaccine 35 For women who received the H1N1 vaccine in both seasons covered in the study the odds of spontaneous abortion in the month after receiving a flu vaccine were 7 7 times greater The vast majority of flu vaccines available during the seasons studied were multidose formulations containing twenty five micrograms of mercury Thimerosal worldwide While the thimerosal debate has carried on in the United States children around the world have never stopped receiving thimerosal containing vaccines The mindset revealed by Simpsonwood attendee John Clements of the WHO who described a mandate to vaccinate one hundred million children this year next year and for many years to come with thimerosal containing vaccines has not changed In fact the medical community continues to argue that the benefits of keeping thimerosal in vaccines outweigh the risks and that thimerosal is critical

of thimerosal in vaccines are warranted 38 The global health authorities making cavalier and single minded pronouncements on life saving vaccines should consider the bigger health picture For example exposure to toxic metals such as mercury can contribute to malnutrition and conversely malnutrition may also increase susceptibility to mercury toxicity 39 40 Mercury is also a potent immunosuppressant which has implications in low resource settings where children already face numerous other health challenges and environmental pollutants 41 The time is now The medical establishment s defense of thimerosal s safety has proven highly successful in tamping down deeper investigation into thimerosal and the vaccine industry Perhaps because major pharmaceutical companies the makers of vaccines are among the biggest advertisers in the U S the mainstream press has accepted these government orthodoxies and ignored the ample evidence showing that thimerosal is toxic In fact the thimerosal saga illustrates the aggressive knee jerk rejection by the press the medical community and allied financial interests of any scientific information suggesting that established medical practices are harming public health Nevertheless continuing to wait for more research is not a reasonable public policy option Thimerosal is dangerous to human health and should immediately be removed

Face Masks Is There an Agenda By Dr Alan Palmer Link copied There has been a shifting of positions on the use of face masks with the COVID 19 outbreak Initially it was not recommended then we had different signals from the U S Surgeon General Dr Jerome Adams and representatives of the CDC the NIH and other agencies More recently the policies recommending wearing face masks have become more prevalent and often mandated in public places Is there sound medical or scientific basis for the recommendations Is much of it simply virtue signaling Is there a legitimate rationale to do it to protect the vulnerable And if so at what cost to the rest of society There are many important considerations including the risk versus the reward So what are the risks vs the benefits And would there be a partisan reason for some policy makers to push for one over the other Because as unfortunate as it is all decisions and policies have to be viewed from at least two lenses politics and who stands to benefit financially Let s look at the two camps in the debate The benefit is greater than the risk Proponents of face masks use the following arguments We can prevent sick or asymptomatic infected people from infecting others by wearing masks There may be some credible evidence to suggest this but in doing so the infected person wearing the mask may be making their infection much worse as a result The wear them only in a medical setting arguments below will prove this out N 95 masks have been shown to block 95 of airborne particles with a median diameter 0 3 μm 2 greater than 0 3 micrometers or microns squared whereas standard face masks may block 50 70 of particles depending on the mask http medcraveonline com JLPRR JLPRR 01 00021 pdf If healthy people wear face masks they will be protected from those that may be infected The counterpoint in the next section will make the argument against that logic If you wear a mask you are less likely to touch your nose mouth or eyes which is where the vast majority of infections begin Some claim this to be true but an argument can be made that people handle their mask frequently when adjusting them on their face and to remove them and put them on All this touching of the mask raises the potential that viral transmission to the mask can then transfer to the nasal and oral cavities Recent video of the Coronavirus Task Force news conferences has underscored this as Dr Fauci and others from the task force are seen frequently fiddling with their masks in the background Face masks should not be worn by healthy individuals to

last point discussed the drop of oxygen levels after wearing a mask A drop in oxygen levels hypoxia is associated with an impairment in immunity Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections called the CD4 T lymphocyte This occurs because the hypoxia increases the level of a compound called hypoxia inducible factor 1 HIF 1 which inhibits T lymphocytes and stimulates a powerful immune inhibitor cell called the T regs This sets the stage for contracting any infection including COVID 19 and making the consequences of that infection much graver In essence your mask may very well put you at an increased risk of infections and if so having a much worse outcome In addition reduced oxygenation can accelerate cancer growth 1 Shehade H et

masks and in some cases even mandatory face mask rules And how does that motivation interface with the extended stay at home orders We have flattened the curve to prevent the risk of overwhelming our

prevent the population from gaining herd immunity which would further support the need and desire for a vaccine what would be the best way to do that 2 If you were successful at preventing people from developing natural immunity by keeping all the healthy and young low risk people apart from one another and thus wanted to increase the chances for a second wave of the virus in a few months how could

growing number of free thinking people that are connecting the dots One thing for certain is that so many people have taken the wearing of face masks and social distancing to a bizarre extreme A few days ago I saw one woman in the neighborhood out for a walk in the heat of the day I commented to her that it sure was a hot time of day to be out for a walk She looked at me with an odd look of concern on her face and said yeah but at least there are no other people out now Other common examples are the people driving alone in their car with a face mask on and people walking through parking lots and down uncrowded sidewalks or at a park wearing face masks My purpose on mentioning these examples is not to be condescending or critical of individuals that are overly fearful or are unaware of the harm face masks may cause them These individuals have been duped by a complicit media that has continued to run with the absolutely ridiculously outrageously inaccurate models and never adjusted their level of hype and fear mongering long after those models had been exposed for what they were ridiculous In the meantime people that are living with an irrational level of fear as a result are being harmed physically and emotionally The reduced oxygen levels will increase anxiety fatigue and brain fog decrease learning capacity due to decreased oxygen to the brain weaken their

hugely exaggerated models the inaccurate coding and calculations of COVID 19 deaths bloating the numbers the large percentages of people that are already immune because they have had the infection and recovered many not even knowing they were sick we realize that the mortality rate from COVID 19 is nowhere near what we had thought Then there are the mistakes made within nursing homes and long term care facilities including sending positive COVID patients into those facilities and the mistakes with the way we treated many cases with ventilators In a retrospective analysis of all of these factors I believe that we will realize that mortality from COVID 19 is not even as bad as a normal flu and pneumonia season This is not to say that initially we shouldn t have viewed COVID 19 as a serious

testing let AIDS further spread around the globe and helped Fauci win promotion to director NIAID In 2006 Dr Mikovits became director of Whittemore Peterson Institute for Neuro Immune Disease and collaborated with Dr Ruscetti searching for the cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome which suddenly became epidemic in the 1980s The male dominated medical community dismissed CFS as psychosomatic yuppie flu caused when fragile females cracked in corporate jobs Dr Mikovits discovered that 67 of affected women carried a virus called Xenotropic Murine Leukemia related Virus that appeared in healthy women only 4 of the time XMRV is also associated with prostate breast ovarian cancers leukemia and multiple myeloma Many women with XMRV bore children with autism In 2009 Drs Mikovits and Ruscetti published their explosive findings in the journal Science But the question remained how was XMRV getting into people Other researchers linked the first CFS outbreak to a polio vaccine given to doctors and nurses that resulted in the 1934 Los Angeles County Hospital Epidemic That vaccine was cultivated on pulverized mouse brains Retroviruses from dead animals can survive in cell lines and permanently contaminate vaccines Dr Mikovits studies suggested that the XMRV Virus was present in the MMR Polio and Encephalitis vaccines given to American children and soldiers XMRV is so hazardous that the mere presence of mouse tissue in a laboratory can contaminate other tissues in the same room Dr Fauci ordered Mikovits to keep her mouth shut When she refused he illegally confiscated her

National Cancer Institute I was under the direction of Frank Ruscetti I isolated HIV from blood and saliva confirming Dr Luc Montagnier s earlier isolation and description of HIV as a possible causative agent of AIDS I refused to do that because it s unethical And then Anthony Fauci intervened Mikovits When Frank Ruscetti was out of town I received a call from Dr Fauci and he demanded that I give him our manuscript on the isolation and confirmation of HIV while it was still in press I refused to do that because it s unethical These manuscripts are confidential and only authors can give him a copy Dr Mikovits standards of ethics and moral courage are unparalleled Mikovits He threatened to fire me for insubordination but still I refused It s unethical Mikovits When Frank Ruscetti returned a few weeks later he gave the manuscript to Dr Fauci and Dr Fauci purposely delayed the publication of our manuscript in order that his crony Dr Robert Gallo could copy our work and submit a competing manuscript and get it into press before ours On May 4 1984 Dr Robert Gallo famously published a series of papers demonstrating that a retrovirus he d isolated was the cause of AIDS Appropriating her work wasn t the worst of it This delayed the development of testing and spread the HIV epidemic through the world killing millions Driven by greed and cronyism Anthony Fauci America

Introduction People who advocate for safer vaccines should not be marginalized or denounced as anti vaccine I am pro vaccine I had all six of my children vaccinated I believe that vaccines have saved the lives of hundreds of millions of humans over the past century and that broad vaccine coverage is critical to public health But I want our vaccines to be as safe as possible Indeed the greatest threats to the kind of widespread vaccine coverage needed to protect global health are public doubt about vaccine safety and mistrust of vaccine regulators And we cannot heal that mistrust by simply dismissing legitimate questions about Thimerosal as the fruit of mindless paranoia For example solid peer reviewed science supports the well documented popular skepticism about the safety of the mercury laden vaccine preservative Thimerosal As this book shows there is a broad consensus among research scientists that Thimerosal is a dangerous neurotoxin that should be immediately removed from medicines Several hundred peer reviewed scientific publications by the world s leading research scientists public health agencies universities and teaching hospitals have confirmed that Thimerosal is a potent neurotoxin that has never been proven safe for medical use and for which cost effective alternatives exist Indeed the evidence of Thimerosal s neurotoxicity is so overwhelming and the lack of any safety data so complete that anyone who is willing to read science and who believes in the capacity for scientific methods to determine empirical truths must conclude that Thimerosal causes serious brain damage I am rabidly pro science For thirty years as a litigator and environmental advocate I have fought to make rigorous science the driver of public policy in the global warming arena in the tobacco wars and in my many battles with pesticide and chemical companies as well as in many dozens of legal skirmishes ranging from the Hudson River to Alaska s Cook Inlet from the West Virginia coal fields to the Louisiana oil patch from the Caribbean island of Vieques to Puget Sound I have fought these battles on issues including acid rain ozone coal ash particulates PCBs lead mercury hydrocarbons pesticides and numerous other poisons that have been the subject of the hundreds of cases I ve argued against polluters and their crooked scientists For many years I ve been puzzled by the bland and apparently baseless insistence by public health regulators and members of the press that it is safe to inject mercury one of the world s most neurotoxic elements into young

range of neurological disorders In fact there is a virtually unanimous scientific consensus among the hundreds of research scientists who have published peer reviewed articles in the field that Thimerosal is immensely toxic to brain tissue and should not be injected into children Nevertheless today we continue to expose millions of babies and pregnant women in this country and elsewhere to one of the world s most potent neurotoxins even though far safer and more economic alternatives exist Most US vaccine makers for example have already switched to Thimerosal free injections in pediatric vaccines administered to American children And the vaccine industry had pleaded with the CDC to allow it to switch to nontoxic alternatives in the remaining Thimerosal preserved vaccines The CDC s refusal to allow the transition is baffling I assembled this book to make that task easier for the agency and to dissuade the press from accepting the tired claim that anyone who questions

the vaccinated children were significantly more likely to use medications to have visited a doctor when sick past year or to have had a hospital stay ever Echoing this pattern a large 2013 study of pediatric clients at managed care organizations MCOs similarly found that age appropriately vaccinated children used more health services than undervaccinated children The MCO study which included several hundred thousand children N 323 247 born between 2004 and 2008 assessed undervaccination at two years of age based on the difference between when the vaccine dose was administered and when the vaccine dose should have been administered The researchers also reviewed medical records to ascertain which children were undervaccinated for nonmedical reasons that is by parental choice By these measures half 49 of the children were undervaccinated for any reason in the first 24 months and an estimated 13 were undervaccinated due to parental choice Undervaccinated children in the parental

that need to be answered The parallel timing of the increased vaccination schedule in the U S and the chronic disease epidemic in children cannot be dismissed as a coincidence Moreover there are many additional vaccine related questions that urgently demand answers For example what are the synergistic effects of multiple toxins such as thimerosal and aluminum and what happens when these toxins build up over time What is the association between the timing and spacing of vaccination and subsequent health outcomes Is there a down side to tinkering with the innate immune system so early in life On this latter point Dr Suzanne Humphries comments that aluminum adjuvants create a red alert situation forcing the infant s innate immune system to respond in the opposite manner to the way it should function in the first year of life Finally it is important to remember that vaccines have been associated not only with morbidity but also with mortality Infants in the U S receive more vaccines in their first year of life than anywhere else in the world yet the U S infant mortality rate is much higher than in other high income countries A group of researchers examined reports to the U S Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS following Haemophilus influenzae type b Hib vaccination 1990 2013 and found reports of 896 deaths median age 6 months 749 records cited a cause of death and 51 of these n 384 listed the death as sudden infant death syndrome SIDS Although the vague SIDS moniker often has made it difficult to definitively pinpoint a causal role for vaccines in July 2017 the U S

quantitative systematic review Meta analytic studies seek to take a step back and draw rigorous conclusions about comparable studies as a group A key benefit of this approach is that it can consolidate a large and often complex sometimes apparently conflicting body of literature The meta analysis approach is a very appropriate tool for taking stock of published studies that compare

laden with heavy metals such as thimerosal and aluminum and annually insists that moms accept thimerosal containing flu vaccines for themselves and their young children Research by Burbacher and colleagues compared blood and brain mercury levels in monkeys exposed to methylmercury and ethylmercury That work showed that ethylmercury in particular goes to the brain gets metabolized into even more toxic inorganic mercury and remains in the brain for years Moreover some common flu vaccines contain the emulsifier polysorbate 80 which disrupts the blood brain barrier and helps create an extremely effective delivery system for escorting neurotoxic ethylmercury and other heavy metals straight to the brain Unfortunately the majority of published studies only measure total mercury and very few have examined brain tissue This makes it challenging to zero in on the specific effects and mechanisms associated with exposure to ethylmercury Given young children s widespread exposure to

Pharmaceuticals UN Praises Maldives Bill Outlawing Informed Consent for Pharmaceuticals By Jeremy R Hammond Link copied The United Nations Children s Fund has dangerously praised the Maldives legislature for passing a bill that fundamentally violates human rights The parliament of the Republic of Maldives on November 14 passed a bill effectively outlawing the exercise of the right to informed consent one of the most fundamental ethics in medicine If ratified according to multiple Maldives online news sources the new law would make it illegal for parents to decline certain pharmaceutical products for their children Concerningly the United Nations Children s Fund UNICEF has praised the Maldives legislature for passing the bill which has been promoted as bringing the country into closer compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child CRC The authoritarian bill is being euphemistically called the Child Rights Protection Bill The implicit underlying concept is that children have a right to receive certain pharmaceutical products and so parents cannot be allowed to choose for their children not to receive those risk carrying products This framework overlooks the fact that children do not have enough knowledge and understanding to be able to do their own risk benefit analysis which is why such decisions must be made for them by their parents until they reach such age as to be able to reasonably make their own choice Of course children won t be given the choice either if news reports are accurate and the bill is ratified into law Government bureaucrats will be the ones making that decision on children s behalf despite having none of the specialized knowledge of the individual child that is possessed by the child s parents working in consultation with the child s doctor knowledge required to be able to conduct the necessary risk benefit analysis for that individual UNICEF is apparently unconcerned with world governments systematically violating the right to informed consent of their citizens The propagandistic language of children s rights being used to push this authoritarian agenda serves to mask how the Maldives government is itself claiming to have a right to force risk carrying pharmaceutical products on children against the will of their parents In effect the government will be subjecting every child member of the population to a mass uncontrolled experiment without their informed consent In a tweet immediately following its passage UNICEF described the bill as a celebration worthy milestone for

another Maldives news site The Maldives Independent similarly reported that the parliament had passed with unanimous consent a new child protection law with provisions to make vaccination mandatory Under the law parents would not be legally allowed to deny vaccinating their children The euphemistic language being used to describe the government s agenda to forcibly vaccinate children is that they have a right to care This aspect of the bill is being passed under cover of other provisions intended to bring the country closer in line with the protections under international law for the rights of the child such as by prohibiting child marriage and criminalizing failure to report child abuse While enacting protections for children from some forms of child abuse however the government itself would be committing child abuse systematically on a massive scale by forcing upon children risk carrying pharmaceutical products that can and do cause permanent injury or even death to some children Once ratified the Maldives Independent added the new law will replace the 1991 child protection law and bring the domestic legal framework in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the

knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision The 1966 United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights similarly states that no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation The updated 2002 edition of the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects the guidelines of which are promulgated by the World Health Organization WHO explicitly recognizes that the individual subjected to medical intervention must be capable of giving informed consent If the individual isn t capable of making that choice the intervention requires the permission of a legally authorized representative which in the case of children means the parents The 2005 Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights states that Any preventive diagnostic and therapeutic medical intervention is only to be carried out with the prior free

DTP Vaccine s Negative Effect on Childhood Mortality Although the popular belief and the message conveyed by government health officials is that all vaccines are safe and effective the truth is that there is an egregious lack of properly designed safety studies for these pharmaceutical products One illustrative example is the diphtheria tetanus and whole cell pertussis DTP vaccine which is routinely administered to children in the Maldives The DTP vaccine was never studied for its effect on childhood mortality in clinical trials Government policy makers always just assumed that by reducing incidence of the target diseases it would reduce childhood mortality But that s not what the scientific evidence tells us On the contrary the best scientific evidence to date strongly indicates that the DTP vaccine increases the risk of death Numerous studies have found it to be associated with a significantly increased rate of childhood mortality The authors of a study into the DTP vaccine s effect on childhood mortality published in the journal EBioMedicine in 2017 summarized the situation bluntly All currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria tetanus or pertussis Though a vaccine protects children against the target disease it may simultaneously increase susceptibility to unrelated infection The key finding of that study was that DTP was associated with 5 fold higher mortality than being unvaccinated The authors further commented that Unfortunately DTP is the most widely used vaccine and the proportion who receives DTP is used globally as an indicator of the performance of national vaccination programs It should be of concern the researchers also remarked that the effect of routine vaccinations on all cause mortality was not tested in randomized trials The term in the literature used to describe such unintended consequences of vaccination is non specific effects Another study published in Frontiers in Public Health similarly pointed out that All studies of the introduction of DTP have found increased overall mortality The association is particularly strong for girls The best studies show four to five times higher mortality for DTP vaccinated children An expert review of the available studies published in June 2019 by the Vaccine Science Foundation expressed the concern that it is impossible to predict what happens in terms of susceptibility to infections in general of all types when the immune system is being stimulated through vaccination

particularly strong for girls The best studies show four to five times higher mortality for DTP vaccinated children An expert review of the available studies published in June 2019 by the Vaccine Science Foundation expressed the concern that it is impossible to predict what happens in terms of susceptibility to infections in general of all types when the immune system is being stimulated through vaccination Concern was also expressed that the WHO had attempted to dismiss the studies and acted in a manner inconsistent and biased towards positive effects of vaccines When a result pleases the WHO it can be accepted but not when a result does not please the WHO The Maldives government is engaging in science denialism by ignoring that sound and medically ethical recommendation Conflicts of interest within the WHO is another area of concern Of the fourteen experts tasked by the WHO to examine the evidence with respect to the DTP vaccine s effect on mortality eight had relevant conflicts of interest in relation to companies producing vaccines Three even had ties to GlaxoSmithKline one of the manufacturers of DTP vaccines While the WHO chose not to see any conflicts of interest research has overwhelmingly demonstrated that people become influenced when they have financial ties to drug companies even when these ties are not directly related to the drugs or vaccines in question The review observed the commonsense principle that expert committees that give advice on immunization programs should not be involved with their re assessment when research has demonstrated that a vaccine might increase total mortality Additionally no one should be allowed to have financial conflicts of interest in relation to the pharmaceutical industry However This is not the case for WHO committees The review further observed It is the duty of a manufacturer of a drug or vaccine to demonstrate in randomized trials that it works and has a positive benefit to harm balance This has not been done for the DTP vaccine Not a single randomized trial has been carried out but the vaccine is nonetheless on the market This has created the odd situation that the burden of proof has been reversed The WHO recommends the use of the vaccine and seems to require very convincing evidence that it increases mortality before any action will possibly be taken Given the widespread use of the vaccine around world the need for randomized trials is an urgent ethical imperative In conclusion the best available evidence tells us that it is likely that the DTP vaccine

Rights or Health How Did We Get Here Vaccine Mandates Results Don t Safeguard Children s Rights or Health How Did We Get Here By Children s Health Defense Team Link copied For decades the U S government has made compulsory childhood vaccination one of the cornerstones of its public health policy Outside the U S countries vaccination policies range from completely voluntary to aggressive with some nations promoting vaccination but leaving the decision up to the individual and others pushing a little harder by financially incentivizing vaccination Some of the countries with mandatory vaccination have modest policies that focus on a single vaccine such as polio and some with broader mandates on the books choose not to enforce them Regardless of the policy no other country requires as many childhood vaccines as the U S but the legal edifice shoring up the compulsory childhood vaccine program is surprisingly flimsy As New York University legal scholar Mary Holland explains in a 2010 working paper this edifice relies primarily on two century old Supreme Court decisions from 1905 and 1922 and on the game changing National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act NCVIA of 1986 which fundamentally altered the legal landscape for vaccination by exempting vaccine manufacturers and medical practitioners from liability for childhood vaccine injuries current childhood mandates are not only radically different from what the earlier courts and legislators envisioned but are unreasonable and oppressive and have led to perverse results that do not safeguard children s rights and health The 1986 Act in particular resulted in an absence of legal protections for vaccinated children that is striking compared to almost all other medical interventions Examining the legal trajectory of vaccine mandates since 1905 Holland argues that current childhood mandates are not only radically different from what the earlier courts and legislators envisioned but are unreasonable and oppressive and have led to perverse results that do not safeguard children s rights and health From mandates for emergencies to mandates for prevention The Supreme Court s 1905 Jacobson v Massachusetts decision as summarized by Holland justified the imposition of one vaccine smallpox on adults on an emergency basis and under circumstances of imminent danger At the same time the Jacobson decision established medical exemptions reasoning that it would be cruel and inhuman in the last degree to vaccinate someone who was medically unfit Jacobson also contained robust cautionary language calling attention to the potential for arbitrary and oppressive abuse of police power and warning against going far beyond what was reasonably required for the safety of the public Jacobson urged courts to be vigilant to examine and thwart unreasonable assertions of state power Despite these words of warning state level courts did not wait long before broadening the judicial interpretation of Jacobson beyond the

vigilant to examine and thwart unreasonable assertions of state power Despite these words of warning state level courts did not wait long before broadening the judicial interpretation of Jacobson beyond the notion of imminent danger or necessity although still within the context of just the smallpox vaccine In 1916 Alabama and Kentucky courts affirmed states right to mandate vaccination for prevention of smallpox epidemics stating that state Boards of Health are not required to wait until an epidemic actually exists before taking action The Alabama court also broadened the rationale for mandates beyond adults to children In 1922 the three paragraph Zucht v King Supreme Court decision sanctioned vaccine mandates as a condition for public school attendance According to Holland this decision further shifted Jacobson s paradigm by upholding a mandate exclusively for children and not for the entire population Decisions in Mississippi and Texas in the early 1930s granted public health authorities the leeway to define public health emergencies in whatever manner they saw fit A New Jersey court in the late 1940s interpreted Jacobson as justifying all vaccine mandates disregarding its language to reject unreasonable arbitrary or oppressive state actions An Arkansas court in the early 1950s suggested that anyone questioning vaccine safety or efficacy should lodge their objections with the Board of Health rather than the court Occasionally legal officials expressed their disapproval of vaccine mandates outside of emergencies as with the North Dakota judge who in 1919 pronounced childhood vaccination in the absence of a smallpox epidemic an act of barbarism The same judge also wrote presciently about the self interest of the medical profession and vaccine manufacturers the class that reap a golden harvest from vaccination and the diseases caused by it In comments that bear repeating today the judge stated Every person of common sense and observation must know that it is not the welfare of the children that causes the vaccinators to preach their doctrines and to incur the expense of lobbying for vaccination statutes And if anyone says to the contrary he either does not know the facts or he has no regard for the truth The legal sea change in 1986 Although vaccination mandates had become legally well entrenched by the mid 1950s regardless of emergency and all but erasing Jacobson s cautionary language Holland emphasizes that this legal framework arose in the context of a single vaccine for a contagious disease considered to be life

compulsion on principle According to Holland the creation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP a federal advisory body with little public participation and no direct accountability to voters laid the groundwork for far more coercive vaccine policies In fact ACIP has become over time the driving force behind vaccine mandates Whereas Jacobson justified mandates under specific and rare circumstances ACIP has created an infrastructure that pushes mandates for any vaccine preventable illness revenue generating vaccine development and promotion have enjoyed priority over vaccine safety science and injury compensation since the Law s NCVIA inception By 1981 after ACIP helped ensure that multiple vaccines were obligatory for school attendance in all 50 states the number of vaccine injuries began increasing Against this backdrop Congress enacted the NCVIA in 1986 Although some legislators may have been well intentioned when they passed the Act Holland makes it clear that it has been nothing short of a disaster In essence the Act located vaccine promotion safety and compensation under one government umbrella thereby creating the risk of trade offs among competing goals The rather predictable result is that revenue generating vaccine development and promotion have enjoyed priority over vaccine safety science and injury compensation since the Law s inception Holland identifies the paradox at the core of the 1986 Law On the one hand the legislation for the first time publicly acknowledged that universal compulsory vaccination is likely to cause permanent injury and death to some infants and children on the other hand it forces healthy children to give up ordinary legal protections including informed consent and takes away from injured children the right to sue manufacturers directly Meanwhile ACIP has continued to promote a shift away from necessity as the rationale for vaccine mandates A number of the vaccines that ACIP now calls for American children to get to attend school 70 doses of 16 vaccines by age 18 are for rarely fatal illnesses and for conditions not contagious

corporate greed and mindless bureaucracy in a related article Whereas demonstrably predatory corporations selling compulsory products to a vulnerable population should lead to a high level of

health professionals are growing increasingly wise to this industry government shell game In one community opposition to human papillomavirus HPV vaccine mandates recently put public health

two part series on mumps Part II will delve further into the mumps vaccine s spillover effects on fertility Across the country frenzied legislators are responding to the pharmaceutical industry s orchestrated fear campaign around measles by seeking to impose further mandating of Merck s measles mumps and rubella MMR vaccine Although ongoing mumps outbreaks involving thousands of at risk adolescents and young adults completely dwarf the number of measles cases no one is covering the mumps story because it will expose the fact that Merck has been in court for over eight years due to scientists blowing the whistle on Merck s fabrication and falsification of the effectiveness of the mumps component of its MMR vaccine Instead of punishing Merck for its chicanery legislatures are rewarding the company by making it impossible to refuse Merck s profitable vaccine subjecting a generation of American children to the risk of serious complications from mumps infection at an age that nature never intended When younger children experience mumps the virus is relatively harmless infected children often exhibit no symptoms When mumps strikes adolescents or adults on the other hand the infection can cause far more serious adverse effects including inflammation of various organs brain pancreas ovaries and testicles as well as damage to male fertility Inflammation of one or both testicles a condition called orchitis occurs in approximately one in three post pubertal men who get mumps and can contribute to sperm defects and subfertility as well as impairing the function of cells that produce testosterone An estimated 30 to 87 of men with bilateral orchitis induced by mumps experience full blown infertility a major cause for concern given the significant declines in male fertility observed over the past several decades Thus it appears that Merck s vaccine instead of protecting children not only delays onset of disease to later age cohorts but has the potential to cause serious and permanent injury Merck and mumps vaccines Let s look at a quick history of mumps and MMR vaccination in the United States The Food and Drug Administration FDA licensed Merck s initial mumps only vaccine in 1967 In 1971 Merck introduced its first combination MMR vaccine followed by the MMR II vaccine in 1978 which repurposed the rubella component and the MMR plus varicella

companies globally and the market valued its stocks at a seven year high as of late 2018 Merck has willfully and illegally maintained its monopoly through ongoing manipulation and by representing to the public and government agencies a falsely inflated efficacy rate for its Mumps Vaccine In order to score the lucrative MMR monopoly Merck needed to satisfy the FDA that all three components of the combination vaccine could achieve 95 efficacy but the mumps portion was bedeviling In fact as alleged in a lawsuit filed by two senior Merck scientists in 2010 under the False Claims Act the company has known since the late 1990s that the mumps component of the MMR is far less than 95 effective A 2005 study published in Vaccine estimated the effectiveness of mumps vaccination to be closer to 69 and the authors noted that their results were consistent with other studies The two whistleblowers assert in the lawsuit which is reportedly headed to trial sometime this year that Merck has willfully and illegally maintained its monopoly through ongoing manipulation and by representing to the public and government agencies a falsely inflated efficacy rate for its Mumps Vaccine Specifically the two scientists claim that Merck executives ordered them to use rigged methodologies including taking antibodies from rabbits and adding them to human blood vials in order to gull regulators into assuming an antibody response robust and durable enough to merit licensing When those enhanced tactics did not achieve Merck s fabricated 95 efficacy rate the whistleblowers allege the company resorted to simply falsifying the test data and engaging in other fraudulent activities The fact that we have mumps showing up in highly immunized populations likely reflects something about the effectiveness of the vaccine Unprotected adolescents and young adults The poor performance of the MMR s mumps component and the doubtful durability of mumps specific immunity following vaccination are of concern In fact we are already living with the legacy of this badly flawed vaccine Rather than protecting a generation of American children from mumps infection in childhood the vaccine has merely postponed the

students had had the requisite two doses of MMR she noted The fact that we have mumps showing up in highly immunized populations likely reflects something about the effectiveness of the vaccine The mumps virus has also made a comeback in other settings where younger adults congregate For example a naval ship deployed to the Persian Gulf the USS Fort McHenry has been unable to come ashore since early January because of a mumps contagion that has devastated its crew even though the military vaccinates all personnel against the virus and despite the Navy having immediately subjected the crew in question to another MMR booster News accounts have declined to comment on mumps complications but describe the quarantine as a morale killer for crew members who are accustomed to having monthly port calls Infection control protocols stipulate that the Navy cannot declare the situation under control until 50 days after the last affected service member recovers Endangering rather than protecting youth All of these cohorts are part of an age group that should never get mumps As Children s Health Defense recently noted whereas flares of illness in vaccinated groups should prompt some

Brain Disorders Yale University Study Shows Association Between Vaccines and Brain Disorders By Robert F Kennedy Jr Link copied A team of researchers from the Yale School of Medicine and Penn State College of Medicine have found a disturbing association between the timing of vaccines and the onset of certain brain disorders in a subset of children Analyzing five years worth of private health insurance data on children ages 6 15 these scientists found that young people vaccinated in the previous three to 12 months were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with certain neuropsychiatric disorders than their non vaccinated counterparts This new study which raises important questions about whether over vaccination may be triggering immune and neurological damage in a subset of vulnerable children something parents of children with autism have been saying for years was published in the peer reviewed journal Frontiers in Psychiatry Jan 19 More than 95 000 children in the database that were analyzed had one of seven neuropsychiatric disorders anorexia nervosa anxiety disorder attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder ADHD bipolar disorder major depression obsessive compulsive disorder OCD and tic disorder Children with these disorders were compared to children without neuropsychiatric disorders as well as to children with two other conditions that could not possibly be related to vaccination open wounds and broken bones This was a well designed tightly controlled study Control subjects without brain disorders were matched with the subjects by age geographic location and gender As expected broken bones and open wounds showed no significant association with vaccinations New cases of major depression bipolar disorder or ADHD also showed no significant association with vaccinations However children who had been vaccinated were 80 percent more likely to be diagnosed with anorexia and 25 percent more likely to be diagnosed with OCD than their non vaccinated counterparts Vaccinated children were also more likely to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and with tics compared to the controls In a carefully worded conclusion the researchers caution making too much of these results while also urging further investigation This pilot epidemiologic analysis implies that the onset of some neuropsychiatric disorders may be temporally related to prior vaccinations in a subset of individuals they write These findings warrant further investigation but do not prove a causal role of antecedent infections or vaccinations in the pathoetiology of these conditions We all know that correlation in this case vaccine administration in the previous 12 months and new diagnoses of brain disorders does not necessarily mean causation But if certain vaccines or a combination of vaccines are actually triggering brain disorders it is imperative that we figure out which vaccines or combination of vaccines are the culprits

influenza vaccine In this study influenza vaccination was strongly correlated with both anorexia and OCD At the same time new research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists has shown the mercury containing preservative thimerosal to be as toxic and as brain damaging as other forms of mercury Yet multi dose flu vaccines still contain thimerosal and flu vaccines are recommended for pregnant women and infants in America despite questions about efficacy and the scientifically documented risks Why look for a correlation between vaccination administration and brain disorders As the researchers point out two major studies one from researchers in Norway and one from an international team of researchers from Finland Italy and Denmark have shown an increased risk of narcolepsy following administration of the H1N1 flu vaccine Another study from China found an increased risk of narcolepsy after the H1N1 flu itself which was unlikely to be linked to vaccinations If we look at this data from the H1N1 flu outbreaks we see that immune responses whether to the disease itself or to vaccination against the disease can damage the brain While new discoveries about the human immune system are being made all the time it is well understood that the immune system plays a role in brain development and in certain psychiatric conditions including attention disorders eating disorders obsessive disorders and depression It is also well understood that the body s immune response involves inflammation which is when tissue swells in response to harmful stimulation Harmful stimulation includes infectious diseases that is illnesses themselves environmental toxins like mercury and allergens like pollen or dust mites which are actually benign though an over stimulated immune system perceives them as threats We further know that vaccination can cause inflammation which is part of the body s natural response to foreign substances Previous scientific studies have shown that when an immune reaction causes inflammation it can negatively affect the brain So it is scientifically plausible and more than reasonable to investigate whether vaccination itself which provokes inflammation may also negatively affect the brain I agree with these researchers that the correlation between anorexia OCD tic disorder anxiety disorder and vaccinations warrants further scrutiny This study suggests that the seemingly inexplicable increase we have seen in brain disorders among young children may not be so mysterious after all", "chunk_id":

process rights and ignore safety concerns Los Angeles CA Children s Health Defense CHD and a coalition of community and environmental groups advocating for safe technology filed a lawsuit on Monday against Los Angeles L A County in the Los Angeles County Superior Court The suit contends that the recently adopted amendments to Title 16 and Title 22 the ordinances of the L A County Code which allow for the fast tracked proliferation of wireless infrastructure violate the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA by exempting projects under the ordinances from CEQA review The lawsuit also asserts that the ordinances raise constitutional due process concerns in relation to wireless projects that directly impact local residents who will suffer significant losses of personal and real property rights without the ability to contest The plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction and petitions the court for a temporary stay and restraining order and preliminary injunction pending resolution of the lawsuit The complaint points to multiple examples of what plaintiffs state violates CEQA the California Constitution and the board s own rule The Ordinance creates the framework for permitting thousands of wireless facilities throughout the County The Board of Supervisors purposefully and unlawfully blinded themselves to the significant and adverse consequences to its local communities and the environment that will occur as a direct result of this Project A wireless project can often so sicken local residents that it constructively evicts whole families who can no longer tolerate continuous exposure to non ionizing radiation emitted from small cell and macro cell towers This situation is especially tragic for poor and minority families who are holding on desperately to affordable housing and lack any financial means of escape Basic justice demands that these families be given adequate prior notice and a fair hearing before their voices are silenced their property is taken or devalued or their lives are put at risk The wireless facilities will endanger the air water flora fauna and objects of historic or aesthetic significance The wireless facilities are not

years According to the Associated Press the agency is actively pressing vaccine maker Pfizer to submit an application for EUA status for this age group despite wide acknowledgment that children are not at risk for complications from COVID 19 CHD has an active lawsuit in TX alleging that the FDA s emergency use authorization of COVID vaccines for 5 to 11 year olds violated federal law and was arbitrary and capricious since the agency didn t follow its own guidelines in granting authorization for medical products for use in emergencies 21 U S Code 360bbb 3 3 The law requires the EUA designation be used only when there is no adequate approved and available alternative to the product for diagnosing preventing or treating such disease or condition The FDA ignored reports of deaths and serious injuries and there are other safer options for treating COVID 19 Vaccinating young children against a virus that poses no harm to them is unethical and dangerous said CHD president and general counsel Mary Holland It does however bring Pharma closer to its ultimate goal of getting COVID shots added to the recommended childhood vaccine schedule which means Pfizer and other COVID vaccine manufacturers will have a captive market in perpetuity and likely never be held accountable for harm or even death to young children caused by their products A COVID study conducted by Johns Hopkins showed a mortality rate of zero among 48 000 children without preexisting conditions Additionally a large COVID study conducted in Germany found the case fatality rate among children is three out of a million and zero deaths occurred in children under five In 1986 Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act NCVIA which bestowed the astounding gift of immunity from liability to drug companies for harms caused by their vaccines added to the recommended schedule by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC and FDA s vaccine advisory committees The NCVIA also established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program where families of children injured and killed by vaccines submit a claim for financial compensation Parents struggling with injured

the U S government has paid out over 4 7 billion for deaths and injuries from vaccines from 1989 to date Parents need to be fully aware that whether their child is vaccinated with an EUA vaccine or one on the routine childhood schedule the family will be financially on its own should their child be injured or killed as a result of vaccination said Holland The compensation system is completely broken Only the restoration of full liability to industry and healthcare practitioners is likely to reverse the current situation While the long term effects of COVID shots are unknown the short term effects are already historic with 1 071 856 reports of injury including 22 607 deaths following vaccination according to the U S government s database the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System VAERS The number of deaths following COVID vaccination are more than the total of all deaths reported to VAERS from all other vaccines since the system was established in 1986 It s despicable to recommend

Circuit Panel OTARD Decision Link copied Press Release For Immediate Release Washington DC Feb 15 2022 On Friday February 11 a panel of the Court of Appeals for the D C Circuit denied a petition for review submitted by Children s Health Defense and four families that challenged a 2020 FCC rule Over the Air Reception Devices OTARD OTARD allows private wireless Internet providers to contract with a property owner and install antennas that provide Internet access to the local area without any notice or right to object by people opposed to the project OTARD also preempts local zoning laws deed and other property restrictions on wireless deployment The FCC rule strips all remedies granted by any state law that restricts deployment of private carrier Internet facilities Wireless radiation affects everyone said Children s Health Defense president and general counsel Mary Holland Some estimates indicate that at least 10 of the population and probably far more than that is already sick from a condition known as electromagnetic sensitivity When exposed to wireless radiation those with this condition experience a range of life altering and sometimes life threatening symptoms and effects including headaches sleep problems heart palpitations ringing in the ears dizziness nausea and skin rashes along with memory and cognitive problems The CDC Justice Department and Department of Labor have recognized this condition and the consensus is that exposure avoidance is the only effective management option people must avoid being radiated especially in their own homes The court agreed that the petitioners were being harmed but it rejected the petition on largely technical grounds It held that the health issues should be resolved in a different proceeding that had already remanded for that purpose in August 2021 It also agreed with the petitioners that the FCC cannot pass a rule that would effectively eliminate rights granted by the Americans With Disabilities Act or Federal Housing Act but it held that any conflict between the rule and the disabilities laws had to be litigated on an as applied basis not through a facial challenge to the rule The court ruled that the petitioners claims that the FCC lacked statutory authority had not been adequately raised at the Commission and were therefore not properly before the court The court noted that the FCC s action outlawing notice was treading on thin ice in terms of the First Amendment right to petition for relief from the government Although the decision denied immediate relief for the most part it merely indicated that the claims should be addressed in the FCC s wireless emissions guidelines proceeding rather than in the context of the so called OTARD rule We are saddened and frustrated the court

when a provider puts a high power antenna right next to their home said Holland The decision basically tells us we have to go back to the FCC and once again ask them to follow the science and basic biology even though the Commission has stubbornly refused to admit that its current emissions rules threaten public health and many people are now very ill But we will do as the court directed The court noted that people can file individual requests for relief under the ADA FHA and by implication the Rehabilitation Act We hope this holding will convince several district courts to re think their prior rulings that the FCC emissions regulations preempt statutory disability remedies commented Holland The decision also clears the way for those who lose property rights like restrictive covenants or whose homes are devalued by a nearby antenna to seek federal government compensation under what is known as the Tucker Act Children s Health Defense hopes that this program is better managed than the fund that is supposed to remediate injuries people suffer when they have an adverse reaction to vaccines said Holland We will find out in the next year or so whether the FCC will finally recognize

Electromagnetically Sensitive or EMS disabled community an increasingly large swath of the disability community that has been harmed by wireless technology such as cell towers smart meters Wi Fi and mobile phones EMS is a term that has been used since 2002 by the U S Access Board an independent federal agency designed to advise the government on guidelines for accommodation The Access Board promised an effort to remove barriers to access for the EMS disabled Twenty years later however that promise has not been fulfilled The legal comments explained that the EMS disabled community experiences a unique form of digital discrimination These individuals simply cannot be around Radio Frequency RF Radiation because it makes them sick said Holland Advocates for the EMS Disabled supports the Commission s enunciated goals to advance equity in the provision of and access to digital communication services and products for all people of the United States without discrimination on the basis of race color religion national origin sex or disability They observed however that the EMS disabled are suffering largely because of the FCC s own actions since it is the agency pushing to flood all parts of the country and invade people s homes with wireless radiation even if it severely harms millions of Americans and has so far refused to accept or recognize the condition even exists The FCC is actively forcing wireless exposure that it knows is hurting people said Holland The FCC is well aware of the grievous injuries it is causing but it persists The FCC is creating a form of

for the Western District of Louisiana Monroe Division against major media outlets the British Broadcasting Corporation BBC The Washington Post Reuters and The Associated Press for collectively colluding with Big Tech to censor publishers of online health and political news The complaint alleges that as members of the Trusted News Initiative TNI Defendants colluded with one another and with social media platforms to target and censor rival online news publishers violating the Sherman antitrust laws and the First Amendment Jed Rubenfeld lead attorney for the plaintiffs commented When social media companies collude with government to censor critics of government policy that violates the First Amendment When they collude with major mainstream news organizations to censor rival online news publishers that violates antitrust law As the Supreme Court said in an antitrust case almost 80 years ago the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public Freedom to publish is guaranteed by the Constitution but freedom to combine to keep others from publishing is not The lawsuit reveals that by March 2020 some of the world s largest news organizations joined forces with social media giants to form the TNI described by a BBC executive as an international partnership initiative convened by the BBC which links media organisations and social media platforms By their own admissions the TNI is a classic group boycott The real rivalry now another BBC executive boasted is not between for example the

interview the president of Emirates Airlines stated that the deployment of 5G is one of the most delinquent utterly irresponsible issue subjects call it what you like I ve seen in my aviation career He went on to say Somebody should have told them a long time ago that it would compromise safety of operation of aircraft in metropolitan areas with catastrophic consequences if this was allowed to continue Other airlines including Air India ANA and Japan Airlines also cancelled flights to some U S cities citing similar concerns A statement issued last Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration FAA states The FAA is working diligently to determine which altimeters are reliable and accurate where 5G is deployed in the United States The agency also says it anticipates some altimeters will be too susceptible to 5G interference For safety reasons aircraft with altimeters that fall into that category won t be allowed to make low visibility landings in areas where 5G is deployed as inaccurate information may be transmitted The fact that airlines outside the US are aghast at our policies signals that their countries made plans for this 5G inevitability said Children s

turning a blind eye to the obvious threats Experts explain that 5G is fundamentally different from all the previous generations of mobile network technologies While 4G networks use frequencies up to the mid band 1 6 GHz the 5G network uses frequencies up to the high band 24 48 GHz of the electromagnetic EM specifically the radiofrequency RF spectrum This order of magnitude increase is likely to have catastrophic consequences on human health including to children and other vulnerable populations said Holland Over 1500 peer reviewed scientific papers demonstrate biological and health impacts

transmission of 5G signals from the ground can interfere with aircraft equipment at relatively large distances posing a risk to airplane landing safety what risks do they pose directly on the ground
