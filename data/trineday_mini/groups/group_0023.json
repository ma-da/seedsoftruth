He proved incorruptible.\" He thanked them but protested wearily, \"If I have to keep earning that epitaph, it will wear me out!\" Visiting his father in Washington, lie admitted that his health had been impaired by working eighteen hours a day and longer, and he was bitter at having been used. \"I was hired as a smoke screen,\" lie charged. \"The politicians were buying the reputation I had earned in twenty-six years' service as a Marine. I was to make a loud noise, put on a brass hat, stage parades, chase the bandits off the streets-and let vice and rum run their hidden course!\" He was outraged by the huge sums lie saw being made illegally by everyone involved in violating the Volstead Act, while Marines who served their country were paid a paltry twenty dollars a month. In December, 1926, he wrote his father angrily, \"I do not suppose thee or the other men who are responsible for this Government have ever stopped to think what these $20 a month men arc doing towards the preservation of the dignity of this Government. Now where can this Government get such devoted service for a total cost per capita of $1,300 a year? Where can we hire men for $20 a month?\" His health still suffering, he began to think of retirement. But Lejeune urged him to stay in uniform: \"In the years to come the Corps will need your enthusiasm, and I had in mind that you would receive the next promotion to the rank of Major General. \"-My retirement according to age is not very far in the future, and there is always the possibility of one of the Major Generals causing a premature vacancy.\" Brooding over the whole question of Prohibition and law enforcement, Butler began to suspect that perhaps he had been wrong in trying", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:83:288306f244d4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13825, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 84, "text": "uniform: \"In the years to come the Corps will need your enthusiasm, and I had in mind that you would receive the next promotion to the rank of Major General. \"-My retirement according to age is not very far in the future, and there is always the possibility of one of the Major Generals causing a premature vacancy.\" Brooding over the whole question of Prohibition and law enforcement, Butler began to suspect that perhaps he had been wrong in trying to enforce an unenforceable law that the majority of the American people did not seem to want and went out *The Indispensable Man 93* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> of their way to violate. The government was wrong, he finally decided, in trying to legislate morality. In view of his fame as a stern enforcer of Prohibition, pru-dence suggested that he keep his changed views to himself. He was unpopular enough with the wets; to speak out now against the Volstead Act would only alienate millions of drys who considered him one of their knights in white armor. But popularity had never been as important to Smedley Butler as his compulsion to blurt out the truth in public and to kick sacred cows in the rump when they loitered in the path of justice. On January 7, 1927, in Washington, D.C., he gave the re-porters a story that flashed from coast to coast. The Volstead Act, he now declared, was \"a fool dry act, impossible of enforce-ment.\" It was, furthermore, \"class legislation,\" because the rich could avoid it and the poor could not. The sensational denunciation of Prohibition by one of its leading Republican crusaders plunged the dry forces of the nation into consternation. Democrats, rejoicing, began laying plans to make repeal of the Volstead Act one of the key issues in the presidential campaign of 1928. Butler's presence in Washington was occasioned by the out-break of a fresh crisis in China. To his delight, Lejeune informed him that lie would soon be headed overseas once more at the head of a combat brigade. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **14** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> China was being torn by civil war between Chiang Kai-shek, commander in chief of the new Nationalist armies of the South, and northern warlords led by Chang Tso-lin.

American missionaries and businessmen appealed to Washington for protection. The forty-six-year-old decorated hero of the Boxer Campaign who had helped relieve the sieges of Tientsin and Peking was made commander of a new Marine expeditionary force-the 3d Marine Brigade. His orders were \"to protect the lives and prop-erty of our Nationals in Tientsin; to offer temporary refuge in Tientsin for our Nationals; evacuation from the Interior and to make safe evacuation to the sea.\" The War Department warned Butler to be extremely prudent in anything he did or said; the smallest error of judgment on his part might have disastrous consequences in the highly volatile situation. Not without good reason, Lejeune added some prudent parting advice: \"Be careful to avoid talking to newspaper cor-respondents.\" He arrived in Shanghai on March 25, 1927, to find tension run-ning high. Chinese troops had attacked several consulates at Nanking, killing many foreigners, looting and burning the city. American businessmen and missionaries had escaped on gun-boats to Shanghai, whose port was now swarming with ships. Never before in history had the war vessels of so many different nations anchored together in one harbor. Barbed-wire entanglements had been erected, and the Inter-national Settlement was under martial law. All legations had ordered their nationals from the interior of China, from which there were daily reports of murders and outrages. A more violent version of the Boxer Rebellion seemed in the making, and the white settlements were gravely apprehensive. Butler's 3d Marine Brigade disembarked at the Standard Oil dock in the Whangpoo River opposite Shanghai and set up tents in the Standard Oil compound. Shortly afterward Butler was taken aboard the flagship of Admiral C. S. Williams, who greeted him frostily. *The Indispensable Man 95* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> \"What do you think of the situation, and what do you think of our participation?\" \"We don't have half enough men to perform our task here,\" Butler replied. \"We need more men to do it properly.\" The admiral snorted. \"So you're one of these fellows who wants to build a big job for himself and get promoted.\" Butler saw red. \"I intend to retire in a year,\" he snapped, \"and don't care whether I am promoted or not.

You asked for my opinion and I gave it to you. Now if you don't care to take my advice, and some Americans are murdered in this town, and you sit quietly here with half of the Marines available in the United States doing nothing but guarding coal piles, you will be held responsible!\" The admiral glared at him, but not without an aspect of re-spect. He was soon one of Butler's chief admirers. Careful to keep the American forces from getting involved in the fighting between the rival Chinese armies, Butler sought to maintain cordial relations with the Chinese people themselves. He had no stomach for any more Haiti-style interventions that would jockey him into the position of defending American busi-ness interests against native rebels, and he did not intend to risk a single Marine's life to get the job done he had been sent to China to do, unless it became absolutely necessary. Military leaders of other nations sought to organize a punitive expedition against the Kuomintang for the Nanking uprising. To Butler's relief, Admiral Williams refused to have anything to do with the scheme, although it had the enthusiastic endorsement of the American minister at Shanghai. On May 31 Butler wrote Lejeune, \"Now for a little 'secret stuff.' The American Minister ... is a nervous wreck. He sits up all night and talks in circles and would have had me in my grave had I stayed much longer. He feels discredited because our Government has not adopted his plan, which meant an invasion of China, followed by intervention and military Government, and is desirous of going home on leave to explain his side to the President with a hope of favorable action.\" He later observed, \"I held to the principle that the Chinese had to settle their own form of government and pick out their own *96 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> rulers. Any attempt to solve the Chinese tangle would have been shadow boxing. All we could do was to see that mutinous Chinese troops didn't get out of hand and shoot Americans. It was up to me to prevent a repetition of the Boxer and Nanking difficulties.\" When the danger to Shanghai seemed to ease while growing more critical in the North, Butler left two thousand Marines stationed in the city under Colonel Henry Davis, and led four thousand men up to Tientsin.

Do not interfere in Chinese quarrel.... I have not heard one person worthy of quoting who does not deplore the presence of Americans in China. . . . We are not in China to maintain order.

Any Marine who laid a hand on a ricksha coolie would be court-martialed, he warned, urging them to win goodwill for the Corps by friendly behavior. He himself cultivated the friendship of the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs and was invited to over twenty Chinese banquets. At one of them he met an American-educated Chinese woman named Mrs. Lu, who reminded him that he had helped evacuate her family by boat from Tientsin twenty-seven years earlier, when she had been three. and their society is said to number twenty million members. \"I well remember carrying you,\" he said to her delight. \"You considered me a hateful `foreign devil' and shrieked lustily, struggling every inch of the way.\" *The Indispensable Man 97* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> As fighting between the rival armies raged closer to Tientsin, the roar of guns echoed through the city. Butler kept the Marines on the alert as a defense force, as well as a rescue force ready to leave in minutes for any place in North China they were needed. To make sure that none of the warlords, whose allegiances were mercurial, entertained any notion of attacking his brigade, he invited them to review a dress parade. Some warlords were not intimidated and demanded that Butler take his Marines out of China.

Why, you can come into that square mile, tool\" When they protested against the flights of Marine planes over Chinese territory, Butler gave them pause for thought by re-minding them, \"You might want to escape in one some day.\" He also convinced them it would be imprudent to attack the American forces by taking them up in Marine planes for bombing practice. He later declared that he had fulfilled United States foreign policy requirements by intimidating the most hostile of the Chinese warlords \"with considerable ease. He shared the detestation of the Chinese people for the warlords and their troops, expressing his sympathy with the people in a letter to Lejeune: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> There is a movement out here which is gaining great headway and is being conducted by a society known as the \"Red Spears.\" Their aims and policies are similar to those of the Boxers in 1900 and is causing considerable uneasiness on the part of our people.

After flexing his muscles to impress them similarly at first, Butler then discreetly sought to \"keep in the background as much as possible, and not in any way behave like an army of occupation-more like a fire company, ready to spring out to the rescue of our people, behaving simply as rescue squads.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **15** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> On November 5, 1927, his wife, having left the children", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:88:c7b46837b234", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13830, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 89, "text": "his muscles to impress them similarly at first, Butler then discreetly sought to \"keep in the background as much as possible, and not in any way behave like an army of occupation-more like a fire company, ready to spring out to the rescue of our people, behaving simply as rescue squads.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **15** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> On November 5, 1927, his wife, having left the children in San Diego, arrived in Tientsin and joined him in a small hotel next to a godown where the Marines had been quartered during the Boxer fighting and where he had been carried when he was wounded in the leg. China's civil war had quieted down for the moment. In a report from Shanghai Colonel Henry Davis wrote Butler: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> I had dinner last night with General Chiang Kai-shek.

Of all the stupid boobs I ever met he is it. I don't believe he ever was the brains behind the movement of last summer.... He looks like a stupid ricksha coolie and grunts like a pig when spoken to. *The Indispensable Man 99* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> By the end of December Butler found himself in a financial bind and complained to his father of the struggle to get along on a brigadier general's pay of $530 a month, out of which he had to pay income tax and \"maintain an establishment for Snooks [daughter Ethel] and Tom Dick in the United States, and send Tommy [Smedley, Jr.] thru college, to say nothing of supporting Bunny [wife Ethel] and myself here in China.\" He added, \"I must entertain many, due to' my official position, and I must pay for the little entertainment out of my own pocket.\" His father consoled him with the reflection that although he might be better off financially if he were home with no chal-lenge to his abilities, \"thee would rot and the world would have been no better because thee happened to live in it.\" Lejeune wrote him that at special ceremonies on December 7, with the Secretary of the Navy present, Lejeune had accepted the bronze tablet honoring Butler, presented by a committee of Philadelphia's grateful citizens, and it had been put up in the Navy Building in Washington.

He also revealed that Thomas Butler was leading the fight in the House for a larger naval defense force, but the public was in a budget-cutting mood. Butler wrote his father: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Thy courage in advocating something which will cost money fills me with pride. Our people are all gluttons and their desire to hoard money is so great that they will prob-ably turn on thee and beat thee to death. It would probably be a good thing for our nation if we were to get a good trimming sometime, and perhaps they would learn that there is more in this world than unnecessarily fat bank ac-counts. The amount of money wasted by five rich men in America in one year would be sufficient to build and main-tain a navy capable of preserving our position as a world power. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The day before Christmas, 1927, the Standard Oil plant on the outskirts of Tientsin caught fire during a battle between the rival Chinese armies. Nine minutes after the alarm, Butler was leading a battalion of Marines to battle the blaze, utilizing fire--fighting experience he had gained as Director of Public Safety *100** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> in Philadelphia. He arrived on the scene to find two huge ware-houses blazing, with a warehouse filled with gasoline twenty feet away and six 3-million-gallon oil tanks close by. If they exploded, the death and devastation in Tientsin would be horrendous. Putting in a call for another thousand Marines, he fought furiously to contain the fire. They built a sixteen-foot wall of earth, empty drums, doors, and anything else that wouldn't burn between the blazing warehouses and the stores of gas, and had the fire under control by nightfall. But at 3:00 A.M. the main drain of the plant blew up, showering the river with a stream of burning oil. They worked through Christmas Day building a bulkhead around the mouth of the drain, only to have ice floes carry off part of it. The river flamed again, threatening the foreign compound on the opposite shore. They fought the conflagration for four days before Butler succeeded in bringing it under control. On New Year's Eve he wrote his father, \"It was a glorious fight and has done a great deal to weld this command together. ...

Everybody in Tientsin and Peking is highly pleased with the magnificent showing of our men.\" Standard Oil estimated their loss at a million dollars but thanked Butler for having saved them four million more. At the height of the blaze the admiring official in charge of the com-pany's Tientsin holdings had vowed to donate twenty thousand dollars toward a recreation hall for the Marines. Once the fire had been brought under control, however, Butler heard no more of the promise. He was disgusted with the company but on principle did not remind them. When he told Smedley, Jr., about it, his outraged son swore never to use a tank of Esso gas in his car for the rest of his life, and kept his word. Butler began having dark thoughts once more about the use of Marines to defend big-business profits overseas. Was the government's professed concern for the protection of Americans in China during the civil war the real reason for the presence of the Marines? Or was it to defend the properties of Standard Oil and other big American corporations? Serving under him in China was David M. Shoup, later to win a Congressional Medal of Honor at Tarawa and become a *The Indispensable Man 101* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> commandant of the Marine Corps as well as a celebrated critic of the Vietnam war. \"Butler was one helluva soldier-no doubt about his military capabilities,\" Shoup recalled later in ad-miration. \"I really felt I wanted to emulate him in every way. Everything I saw in Tientsin indicated that he was a helluva showman, too, but a good warrior in the service of his country.\" The author questioned General Shoup about the Marines' mission in China in 1927-1928 \"I would say it was pretty hard to say who we were supporting there,\" he replied. \"It was just our presence there that was the thing. I heard no solid reason for why we were being sent; we were just told we were going to fight the Chinese. We didn't know what the mission was. But we landed at the Standard Oil docks and lived in Standard Oil compounds and were ready to protect Standard Oil's investment.

In March he wrote his father that he was wary of involvement with any other power represented in China because of his suspicion of their selfish interests: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The Japanese are most anxious to control all of North China, particularly Manchuria, and will sacrifice anything and back anyone who will assure to them this control. . . .

It behooves us to keep absolutely aloof from everyone and to do nothing which is not directly in line with the saving of lives. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Letters from home told him that his father had become very ill. Deeply worried, he wrote Thomas Butler in April: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> I do so hope . . . thee will not run thy legs off for this fool Navy.

Storms having washed away a bridge on the Tientsin-Peking main road in September, he ordered the Marines to build a temporary structure out of scrap lumber to keep the highway open. The delighted villagers urged him to allow the bridge to remain; instead he magnified Chinese-American good-will by building a more permanent bridge for them. Chinese officials named it after him and made him an honorary Chinese citizen. He then offered to rebuild the whole road from Peking to Tientsin with Marine equipment, to make it suitable for motor use, if they would supply soldier labor. They happily pro-vided fifteen hundred Chinese troops for the job, which he personally supervised. The Chinese peasants were grateful for the road and bridges that helped them get their fresh produce to market. When the road was officially opened, the governor of the province held a celebration at which Butler was the guest of honor. Ancient Chinese custom decreed that when the citizens of a town or district unanimously voted a man to be a great public benefactor, he could be awarded an Umbrella of Ten Thousand Blessings-a magnificent canopy of red satin with small silk streamers proclaiming his greatness.

No foreigner in Tientsin or Peking had ever rated one. But now the people of Tientsin pre-sented a Blessings Umbrella to Smedley Butler. Soon afterward he drove into Boxertown just as a detached column from Chiang Kai-shek's army advanced into the opposite end of the town to loot it. His car kicked up so much racket that it sounded like machine-gun fire. The Nationalists, thinking he had an army behind him, fled. Despite Butler's protests that he had done nothing at all to help them, the people of Boxer-town hailed him as a deliverer. When he received a second Blessings Umbrella with its silk streamers inscribed in Chinese, one banner read, \"Your kindness is always in the minds of people.\" The other: \"General Butler loves China as he loves America.\" The second award moved him deeply, because Boxertown was the very same town from which Boxers, twenty-eight years earlier, had poured fire on his company, killing three Marines and wound-ing nine. After he made a speech recalling this event, he learned *104 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> that five old men in the crowd that had just presented him with Boxertown's greatest honor had been among the Boxers who had shot at him in 1900. He was equally popular with his men, frequently working be-side them when there was physical labor to be done. Junior officers were so caught up by his gung-ho leadership, General Shoup recalled, that they, too, worked voluntarily beside the enlisted men. \"Never before or since,\" one of them said later in awe, \"have I ever known a general who could actually inspire officers to want to do physical labor.\" In the fall of 1928 Butler followed developments by radio in the presidential race between Herbert Hoover and A1 Smith, deeply interested in the campaign issues that touched two facets of his personal experience-Prohibition and Latin American rela-tions. He wrote Lejeune in October, \"There seems no doubt that Hoover will be elected President-I guess, however, the country will survive.\" Orders for the Marines to begin pulling out of China came from President Coolidge in December. As he left China in Janu-ary, 1929, Butler's affection and admiration for the Chinese people was so great that he wrote Lejeune, \"It may be that when I am retired I will live among them.\" Their enthusiasm for him was equally unrestrained.

A friend with the Asiatic Fleet wrote him, \"The sendoff which the newspapers at Tientsin gave to you and Mrs. Butler was a great and just tribute to the cordial relations which you had so successfully established, not only with the Americans and the Chinese, but with everybody you came in contact with during your stay in North China.\" Butler was awarded the Yangtze Service Medal and in July, 1929, promoted to major general-at forty-eight the youngest Marine officer ever to have reached this rank. The Navy Depart-ment declared, \"Probably no finer example of successful arbitra-tion by American officers has been demonstrated in recent years than the peace-making achievements that crowned General Butler's efforts in China in 1927 and 1928.\" *The Indispensable Man **105* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **17** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Back home, Butler winced when Lejeune asked him to take command of the Parris Island, South Carolina, base. Weary after his China stint, he felt a need to renew his ties with kith and kin in his hometown of West Chester. He talked of retiring. \"I had better begin to think what is best for me and my family,\" he told Lejeune. \"I have given over thirty years of my best to the Marine Corps.\" He was given a long leave home, where he became aware of a rising tide of American sentiment matching his own growing distrust of the reasons for which armed forces were sent over-seas. It had begun with a belated disillusionment over World War I, sparked by such books as *All Quiet on the Western Front *and *Merchants o *f *Death. *In 1925 a National Committee on the Cause and Cure of War had been founded, and a rapidly de-veloping pacifist movement had compelled the government to enter disarmament negotiations. By August, 1928, the antiwar movement was worldwide. Assigned once more to command the base at Quantico, Butler made it a Marine showplace and developed Marine football, baseball, and basketball teams with such high esprit de corps that they played the best college teams of the East and often beat them. His fatherly interest in his men led him to help them with personal problems, get them out of trouble, and encourage them to write home. The admiration of Marines' families was expressed in a typical letter to him from Philadelphia: \"My brother in the Marines just came back from Nicaragua and he ask", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:95:3e1181503fac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13837, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 96, "text": "developed Marine football, baseball, and basketball teams with such high esprit de corps that they played the best college teams of the East and often beat them.

His Mother was operated for Tumbers but it was a baby boy and to day it was Christend Smedley D. Butler Ruth.\" Military and patriotic organizations persistently sought to lure *106 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> him into joining. He wired the Sons of the American Revolution, \"My ancestors were all Quakers and I regret to say took no part, as far as I know, in the American Revolutionary War, so I am not entitled to be a Son of the American Revolution.\" Actually, recently discovered evidence indicates that his great-great--grandfather, William Butler, although a Quaker, probably served in the Revolution, along with three brothers. He did, however, finally yield to the pleas of American Legion official James J. Deighan that he attend the national convention in Scranton as a guest of honor. \"The success of the 11th Na-tional Convention ... last week was in large part due,\" Deighan wrote him gratefully afterward, \"to the fact that you were our guest.... The Legionnaires are all for you.\" News came that John Lejeune was resigning as commandant to head the Virginia Military Academy and would be replaced by Butler's other old friend, Buck Neville, now a major general. Thirty years had gone by since they had been an inseparable trio in the feverish days of the Cuban campaign. Butler began to feel the weight of time and too many campaigns. The endless demands on him made retirement and rest seem alluring. Asked once too often for a speech, he replied in October, 1929, \"I am not a crusader or a propagandist, nor have I message for anybody, so there is no object in my appearing anywhere, except for money.\" He began to charge stiff lecture fees to cut down de-mands for him to travel everywhere to address luncheons and meetings as guest of honor. Perusing the morning papers on October z, he noted a state-ment by Charles E. Mitchell, of the National City Bank: \"I know of nothing fundamentally wrong with the stock market or with the underlying business and credit situation.\" The following day there was a minor panic on the New York Stock Exchange, and a day later the market collapsed.

On Octo-ber 29 the bottom fell out in the blackest day in stock-market history, and within two weeks over thirty billion dollars in stock values were wiped out. The Great Depression had begun, and with it a swift rush of events that would involve Smedley Butler in a fantastic plot to overthrow the American Government. *The Indispensable Man **107* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> At first the American people imagined that the stock-market crash was something that merely affected Wall Street. In a mes-sage to Congress President Hoover reassured them that there was nothing to worry about; business confidence had been re-established. Bootleggers, gang wars, and crime continued to be the major preoccupation of the public. Despite Butler's reluctance, more and more organizations in-sisted upon hearing the general who never pulled his punches speak out on the law-and-order problem. There was a ground swell in Pennsylvania to nominate Philadelphia's former crime-buster for governor on the Republican ticket. A friend wrote from Washington, \"I note that some of the politicos may draft you as Dictator for Washington.\" In December, 1929, Butler was glad when a demand arose for a Senate investigation of the use of Marines to intervene in Latin American affairs. He upset the Hoover Administration by shooting from the hip in an extemporaneous speech he made in Pittsburgh, revealing that the State Department had rigged the Nicaraguan elections of 1912 by ordering him to use strong-arm methods during the Marine intervention. \"The opposition candidates in Nicaragua were declared bandits when it became necessary to elect our man to office,\" he ex-plained. And he said of Diaz, \"The fellow we had there nobody liked, but he was a useful fellow to us, so we had to keep him in. How to keep him in was a problem.\" Then he described how the election had been rigged, under orders, for that purpose. \"When a Marine is told to do something,\" he said, \"he does it.\" Butler's disclosures, picked up by the press, created a sensa-tion in Washington. Alarm bells rang in the State Department; the last thing the administration wanted was an investigation concerning Marines then stationed in Nicaragua. Officials angrily attacked Butler for \"loose talk.\" Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson wrote a furious memo to Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> . . .

Butler saw red. \"This is the first time in my service of thirty-two years,\" he snapped back, \"that I've ever been hauled on the carpet and treated like an unruly schoolboy. I haven't always approved of the actions of the administration, but I've always faithfully car-ried out my instructions. If I'm not behaving well it is because I'm not accustomed to reprimands, and you can't expect me to turn my cheek meekly for *official *slaps!\" \"I think this will be all,\" Adams said icily. \"I don't ever want to sec you here again!\" \"You never will if I can help it!\" Butler rasped, storming out of his *office *livid with anger. Just two days after his attack on the government's gunboat diplomacy, which provoked a great public commotion, Under-secretary of State J. Reuben Clark privately submitted to Secre-tary of State Stimson the draft of a pledge that the United States would never again claim the right to intervene in the affairs of any Latin American country as an \"international policeman.\" The Clark Memorandum, which later became official policy-for a while at least-repudiated the (Theodore) Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine that Smedley Butler had unmasked as raw gunboat diplomacy. *The Indispensable Man **109* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **18** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Defying Adams, Butler continued to express his convictions freely and publicly about current problems on which he felt qualified to speak out.

He was delighted in May, 1930, when Congress, over President Hoover's veto, passed a Spanish-American War pension bill for veterans. With the unemployment rate climbing steadily to almost five million that year, he urged passage of a bonus bill for all veterans. The government had a solemn obliga-tion to citizens who had risked their lives to protect it, Butler insisted, to see to it that they, their wives, and their children were not allowed to languish in hunger, poverty, and despair. Two deaths that year saddened him. His brother Horace was killed in a car accident in Texas, and his old friend Buck Neville died suddenly after briefly replacing Lejeune as commandant. Now Butler was the senior-ranking major general in the Marine Corps, the logical choice as next commandant. An official in-spection report had also praised Quantico as the finest post in the United States. But on the same day that it appeared, Marine Corps headquarters sent Butler a curt letter suggesting that he make fewer speeches, because his Quantico post was in poor shape as a result of his frequent absences. In July, 1930, Secretary Adams paid a visit to Quantico, un-doubtedly to lay the groundwork for an official excuse to reject Butler's fitness to be appointed commandant. Butler was equally determined to demonstrate that the rebuke he had received about the \"poor shape\" of his post was totally unwarranted. Escorting Adams everywhere over the barracks and parade grounds, he proved that Quantico was a model of efficiency. The dress-uniform review of his crack regiments was flawless, and the Marine air squadron performed brilliant maneuvers. The secretary acidly observed that Quantico was the most <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *110 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> expensive place in the nation for training men. Controlling his temper, Butler pointed out the sports stadium built at almost no cost to the taxpayers. \"That's one of your damned follies!\" Adams muttered. He was clearly attempting to provoke the volatile Butler into flaring up, and Butler knew it. Clenching his jaw, the general remained out-wardly calm but could not resist telling a sharply barbed joke about \"an old buzzard\" who couldn't be pleased by anything. Several weeks later a Navy selection board met to choose a new commandant. One staff admiral declared that he'd be damned before he'd see Butler made commandant; in no time at all the damned fellow would be trying to run the whole Navy. Others agreed. Adams happily discarded Butler's name and pro-posed instead Brigadier General Ben H. Fuller who, despite being junior in rank, was approved by the board.

The news was the last straw for Butler, who now determined to retire within a year to devote himself to advocating the de-fense of the United States as he believed it ought to be defended. Resolutely opposed to military intervention overseas on behalf of Wall Street interests, he planned to arouse the American people into preventing any more. At the same time he had doubts about the wisdom of entering world disarmament agreements, as leading pacifists proposed. Could the United States afford to dis-arm and trust the word of military dictators like Italy's Mussolini, with Hitler's swiftly growing Nazi party in Germany already laying the groundwork for a new war by renouncing the Ver-sailles Treaty? In a speech before the influential Contemporary Club of Philadelphia on January 19, 1931, he declared, \"I agree with Dr. Hull of Swarthmore; if we could all lay down our arms, there couldn't be any war. But there are mad-dog nations who won't get the word, who will refuse, to sign the agreement, or, if they sign it, refuse to abide by it.\" Seeking to impress his listeners with the kind of men dictators were, he added, \"A friend of mine said he had a ride in a new automobile with Mussolini, a car with an armored nose that could knock over fences and slip under barbed wire. He said that they drove through the country and towns at seventy miles *The Indispensable Man **111* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> per hour. They ran over a child and my friend screamed. Musso-lini said he shouldn't do that, that it was only one life and the affairs of the state could not be stopped by one life.\" His listeners gasped audibly. Arms akimbo, his head thrust forward angrily, Butler demanded in a scornful voice, \"How can you talk disarmament with a man like *that?\"* He had been told that the audience was a private one and that he could speak in confidence, but he soon learned that there was no such thing as confidential speech for a man so often in the public eye. Among his listeners, unknown to him, was an Italian diplomat from Washington who had been invited to attend. The outraged diplomat at once reported Butler's remarks to Italian Ambassador de Martino. The embassy sent a frantic cable to Rome, then filed an official protest with the State De-partment. The morning papers broke the story, and it made sen-sational headlines.

A high-ranking American officer, wearing the Marine uniform on active duty, had publicly insulted the head of a friendly power. Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson felt compelled to deliver a formal apology to Mussolini: \"The sincere regrets of this gov-ernment are extended to Mr. Mussolini and to the Italian people for the discourteous and unwarranted utterances by a commis-sioned officer of this government on active duty.\" The Washington military-diplomatic bureaucracy now decided that this time Butler had gone too far. Formal charges against him were hastily drawn and presented to President Hoover, who promptly signed them. On the morning of January 29 Marine Commandant Ben Fuller phoned Butler at Quantico. \"General Butler, you are hereby placed under arrest to await trial by general court-martial. You will turn over your command to your next senior, General Berkeley, and you will be restricted to the limits of your post. The Secretary of the Navy wishes you to know that this action is taken by the direct personal order of the President of the United States.\" The charges were \"conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline\" and \"conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentle-man.\" These accusations were known in the armed forces as <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *112 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Mother Hubbard charges because they \"covered everything.\" Most Marine officers were convinced that the powers-that-be had decided to \"throw the book\" at Old Gimlet Eye and drum him out of the Corps dishonorably, in revenge for his well-known fighting man's scorn of Washington's desk warriors. Butler notified Brigadier General Randolph C. Berkeley, his junior officer at Quantico and a good friend, that he was under arrest-the first general officer to be placed under arrest since the Civil War. Butler's two-star command flag was lowered on the Quantico flagstaff, and he offered his sword to Berkeley, who indignantly refused to accept it. Berkeley was outraged that Smedley Butler, who wore eighteen decorations and was one of only four military men in American history who had ever been awarded two Medals of Honor, should be put under arrest by a telephone call. He was even more indignant that Butler had been confined to the post, hindering his ability to arrange for his own defense at the court-martial.

Leonard rushed off to Quantico immediately. A prisoner on his own post, Butler was wryly amused by an invitation to be guest of honor at a sportsmen's dinner. His aide-de-camp, L. C. Whitaker, replied dryly for him: \"As General Butler is under arrest, he will be unable to attend.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **19** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> News of his arrest brought an outpouring of sympathy and support for him not only among his far-flung and influential staunch friends but also among millions of Americans who despised Mussolini and everything the dictator stood for. Admiring Butler *The Indispensable Man **113* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> for speaking out against fascism, they were appalled that he was being court-martialed for being a patriot who believed in democ-racy, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, and distrusted dictators who denied such civil liberties to their own people. Butler also had the support of millions of veterans who knew him as a magnificent fighting man and hero, as well as a general who was on the side of the enlisted man against the brass; and of hundreds of thousands of admirers who still remembered the courageous fight he had waged against the crooked politicians and racketeers of Philadelphia. Many Americans, moreover, were fed up with the Hoover Ad-ministration for sitting on its hands with the Depression rapidly worsening, and esteemed a public leader who at least had the courage of his convictions and spoke them bluntly. Italian--American anti-Fascists also rallied to Butler's support by bitter protests against Stimson's apology to Mussolini. The administration grew alarmed as a rolling tidal wave of angry criticism o Butler's arrest swept across the country. \"Unless we are mistaken,\" declared a Washington *Daily News* editorial, \"the American people are likely to consider these Cabinet officials guilty of a strange timidity toward Mussolini on one hand and of an unwarranted harshness toward a splendid American soldier on the other.\" Public opinion on the side of Butler made itself felt so quickly and emphatically that the administration found it necessary to ameliorate the conditions of his arrest.

His restriction to the post was lifted, allowing him to travel where he needed to in order to arrange for his defense. He wired New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had presented him with one of his Medals of Honor as Undersecretary of the Navy, \"Am in great trouble. Can you assist me in securing services of John W. Davis as counsel?\" Davis, a leading Wall Street corporation lawyer, had been the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for President in 1924. Roosevelt persuaded Davis to agree to argue Butler's case at the trial. A visit to Butler's aunt, lawyer Isabel Darlington, also en-listed Roland S. Morris, a former ambassador to Japan, as Henry Leonard's counsel in preparing the case. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *114 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Thousands of sympathetic messages poured into Quantico. Butler was deeply touched by two letters especially: Both Governor Roosevelt and former Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels volunteered to testify in his behalf at the court-martial. That news stunned Adams and Hoover. The trial date was set for February 16. Butler was impatient to have it sooner, anxious to get all the facts before the public, but Leonard and Morris argued that the torrent of favorable publicity was helping his case. They proved correct. Protests against the court-martial were pouring into the White House by the sackful. The trial threatened to become a cause celebre, with, implications for the whole system of military justice, especially after a Marine colonel denounced American court-martials as basically unjust. The impending trial was also throwing a spanner into Secretary of State Stimson's plans for forging an international naval arms limitation agreement. Crucial to that agreement were preliminary negotiations between Italy and France, which feared Italian and German fascism. Resisting Stimson's pressure to sign an arms limitation agreement with Mussolini, the French cited as justification popular American support of Butler's view that Mussolini could not be trusted and widespread protest over his arrest for saying so. Mussolini himself, alarmed by the bad press he was getting in the United States, with a few notorious exceptions, sent word to Stimson that he considered the whole incident an \"unfortunate error\" and believed it would be best for all concerned if the whole plan to court-martial Butler could be quietly dropped. Stimson, who now realized that he had a tiger by the tail, passed the word to the crestfallen Adams.

Stimson, who now realized that he had a tiger by the tail, passed the word to the crestfallen Adams. The Secretary of the Navy now had to beat a hasty retreat with as much dignity as he could muster out of his humiliating predicament. He sent Leonard a letter announcing his decision to \"settle\" the matter by calling off the court-martial and simply detaching Butler from his command with a reprimand, placing him on the inactive list with the limbo status of \"awaiting orders.\" In polite language Leonard told Adams to go to hell. A few hours later, after checking with his principals, the Secretary of *The Indispensable Man **115* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> the Navy then offered to let the whole thing drop by just detaching Butler from the command and issuing a reprimand. Again Leonard turned him down flatly. Adams frantically tried a third proposal. The administration would settle, he now pleaded, for an official letter of apology. There would be no court-martial and no removal of Butler from Quantico. Roaring a third refusal, Leonard demanded that Adams stop dawdling and proceed to trial. By now the administration, in a state of near panic, meekly asked Leonard just what terms for settling the matter would be acceptable to General Butler. Leonard, jubilant at this abject surrender, conferred with Morris and Butler. Angry at his persecutors, Butler wanted to insist upon the court-martial, but as he confided to a relative on February 12, \"Mother and Bunny [his wife] were both breaking under the strain,\" and he decided that it wasn't worth their anguish to fight the establishment to a finish. \"I feel we could have licked them badly,\" he added, \"but now I have a club over their heads, as they were warned that we would tell if they tried any more persecutions.\" Since he had already won a clear moral victory, he decided he could afford to let the government save a little face. He agreed to write a letter reiterating his explanation that the Mussolini speech had been made at a private club meeting and expressing regret that anything he had said \"caused embarrassment to the Government.\" He would accept an official gentle \"reprimand,\" which was, however, not to be written by Adams but by Leonard himself for Adams to sign.

The administration hastily accepted Butler's terms, and the suitable papers were drawn. On February 9 the court-martial was canceled, and a mild reprimand credited Butler's explanation that his speech had been intended to be \"confined to the limits of four walls,\" as well as acknowledging his \"long record of brilliant service.\" One newspaper headlined the story: \"YOU'RE A VERY BAD BOY\"- SAYS ADAMS TO BUTLER. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *116 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The general's admirers grinned in delight. He was released from arrest and restored to duty, his command flag once more fluttering over Quantico. It was a signal and remarkable victory for a lone Marine officer to win over the President of the United States and the Secretaries of State and the Navy. \"I was glad to sec Smedley Butler get out of his case as he did,\" Will Rogers wrote in his column on March 15, 1931. \"You know that fellow just belongs in a war all the time. He don't be-long in Peace time. He is what I would call a natural born warrior. He will fight anybody, any time. But he just can't dis-tinguish Peace from war. He carries every medal we ever gave out. He has two Congressional Medals of Honor, the only man that ever got a double header.* You give him another war and he will get him another one.... I do admire him.\" The press was reluctant to let the story die. The wire services carried journalist Cornelius Vanderbilt's revelation that he had been the one who had told Butler the true story about Mussolini. He corrected a few details. After running down the child, Van-derbilt said, Mussolini had observed the journalist looking back in horror and had patted his knee reassuringly, saying, \"Never look back, Mr. Vanderbilt-always look ahead in life.\" Italian officials now sought to deny that Vanderbilt had ever ridden in a car with Mussolini. Butler was appalled, but not too surprised, to read that Ralph T. O'Neill, national commander of the American Legion, had presented to Italian Ambassador de Martino a resolution in praise of Mussolini, passed by the National Executive Committee. There were powerful and influential wealthy elements in the Legion leadership who admired Mussolini's shackling of Italian labor unions under the guise of fighting Reds.

Now that he had defeated the attempt of his enemies to court-martial him, Butler revealed to his friends that he intended to go ahead with his original plan to retire at the end of the year. On March 1 he informed the press, barking, \"Get this clear-I are not *resigning!*\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *Rogers's mistake was a common error.

The Alber Lecture Bureau of Cleveland pleaded with him to take a leave of absence and satisfy the groups all over the country clamoring to hear him. He was offered half of admission fees charged, with a minimum guarantee of $250, $25 a day expenses and railroad fare. At the same time Philadelphia's Mayor Mackey asked him if he would assist in raising funds for the city's Committee for Unemployment Relief. Applying for a two months' leave of absence to make a speaking tour, he turned over half his fees of about six thousand dollars to the unemployed and also to the Salvation Army, which he respected as being genuinely responsive to the needs of both the poor and the doughboys in trenches. He explained the impulse for his decision by a letter he had received while he was under arrest during the Mussolini affair. \"General,\" a veteran had written him, \"the stamp on this letter cost me the two of my last four cents, but I wanted you to know that I am for you.\" \"I almost cried,\" Butler admitted. \"I feel that if that poor fellow could give me half of what he had, I can give him half of what I've got.\" He was also strongly influenced in his sympathy for the luckless by his aunt, Isabel Darlington, who headed the Chester County Poor Board and fought county authorities vigorously to increase welfare funds. Publishers begged him for a book. \"I am making far more money out of making speeches than I ever could out of writing a book,\" he replied practically, \"so unless Bobbs-Merrill are going to outbid the public...I would be cutting off my nose to spite my face by writing instead of talking.\" But he finally consented 118 *The Plot to Seize the White House The Indispensable Man 119*", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:106:cb63242b44d9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13848, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 107, "text": "County Poor Board and fought county authorities vigorously to increase welfare funds.

He ac-cepted radio offers to relate his experiences in the Marines. If Butler did not consciously seek publicity, there was little doubt that the headlines sought him out. His rapport with the press was explained by one newsman's observation that he was \"colorful copy and a helluva guy.\" He often said himself, \"There are three types of people who understand me-Marines, police-men, and newspapermen.\" His chief interest in stories about him in the press was less vanity than a determination to disseminate views he held strongly. With the first ominous rumblings of war beginning to be heard in both Europe and Asia, he was determined to steel the Ameri-can people against letting themselves be dragged into any more foreign wars. He would tell them the whole truth about the use that had been made of the Marines by the government in the name of protecting democracy and \"American interests\" abroad. On August 21, 1931, invited to address an American Legion convention in Connecticut, he made the first no-holds-barred antiwar speech of his career. It stunned all who heard it or read it in the few papers that dared report it in part: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> I spent 33 years . . . being a high-class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers.

I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City [Bank] boys to collect revenue in. I helped in the rape of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street....

There is no use talking about abolishing war; that's damn foolishness. Take the guns away from men and they will fight just the same. . . . In the Spanish-American War we didn't have any bullets to shoot, and if we had not had a war with a nation that was already licked and looking for an excuse to quit, we would have had hell licked out of us....

Hell, I'm a pacifist, but I always have a club behind my back! <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Earlier that same day, before Hoover had had a chance to read the speech, reporters asked the President if he would seek to delay the general's retirement. \"I assume that if General Butler wishes to retire, the authorities will approve,\" Hoover answered cautiously. \"The general is a very distinguished and gallant officer and I have no doubt that if the country has need, it always can secure his services.\" Next day, when Butler's attack on big business was reported, attempts to get any statement from the White House met with icy silence. And on that day, providing a punctuation mark to Butler's doubts that the Kellogg-Briand Pact protected any nation from aggression, Japan invaded Manchuria and reduced the pact to a worthless scrap of paper. On October 1, 1931, friends of Smedley Butler from all stations in life, and from all periods of his career, gathered at Quantico as his two-star command flag was hauled down once more, this lime with full honors.

I want you to come around and see me, especially if you ever get into trouble, and I will help you if I can.

He had embarrassed governments, large and small, including his own, by his relentless candor, but his courage and honesty had ' won the admiration of millions of Americans. His speeches be-' came more vitriolic than ever, scorching the hides of the power-ful and the highly placed. He met eager requests for articles by magazines and news-paper syndicates with the help of his friend E. Z. Dimitman, who was now night city editor of the Philadelphia *Inquirer. *Dimitman would flesh out his views on war and peace, which Butler then edited and revised to his own satisfaction. There never seemed to be enough money. Although he received some lecture fees up to $500, the average fee came to $25o and in many cases turned out to be far less.

He had thought to remodel the house for $35,000, but it had turned out to cost far more, and he was forced to sell most of the land to pay off the mortgage. As a civilian Butler was close-fisted with money, gently but firmly resisting the endless letters he received begging for hand-outs, because he had no money to spare. His thrifty wife kept an old, ragged, shabby fur coat in the closet, over thirty years after he had brought it home for her from the Boxer Rebellion. She never wore it, but could not bring herself to throw it away. He himself upset many military organizations by canceling his membership and journal subscriptions without offering any ex-planation. He was too proud to admit the real reason; he simply had to prune expenses. Out of uniform, he took pride in his appearance and dressed well but conservatively. Unable to break the traditions of thirty--three years of dress parade, he polished his shoes daily and buffed the buttons on his white, custom-made summer suits. His thought patterns, too, continued to dwell primarily on military concerns. One of his objectives was to stir up a demand that the Marine Corps be removed from under the thumb of politically appointed desk admirals of the Navy and set up as a separate branch of the armed forces under their own leaders. He gave his reasons in an article called \"To Hell with the Admirals!

The tablet that had been erected in his honor in the Navy Building was removed. Later located and rescued by a Butler Memorial Commission, it was installed in Philadelphia's City Hall after his death. Another article Butler wrote for *Liberty *stirred the wrath of the Honduras Government by exposing the collaboration of Honduran and other Central American dictators with American banking and commercial interests. The controlled Honduran press accused him of misrepresenting the situation and showered him with epithets. From Tegucigalpa a New *York Times *cor-respondent wired, \"It is realized that he is now retired, and not subject to the restraint which can be imposed on an officer in active service.\" More and more of Butler's attention was directed to the stead-ily worsening Depression and what it was doing to the country. He was outraged when hunger marchers who had gone to Wash-ington on December 7 were denied admission to the White House to petition for jobs. During 1932 stocks fell go percent, farm products 6o percent, industrial production 50 percent. By the end of the year fifteen million Americans were in the ranks of the unemployed. Home-owners and farmers were being dispossessed for nonpayment of taxes and debts. Outraged neighbors in many communities were setting up roadblocks with guns to bar outside bidders at fore-closure auctions so that the property could be bought for a song and returned to its owners. Alarmed bankers saw this develop-ment as a Communist threat. Butler's antagonism toward big business intensified. On Febru-ary 14, 1932, the United Press quoted him as saying, \"I've about <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *The Indispensable Man **123* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> come to tile conclusion that some American corporations abroad are, in a measure, responsible for trouble with the natives simply because of the way they treat them. . . .

Davis, former Secretary of Labor under Hoover, for the Re-publican nomination for senator. His admirers were already demanding that Butler run for governor. \"I am not going to run for the Senate or governorship,\" he growled to newspaper friends, \"and then have the politicians laugh at me.\" But Pinchot's entreaties were too strong and per-sistent, and Butler reluctantly agreed. Stumping the state, he appealed to Republican voters with a platform promising jobs for the unemployed and home prop-erty loans for debtors. Campaigning for a bonus bill, be placed all his decorations and uniforms in a vault, publicly vowing never to wear them again until soldiers got their bonus. Although he was personally popular, two issues he campaigned for in 1932-Prohibition and the soldiers' bonus-were not. Despite receiving half a million votes, he was defeated. Paul Comly French of the Philadelphia *Record *revealed that Gov-ernor Pinchot had set Butler up for defeat to eliminate him as a political threat, making a secret deal to support Davis. The Pinchot political machine had been used against Butler in key election districts. Reporter Jesse Laventhol, later city editor of the Philadelphia *Record, *who had been Butler's press secretary during the cam-paign, told the author, \"Butler's sponsors failed him . . . , trading off votes for Davis in return for electing certain state senators to give the governor control of that body.\" So Smedley Butler never went to Congress like his father. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *124 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **22** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> In the early summer of 1932 over twenty thousand veterans and their families joined in a Bonus Army march to Washington, camping on the edge of the Capital to demand payment of a two-billion-dollar cash bonus to all veterans. The House, tinder pressure, quickly passed the Patman Bonus Bill on June 17, but the Republican Senate rejected it, 62 to 18. Butler was indignant at the failure of Congress to honor Amer-ica's pledge to its fighting men and was thoroughly disgusted with Hoover's failure to do anything about the plight of the nation except issue optimistic reports that prosperity was \"just around the corner.\" On June 30, while the Democratic convention was in session, he announced that he might, for the first time in his life, vote Democratic \"if the right man is nominated for President.\" It was no secret that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:112:3f907d684e69", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13854, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 113, "text": "Butler was indignant at the failure of Congress to honor Amer-ica's pledge to its fighting men and was thoroughly disgusted with Hoover's failure to do anything about the plight of the nation except issue optimistic reports that prosperity was \"just around the corner.\" On June 30, while the Democratic convention was in session, he announced that he might, for the first time in his life, vote Democratic \"if the right man is nominated for President.\" It was no secret that he saw the right man as New York's governor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had already broadcast an impressive speech on the need of the American Government to discover its \"forgotten man.\" When Roosevelt won the nomination, pledging a New Deal along with the repeal of Prohibition, Butler wired him, \"We salute your nomination as one of the greatest blessings granted any nation in an hour of desperate need.\" He offered to help F.D.R.'s campaign any way he could, and Roosevelt asked him to get in touch with Democratic campaign manager James A. Farley, or Roosevelt's chief secretary, Louis Howe. Butler soon began stumping for F.D.R. In a speech before the General So-ciety of Mechanics and Tradesmen in New York on July 7 he warned that the government had to be rescued from \"the clutches of the greedy and dishonest\": *The Indispensable Man 125* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Today, with all our wealth, a deathly gloom hangs over us.

As \"a stranger to my native land and to my fellow citizens,\" he felt a strong compulsion to \"sec America last\" and learn about them, too. So he began visiting over one hundred cities in forty-eight states, \"keeping my eyes and cars open all the time.\" Years of delivering training talks to his troops and pep talks before and during battle had made him an articulate extem-poraneous speaker. Without a note to refer to lie held audiences spellbound, and each time be delivered a talk it was different. A fast thinker on his feet, he spoke in the colorful idiom of everyday language, which he used with the impact of a shower of arrows. He was only partially successful in his attempts to civilianize his colorful barracks argot. One Milwaukee newspaper, describing a speech lie made at a First Methodist Episcopal church in September, 1932, ran a story headlined: BUTLER TALKS IN CHURCH, *126 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> USES *NICE *LANGUAGE. \"Only one `hell' and two `damns' spiced his remarks throughout the evening.\" What he heard and saw on his tour convinced him that Americans were hungry for a change in the administration especially for a turn away from foreign affairs to home problems. But he found no indication that Main Street America either wanted revolutionary change or thought it likely, despite alarm over a Red menace in the conservative press. \"I held personal conversations with more than two thousand persons in all walks of life,\" he said on October z, 1932*, *after his tour, \"and they gave me a new and true insight into the people of America. I learned that the average American is convinced that no change in the form of our government is necessary or advisable.\" The attempt by conservatives to smear \"anyone who utters a progressive thought\" as a Red, he pointed out, was helping a \"handful of agitators in their vain efforts to foment disorder and discontent with our form of government.\" He branded Republi-can warnings that a Democratic victory would turn America socialist an absurd myth. When a new political group called the Roosevelt Republican Organization was formed in Philadelphia, Butler was asked to take a leading role in it.

A week before Election Day Butler made a slashing attack on Hoover in a speech to an enthusiastic rally of Queens, New York, veterans, describing himself as \"a member of the Hoover-for-Ex-President League because Hoover used gas and bayonets on unarmed human beings.\" \"Nobody has any business occupying the White House who doesn't love his own people,\" he declared, adding, \"I was raised Republican, but I was born American. I have no ring through my nose, and I vote for whom I please.\" He insisted that the bonus must be paid: \"The bonus is an amount of money that the American people owe the soldier, but anybody demanding it is charged with lack of patriotism. During the war nobody charged the officers of the Bethlehem Steel *The Indispensable Man **127* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Corporation or any of the other corporations who received enormous bonuses with `raiding the Treasury.'\" American big business, he accused, had been responsible for United States entry into World War I and was now \"getting ready to start another one in the East.\" On November 8 Butler's choice for President won, and the House of Representatives went Democratic by a margin of three to one. A chorus of newspaper fury and frustration re-flected the dismay of banking and industrial interests over Roosevelt's election. Less than three weeks before the President-elect's inaugura-tion, an unsuccessful attempt was made to assassinate him at Miami. Could the assassin's bullet possibly have been negoti-ated for, Butler speculated, by a big-business cabal that hated Roosevelt and dreaded a New Deal? <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **23** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Many veterans' posts now started a movement to have Butler appointed administrator of the U.S. Veterans Bureau in January, 1933, and sent resolutions to Roosevelt to this effect.

Butler thanked him but refused, explaining, \"I don't want to be tied up with anything I don't know about.\" Meanwhile lie watched with fascination the swift unfolding of developments in the New Deal from the time Roosevelt de-clared at his inauguration on March 4, 1933, \"Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" Next day the new President proclaimed a national bank holiday and embargoed the exportation of gold.

As the American people stirred with new hope that at last the government was beginning to fight the nightmare Depression, Butler noted with satisfaction that the bankers and industrialists of the nation were horrified. Meanwhile between July and December he had been pursued and wooed by Jerry MacGuire, the bond salesman for Grayson M.-P. Murphy and Company, who had sought to enlist him in the schemes of the financial group he represented. It was with some relief that he was temporarily freed from these persistent attentions on December 1, when MacGuire went abroad on an unexplained mission for his backers. Early in December, 1933, Butler began touring the country for the V.F.W. and made headlines by speaking out with char-acteristic bluntness to attack the leadership of the American Legion. He told a large gathering of veterans in New Orleans that the V.F.W. commander \"would not sell out his men as the officers in charge of the American Legion have.\" Sharing the platform with Senator Huey Long, he urged Long to concentrate on fighting for the veterans' bonus and forget less important matters. \"What the hell do you know about the gold standard?\" he challenged Long. \"Don't pay any attention to what the newspapers say. Stand by your friends and to hell with the rest of them!\" Taking Long's political demagoguery at face value, he be-lieved him to be sincere in his advocacy of a redistribution of national wealth and praised him as a man \"with nerve enough to maintain a fight against Wall Street.\" He urged the veterans to \"make Wall Street pay, to take Wall Street by the throat and shake it up.\" If they wanted to get the bonus that had been promised them, they would have \"to organize . . . to get to-gether . . . to do as the veterans of other wars have done.\" It was a fighting speech in the classic populist vein, and it sparked national controversy. The *Cincinnati Times Star, *a news-paper controlled by American Legion officials, angrily accused Butler of advocating a \"soldier dictatorship.\" Interviewed afterward in Atlanta about his attack on the Legion, he stuck by his guns and added fuel to the fire by stating *The Indispensable", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:116:2ff750c49772", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13858, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 117, "text": "\"to organize . . . to get to-gether . . . to do as the veterans of other wars have done.\" It was a fighting speech in the classic populist vein, and it sparked national controversy.

His sus-picions about Clark and Maguire were obviously very much on his mind when he made it. \"To many it may seem strange for a military man to denounce dictatorship,\" he declared. \"Generally it is the military men who are advocates of this stern measure. . . . But we do not need a dictator and we would not have one anyway, because our tem-perament and traditions forbid it.\" He made it clear that he was stumping the country only on behalf of the ordinary \"forgotten soldier,\" just as F.D.R. had crusaded for the \"forgotten man.\" He told reporters, \"I went on the retired list after thirty-three years of making wars, to rock and rock. So many former soldiers came to me with their pathetic stories that I bounced out of retirement. All we soldiers are asking is that the nation give us the same break that is being given the manufacturers, the bank-ers, the industrialists. . . . Jimmie [Van Zandt] and I are going around the country trying to educate the soldiers out of the sucker class.\" If American Legion officialdom was furious at Butler's charges, the rank and file were not. Typical of the barrage of fan mail cheering him on was a letter from a Los Angeles Legionnaire: \"Every word you say is true, and I, as an ex-soldier and one of the rank and file, respectfully request that you assume the active leadership of the ex-servicemen. These five million men and their families need you for a leader and will stick through thick and thin. The leadership of the American Legion voice actually the opposite of the true wishes of the membership. . . . Sir, the ex-serviceman of the United States is at your command.\" But Butler's first bombshell was mild compared to his next broadside against the establishment, made in his Atlanta speech to the V.F.W. the next day. *The New York Times *featured it under the headline GEN.

I know-I've been in eleven of these expeditions.\" The world was not yet through with war, he warned, but we can help get rid of it when we conscript capital along with men.\" He pointed out that soldiers who went through the horrors of war were not the same when they came back, adding vehemently, \"We ought to make those responsible pay through the nose.\" That was why the V.F.W. was calling for immediate payment of the soldiers' bonus, in addition to compensation asked for disabled veterans and pensions for veterans' widows and orphans. Ex-servicemen were made the butt of an Economy Act passed by Congress, Butler charged, because \"the principle of taking care of soldiers is nothing at all but an old-age pension to which the nation eventually will come, and the bankers don't want it.\" He added caustically, \"If Charles Dawes got ninety million dollars for a sick bank, soldiers ought to get it for sick comrades.\" Pointing out that veterans could muster twenty million votes among themselves and their families, he urged them to use this pressure at the polls to force decent care of the disabled. If the \"Democrats take care of you,\" he advised, \"keep them in. If not-put 'em out!\" He warned veterans not to believe \"the propaganda capital circulates\" in the press, which he condemned as largely capitalist-controlled. \"The paper that takes the part of the soldier,\" he charged, \"loses advertising.\" His concern for disabled veterans was not mere rhetoric. He met many of them in the eighteen veterans' hospitals he visited during his tour of the country. His walks through the wards to talk with them filled him with an angry grief. In his days of combat he had seen many men killed and wounded. But the crushing impact of seeing fifty thousand young men gathered together in \"living graveyards,\" forgotten by their country and the people for whom they had sacrificed arms, legs, faces, and minds, moved him to rage against the old men in power who had doomed them to lives of empty despair. *The Indispensable Man **131* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> \"Seventeen years ago they were the pick of the nation,\" he wrote grimly. \". .", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:118:1f7d485bae3e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13860, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 119, "text": "men killed and wounded.

He replied, \"I am doing everything humanly possible to help the veterans,\" and urged them to swamp Con-gress with letters and postcards. George K. Brobeck, legislative representative for the V.F.W., wrote Butler: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Every member of our National Staff is deeply appreciative of your fine cooperation in our battle for the disabled men. I can think of no greater service that America's mili-tary leaders might dedicate themselves to than the one you have carried on so unceasingly, and I wish to repeat what Admiral R. E.

In his speeches for the V.F.W. he continued to plead their cause, along with assailing war-makers and demanding payment of the veterans' bonus. In March he was urged to attend the Indiana convention of the V.F.W. at Marion, which had the largest veterans' hospital in the United States. John R.

I am unable to mention your name in a meeting without getting a round of applause.\" He was gratified to read on April 12, 1934, that the Senate had voted an inquiry into the manufacture of and traffic in arms. Senator Gerald P. Nye, of North Dakota, as chairman of the Senate Munitions Investigating Committee. began holding pub-lic hearings stressing the heavy profits made by American finan-ciers and armament-makers during World War I. The Nye Committee produced shock waves by exposing the pressures exerted by the armament industry on the government to take America into that war. Oswald Garrison Villard, editor--publisher of *The Nation, *wrote, \"I never dreamed that I should live to see the time when public opinion in the United States would be practically united in recognizing that we were lied to and deceived into going to war . . . and when Congress would actually put a stop to those processes by which Wilson, House, Lansing and J. P. Morgan and Company brought us into the war.\" The Nye investigation, continuing until 1936, strengthened isolationist sentiment in the United States and inspired a series of neutrality acts during 1935-1937. Following the hearings closely, Butler was tremendously im-pressed and influenced by their disclosures. They also confirmed his suspicions that big business-Standard Oil, United Fruit, the sugar trust, the big banks-had been behind most of the military interventions he had been ordered to lead. In a broadcast over Philadelphia radio station WCAU he described his experiences *The Indispensable Man **133* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> in \"the raping of little nations to collect money for big indus-tries\" that had large foreign investments. Authentication for this view came thirty-eight years later when Milan B. Skacel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of Latin America in the United States, acknowledged on October 16, 1971, \"Most of us freely admit that some of the past business practices of U.S. firms in Latin America were unconscionable.\" Testifying before the Nye Committee, Eugene G.

He nervously expressed concern that such a revelation might \"leave a bad taste\" in the mouths of veterans who had served their country for a dollar a day, but nevertheless labeled their bonus movement an \"unfortunate\" enterprise. \"Bethlehem Steel made ten times as much money during the war as before,\" Butler roared over WCAU, \"and this band of pirates calls the soldiers Treasury raiders!\" He urged reporter friends to get transcripts of the Nye hear-ings and read them, insisting, \"You fellows ought to know this stuff.\" One wanted to know what had prompted him, even before the Nye disclosures, to \"pull the whiskers off\" the face of com-mercialism behind the pomp and patriotic glory of war. \"As a youngster, I loved the excitement of battle,\" he replied. \"It's lots of fun, you know, and it's nice to strut around in front of your wife-or somebody else's wife-and display your medals, and your uniform. But there's another side to it, and that's why I have decided to devote the rest of my life to 'pulling off the whiskers.\"' During his V.F.W. lecture tour he met an old war comrade, G. D. Morgan, who was now adjutant of the V.F.W. post in Hazlehurst, Mississippi, and confided in him about the scheming of MacGuire, Doyle, and Clark. On May 14, 1934, Morgan wrote him, \"My Dear Smed: I wish you would send me the Statistics as near as possible that you have on those two Ex-Service men and the Banker.

While smoking out the plot as far as he could and then getting reporter Paul Comly French to investigate it for corroborative evidence in preparation to exposing it, Butler continued his cru-sade against war and on behalf of justice for the veterans. Once more he found himself running into censorship trouble. Radio station WAVE, carrying his speech on October 3 to the V.F.W. national convention, cut him off the air for \"objec-tionable language\" used before \"a mixed audience.\" The con-vention unanimously adopted a resolution condemning WAVE for \"unceremoniously curtailing the address of General Butler, an honored and beloved member of this organization.\" Louis G. Burd, Adjutant of the Butte, Montana, post, wrote him: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> ... This assertion is just some more of the same old hooey to mislead the public. In our opinion you were cut off simply because you are one man before the public who has the courage to . . . give the public the true facts that they hunger to hear, and in a language of which there is no misunderstanding. . . .

He proposed two constitutional amend-ments. The first would make it impossible for war to be declared except by the exclusive vote of those physically able to fight. The second would prevent United States warships from going beyond a two-hundred-mile limit, and airplanes from going more than five hundred miles from the American coastline.

We of the Legion are mobilized to meet that enemy and we are calling upon loyal Americans everywhere to join us in ridding our coun-try of this menace.\" To Butler that sounded suspiciously like the reams of propa-ganda the American Liberty League was now sending out, along with lecturers, to denounce the \"socialism\" of the Roosevelt Administration and call for a return to the doctrines of a laissez--faire economy. The League's campaign failed to make any impact in the con-gressional elections of 1934, however, and F.D.R. won an enor-mous Democratic majority in both houses of Congress. Meanwhile gossip was spreading around Washington that the American Legion was going to provide the nucleus of a Fascist army that would seize the Capital. John L. Spivak, a crack reporter <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *136 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> whose specialty was exposing American Fascists and of whom Lincoln Steffens once said, \"He is the best of us,\" heard about it from an eminent Washington correspondent with excel-lent sources of information and decided to investigate it. The rumors also reached the McCormack-Dickstein Com-mittee of the House of Representatives. This was the first House Un-American Activities Committee, at that time equally oriented against Fascist and Communist activities. Under Representative John W. McCormack, later Speaker of the House, it spent con-siderable time and energy unmasking Fascist agents in America. Not until 1939, when a new version of HUAC was reconstituted under the chairmanship of Martin Dies, did this committee become infamous for its relentless persecution directed almost exclusively against liberals and leftists of every persuasion, while ignoring subversion on the right. One of the McCormack-Dickstein Committee's investigators contacted Butler to ask if there was any truth in the rumors that he could shed light on. Now that he had Paul Comly French's testimony to corroborate his own, Butler decided that there was little more to be gained by playing MacGuire along; between French and himself, the plotters' secret plans had been ferreted out to a significant extent.

Come hell or high water, press ridicule or denunciations term-ing him a madman, he was now determined to testify before the committee and spread the plot for a Fascist takeover of the United States all over the front pages. He would destroy it be-fore it had a chance to crush democracy in the country he loved and had served all his life. But would he be believed, even with the support of French's testimony?

The two cochairman of the committee were Representative John McCormack, of Massachusets, and New York Representative Samuel Dickstein, who later became a New York State Supreme Court justice. Butler's testimony, developed in two hours of questions and answers, was recorded in full. Simultaneously Paul Comly French broke the story in the Stern papers, the Philadelphia *Record *and the New York Post. Under the headline \"$3,000,000 Bid for Fascist Army Bared,\" he wrote: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Major General Smedley D. Butler revealed today that he has been asked by a group of wealthy New York brokers to lead a Fascist movement to set up a dictatorship in the United States. General Butler, ranking major general of the Marine Corps up to his retirement three years ago, told his story today at a secret session of the Congressional Committee on Un--American Activities. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> McCormack opened the hearing by first noting that General Butler had been in the Marine Corps thirty-three years and four months and had received the Congressional Medal of Honor twice, establishing his integrity and credibility as a witness. Then he invited the general to \"just go ahead and tell in your own way all that you know about an attempted Fascist movement in this country.\" \"May I preface my remarks,\" Butler began, \"by saying, sir, <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *139* * * *140 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> that I have one interest in all of this, and that is to try to do my best to see that a democracy is maintained in this country?\" \"Nobody who has either read about or known", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:124:f91d7a55a751", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13866, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 125, "text": "about an attempted Fascist movement in this country.\" \"May I preface my remarks,\" Butler began, \"by saying, sir, <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *139* * * *140 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> that I have one interest in all of this, and that is to try to do my best to see that a democracy is maintained in this country?\" \"Nobody who has either read about or known about General Butler,\" replied McCormack promptly, \"would have anything but that understanding.\" Butler then gave detailed testimony about everything that had happened in connection with the plot, from the first visit of MacGuire and Doyle on July 1, 1933. Some of his testimony was not released in the official record of the bearings, for reasons that will be discussed later, but was nevertheless ferreted out, copied, and made public by reporter John L. Spivak. This censored testimony is indicated by the sym-bol to distinguish it from the official testimony eventually released by the McCormack-Dickstein Committee. The same was true of testimony given by reporter Paul Comly French, who followed Butler as a witness, and the same symbol () indicates the censored portions.* Butler first described the attempts made by MacGuire and Doyle to persuade him to go to the American Legion convention h-and make a speech they had prepared for him. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> BUTLER: . . . they were very desirous of unseating the royal family in control of the American Legion, at the convention to be held in Chicago, and very anxious to have me take part in it. They said that they were not in sympathy with the . . . present administration's treatment of the soldiers. . . . They said, \"We represent the plain soldiers. . .We want you to come there and stampede the convention in a speech and help us in our fight to dislodge the royal family.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> He told of MacGuire's revelation that he was the chairman <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *The reader who wishes to examine the official testimony is referred to the government report, *Investigation of Nazi Propaganda Activities and Investigation of Certain Other Propaganda Activities: Public Hearings Before the Special Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representa-tives, Seventy-third Congress, Second Session, at Washington, D.C., Decem-ber *29, *zg34.

I said nothing.... CHAIRMAN: When you say you smelled a rat, you mean you had an idea that they were not telling the truth? BUTLER: I could not reconcile . . . their desire to serve the ordinary man in the ranks, with their other aims. They did not seem to be the same. It looked to me as if they were trying to embarrass the administration in some way.... I was just fishing to see what they had in mind. So many queer people come to my house all the time and I like to feel them all out. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> MacGuire had told him, Butler revealed, that invitation or no invitation, he and his supporters had figured out a way for Butler to address the Legion convention. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> BUTLER: I said, \"How is that, without being invited?\" They said, \"Well, you are to come as a delegate from Hawaii.\" I said, \"I do not live in Hawaii.\" \"Well, it does not make any difference.

I was to get two or three hundred legion-naires from around that part of the country and bring them on a special train to Chicago with me. . . . they would sit around in the audience, be planted here and there. . . . I was to appear in the gallery. These planted fellows were to begin to cheer and start a stampede and yell for a speech. Then I was to go to the platform and make a speech. I said, \"Make a speech about what?\" \"Oh,\" they said, \"we have one here.\" . . . They pulled out this speech. They said, \"We will leave it here with you to read over, and you see if you can get these fellows to come.\" I said, \"Listen. These friends of mine that I know around here, even if they wanted to go, could not afford to go. It would cost them a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars to go out there and stay for five days and come back.\" They said, \"Well, we will pay that.\" I said, \"How can you pay it? You are disabled soldiers. How do you get the money to do that?\" \"Oh, we have friends.

Pointing out to MacGuire that the speech given him urged a return by the United States to the gold standard, Butler had demanded to know what that had to do with the ostensible reasons for which he was being asked to go to Chicago. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> BUTLER: . . . MacGuire had said, \"We want to see the sol-diers' bonus paid in gold. We do not want the soldier to have rubber money or paper money. We want the gold. That is the reason for this speech.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler had then sought to get MacGuire to reveal the source of the funds on deposit in his name. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> BUTLER: He said that it was given to him by nine men, that the biggest contributor had given $9,000 and that the donations ran all the way from $2,50o to $9,000 I said, \"What is the object?\" He said the object was to take care of the rank and file of the soldiers, to get them their bonus and get them properly cared for. * * 144 The Plot to Seize the White House <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Well, I knew that people who had $9,000 to give away were not in favor of the bonus.

An aunt and an uncle died and left him $10,000,000. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Having established contact with one of the plot's principals, Butler testified, he had been visited by Clark within the week with and invited to travel in a private car to the Chicago convention with the millionaire, who revealed that he would arrange an opportunity for Butler to deliver the gold-standard speech. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> BUTLER: He said, \"You have got the speech?\" I said, \"Yes.

Butler had pointed out that a speech urging a return to the gold standard did not seem to be relevant to the reasons he was being asked to go to the con-vention.

There was some talk about a flood of tele-grams that came in and influenced them and I was so much amused, because it all happened right in my room.

It had been written by Val O'Farrell, a former New York City detective who had become one of the city's leading criminal and civil investigators. On December 11, 1933, O'Farrell had written to presidential secretary Louis Howe: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> My dear Colonel: . . . Before he [Butler] left for Atlanta, he was ap-proached by a representative of the bankers gold group system, and offered the sum of seven hundred and fifty dol-lars <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *152 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> for each speech if he would insert some short reference in favor of continuing the bankers gold standard. This would have meant an additional ten thousand dollars to General Butler, but he told the representative of the gold group that even if he were offered a hundred thousand dollars to do this, his answer would be \"no.\" Notwithstanding the fact that I do not know General Butler, who has been occasionally subject to harsh criticism for the things he has done or failed to do, I felt it my duty to report this incident to you as it shows him to be a man of exceptional character.

However, if Clark wanted to get rid of his money, it was none of my business. . . . Now, he [MacGuire] is a very cagey individual. He always approaches everything from afar. He is really a very nice, plausible fellow. But I gather, after this association with him, that due to this wound in his head, he is a little inconsistent, a little flighty. He is being used, too, but I do *The Conspiracy Explodes **153* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> not think Clark is using him. My impression is that Murphy uses him; and he uses Clark, because Clark has the money. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> During MacGuire's trip to Europe, Butler testified, the bond salesman had sent him a postcard from Nice in February, 1934, and a short note later from Berlin, both of the \"having wonderful time\" variety. Then after MacGuire's return, upon his urging to see Butler on a matter of the utmost importance, they had met in the empty restaurant of Philadelphia's Bellevue Hotel, on August 22, 1934. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> BUTLER: He told me all about his trip to Europe.... He said, \"I went abroad to study the part that the veteran plays in the various set-ups of the governments that they have abroad.

But that set-up would not suit us at all. The soldiers of America would not like that. I then went to Germany to see what Hitler was doing, and his whole strength lies in organizations of soldiers, too. But that would not do. I looked into the Russian business. I found that the use of the soldiers over there would never appeal to our men. Then I went to France, and I found just exactly the organization we are going to have. It is an organization of supersoldiers.\" He gave me the French name for it, but I do not recall what it is. I never could have pronounced it, anyhow. But I do know that it is a superorganization of members of all the other soldiers' organizations of France, composed of noncommissioned officers and officers. He told me that they had about 500,000 and that each one was a leader of ten others, so that it gave them 5,000,000 votes. And he said, \"Now, that is our idea here in America-to get up an organization of that kind.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Investigators for the McCormack-Dickstein Committee were able to uncover a report on this French \"superorganization,\" the Croix de Feu, that MacGuire had written about to Robert S. *154 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Clark and Clark's attorney, Albert Grant Christmas, from France on March 6, 1934: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> I had a very interesting talk last evening with a man who is quite well up on affairs here and he seems to be of the opinion that the Croix de Feu will be very patriotic during this crisis and will take the [wage] cuts or be the moving spirit in the veterans to accept the cuts. Therefore they will, in all probability, be in opposition to the Socialists and functionaries. The general spirit among the functionaries seems to be that the correct way to regain recovery is to spend more money and increase wages, rather than to put more people out of work and cut salaries. The Croix de Feu is getting a great number of new recruits, and I recently attended a meeting of this organization and was quite impressed with the type of men belonging.

He mentioned that the position would be a secretary of general affairs-a sort of a supersecretary. CHAIRMAN: A secretary of general affairs? BUTLER: That is the term used by him-or a secretary of general welfare-I cannot recall which. I came out of the interview with that name in my head. I got that idea from talking to both of them, you see [MacGuire and Clark]. They had both talked about the same kind of relief that ought to be given the President, and he [MacGuire] said: \"You know, the American people will swallow that. We have got the newspapers. We will start a campaign that the President's health is failing. Everybody can tell that by looking -at him, and the dumb American people will fall for it in a second.\" And I could see it. They had that sympathy racket, that <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *156 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> they were going to have somebody take the patronage off of his shoulders and take all the worries and details off of his shoulders, and then he will be like the President of France. . . . Now, I cannot recall which one of these fellows told me about the rule of succession, about the Secretary of State becoming President when the Vice President is eliminated. There was something said in one of the conversations that I had, that the President's health was bad, and he might resign, and that [Vice President] Garner did not want it, anyhow, and then this supersecretary would take the place of the Secretary of State and in the order of succession would become President. That was the idea. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> In corroborative testimony Paul Comly French described what MacGuire had told him about the conspirators' plans. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> FRENCH: During the course of the conversation he con-tinually discussed the need of a man on a white horse, as he called it, a dictator who would come galloping in on his white horse.

He warmed up considerably after we got under way and he said, \"We might go along with Roosevelt and then do with him what Mussolini did with the King of Italy.\" It fits in with what he told the general, that we would have a Secretary of General Affairs, and if Roosevelt played ball, swell; and if he did not, they would push him out. He expressed the belief that at least half of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars would follow the general if he would announce such a plan. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> In censored testimony Butler revealed that MacGuire had im-plicated General Hugh Johnson, head of the N.R.A., as Roose-velt's own choice to become an assistant President. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> BUTLER: He said, \"That is what he [Roosevelt] was build-ing up Hugh Johnson for. Hugh Johnson talked too damn <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *The Conspiracy Explodes **157* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> much and got him into a hole, and he is going to fire him in the next three or four weeks.\" I said, \"How do you know all this?\" \"Oh,\" he said, \"we are in with him all the time.

It is interesting to note that. He [MacGuire] said, \"There is going to be a big quarrel over the reappointment of MacArthur . . . you watch the President reappoint him. He is going to go right and if he does not reappoint him, he is going to go left.\" I have been watching with a great deal of interest this quarrel over his reappointment to see how it comes out. He [MacGuire] said, \"You know as well as I do that Mac-Arthur is Stotesbury's son in law in Philadelphia-[Stotes-bury being] Morgan's representative in Philadelphia.

They had a lot of talk this time about maintaining the Constitution. I said, \"I do not see that the Constitution is in any danger.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler's next observation, possibly the most significant in all his testimony, was missing from the published version of his testimony. It was the link between the conspiracy and the power-ful interests Butler had good reason to believe were the \"big fellows\" in the background. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> BUTLER: . . . and in about two weeks the American Liberty League appeared, which was just about what he described it to be. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The American Liberty League, which had brokerage head Grayson M.-P.

Its contributors included representatives of the Morgan, Du Pont, Rockefeller, Pew, and Mellon interests. Directors of the League included A1 Smith and John J. Raskob. League later formed affiliations with pro-Fascist, antilabor, and anti-Semitic organizations. It astonished Butler that former New York Governor A1 Smith, who had lost the 1928 presidential race to Hoover as the Democratic candidate, could be involved in a Fascist plot backed by wealthy men. But the \"happy warrior\" who had grown up on New York's East Side had traded his brown derby for a black one.

He has definitely broken with the President.\" I was interested to note that about a month later he did, and the New Outlook took the shot that he told me a month before they were going to take. Let me say that this fellow [MacGuire] has been able to tell me a month or six weeks ahead of time everything that happened. That made him interesting. I wanted to see if he was going to come out right. . . . <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> In testimony that was also censored, Paul Comly French re-vealed that MacGuire had implicated the Du Ponts to him, indicating the role they would play in equipping the superarmy being planned by the plotters. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> FRENCH: We discussed the question of arms and equip-ment, and he suggested that they could be obtained from the Remington Arms Co., on credit through the Du Ponts. I do not think at that time he mentioned the connections of Du Pouts with the American Liberty League . . . but he skirted all around the idea that that was the back door; one of the Du Pouts is on the board of directors of the American Liberty League and they own a controlling interest in the Remington Arms Co....

I have got a wife and children.\" in other words, he had had a nice trip to Europe with his family, for nine months, and he said that that cost plenty, too. . . . So he left me, saying, \"I am going down to Miami and I will get in touch with you after the convention is over, and we are going to make a fight down there for the gold standard, and we are going to organize.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> After he had been urged over forty times to accept the leadership of the Fascist coup d'etat being planned, while he gathered as much information about it as he could, Butler had then sought to gather corroborative evidence through reporter Paul Comly French. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> BUTLER: ... in talking to Paul French here-I had not said anything about this other thing, it did not make any differ-ence about fiddling with the gold standard resolution, but this [the Fascist plot] looked to me as though it might be getting near that they were going to stir some of these sol-diers up to hurt our Government. I did not know anything about this committee [the American Liberty League], so I told Paul to let his newspaper see what they could find out about the background of these fellows. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Although Butler recalled having induced French to check into the case, former Philadelphia *Record *city editor Tom O'Neil gave the author his recollection that Butler had approached him and told him the whole story. O'Neil recalled that he had agreed to assign French to investigate. Probably Butler first approached French, who had referred him to the city editor.

I have seen absolutely no sign of anything showing a trend for a change of our form of Government. So it has never appealed to me at all. But as long as there was a lot of money stirring around-and I had noticed some of them with money to whom I have talked were dissatisfied and talking about having dictators-I thought that perhaps they might be tempted to put up money. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler testified that his last encounter with MacGuire had been reference to French's attempt to talk to him. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> CHAIRMAN: Did you have any further talks with him? BUTLER: No. The only other time I saw or heard from him was when I wanted Paul to uncover him. He talked to me and he telephoned Paul, saying he wanted to see him. He called me up and asked if Paul was a reputable person, and I said he was. That is the last thing I heard from him. CHAIRMAN: The last talk you had with MacGuire was in the Bellevue in August of this year? BUTLER: August 22; yes. The date can be identified. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> He concluded his testimony by urging the committee to ques-tion several persons about the plot in addition to MacGuire--notably Murphy, Doyle, and Legion Commander Frank N. Bel-grano. This request was also stricken from the official record. Butler was aware that Chairman McCormack was himself a Legionnaire and that the revelations of the plot implicating Legion officials might be painful to him. But Butler also knew that McCormack was a determined foe of Nazi propaganda and a staunch supporter of New Deal measures. Butler counted on his indignation over the conspiracy to bring about a full-scale investigation by the Department of justice. *164 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **5** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> After Butler had completed his testimony, Paul Comly French took the witness chair to report on his own investigation of the plot, in which a candid two-hour conversation with MacGuire at the latter's office figured prominently.

In addition French reported the more open statements MacGuire had made to him about the nature of the conspiracy and how it would work. More frank with French, apparently, than he had dared to be with the general, MacGuire made little attempt to disguise the Fascist nature of the proposed putsch with euphemistic phrases about \"supporting the President.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> FRENCH: We need a Fascist government in this country, he insisted, to save the Nation from the Communists who want to tear it down and wreck all that we have built in America. The only men who have the patriotism to do it are the soldiers and Smedley Butler is the ideal leader. He could organize a million men overnight. During the conversation he told me he had been in Italy and Germany during the summer of 1934 and the spring of 1934 and had made an intensive study of the background of the Nazi and Fascist movements and how the veterans had played a part in them. He said he had obtained enough information on the Fascist and Nazi movements and of the part played by the veterans, to properly set up one in this country. He emphasized throughout his conversation with me that the whole thing was tremendously patriotic, that it was saving the Nation from Communists, and that the men they deal with have that crackbrained idea that the Communists *The Conspiracy Explodes **165* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> are going to take it apart. He said the only safeguard would be the soldiers. At first he suggested that the General or-ganize this outfit himself and ask a dollar a year dues from everybody. We discussed that, and then he came around to the point of getting outside financial funds, and he said that it would not be any trouble to raise a million dollars. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> French's use of the phrase \"crackbrained idea\" to describe the notion by financiers and captains of industry that the country needed to be saved from communism was obviously his own, and not MacGuire's, expression.

MacGuire, who earned only $150 a week as a bond salesman, contradicted himself on the amount of money he had received from sponsors and what he had done with it. He denied Butler's allegation that he had thrown eighteen thousand-dollar bills on the bed at the Newark hotel during the 29th Division convention to bribe Butler into going to the Legion convention in Chicago. But he could not explain what he had done with at least thirty thousand in letters of credit, funds advanced to him by either Clark or Clark's attorney, Albert Grant Christmas, and which MacGuire had had with him at the Legion convention in Chicago the following October, at which he had been both a delegate and a member of the \"distinguished guest committee.\" The McCormack-Dickstein Committee found five significant facts that lent validity to Butler's testimony.

Clark, who wanted the Legion to pass a gold-standard resolution, had given MacGuire those funds. In the long-distance call Clark had allegedly made to Chicago while Butler was listening, he had instructed MacGuire, \"You can put this thing across alone. You've got $45,000. You can send those telegrams.\" MacGuire could not explain how he had spent those funds. But telegrams had, indeed, *The Conspiracy Explodes 169* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> flooded the convention, and the Legion had passed the resolution. Corroboration of Butler's testimony about MacGuire's mission in Europe was borne out by the committee's finding that he had spent large sums of money on that trip to study Fascist move-ments in Italy, Germany, and France. The committee found, too, that he and Clark had handled large sums of money for various organizations, that he had been active in organizations men-tioned by Butler, and that he had acted as cashier for one organization. His accounts of some of these financial transactions failed to satisfy the committee, and he was curtly instructed to reappear the following day for further questioning. Interviewed by reporters afterward, MacGuire declared that he was a personal friend of General Butler's and had last seen him six months earlier when he had gone to Philadelphia to sell some bonds. They had talked about an adequate military force for the nation, MacGuire insisted, and about world affairs in general, but he denied ever discussing a Fascist army or move-ment. A little desperately MacGuire suggested that \"General Butler must be seeking publicity,\" and called the general's testimony \"a pacifist stunt:\" His attorney, Norman L. Marks, called it \"a joke and a publicity stunt for General Butler.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **7** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Smedley Butler's reputation as an honest patriot made what he had testified to under oath impossible for the press to ignore.

Instead of beginning with a full account of his charges, there was only a brief paragraph restating the facts in the headline. This was followed by a whole string of denials, or ridicule of the charges, by prominent people implicated. Extensive space was given to their attempts to brand Butler a liar or lunatic. Only at the tail of the story, buried inside the paper, did the *Times *wind up its account with a few brief paragraphs men-tioning some of his allegations. Many papers that picked up the story dropped the tail carry-ing even those cursory details of the plot. Newspaper publishers had little reason to be fond of the firebrand general who, in his speech to veterans in Atlanta almost a year earlier, had warned them not to believe the capitalist-controlled press, which, Butler charged, suppressed facts unfavorable to America's powerful corporations. *The New York Times *did note, however, that Butler had told friends in Philadelphia that General Hugh S. Johnson, former N.R.A. administrator, had been among those slated for the role of dictator if Butler turned it down and that J. P. Morgan and Company and Grayson M.-P. Murphy and Company were both involved in the plot. \"It's a joke-a publicity stunt,\" Jerry MacGuire was quoted as insisting. \"I know nothing about it. The matter is made up out of whole cloth. I deny the story completely.\" General Johnson growled, \"He had better be pretty damn care-ful. Nobody said a word to me about anything of this kind, and if they did I'd throw them out the window. I know nothing about it.\" Thomas W. Lamont, partner in J. P. Morgan and Company, gave his comment: \"Perfect moonshine! Too unutterably ridicu-lous to comment upon!\" J. P. Morgan himself, just back from Europe, had nothing to say. \"A fantasy!\" scoffed Colonel Grayson M.-P. Murphy. \"I can't imagine how anyone could produce it or any sane person believe it.

He insisted that in 1932 he had voted for President Roosevelt, the target of the alleged plot. Asked about these denials, Butler snorted to a *New York Times *reporter, \"Hell, you're not surprised they deny it, are you? What they have to say they'll say before the committee.\" He wanted them under oath, as lie had been. In Washington General Douglas MacArthur, Chief of Staff, was unavailable for comment because of a real or a diplomatic \"heavy cold.\" His aides, however, expressed amazement and amusement that MacArthur had been named by Butler as an alternate choice of the plotters for dictator if Butler persisted in refusing the offer. \"All the principals in the case,\" George Seldes noted in his book *Facts and Fascism, *\"were American Legion officials and financial backers.\" Secretary of War George H. Dern, Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson, and a large number of senators and con-gressmen urged the McCormack-Dickstein Committee to get to the bottom of the conspiracy. \"We are going to make a searching investigation of the evidence submitted by General Butler,\" McCormack announced. \"Our original information came from several different sources. General Butler was not the first source of our information. . . . We have been in possession of certain information for about five weeks and have been investigating it. We will call all the men mentioned in the story, although Mr. Clark is reported to be in Europe.\" \"From present indications,\" declared Dickstein, \"Butler has the evidence. He's not going to make any serious charges unless he has something to back them up.

Both McCormack and Dickstein emphasized that the general had repulsed all proposals from the Fascist group.

Yours for justice. . . . <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Jerry MacGuire returned as a witness for a second day of secret grilling by the McCormack-Dickstein Committee. Again he denied Butler's charges that he had approached the general on behalf of a plot to establish a Fascist dictatorship. He testified that lie had received thirty thousand dollars from Robert Sterling Clark to be deposited in the Hanover Trust Company to the credit of \"The Committee for a Sound Dollar and Sound Currency, Inc.\" He and his backers had only wanted *174 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> to interest Butler in *that *committee, MacGuire insisted, because as an important and popular public figure the general could command attention for their movement. They wanted to give him the opportunity to \"make a little money\" in the process. Although Clark, his attorney A. G. Christmas, Walter E. Frew, and others were behind the Committee for a Sound Dollar and Sound Currency, their names had been carefully omitted from its records. MacGuire testified that as far as he knew, Clark had never had any interest in a Fascist organization. But the McCormack-Dickstein Committee located letters from MacGuire written from Europe to Clark and Christmas that proved otherwise. To many questions thrown at him MacGuire answered evasively, \"It is too far back,\" or \"I cannot recall.\" At the con-clusion of his testimony Dickstein told reporters that MacGuire was \"hanging himself\" by contradictions in his story and by forced admissions made during his testimony. When this opinion was quoted in a few evening newspapers, Dickstein observed that he had meant it to be \"off the -record.\" Norman L. Marks, the attorney who had accompanied Mac Guire at the secret hearings, told reporters that MacGuire had denied ever having had any connection with any Fascist organization of any sort; that he had ever been the \"cashier\" for any Fascist group; or that he had gone to Europe to study the Fascist", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:156:41267778b357", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13898, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 157, "text": "made during his testimony. When this opinion was quoted in a few evening newspapers, Dickstein observed that he had meant it to be \"off the -record.\" Norman L. Marks, the attorney who had accompanied Mac Guire at the secret hearings, told reporters that MacGuire had denied ever having had any connection with any Fascist organization of any sort; that he had ever been the \"cashier\" for any Fascist group; or that he had gone to Europe to study the Fascist movement. MacGuire's European trip, Marks alleged, had been solely for purposes of private business. McCormack declared that all information about the testimony would be withheld because it had been given in closed executive session. But the fact that the committee regarded the testimony as important, he added, was shown by the decision to recall MacGuire for further questioning. Despite Dickstein's earlier statement that sixteen people named by Butler would be subpoenaed, McCormack said that the committee had not yet decided whether to call additional witnesses. Noting that the most important witness, apart from MacGuire, was Robert S. Clark, \"a wealthy New Yorker with offices in the Stock Exchange Building,\" who was abroad, McCormack indicated that if the facts warranted, a public hearing would be held. Leaders of important *The Conspiracy Explodes 175* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> organizations like the American Legion and the V.F.W. would then be invited to appear before the committee. The Associated Press reported from Indianapolis that banker Frank N. Belgrano, Jr., national commander of the Legion, had denied that the Legion was involved \"in the slightest degree\" in any plot to supply an army for a \"march on Washington.\" Highly placed Legion officials in Washington also characterized as \"horsefeathers\" a rumor that a group of \"big-business men\" had promised the Legion payment of adjusted service certificates, in return for a pledge to support the Fascist movement. Louis Johnson, former Legion national commander, declared in Fairmont, West Virginia, that he could not recall having written the letter to Jerry MacGuire, promising to see him about Fascist army plan, that MacGuire had shown briefly to Paul Comly French. If he had written such a letter, Johnson insisted, it would show that he and the Legion were unalterably opposed to any dictatorship. On November 22 the Associated Press struck a low blow at Butler by getting Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, of New York, to express an opinion of the conspiracy based on what he had read about it in the press. The AP ran this \"news item\" under the headline \"COCKTAIL PUTSCH,\" MAYOR SAYS: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Mayor LaGuardia of New York laughingly described to-day the charges of General Smedley D.* *Butler that New York brokers suggested he lead an army of 500,000 ex-service men on Washington as \"a cocktail putsch.\" The Mayor indicated he believed that some one at a party had suggested the idea to the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:157:4f3fcdf12453", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13899, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 158, "text": "the conspiracy based on what he had read about it in the press.

He had expected to be pilloried for his audacity in pinning a traitors' label on powerful American interests. He hoped, however, that the press would eventually be compelled to print the whole story of the plot as it had unfolded to him, when he testified at a public hearing along with French's corroboration. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *176 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The committee would surely have to subpoena all the people who were implicated, in one way or another, to testify at that open meeting under oath. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **9** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Fresh support for Butler's expose came from Van Zandt, who revealed to the press that he, too, had been approached by \"agents of Wall Street\" to lead a Fascist dictatorship in the United States under the guise of a \"Veterans Organization.\" He revealed that Butler had informed him about the plotters' solicitation of the general two months earlier and had warned him that he, too, would be contacted by them at the V.F.W. convention in Louisville, Kentucky. Van Zandt said he had asked Butler the purpose of the organization and the general had re-plied that it sought to return the American dollar to the gold standard and, in MacGuire's words, \"to get rid of this fellow in the White House.\" In addition to Butler and himself, Van Zandt told reporters, MacArthur, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., and former Legion Commander Hanford MacNider had recently been sounded out on their interest in leading the proposed Fascist veterans organi-zation. He also charged that MacGuire had spent months in Europe studying Fascist organizations as models for an American one. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., decried as \"ridiculous\" the idea that he could be used to wrest the powers of the Presidency away from his fourth cousin, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

But McCormack indicated that he intended to keep the scope of the investigation circumscribed by legal considerations. \"We don't intend to drag in names that come to us through rumors,\" he told reporters. \"If investigation discloses there is sufficient reason to subpoena witnesses, we will do so. Simply because someone mentions the name of Mr. Lamont or General Johnson is not sufficient to ask them to appear before the committee.\" Meanwhile the focus of the committee's interest was shifted when it turned its attention to investigating charges that some left-wing unions had used a three-million-dollar fund to \"foment and carry on strikes.\" *The New York Times *ran headlines read-ing \"Reds Fund Activity in Fur Industry\" and \"Red Union Funds Traced at Hearing.\" Buried in third-rank subheads, and in the body of the story, was further information about the Fascist plot. A news dispatch from Paris reported that Robert Sterling Clark was sending a lawyer to New York to answer charges made by Butler and \"clear the matter up.\" Clark declared himself be-wildered by the mention of his name and said he would send the lawyer \"if the whole affair isn't relegated to the funny papers by Sunday.\" \"MacGuire went to Europe for me, but his visit had nothing to do with politics,\" he insisted. \"He visited France, Italy and Germany and was in Paris in February of this year. He spent four months on the Continent. His trip was made for the pur-poses of investigating the financial situation, the possibilities of monetary stabilization and commercial trends.\" When reporters showed him Van Zandt's accusation that Mac-Guire had returned to the United States with copious data for setting up an American Fascist regime, he exclaimed, \"My God, what is back of all this? I saw all of MacGuire's reports. I cannot imagine him doing anything else on the side.\" Although he was on vacation in Paris, Clark declared, he was ready to return to testify if the committee summoned him. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *178 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **10** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> MacGuire showed up a third time for interrogation by the committee, this time with the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:159:b6431fbd5cd7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13901, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 160, "text": "imagine him doing anything else on the side.\" Although he was on vacation in Paris, Clark declared, he was ready to return to testify if the committee summoned him. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *178 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **10** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> MacGuire showed up a third time for interrogation by the committee, this time with the bankbooks, canceled checks, and other financial records he was ordered to produce.

I am returning at once to testify as to our anti-inflation activities. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> MacGuire now testified that on September 24, 1933, on the date Butler had said he was approached by MacGuire in the Newark hotel and offered eighteen thousand-dollar bills, Mac-Guire had been in Chicago. He claimed to have registered at the Palmer House on September 21, remaining in Chicago until October 8, so that he could not have met Butler in Newark on the twenty-fourth. But committee investigators found that he had indeed called upon Butler that day and had had available at least sixteen thousand dollars, largely in thousand-dollar bills. Unless Mac-Guire had shown them to him, Butler could not possibly have known about them, lending strong verification to the general's charge that they had been tossed on his bed as a bribe. MacGuire produced the bank accounts of the Committee for a Sound Dollar and Sound Currency, Inc., of which he was an official, and whose purpose he described as \"opposing monetary inflation in the United States.\" He and his lawyer now insisted *The Conspiracy Explodes 179* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> that the only discussions MacGuire had had with Butler con-cerned financial backing for a contracting concern. MacGuire reluctantly admitted receiving $75,000 from Clark for an \"unexplained purpose,\" the McCormack-Dickstein Com-mittee report later noted, while working on a drawing account of $432 a month. This $75,000 was in addition to $30,00o he had also received from Walter E. Frew, of the Corn Exchange Bank, for the Committee for a Sound Dollar and Sound Currency, Inc. \"Whether there was more, and how much more,\" said the report, the [McCormack-Dickstein] Committee does not yet know.\" MacGuire admitted spending almost $8,000 on the trip to Europe, ostensibly to buy bonds, but the investigators noted the trip had resulted in detailed reports to MacGuire's backers on various Fascist organizations abroad.

Although he still denied having tossed the eighteen thousand--dollar bills on Butler's bed in the Newark hotel, the committee found bank records showing he had bought letters of credit six days later from Central Hanover Bank, paying for them with thirteen thousand-dollar bills. The testimony of MacGuire under oath flatly contradicted everything Butler had testified to. The McCormack-Dickstein Committee was left with no other option than to conclude either that Butler was lying, in which case the whole plot was a fabrication or fantasy, or that MacGuire was lying, in which case Butler's charges were true, and the dangerous conspiracy of which he warned was a reality. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> MCCORMACK: Did you leave a speech with him-a speech that he was to make to the convention if he went out there?

MACGUIRE: No, sir; *I *did not. It was a matter of public information in the press and was reported so in the letter.... <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The committee examined tellers from the Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company and other banks on financial trans-actions that had taken place between MacGuire and Clark, on the account of Albert Christmas, Clark's attorney. Evidence was found that the day before MacGuire had al-legedly seen Butler in Newark, he had drawn six thousand dollars m thousand-dollar bills from a \"special account\" in the Manufacturers Trust Company and had also been given ten thousand dollars in thousand-dollar bills by Christmas in Clark's presence. The committee was convinced that MacGuire had been the \"cashier\" for the planned veterans organization. The committee also found evidence that disproved MacGuire's alibi that he had been in Chicago on September 24, as well as his contention that he had not seen Butler on that day at the Newark hotel. And it was established beyond dispute that he had written detailed letters to Clark and Christmas reporting on the Black Shirts of Italy, the Brown Shirts of Germany, and the Croix de Feu of France. McCormack announced grimly that he would subpoena Clark as soon as he returned from Europe. \"As the evidence stands,\" he declared, \"it calls for an explanation that the committee has been unable to obtain from Mr. MacGuire.\" On November 26, 1934, referring to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:163:07e1434ec6a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13905, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 164, "text": "Newark hotel.

Investigating, reporter John Spivak learned that the only one known to have been called to testify was California banker Frank N. Belgrano, commander of the American Legion. Check-ing into why he had not testified, Spivak found that he had been informed he could return home without having to answer a single question. The reporter could not verify a rumor that Belgrano had met with President Roosevelt at the White House, after which he had been taken off the committee's hook. When Spivak tried to learn more about this from the com-mittee itself, Dickstein revealed that he didn't know why Bel-grano had been sent home without being questioned, and McCormack declined to answer any questions on the subject. Apparently in response to Spivak and other newsmen pressing for an explanation of what the committee was doing about Butler's charges, McCormack announced on November 2,5 that the committee would make a statement the next day detailing the testimony it had received. He declared that it would reveal \" several important inconsistencies\" between the testimony of MacGuire and statements attributed to him in the press. McCor-mack also went out of his way to emphasize vigorously that General Butler could not be accused of \"publicity seeking\" in making public his exposure of the plot. Next day, November 26, the committee's preliminary findings were released in an eight-thousand-word statement signed by *184 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> McCormack and Dickstein. It began: \"This committee has had no evidence before it that would in the slightest degree warrant calling before it such men as John W. Davis, General Hugh Johnson, General James G.

This committee is not concerned with premature newspaper accounts, when given and published prior to the taking of testimony. . . .\" In 1971 McCormack told the author that he had always tried to operate by the rules of courtroom law, eliminating hearsay evidence lie considered legally inadmissible. Dickstein had given the same explanation of the committee's modus operandi in 1934, whereupon Spivak had pointed out, \"But your published reports are full of hearsay testimony.\" Dickstein had merely blinked and said, \"They are?\" The committee statement withheld passing judgment on the testimony it had heard as premature, but the two chairmen indicated that they intended to pursue their inquiry further by calling Clark and Christmas to testify on their return from Europe, to question them about the thousand-dollar bills. *The New York Times *reported: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> COMMITTEE CALM OVER BUTLER 'PLOT' <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Has No Evidence to Warrant -Calling Johnson and Others Named, It Declares <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The so-called plot of Wall Street interests to have Major Gen.

Van Zandt wrote Butler on December 26,* *\"The next time I see you I will explain to you just how I became involved in the Nazi story.

What he had to say was im-pressive enough to make small headlines in the back pages of newspapers sufficiently often to generate enthusiastic support from the nation's veterans. On January 7 the Miami, Oklahoma, post of V.F.W. passed a resolution: \"Major General Smedley D. Butler should be com-mended for his high type of patriotism in exposing the alleged plot to establish a dictatorship in the United States, and . . . Franklin D.

There is no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient. This committee received evidence from Maj. Gen Smed-ley D. Butler (retired), twice decorated by the Congress of the United States. He testified before the committee as to conversations with one Gerald C. MacGuire in which the latter is alleged to have suggested the formation of a fascist army under the leadership of General Butler (p. 9-114 D.C. 6 II). <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *The Conspiracy Explodes 193* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> MacGuire denied these allegations under oath, but *your* *committee was able to verify all the pertinent statements* *made by General Butler,* *with the exception of the direct statement suggesting the creation of the organization. This, however, was corroborated in the correspondence of Mac-Guire with his principal, Robert Sterling Clark, of New York City, while MacGuire was abroad studying the various forms of veterans organizations of Fascist character (p. 111 D.C. 611). <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> There was also corroboration of this point in French's testi-mony.

Spivak had been tipped off earlier by a fellow Washing-ton correspondent that some of Butler's testimony had been de-leted in the committee's November 26, 1934 report to the House of Representatives, and not for national security reasons. Spivak determined to get a look at the complete uncensored record of the testimony given at the executive session. He had asked for permission to see it, in order to follow up leads on Nazi activities in the United States, but he had been turned down on grounds that no one outside the committee and its employees could sec transcripts of testimony taken in execu-tive session. Other newsmen, however, joined him in pressing for a copy of the Butler testimony. It was then that the defunct McCormack--Dickstein Committee, possibly to quiet persistent rumors about why it was being hushed up, decided to publish a 125-page document containing the testimony of Butler, McGuire, and others, on February 15, 1935. It was marked \"Extracts,\" and the last page explained why: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> In making public the foregoing evidence, which was taken in executive session in New York City from November 20 to 24, inclusive, the committee has ordered stricken there--from certain immaterial and incompetent evidence, or evi-dence which was not pertinent to the inquiry, and which would not have been received during a public hearing. *The Conspiracy Explodes 195* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Spivak's newshawk instincts did not let him fully accept this explanation, because he knew that the committee *had *published hearsay evidence.

Why had the committee at first announced it would subpoena all those named by Butler, only to declare later that it had no evidence on which to question them? Was the clue to this abrupt change of mind to be found in the censored testimony? A veteran Washington correspondent told Spivak that he had heard the deletions had been made at the request of a member of the President's Cabinet. The implication was that release of certain names could embarrass the Democratic party, because two had been unsuccessful Democratic candidates for the Presidency -John W. Davis, the Morgan lawyer, and A1 Smith, governor of New York before Roosevelt. Davis had been named in the committee's press release, but not A1 Smith, the erstwhile \"happy warrior\" from the slums of New York who had become codirector with Irenee du Pont in the American Liberty League, and a bitter critic of Roosevelt's liber-alism and New Deal reform. Spivak tried everything to check out the story but found himself up against a brick wall at every turn. He had been tipped off earlier that the House of Representa-tives intended to let the McCormack-Dickstein Committee expire on January 3, 1935, rather than renew it as the committee had asked in order to continue its investigations. And die the com-mittee did. About a week later, seeking to do a story on its accomplish-ments in exposing Nazi and anti-Semitic activities in the United States, Spivak won permission from Dickstein to examine the committee's official exhibits and make photostatic copies of those that had been made public. Dickstein wrote a letter to this effect to the committee's secretary, Frank P. Randolph, and added, \"If necessary consult John [McCormack] about it.\" Randolph, flooded with work involved in closing the com-mittee's files and records, gave Spivak stacks of documents, exhibits, and transcripts of testimony that were being sent to <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *196 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> the Government Printing Office. To Spivak's amazement, he found among these records a full transcript of the executive session hearings in the Butler affair. Excited by this accidental stroke of luck, he compared it with the official extract of the hearings and found a number of startling omissions made from the testimony of both Butler and French, some of which could not be justified on grounds of hearsay evidence. Spivak copied down the censored material. In 1971 I asked former Speaker McCormack if he could recall, after thirty-four years, the reasons for these omissions from the official record of the testimony at the hearings. \"I don't recall striking anything from the record,\" he", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:174:9c6a06629b00", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13916, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 175, "text": "it with the official extract of the hearings and found a number of startling omissions made from the testimony of both Butler and French, some of which could not be justified on grounds of hearsay evidence.

Executive hearings were different. We'd let people say anything there because we'd get lots of valuable tips to follow up that way. But in open hearings I insisted that all the evidence had to be pertinent, relevant, and germane-evidence that would stand up in a courtroom to the nth degree. I don't think all investigative committees follow this method, but they should. I wanted to be very careful about safeguarding the character of anyone who might be named, without hard evidence, by a witness in testimony at an open hearing, so if somebody gave hearsay evidence, I would say, `Strike it out.\"' Omissions from the official record of some revelations from the testimony of Butler and French gave the American press, with a few minor exceptions, a legitimate excuse to keep silent about them. It was significant that none of the biggest newspaper chains or wire services saw fit to assign crack reporters to dig into what was obviously one of the biggest news stories of the decade. John L. Spivak could not help wondering why MacGuire, the key to the plot, had not been compelled to testify on where and how he had obtained his advance inside information about AI Smith's plans, Hugh Johnson's firing, and the appearance of the American Liberty League; or why he had not been asked to reveal the sources of his information about the Morgan and Du Pont interests' involvement in the plot. *The Conspiracy Explodes 197* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Worst of all, no one involved in the plot had been prosecuted. Spivak went to the Department of justice and pointed out that MacGuire had denied essential parts of Butler's testimony, which the committee itself reported it had proved by documents, bank records, and letters. Did the department intend to file a criminal prosecution against MacGuire for perjury or involvement in the plot? \"I was told,\" Spivak reported, \"it had no plans to prosecute.\" Roger Baldwin, director of the American Civil Liberties Union, issued an angry statement on the curious apathy of the justice Department in punishing any of the miscreants: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The Congressional Committee investigating un-American activities has just reported that the Fascist plot to seize the government . . . was proved; yet not a single", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:175:40bc2a0b7874", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13917, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 176, "text": "file a criminal prosecution against MacGuire for perjury or involvement in the plot? \"I was told,\" Spivak reported, \"it had no plans to prosecute.\" Roger Baldwin, director of the American Civil Liberties Union, issued an angry statement on the curious apathy of the justice Department in punishing any of the miscreants: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The Congressional Committee investigating un-American activities has just reported that the Fascist plot to seize the government . . . was proved; yet not a single participant will be prosecuted under the perfectly plain language of the federal conspiracy act making this a high crime.

Spivak had shrewd observations about the reasons the conspirators had failed dismally in their treason: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The takeover plot failed because though those involved had astonishing talents for making breathtaking millions of dol-lars, they lacked an elementary understanding of people and the moral forces that activate them. In a money-standard civilization such as ours, the universal regard for anyone who is rich tends to persuade some millionaires that they are knowledgeable in fields other than the making of money. The conspirators went about the plot as if they were hiring an office manager; all they needed was to send a messenger to the man they had selected. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> And with incredible ineptitude, they had selected the wrong man. *The Conspiracy Explodes 199* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **16** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Was it possible that MacGuire had exaggerated to both Butler and French about the powerful and influential figures involved in the plot, in order to impress Butler into accepting the leader-ship of the Fascist putsch that MacGuire was in charge of planning? It is conceivable that some of those named by MacGuire as under consideration for the role of dictator or subordinate posi-t ions of leadership had no knowledge of this fact, although Van Zandt reported that he, for one, had been approached. It is unlikely that Douglas MacArthur, as Chief of Staff and a stiff--necked hero with patriotic credentials as unchallengeable as Butler's, would have had any unsavory dealings with the plotters, however patrician his outlook. As for involvement of the American Legion, MacGuire had obviously been influential enough in the organization to have been made chairman of the \"distinguished guest committee\" of its convention, on the staff of National Commander Louis John-son, former Secretary of Defense and head of a large law firm in Clarksburg, West Virginia. There is solid evidence that MacGuire had been able to use the Legion to do multimillionaire Robert S. Clark's bidding and get the Legion to pass a resolution demanding a return to the gold standard. MacGuire was certainly financed by Clark, Christmas, Walter E. Frew, of the Corn Exchange Bank, and others through the Committee for a Sound Dollar and Sound Currency, Inc.,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:177:0884d2e1cd07", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13919, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 178, "text": "Louis John-son, former Secretary of Defense and head of a large law firm in Clarksburg, West Virginia.

MacGuire was certainly financed by Clark, Christmas, Walter E.

And the McCormack-Dickstein Committee verified that he had been sent abroad to study Fascist organizations in Europe as models for creating one in America and had reported favorably to Clark and Christmas about the Croix de Feu. *200** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> MacGuire had outlined to Butler and French the conspirators' plans for a putsch, indicating it would easily succeed in just a few days because a \"big fellow\" organization-later identified by Butler and French as the American Liberty League-was behind it with money and arms. He might have been boasting falsely about having had his headquarters while in Paris at the offices of Morgan and Hodges and about the involvement of the Morgan interests in the plot. The McCormack-Dickstein Committee failed to pursue this line of investigation, but a remarkable number of \"coincidences\" linked the Morgan interests to various facets of the plot. Colonel Grayson M.-P. Murphy, MacGuire's boss who had supported his denial of Butler's charges by insisting, \"I don't believe there is a word of truth in it with respect to Mr. Mac-Guire,\" was a director of a Morgan bank. Butler testified that Clark had implicated John W. Davis, attorney for J. P. Morgan and Company, as author of the speech Clark had given MacGuire to get Butler to deliver at the Legion convention. Davis was the same man from whom MacGuire had declared he could easily raise a million dollars for his Fascist army. MacGuire had also revealed to Butler that the same financial interests who had been behind the gold-standard propaganda were financing the plot to seize the White House. The formation of the American Liberty League had been an-nounced precisely at the time MacGuire had predicted the emer-gence of an organization of \"big fellows\" who were in the back-ground of the Fascist putsch. Its treasurer had been none other than Colonel Grayson M.-P. Murphy. One of its financial backers was Robert S. Clark. Two of the largest contributors had been the J. P. Morgan Associates and the Du Pont interests. John W. Davis was a member of the National Executive Committee. Morgan and Du Pont men were directors.

Few realized that follow-ing his defection from the Roosevelt camp, Smith entered private business as chairman of the board of the New York County Trust Company and joined in erecting the Empire State Building, of which he was corporation president. His alliance with Raskob and the Du Ponts in the League brought charges that he had \"forsaken the brown derby for the top hat.\" When he failed to stop Roosevelt's renomination in 1936, he stumped for Republican candidate Alf Landon, losing much of his former popularity in the process and speaking to dwindling, hostile audiences. Were all the interlacing connections linking MacGuire, Clark, Colonel Murphy, and the Morgan and Du Pont interests to the plot only a series of remarkable coincidences? If so, another unique coincidence led the American Liberty League to sub-sidize such affiliated organizations as the openly Fascist and anti-Semitic Sentinels of the Republic and the Crusaders, who were urged by their leader, George W. Christians, to consider lynching Roosevelt. One night when the President was scheduled to arrive in Chat-tanooga, Christians threatened to cut off the city's electric power and warned grimly, \"Lots of things can happen in the dark!\" This protege of the American Liberty League was kept under surveillance by the Secret Service. As Donald R. McCoy observed in his book, Coming *o f Age: The United States During the *1920's *and 1930's, \". . . *it was clear to most people that the organization [American Liberty League] was playing the same game on the Right as the radical groups were playing on the Left, to influence the [Roosevelt] admin-istration and if unsuccessful to oppose it.

Their hate campaign was echoed by the vast majority of news-papers, like the Hearst press, which had originally supported the President, then denounced him as a dictator. Roosevelt had been compelled to turn to \"fireside chats\" over the radio in order to communicate with the American people over the heads of the press lords. In that emotional climate it was not at all surprising that some elements of big business should have sought to emulate their counterparts in Germany and Italy, supporting a Fascist putsch to take over the government and run it under a dictator on behalf of America's bankers and industrialists. That it did not happen here could be credited largely to the patriotism and determination of one courageous American--Major General Smedley Darlington Butler. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> PART FOUR **<![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]>** **Fallout** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **1** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> About seven weeks after Butler and French had testified, John Spivak asked McCormack for an interview, and it was granted. McCormack had no fear of talking to a reporter from the *New Masses, *for which Spivak was writing at the time. Communis-t-oriented or not, McCormack knew that the *Masses *was in the forefront of exposing Nazi and anti-Semitic activities in the United States. Asked about the deleted testimony, McCormack at first sug-gested that Spivak was relying on gossip. When Spivak revealed and convinced McCormack that he had 'seen the transcript of the executive session, the congressman grew annoyed and can-celed the interview. He agreed to let Spivak leave questions with him, however, and said he would reply to those he chose to answer within three days. Writing Spivak a letter three days later, he gave no specific answers to questions about the American Liberty League, the American Legion's passage of the gold resolution, and the report that John W. Davis had written the speech that MacGuire and Clark had wanted Butler to make. \"The reason for certain portions of General Butler's testimony in executive session being deleted from the public record,\" he wrote, \"has been clearly stated in the public record.\" He went on to make a broad attack against the plotters", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:180:ccbe0753a516", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13922, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 181, "text": "later, he gave no specific answers to questions about the American Liberty League, the American Legion's passage of the gold resolution, and the report that John W.

Murphy had not been called upon to testify. \"Your committee knew,\" Spivak reminded him, \"that Murphy's men are in the anti-Semitic espionage organization, Order of '76.\" \"We didn't have the time,\" Dickstein replied. \"We'd have taken care of the Wall Street groups if we had the time. I would have had no hesitation in going after the Morgans.\" \"You had Belgrano, commander of the American Legion, listed to testify.

His spartan march appealed to Butler, who welcomed him heartily with the approval he had always shown to soldiers who disregarded the foulest weather to push on doggedly with their assigned missions.

He liked Butler instantly, and the feeling was apparently mutual. During their talk Butler revealed that he was intensely pre-occupied with the corporate exploitation of the military for profit. Anxious to arouse Americans to this spoliation, he now be-lieved it might be done by a more sophisticated book of memoirs and reflections than Old *Gimlet Eye.* \"I think you're the man I've been hoping to run into to help me do an autobiography,\" he told Spivak. \"There are things I've seen, things I've learned that should not be left unsaid. War is a racket to protect economic interests, not our country, and our soldiers are sent to die on foreign soil to protect investments by big business.\" Spivak said regretfully that he felt compelled to continue in-vestigating and exposing a more urgent and dangerous situation -Nazi activities in the United States. Butler agreed at once that this activity was more important and offered to help by opening any doors he could for Spivak. During their discussion Spivak learned \"things about big busi-ness and politics, sometimes in earthy, four-letter words, the like of which I had never heard.\" Butler spilled over with anger at the hypocrisy that had marked American interference in the internal affairs of other governments, behind a smoke screen of pious expressions of high-sounding purpose. \"We supervised elections in Haiti,\" he said wryly, \"and wher-ever we supervised them our candidate always won.\" Admiring Butler's candor, Spivak did not want to mislead him or sail under false colors. He reminded the general that he was from the *New Masses, *and in case Butler didn't know it, added, \"It's supposed to be a Communist magazine.\" \"So who the hell cares?\" Butler shrugged. \"There wouldn't be a United States if it wasn't for a bunch of radicals. I once heard of a radical named George Washington. As a matter of fact from what I read he was an extremist-a goddam revolutionist!\" Because of his fierce anti-Fascist and anti-big-business views, Butler was sometimes Red-baited.

His scowl deepened as Spivak revealed that Belgrano had been dismissed without being asked a single question about what had happened at the \"gold--standard resolution\" Legion convention in Chicago. According to Spivak, upon learning that the committee had reported to Congress that it had verified the authenticity of the plot, yet no action had been taken about MacGuire's wholesale denials under oath, Butler lost control of his volatile temper. \"I'll be goddammed!\" he roared. \"You can be sure I'm going to say something about this!\" Spivak asked him to hold off long enough to let the tiny -circulation *New Masses *break the story first. Butler agreed. When the *Masses *appeared with the expose, it was a sensational news scoop, but none of the Washington correspondents dared touch it or follow it up. \"Several expressed regret,\" Spivak related, \"that the exposes were appearing in the *New Masses; *when they quoted from one of my stories-solely on its news value-their editors cut the material out and advised them that quotes from `that magazine' might make readers say the paper was spreading Red propa-ganda.

You know, the average veteran thinks the Legion is a patriotic organization to per-petuate the memories of the last war, an organization to <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *210** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> promote peace, to take care of the wounded and to keep green the graves of those who gave their lives. But is the American Legion that? No sir, not while it is controlled by the bankers. For years the bankers, by buying big club houses for various posts, by financing its beginning, and otherwise, have tried to make a strikebreaking organiza-tion of the Legion. The groups-the so-called Royal Family of the Legion-which have picked its officers for years, aren't interested in patriotism, in peace, in wounded veterans, in those who gave their lives. . . No, they are interested only in using the veterans, through their officers. Why, even now, the commander of the American Legion is a banker-a banker who must have known what Mac-Guire's money was going to be used for. His name was men-tioned in the testimony.

The committee felt it should hear General Butler and ... follow out the \"leads\" which the general furnished to the *Fallout** 211* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> members of the committee. The testimony given by General Butler was kept confidential until such time as the names of the persons who were mentioned in his testimony could be checked upon and verified. The committee did not want to hear General Butler's allegations without giving itself the opportunity to verify the assertions made by him. It did not feel like dragging into the mud of publicity names of persons who were mentioned by General Butler unless his statements could be verified, since untold damage might be caused to a person's reputation, by public discus-sion of testimony which could not be substantiated. This accounts for the fact that when the results of the hearings were finally made public, references to Alfred E. Smith and others were omitted. They were wholly without consequence and public mention might be misinterpreted by the public. The essential portions, however, of General Butler's testi-mony have been released to the public and his specific charges relating to the proposed organization of a \"soldier's movement\" have been thoroughly aired and passed upon by the committee. . . . General Butler asks why Clark was not called before the committee. Well, the reason was that Mr. Clark has been living in France for over a year, as General Butler well knows, and naturally he could not be subpoenaed, but on the 29th of December, 1934, Mr. Clark was represented before the committee in the person of his attorney, and full information was given the committee.

I reminded him that the committee had said that it wanted to hear Clark's testimony, and Clark had stated that he would return from Europe to testify, but had not done so. Yet he had not called or subpoenaed Clark to do so. Why not? \"We couldn't subpoena Clark to testify at the executive session because they were held outside of Washington,\" McCormack explained. \"According to the law of that day, we had no power to subpoena anyone to executive sessions outside the Capital. I subsequently recommended changing the law to give congressional committees that right, and the change was in fact made.\"* Asked whether he knew what the reaction of President Roosevelt or Louis Howe had been to the exposure of the plot, he replied that he did not, Why had the Department of justice under Attorney General Homer Cummings failed to initiate criminal proceedings against the plotters? \"The way I figure it,\" he replied, \"we did our job in the com-mittee by exposing the plot, and then it was up to the Department of Justice to do their job-to take it from there.\" John L. Spivak was equally mystified by the lack of any action taken by the department against the conspirators. When I asked him about it, he replied, \"I have no knowledge why the Attorney General did not pursue this matter except that most likely it was deemed politically inadvisable.\" He thought it possible that the decision might actually have been made in the White House on a basis of sheer pragmatism.

He was a great, patriotic American in every respect.\" \"In your considered judgment, Mr. Speaker, were those men Butler named as involved in the plot guilty?\" \"Millions were at stake when Clark and the others got the Legion to pass that resolution on the gold standard in 1933,\" he answered. \"When Roosevelt refused to be pressured by it, and went even further off the gold standard, those fellows got desperate and decided to look into European methods, with the idea of introducing them into America. They sent MacGuire to Europe to study the Fascist organizations. We found the evidence that Clark and [Colonel] Grayson Murphy, who underwrote the American Legion with $125,000, were involved when we ex-amined MacGuire's records and bank accounts.\" I asked him about Colonel Murphy's role in the plot. \"Grayson Murphy was a number-one kingmaker in the Legion. His firm had clients of great wealth. Those fellows were afraid that Roosevelt would take their money away by taxes. They were desperate and sought to take power and frighten Roosevelt into doing what they wanted. But they made the mistake of ap-proaching the wrong man to do the job.\" \"Had the plotters only wanted to take over the White House to restore the gold standard, or were they also out to destroy the New Deal and set up a Fascist dictatorship to run the country through an American Mussolini?\" McCormack reflected a moment, then said, \"Well, we were in the depths of a severe depression, and we had a good man, *214** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Roosevelt, in the White House, and he'd revived the hopes and confidence of the American people.

The plotters definitely hated the New Deal because it was for the people, not for the moneyed interests, and they were willing to spend a lot of their money to dump Mr. Roosevelt out of the White House.\" \"Could you say definitely that the American Liberty League was the organization of `big fellows' that MacGuire had de-scribed as being behind the plotters?\" \"I don't know anything about the Liberty League,\" he replied in a crisp manner that did not encourage me to pursue any further interrogation along that line. \"Mr. Speaker, why were the plotters so insistent that General Butler accept their proposal that he be the one to head the Fascist march on Washington they planned?\" \"They chose Smedley Butler because they needed an `enlisted man's general,' not a `general's general.' They had to have a colorful figure half a million or more veterans who had been privates and noncoms would follow. General Butler was the most popular one.\" \"If General Butler bad been an ambitious man like Aaron Burr and had been willing to be the Man on the White Horse for the plotters, do you think their conspiracy to take over the White House, with all that money behind it, might have succeeded?\" \"Well, if General Butler had not been the patriot he was, and if they had been able to maintain secrecy, the plot certainly might very well have succeeded, having in mind the conditions existing at that time. No one can say for sure, of course, but when times are desperate and people are frustrated, anything like that could happen.\" And we might have gone Fascist?\" \"If the plotters had got rid of Roosevelt, there's no telling what might have taken place. They wouldn't have told the people what they were doing, of course. They were going to make it all sound constitutional, of course, with a high-sounding name for the dictator and a plan to make it all sound like a good American program.

He was giving the plotters a come-on and trying to get the whole story from them. When he had all the information on who was behind it, and what they were up to, he wanted to come to Washington, testify before our committee, and break the whole thing wide open.\" Finally I asked him, \"Then in your opinion America could definitely have become a Fascist power had it not been for Gen-eral Butler's patriotism in exploding the plot?\" \"It certainly could have,\" McCormack acknowledged. \"The people were in a very confused state of mind, making the nation weak and ripe for some drastic kind of extremist reaction. Mass frustration could bring about anything.\" He reminded me that the international smell of fascism had been very much in the air during the hectic days of the plot and that much undercover Fascist activity had been going on in the United States that the American people knew nothing about. The McCormack-Dickstein Committee had exposed Ivy Lee, the noted public relations expert ostensibly employed by the German dye trust, but actually on the payroll of the Nazi Government to help them win favorable publicity in the American press. The committee had brought about passage of the Foreign Agents' Registration Act to smoke out hidden Nazi and Soviet agents into the limelight. This committee was not the headline-seeking, witch-hunting extravaganza that HUAC became under Martin Dies. \"Its man-ner of investigation commanded special respect,\" notes historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. \"McCormack used competent investi-gators and employed as committee counsel a former Georgia senator with a good record on civil liberties. Most of the ex-amination of witnesses was carried on in executive sessions. In public sessions, witnesses were free to consult counsel. Throughout, <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *216** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> McCormack was eager to avoid hit-and-run accusation and unsubstantiated testimony. The result was an almost uniquely scrupulous investigation in a highly sensitive area.\" Schlesinger noted that the McCormack Committee had \"de-clared itself `able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler' except for MacGuire's direct proposal to him, and it considered this more or less confirmed by MacGuire's European reports....

James E. Van Zandt, national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and subsequently a Republican congressman, corroborated Butler's story and said that he, too, had been approached by `agents of Wall Street.\"' I queried McCormack about one final point. One newspaper reporter had suggested that Butler had not himself taken the plot very seriously. \"Oh, no, General Butler regarded the plot very gravely indeed,\" McCormack said emphatically. \"He knew that this was a threat to our very way of government by a bunch of rich men who wanted fascism.\" I also discussed this point with the Butler family. Smedley Butler, Jr., agreed with McCormack and explained why his father did not immediately go to Washington when he realized what the plotters were up to: \"Dad was not stupid. He had no proof, and he could not name names, so he had to be careful about it.\" In fairness to the American Legion today, it needs to be pointed out that the Legion leadership of our times is far dif-ferent from what it was in the period during and preceding the Butler hearings, when so many former commanders and high officials were involved in the conspiracy and antilabor activities dictated by big-business interests. John L. Spivak explained why: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> A long struggle followed within the Legion between those who would use the members for their own business and political interests and those who wanted the organization used for the benefit of former servicemen. The latter won. At the time of the plot, the cleavage between the rank and file and the Royal Family seemed-as it indeed turned out to be-a permanent one. In the generation that followed, the *Fallout** 217* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Legion underwent drastic changes and a mellowing. . . .

On the podium lie held audiences fascinated not only by his vigorous exposes of big business, war-makers, the American Liberty League, and the American Legion \"Royal Family,\" but by the sheer dynam-ism of his personality. As he grew more and more heated, he would roam the stage, gesticulating vigorously as he made his points, often extempo-raneously, in salty, sometimes ribald, always blunt language.

He was flooded with requests for appearances at huge vet-erans' bonus rallies staged by the V.F.W. all over the country. In his speeches to veterans he would growl at their naiveté as \"dumb soldiers\" because they didn't organize politically to fight for veterans' benefits due them. They would grin and applaud enthusiastically, knowing that behind his gruff manner was a genuine fondness and concern for their welfare. \" Acknowledged as the spokesman for the \"forgotten veteran,\" he was besieged with requests for help in getting adequate pen-sions for disabled veterans, and through the V.F.W. put pressure on the Veterans Administration in hundreds of cases. The worshipful attitude of veterans toward Butler was ex-pressed in a typical letter to him in March, 1935, by a veteran who wrote, \"We all know that you speak our language, and that the Vet is about as close to your heart as anything else in the world.\" There was no generation gap between the fifty-four-year-old general and youth leaders of that period, who were organizing *218** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> the American Student Union to fight \"against war and fascism.\" They felt a close kinship with the war hero who hated wars, and hated the men who had sent him to fight them. Now con-stantly proselytizing against war in the hope of stopping any new ones, Butler also wrote magazine articles condemning Marine intervention in the affairs of China. Speaking to a Y.M.C.A. in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, in Febru-ary, he accused the big industrialists of America of fattening on the blood of soldiers. He pointed out that the average profit of the Du Ponts from 1910 to 1914 had been only $6 million, but had soared to $58 million between 1914 and 1918. The jump in the same periods for Bethlehem Steel had been $6 to $49 million; for International Nickel, $4 to $73 million. \"It makes you feel proud,\" he said bitingly. \"A lot of the stockholders are members of the National Economy League, and, after I complete my investigation, I will probably find they are also members of the American Liberty League.\" On February 25 *Time *magazine ran a two-column photo show-ing Butler and comedian Jimmy Durante, who attended a dinner in Pittsburgh where the general was speaking, facing each other \"nose to nose\" in a light moment for the photographer.

In March, 1935, Butler began lecturing to mass meetings called by the V.F.W., speaking on behalf of the Patman Bonus Bill. He lost no opportunity to warn veterans also against those big--business interests who favored war and fascism. His convictions were strengthened by a new book based on the Nye munitions investigation, *The Road to War, *by Walter Millis. He wrote a small antiwar book of his own that year, based on an earlier magazine article m which he favored a foreign *Fallout** 219* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> policy of strict neutrality. In *War Is a Racket *he advocated an \"ironclad defense a rat couldn't crawl through,\" but only to defend the United States against attack. The job of the armed forces, he insisted, was only to protect democracy at home-not waste lives on foreign soil to protect American investments overseas: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> [War] is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the masses.

But if they had checked the Oxford Dictionary, they would have found as one definition of conscription: \"taxation or confiscation of property for war purposes to impose equality of sacrifice on non-conscripts.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *Fallout** 221* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **6** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler's speeches at bonus rallies and over the air helped put pressure on Congress to pass the Patman Bonus Bill. As it went to the White House, Butler urged the President to sign it into law, pointing out that it was one way the nation could make amends to the veterans for their exploitation by big business in America's wars of the twentieth century. In a radio broadcast on May 9 he urged his listeners to deluge Roosevelt with a million wires and letters supporting the bill. But the President vetoed it. On May 21 Butler conferred with Senator Elmer Thomas, of Oklahoma, in Washington on tactics to get Congress to override the veto. Afterward he declared his hope of organizing a large-scale political movement of veterans to press for the bonus. \"My idea,\" he told the press, \"would be a mammoth organiza-tion like the Grand Army of the Republic, which would bring political pressure to bear to take care of the soldiers.\" Now he criticized not only the American Legion but also the V.F.W. for avoiding the political arena: \"They're no good. They've got provisions in their bylaws which say they can't engage in political action. The politicians put them to sleep. . . . If the soldiers don't get theirs now, they'll organize and get it. There'd be about five million of them.\" He was asked who would head the new organization. \"I don't know who we'd get to lead it,\" he replied. He was instantly besieged with requests from various veterans groups that he take them over as the nucleus for his battle for the bonus and veterans' pensions. Morris A. Bealle, publisher of Plain Talk magazine, wrote Butler on May 24 that he had already begun such an organization, calling it the Iron Veterans. He urged Butler to assume its leadership. *222** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> \"You may be interested to know that Bill Doyle tried to finance this organization for us,\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:194:6facd5e8ba6b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13936, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 195, "text": "that he take them over as the nucleus for his battle for the bonus and veterans' pensions.

Bealle added, \"A few weeks later I discovered to my horror that he was trying to take it over for the House of Morgan.\" But Butler, made wary by the Fascists' plan for a veterans' \"superorganization,\" began to have second thoughts about the wisdom of any attempt to organize a national veterans group for political purposes. \"To attempt a national association in the beginning,\" he wrote to the organizer of the American Warriors in Iowa, \"would only lead to great financial expense and exploitation of the veterans by chiselling professionals. . . . While it might be possible to find those who would contribute the necessary funds, it would put the veterans under obligation to the contributors.\" His fight for the Bonus Bill, and his bare-knuckled attacks against the establishment, led to cancellation of his radio broad-casts as of July 3. A month earlier, when Van Zandt urged him to come to Montana to speak for the soldiers' bonus at a V.F.W. rally there, Butler declined. \"Such a trip would be a very heavy drain on my pocketbook,\" he explained. \"And as long as I am being put off the air for being too noisy in my criticism of this administration and for taking the part of the soldiers, I more or less shall have to con-serve my resources.\" But he was determined to get the truth as he saw it out to the American people and undertook a new lecture tour that would cover the country. Roosevelt had not been able to get the press to carry his message to the people, so he had turned to national radio. Butler had not been able to get national radio to carry his message, so he turned to town-hall meetings all over America. On June 12 the American League of Ex-Servicemen asked him to speak at a rally in favor of the bonus with American Labor party Congressman Vito Marcantonio.

The League adjutant quickly agreed, adding, \"Millions of rank-and-file veterans have always looked to you as a champion of their cause in fighting for their rights and to receive justice from the government:\" Meanwhile a vigorous debate was taking place in Congress, sparked by the Nye Committee revelations and the weakness of the League of Nations, over the Ludlow Resolution calling for a national referendum before war could be declared. The resolu-tion failed, but on August 31 Congress passed the First Neutrality Act. It forbade transportation of munitions to any belligerents after the President had declared a state of war to exist between them and authorized the President to prohibit travel by Ameri-can citizens on the ships of belligerents. Butler regretted the failure of the Ludlow Resolution to pass, because he saw it as a way to prevent powerful men from mak-ing decisions that could drag the country to war. He praised Congress for passing the Neutrality Act, however, believing that it would help take the profits out of war for American munitions--makers, and also make it difficult for them to embroil the United States in a foreign war by stirring passions over Americans lost at sea in naval attacks. When a book by Senator Huey Long appeared, hopefully called *My First Days in the White House, *it listed as members of Long's mythical cabinet Franklin D. Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover, with Smedley Butler as Secretary of War. On September *15, *one week after Long was assassinated, Butler was interviewed in Atlanta. He was asked how he felt about his inclusion in the late senator's proposed cabinet. Characterizing it as \"the greatest compliment ever paid to me,\" Butler smiled, \"I certainly felt in good company.\" Asked about his own political ambitions, Butler shrugged, \"I'm just a gentleman farmer now.\" Reporters then asked him to comment on the government's transfer of veterans who had been lobbying for the bonus from Washington to Florida, where some had been killed in a violent hurricane. \"What I'm interested in,\" Butler replied, \"is who approved the order to send them down there. They were in Washington, lobbying or pleading under their constitutional rights, when they *224** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> were sent down to the sandspits.

Although Butler sym-pathized with Ethiopia, he approved of Congress's determination to keep clear of involvement in any foreign war. On Armistice Day he spoke to a crowd of ten thousand in Philadelphia at a peace rally held by the Armistice Day Celebra-tion Committee and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Deglamorizing the first war he had fought in, the Spanish-American War, he shouted, \"That war was caused by the newspaper propaganda of William Randolph Hearst, and he's been trying to get us into another war ever since.

In April, 1936, the Tacoma *News-Tribune *published an edi-torial on his antiwar speeches, intimating that he was \"credited with fascist leanings.\" The Olympia, Washington, post of the United Spanish War Veterans immediately passed a resolution protesting this libel. Demanding a retraction, they pointed out, \"Less than three years ago he stifled an incipient fascist rebellion in the eastern United States, an accomplishment due solely to his own prompt initiative, thereby demonstrating once more his stalwart Americanism.\" While Butler had become an isolationist out of disillusionment *Fallout** 227* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> with the motives of those who had engineered armed U.S. inter-vention in other countries, he hated fascism as fervently as he hated war. He warned angrily that the Fascist fifth column in America was so active that one in every five hundred Americans had become \"at heart a traitor to democracy.\" One of his long-fought crusades ended in triumph in Jan-uary, 1936, when Congress, under heavy pressure from the na-tion's veterans aroused by Butler, Senators Patman and Thomas, and the V.F.W. bonus rallies, finally passed the Patman Bonus Bill over Roosevelt's veto.

A realist, he declined, explaining, \"I am too ignorant to be President of the United States and have not a definite plan for curing our present ills. I am doing the best I can to educate myself, but feel that no man should invite others to follow him unless he has a definite objective, and has the course marked out, day by day. I, of course, learned the above from my military life.\" He devoted all his energies to keeping America out of the war he saw coming. Preoccupied with writing and speaking against it, as well as reading to learn more about it, he had no time for the theater, radio, or tennis, which he loved and played brilliantly. At the dinner table at home and elsewhere, guests listened to him spellbound in complete silence. He was kept talking so much that he frequently left the table without having had more than a mouthful of food. A thoroughgoing extrovert, he was not ostensibly an egotist; it simply came naturally to him as a Marine general to be in command of any situation. His children could not recall any gathering at which their father did not hold forth, less because he wanted or needed to, than because he was urged on by a barrage of interested questions. People were fascinated by his views and experiences. He was not, however, among the honored guests when the American Liberty League, in January, 1936, organized a banquet for two thousand of its members at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. The principal speaker was Al Smith. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *228** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **7** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> In his speech Smith warned Americans that they faced a choice between \"the pure air of America or the foul breath of Com-munistic Russia.\" The New Deal, he charged, was taking the nation into communism. The press, 8o percent anti-Roosevelt, warmly applauded his attack. Militant C.LO. labor leader John L. Lewis growled that Smith had undoubtedly been \"well paid\" by his present employers for what he had said. New Deal parti-sans denounced Smith as a tool of Wall Street. \"I just can't understand it,\" Roosevelt told Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. \"All the things we have done in the Federal Government are like the things A1 Smith did as governor of New York.

They're the things he would have done as President. . . . What in the world is the matter?\" The American Liberty League banquet marked the opening of their hate campaign of propaganda to defeat the reelection of Roosevelt in 1936. The Scripps-Howard press and its United Press wire service, an exception to the rabidly anti-Roosevelt newspaper chains, rushed to the President's defense. Following through on Butler's expose, their papers carried a story headlined: \"Liberty League Controlled by Owners of $37,000,000,000.\" Directors of the League were identified as also being directors of U.S. Steel, General Motors, Standard Oil, Chase National Bank, Goodyear Tire, and Mutual Life Insurance Company. Liberal senators joined the attack. On January 23 Senator Schwellenbach denounced \"J. Pier-pont Morgan and John J. Raskob and Pierre du Pont and all the rest of these rascals and crooks who control the American Lib-erty League.\" Senator Robert M. La Follette, Jr., pointed out that the League's biggest contributors were the Du Ponts, A. P. Sloan, the Pews, E. T. Weir, Sewell Avery, and John J. Raskob, *Fallout** 229* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> and declared, \"It is not an organization that can be expected to defend the liberty of the masses of the American people. It speaks for the vested interests.\" The attacks on the League, plus Roosevelt's reelection in 1936 over its desperate and expensive opposition, destroyed the organ-ization as an effective force of reaction in America. It was dis-banded soon afterward with a brief announcement to the press that the purposes for which the League had been formed had been served, and that it was therefore no longer necessary. But affiliates financed by the League, like the Sentinels of the Re-public, the Crusaders, and other pro-Fascist and far-right organi-zations, continued their agitation. Butler continued to stump the country through 1936 warning against involvement in the coming war he foresaw. He was grati-fied on February 29 when Congress passed the Second Neutrality Act, amending the original act to prohibit either loans or credits to belligerent nations. He was disturbed, however, when the Spanish civil war broke out in July. The Neutrality Act imposed a boycott of aid to the Loyalist Government, while it was apparent that Mussolini and Hitler were supplying both money and military assistance to Franco. But by this time Butler was so passionately opposed to the loss of another American soldier on foreign soil, he felt only strict neutrality could prevent it.

But by this time Butler was so passionately opposed to the loss of another American soldier on foreign soil, he felt only strict neutrality could prevent it. He shocked a meeting of the American League Against War and Fascism, which was trying to raise funds for the Loyalists, by asking them, \"What the hell is it our business what's going on in Spain? Use common sense or you'll have our boys getting their guts blown out over there. Americans en masse never did a wrong thing. Mind your own business. Have faith in your own country.\" He considered the argument that Hitler and Mussolini had to be \"stopped now before it's too late\" the kind of sophistry that had plunged America into World War I with frightening warnings about the Kaiser. In September he endorsed the candidacy of Representative Vito Marcantonio, of the left-wing American Labor party, for his antiwar, anti-Fascist stand. Butler's detractors assailed this endorsement as \"proof' that he was some kind of Red, ignoring <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *230** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> the fact that two weeks earlier Roosevelt had accepted the in-vitation of the A.L.P. to become its candidate, as well as the candidate of the Democratic party. The growing isolationist movement in America now resulted in more prominence being given to Butler's antiwar speeches in the press. On September 17 when he delivered a slashing attack on war makers before the V.F.W. in Denver, it was carried in part on the wires of the Associated Press: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> WAR IS CALLED `HELL' AND `BUSINESS RACKET' <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Gen.

Six days later the mood of the nation grew more apprehensive, however, as Hitler and Mussolini signed the Rome-Berlin Axis pact and the following month were joined by Japan, which signed an Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany. Roosevelt's landslide reelection strengthened his hand against the isolationists, and there were signs that the White House intended to take a tougher stand against the Axis powers. Butler grew increasingly worried that the President might be starting the nation down the road to war.

Since a national poll showed that 73 per-cent of Americans favored some kind of popular referendum before the United States could declare war, Butler felt that the President was ignoring the will of the people and seeking to tie their fate to that of England and France. On July 12 he warned a thousand veterans at Paterson, New Jersey, that unless the nation's veterans banded together to de-mand peace, America would be at war again in a short time. He urged them to demand that U.S. armed forces be kept within their own borders and that the use of the American flag be restricted to government-owned ships. Speaking to a Writers' Union meeting in Philadelphia, he described how the United States might be dragged into the next European war. A European ship would stop a U.S. ship carrying munitions to a potential enemy. The American captain would radio William Randolph Hearst that the flag had been insulted. Orators would begin demanding that Americans avenge the insult. Ministers would discover that they were \"transmitters from God\" and encourage a holy crusade.

Three months later Japanese airmen sank the U.S. gun-boat Panay in Chinese waters. A poll showed that 53 percent of Americans agreed with Butler's demand for withdrawal of all United States forces. But instead Washington demanded in-demnity from Tokyo. Butler was convinced that a continued American presence in Asia could only lead to eventual war with an aggressive Japan bent on becoming the dominant power in the Orient. He saw confirmation of his belief that war was a business racket when Washington continued to permit American corporations to sell scrap iron and oil to Tokyo for its war machine. He also knew that there were over two billion dollars in American investments in Germany, which was being goaded by British diplomacy into attacking the Soviet Union. If these facts seemed to him more immediately menacing than the steadily escalating aggression of the Axis powers, he was not alone among liberal and left-wing Americans in this myopia.

Bingham, Dwight *234** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> MacDonald, Bertrand Wolfe, and Sidney Hook were among those who opposed any strong action against Japan, or any of the other Axis powers, arguing, \"We believe that the first result of another War to Make the World Safe for Democracy will be the establishment of virtual fascism in this country.\" By now the country was almost evenly divided between iso-lationists and those who advocated anti-Fascist alliances.

In the event of war, he told the committee, he favored abandoning Alaska, the Panama Canal, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. The Canal, he asserted, could be destroyed by \"a handful of bombs.\" He also insisted *Fallout** 235* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> that all mercantile ships operated for profit should fly com-mercial flags, not the American flag. He explained that since his retirement he had visited twelve hundred cities and towns and \"talked to all 'kinds of people in all parts of the country.\" He said, \"I have a feeling that this bill does not represent a consensus of opinion among naval officers. I have a feeling that it is a grand bluff. Furthermore, I believe that the American people will turn against this bill before any of the keels provided are laid.

He did, he replied, and hoped that Congress would fix a defense line beyond which the Navy would not be allowed to operate. \"Suppose Japan tried to invade the United States?\" Her forces would be so weak by the time they reached the Pacific Coast, Butler replied, that \"we could knock her over with a feather.\" He recommended a force of twenty-thousand-ton battleships that would hug the coasts and, with the aid of sub-marines, aircraft, and coastal defenses, would be able to stand off any hostile forces that came within striking distance. \"I am a friend of the Navy,\" he declared, \"and I have an anchor tattooed on my chest, but if we go to building up the Navy as proposed in the bill, and loading down the people with the cost of it, the people will turn on the Navy as they did in the eighties, and not a ship will be able to leave port, for there just won't be a dollar appropriated for the Navy.\" He was joined in opposing the Navy construction bill by eighteen peace organizations, including the American Friends Service Committee, the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, the National Council of Jewish Women, the Con-ference on World Peace of the Methodist Episcopal Church, *236** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> the National Council for the Prevention of War, the Church Peace Union, and the National Student Federation. But Con-gress turned a deaf ear, and in May it passed the Naval Con-struction Act, authorizing a billion-dollar expansion program. Butler's raging hatred of war led him into the same errors of judgment that ensnared the isolationists of America. Like them, he approved of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's efforts to buy \"peace in our time\" at Munich. Confident that the Nazis could not get through the French Maginot line, he also believed that every Frenchman would fight fiercely to protect his own plot of land against any invasion. The Stalin-Hitler nonaggression pact of August 23, 1939, fol-lowed by the invasion of Poland, made it clear that the world was tottering on the verge of another great war.

Not a single drop of American blood should ever again be spilled on foreign soil.

On the same day the British passenger liner *Athenia *was torpedoed and sunk without warning off the Hebrides, drowning thirty American passengers. That night, in a fireside radio chat to the American people, Roosevelt declared, \"This nation will remain a neutral nation, but I cannot ask that every American remain neutral in thought as well.\" In November Congress passed a new neutrality act that legal-ized the sale of munitions to belligerent nations on a cash-and--carry basis. The news filled Butler with dismay. \"This country,\" he protested, \"did not have one solitary blessed thing to do with the making of this mess over there, and there is no possible sane and logical reason why we should feel any impulse to take a hand in it.\" *Fallout** 237* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **10** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> A spiteful rumor that Butler had become a spokesman for Father Coughlin's Christian Front led some Jewish groups to threaten cancellation of speeches he was scheduled to make to them in November. \"I couldn't believe there was a word of truth in this,\" wrote Mildred Smith, executive secretary of the Open Forum Speakers Bureau, \"but I dared not say an official `no' without direct word from you on this matter.\" He wired back indignantly, \"Have never spoken for the Chris-tian Front. I am a Quaker and am preaching tolerance and am not connected nor will I have anything to do with any movement or organization advocating intolerance or the entrance of this country into any foreign war.\" His hatred for war did not cause any diminution in his hatred for fascism, but he refused to sanction one to fight the other except in absolute self-defense.

Once he was visited by a female cousin who had married a German and brimmed over with praise for the Nazis. Butler's face grew taut as she babbled on, but he said nothing until it was time to say good-bye. Unable to contain himself any longer, he rasped at the door, \"Nellie, if Hitler comes over here, thee can be sure I will be on the beach at Atlantic City to kick the everlasting hell out of him!\" His taste in books increasingly reflected both his antiwar and his anti-Fascist convictions. In his library during his last years were *Sawdust Caesar, *by George Seldes, *The Road to War, *by Walter Millis, and *Johnny Got His Gun, *by Dalton Trumbo. *Europe Under the Terror, *by John L. Spivak, was inscribed to him as \"one of the best fighters against Fascism in the country, with the respect and admiration of J.L.S.\" *238** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> In 1939 he wrote an antiwar piece for a book edited by Paul Comly French, *Common Sense Neutrality-Mobilizing for Peace. *Sharing the covers with him were such contributors as Eleanor Roosevelt, Charles A. Beard, Dr. Harry Elmer Barnes, Senator William Borah, Norman Thomas, Sumner Welles, Herbert Hoover, Senator Robert La Follette, Jr., John L. Lewis, and Elliot Roosevelt. But as the Nazis swept through Belgium and the Netherlands on May 10, 1940, bypassing the Maginot line and imperiling France, millions of Americans grew alarmed. A Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies was organized by William Allen White to rout the isolationists. In a mood of black despair Butler delivered his last antiwar speech on May 24 at Temple University. Hating Hitler and Nazism, he nevertheless could not shake off the dread specter of one or two million dead American youths strewn over Europe's battlefields. He decried fears of a German invasion of the United States as alarmist, playing into the hands of war profiteers. From the comfortable vantage of hindsight, it is easy to fault Smedley Butler as having been woefully shortsighted in his stubborn view that the best interests of Americans were served by persisting in a policy of neutrality. But thirty years in uni-form, seeing active service in every war and campaign since the Spanish-American War, had convinced him that war was nothing but a cruel and bloody swindle of the people.

In his disillusionment he saw little difference between World War I and World War II. Ever since he had been a starry-eyed Marine recruit of sixteen, American administrations had per-sistently cried wolf in order to use him and the youths under him in order to protect and augment foreign investments wrapped in the flag. It was now impossible for him to believe that the *Fallout** 239* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> shouts of wolf he heard once more any** **more genuine than all those he had heard at regular intervals since 1898.

His doctor ordered him to enter the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia for a rest and examination. \"As soon as I get out,\" he promised Ethel Bitter, \"I am going to take thee to Europe for the vacation I've never managed to find time for. Thee deserves it for thy patience!\" During his four weeks in the hospital, however, lie lost weight rapidly and guessed that his ailment was more serious than the doctors were letting him know. On June 10 Italy declared war on Britain and France. Roose-velt promptly called for \"full speed ahead\" in the promotion of national defense and for the extension of material aid to \"op-ponents of' force.\" The next day Congress voted another $3.2 billion in military appropriations. On June 14 Butler's gloom plunged to new depths when Ger-many invaded France unopposed. Four days later Admiral Harold R. Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, asked Congress for a two--ocean navy in a $4-billion expansion program. During a visit by his son Smedley, Jr., Butler reflected glumly on the futility of his long fight to keep his country from getting involved in another war. \"I think,\" he said ruefully, \"that I should have stayed with my own kind.\" He meant Quakers and Marines, rather than politicians. On June 21, 1940, hours before France was scheduled to surrender officially to Adolf Hitler, Smedley Darlington Butler died in the hospital of an abdominal ailment suspected to be cancer. *240** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> ** 11 ** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Although the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:210:e7ff48758742", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13952, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 211, "text": "in another war. \"I think,\" he said ruefully, \"that I should have stayed with my own kind.\" He meant Quakers and Marines, rather than politicians.

I shall always remember the old days in Haiti. My heart goes out to you and the family in this great sorrow.\" Among others who sent condolences were former Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, then ambassador to Mexico, and Major General Thomas Holcomb, commandant of the Marine Corps. A simple funeral service was held at the Butler home in Newtown Square, followed by burial in West Chester, with attendance limited to close friends and immediate members of the family. Ethel Butler knew that elaborate formal ceremonies would be a violation of the principles of her husband, who had always detested phony pomp and circumstance. The general who could have had all the wealth and power he wanted as dictator of the United States died leaving an estate that totaled two thousand dollars. *The New York Times *now hailed him as \"one of the most glamorous and gallant men who ever wore the uniform of the United States Marine Corps.... a brave man and an able leader of troops.... He laughed at danger, and he set an example to his men that helped them to carry out the traditions of the Marine Corps.\" Calling him also \"often a storm center,\" the *Times *added, \"It was when he ventured into public affairs that his impetuosity led him into trouble.\" In an editorial obituary on June 23 the New York *Herald Tribune *had no cautious reservations: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> It is as a great \"leatherneck\" that Gen.

Butler *in his honor. Converted to a high--speed minesweeper, it saw distinguished service during the war. That would not have seemed inappropriate to the fighting hero who hated war as a racket, yet who had once declared, \"I am a peace-loving Quaker, but when war breaks out every damn man in my family goes.\" Both his sons entered the service, Smedley, Jr. in the Marines, Tom Dick in the Navy. A hell-for-leather Marine officer who drove himself as hard as his men, he had won their enthusiastic admiration and loyalty. He, in turn, had been passionately and stubbornly devoted to them, in service and out of it. Former Marine Commandant David M. Shoup, who served under Butler in China, told me that he and all the men in the command had respected Butler as \"one helluva fine soldier.\" During World War II Butler's old newspaper friend, E. Z. Dimitman, interviewed Douglas MacArthur in the Pacific as a war correspondent. Noting a resemblance between MacArthur's commander of the 32d Division, General Robert L. Eichelberger, and Old Gimlet Eye, Dimitman mentioned it to MacArthur and suggested that Eichelberger might prove another Butler. \"Never in a million years,\" MacArthur replied emphatically. \"There's only one Butler.

Significantly, as early as January, 1966, another distinguished Marine general, former Commandant David M.

It might also be noted that before the explosion of the Pentagon Papers, two Marine Corps colonels wrote books de-nouncing the intervention in Vietnam as genocide against a people caught up in a civil war, in support of a corrupt Saigon dictatorship.

It might also be noted that before the explosion of the Pentagon Papers, two Marine Corps colonels wrote books de-nouncing the intervention in Vietnam as genocide against a people caught up in a civil war, in support of a corrupt Saigon dictatorship. Perhaps the elite fighting team of the United States produces high-ranking dissenters like Butler, Shoup, and the two colonels because many men who choose careers as Marine Corps officers tend to be strongly motivated by patriotism and idealism. When there is an American military intervention overseas, it is usually the Marines who spearhead it, do the fighting, get an accurate picture of the real situation, and observe who is being politically supported or suppressed, and why. All too often these officers have been disillusioned by the use of the Marines to suppress social change in small countries, on behalf of dictators, an elite military and business class, and American commercial interests. This realization outrages their idealism. They resent the expenditure of the lives of Marines under them for sordid motives in power games of dollar diplo-macy and international politics. Hence the most intelligent and high-principled Marine staff officers may become the bitterest critics of American admini-strations that misuse the Corps. The war records, motivation, and *Fallout** 242* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> integrity of such generals as Butler and Shoup make it impossible to dismiss their testimony expressing dismay at the way United States expeditionary forces have been deployed in the name of national defense. Although Butler had considered himself basically a pacifist who hated war, he had placed duty to his country above all other considerations and had spent thirty-three years of his life carry-ing out orders to defend it. His gradual disillusionment with those orders, and the men who gave them, had led him to speak out abrasively against the use of the military on behalf of American vested interests. No matter whose corns he trod on, or the cost to his career, he had habitually said and did what he thought right. His bluntness had made him unpopular with some Presidents, Secre-taries of State and Navy, and the highest-ranking generals and admirals in Washington, who considered him a military fire-brand as irrepressible as Generals Billy Mitchell and George S. Patton. But it was just this quality in Butler that had given him the courage and integrity to face public ridicule to expose, in the name of service to his country, what John L. Spivak called \"one of the most fantastic plots in American history.\" \"What was behind the plot was shrouded in a silence which has not been broken to this day,\" Spivak wrote. \"Even a genera-tion later, those who are still alive and know all the facts have kept their silence so well that the conspiracy is not even a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:213:00425f22d97d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13955, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 214, "text": "him the courage and integrity to face public ridicule to expose, in the name of service to his country, what John L.

It would be regrettable if his-torians neglected this episode and future generations of Ameri-cans never heard of it.\" In 1964 Speaker of the House John W. McCormack referred to the plot in his speech before the Democratic convention in Atlantic City, when he warned against right-wing extremists in the Barry Goldwater camp. But he did not give any details, and only a knowledgeable handful of Americans understood the full implications of what he was talking about. The conspiracy unquestionably inspired the novel *Seven Days in May, *made into a successful film, which portrayed a Fascist plot by high-placed American conspirators to capture the White House and establish a military dictatorship under the pretext <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *242** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> of saving the nation from communism. Few of the millions of Americans who read the novel or saw the film suspected that it had a solid basis in fact. It would seem time that school textbooks in America were revised to acknowledge our debt to the almost forgotten hero who thwarted the conspiracy to end democratic government in America. If we remember Major General Smedley Darlington Butler for nothing else, we owe him an eternal debt of gratitude for spurning the chance to become dictator of the United States--and for making damned sure no one else did either. **For an engaging 10-page summary of Gen.

I'm coming to trust the major polling organizations less and less. Read below to see how *Newsweek* manipulated data to skew the polls by several percentage points.

Bush. For one solid week he was on message and got Americans who watched to listen to the message he intends to carry in the fall campaign: leadership, decisiveness and success battling the war on terrorism. The convention actually followed another big week for Mr. Bush and equally dismal one for his opponent, Democratic Senator John Kerry. Now the first polls are out. I have Mr. Bush leading by 2 points in the simple head-to-head match up - 46% to 44%. Add in the other minor candidates and it becomes a 3 point advantage for the President - 46% to 43%. This is no small achievement. The President was behind 50% to 43% in my mid-August poll and he essentially turned the race around by jumping 3 points as Mr. Kerry lost 7 points. Impressive by any standards. For the first time in my polling this year, Mr. Bush lined up his Republican ducks in a row by receiving 90% support of his own party, went ahead among Independents, and now leads by double-digits among key groups like investors. Also for the first time the President now leads among Catholics. Mr. Kerry is on the ropes. Two new polls came out immediately after mine (as of this writing) by the nation's leading weekly news magazines. Both Time's 52% to 41% lead among likely voters and Newsweek's 54% to 43% lead among registered voters give the President a healthy 11 point lead. I have not yet been able to get the details of Time's methodology but I have checked out Newsweek's poll. Their sample of registered voters includes 38% Republican, 31% Democrat and 31% Independent voters. If we look at the three last Presidential elections, the spread was 34% Democrats, 34% Republicans and 33% Independents (in 1992 with Ross Perot in the race); 39% Democrats, 34% Republicans, and 27% Independents in 1996; and 39% Democrats, 35% Republicans and 26% Independents in 2000. While party identification can indeed change within the electorate, there is no evidence anywhere to suggest that Democrats will only represent 31% of the total vote this year. In fact, other competitors have gone in the opposite direction.

While party identification can indeed change within the electorate, there is no evidence anywhere to suggest that Democrats will only represent 31% of the total vote this year. In fact, other competitors have gone in the opposite direction. The Los Angeles Times released a poll in June of this year with 38% Democrats and only 25% Republicans. And Gallup's party identification figures have been all over the place. This is no small consideration. Given the fact that each candidate receives anywhere between eight in ten and nine in ten support from voters in his own party, any change in party identification trades point for point in the candidate's total support. My polls use a party weight of 39% Democrat, 35% Republican and 26% Independent. Thus in examining the Newsweek poll, add three points for Mr. Bush because of the percentage of Republicans in their poll, then add another 8% for Mr. Bush for the reduction in Democrats. It is not hard to see how we move from my two-point lead to their eleven-point lead for the President. I will save the detailed methodological discussion for another time. But I will remind readers that my polling has come closest to the final results in both 1996 and 2000. None of this takes away from the President's achievement. He got out of his party's convention everything he needed to launch his campaign in earnest in the closing two months. But my poll still reveals lurking shadows for him. He still has a net negative job performance rating, a negative re-elect (i.e. more voters think it is time for someone new than feel he deserves re-election) and a net negative wrong direction for the country. The poll also suggests that Mr. Kerry is behind and has a lot of work to do to refocus the campaign on the issues that must work for him: the economy, health care, and the execution of the war in Iraq. We also see now that at least in the short run, the advertising campaign against the Senator about his military service in Vietnam has raised questions about his integrity and has caused his personal unfavorable numbers to jump. But with all that said, it simply is not an 11 point race. It just isn't.

Barr Updated: 3:00 a.m. PT Dec 1, 2006 **Paperless electronic voting machines used throughout the Washington region and much of the country \"cannot be made secure,\"** according to draft recommendations issued this week by a federal agency that advises the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. **The assessment by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, one of the government's premier research centers, is the most sweeping condemnation of such voting systems by a federal agency.** In a report hailed by critics of electronic voting, **NIST said that voting systems should allow election officials to recount ballots independently from a voting machine's software.** The recommendations endorse \"optical-scan\" systems in which voters mark paper ballots that are read by a computer and electronic systems that print a paper summary of each ballot, which voters review and elections officials save for recounts. Voters in Maryland cast ballots on electronic machines that produce no paper record of each vote; in the District and Loudoun County, voters can choose between using such machines and optical-scan systems. Other Northern Virginia jurisdictions, and many counties across the state, use electronic voting systems exclusively. NIST's recommendations are to be debated next week before the Technical Guidelines Development Committee, charged by Congress to develop standards for voting systems. To become effective, NIST's recommendations must then be adopted by the Election Assistance Commission, which was created by Congress to promote changes in election systems after the 2000 debacle in Florida. If the commission agrees with NIST, the practical impact may not be felt until 2009 or 2010, the soonest that new standards would be implemented. The standards that the Election Assistance Commission will adopt are voluntary, but most states require election officials to deploy voting systems that meet national or federal criteria. State election officials in Maryland and Virginia declined to comment yesterday on the NIST report, which they were reviewing. Alice P. Miller, executive director of the District's Board of Elections and Ethics, said through a spokesman that she would not comment because she is a member of the Technical Guidelines Development Committee. **NIST says in its report that the lack of a paper trail for each vote \"is one of the main", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:postelectronicvotingproblems.txt:0:30ebf4ccddb3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13967, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "postelectronicvotingproblems.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "postelectronicvotingproblems", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "voting systems that meet national or federal criteria.

Electronic voting systems have had technical problems -- including unpredictable screen freezes -- leaving voters wondering whether their ballots were properly recorded. **Computer scientists and others have said that the security of electronic voting systems cannot be guaranteed and that election officials should adopt systems that produce a paper record of each vote in case of a recount. The NIST report embraces that critique, introducing the concept of \"software independence\" in voting systems.** **NIST says that voting systems should not rely on a machine's software to provide a record of the votes cast.** Some electronic voting system manufacturers have introduced models that include printers to produce a separate record of each vote -- and that can be verified by a voter before leaving the machine -- but such paper trails have had their own problems. Printers have jammed or otherwise failed, causing some election directors to question whether a paper trail is an improvement. Maryland state elections administrator Linda Lamone, in an undated video snippet that her critics have circulated on the Internet, says that voter verification is unnecessary. \"I'm not going to put this paper on my machines -- it'll be over my dead body, because I just don't think it works. It really is a false sense of security,\" she said. For critics of paperless electronic voting, the report is vindication. \"I think I got it right,\" said Aviel Rubin, a Johns Hopkins University computer scientist who has long questioned the security and reliability of some electronic voting systems. Linda Schade, a founder of TrueVoteMD, which has pressed for a system that provides a verifiable paper record of each vote, said, \"These strong statements from a credible institution such as NIST add yet another voice to the consensus that paper electronic voting as used in states like MD is not secure. We hope that the [Election Assistance Commission] formally adopts these improved standards.\" **Even critics of paperless electronic voting have grown disenchanted with the practical problems of adding printers to electronic \"touch-screen\" voting machines.** \"Why are we doing this", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:postelectronicvotingproblems.txt:1:2d31dd6ac958", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13968, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "postelectronicvotingproblems.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "postelectronicvotingproblems", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "a system that provides a verifiable paper record of each vote, said, \"These strong statements from a credible institution such as NIST add yet another voice to the consensus that paper electronic voting as used in states like MD is not secure.

I received over 50 emails from friends excited about joining in to invite our world leaders to open to the love and divinity within them. Several of these friends forwarded the message to thousands of their friends around the globe (thanks especially to Jean Hudon), so we had an incredible amount of caring people joining in to energetically bombard our leaders with love. I felt your loving presence so strongly! When I awoke yesterday, I already felt an incredible amount of love and support around me which continued throughout the day. When I walked into the beautiful meeting room on the 35th floor of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York, I could feel and almost see your loving spirits filling the room. Thankfully, I had a few minutes to meditate in the room and connect with you all and with this amazing love energy before the meeting started. President Bush and President Megawati only talked for about 20 minutes. Colin Powell and Condaleeza Rice were among other well known people present. I felt your presence so strongly that it was almost hard for me to pay attention and interpret for the conversation. But I was able to hold both the communication and the love, and the conversation went smoothly. I sat right next to Bush and interpreted for him when he spoke. The Indonesian interpreter, Dino, sat next to Megawati and interpreted for her when she spoke. Whenever I wasn't interpreting, I opened to all of the amazingly powerful love and support I felt in the room and joined in channeling it into the hearts of all present. At one point, about 15 minutes into the meeting, I felt an extra powerful surge of love from all of you flow into the room and through me. Amazingly, at that very moment everyone came to silence. It was just a brief pause, yet it was miraculous! I had absolutely no doubt that everyone in the room was feeling this powerful invitation to open to the love and divinity within themselves. Thank you all!!! Together, we are creating a new paradigm of love and empowerment on the planet. I see and feel big shifts in me and in the world with increasing frequency. Through efforts like what we did at this powerful meeting, our divinity is shining through and helping others to remember the divinity and love the lies within all of us. Yea!!!

Wishing you much love, joy, creativity, and beauty, Fred PS I invite you to continue sending out love to these leaders and to all on our planet. We all know that right along with all the wonderful things happening now, there's lots of craziness and ugly things happening in the world. People become selfish and cruel because they have forgotten just how incredibly divine and full of love they are.

These experts and riveting footage also show how the media have been manipulated to support secret war and power agendas. This eye-opening documentary shows that, especially after 9/11, fear has been used widely in the media to manipulate the public into giving up civil liberties and turning over power to elite groups with their own hidden agendas.* The Power of Nightmares* clearly demonstrates that the nightmare vision of a powerful, united terrorist organization waiting to strike our societies is largely an illusion.

After resigning in late 2004 from my work as an Indonesian interpreter with the U.S. Department of State for [over 18 years](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fredburksresigns), in January 2005 I testified to this in the widely publicized trial of Indonesian Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Ba'asyir. Among other things, Ba'asyir was accused by U.S. authorities of being the mastermind behind JI (Jemaah Islamiah), which is alleged to be a sister organization of Al Qaeda. Many Indonesians were quite skeptical of these allegations. Like me and the *Power of Nightmares* documentary, they questioned whether JI was largely fabricated by powerful elite groups with hidden agendas. At Ba'asyir's trial, I testified about a September 2002 [secret meeting](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050228secretmeeting) at which I interpreted for the president of Indonesia, Megawati Soekarnoputri, and three American representatives: US Ambassador to Indonesia Ralph Boyce, National Security Council representative Karen Brooks, and a special assistant sent personally by President Bush (who revealed privately to me that she was a CIA agent).

This information involved the public testimony of over [20 senior government and military witnesses](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=national+press+club+disclosure+project+2001) whose credentials could not be questioned. The astounding information revealed in their testimony clearly did not benefit these witnesses personally. In fact, it threatened their careers. Yet though these brave individuals testified in public with large numbers of major media reporters present, mainstream news sources in the U.S. gave little significant coverage to this major occurrence.

Since my eyes were opened in 2001 to a major cover-up of the UFO issue and much, much more, I have dedicated myself to uncovering all that is going on behind the scenes.

I received many supportive emails from friends and friends of friends who joined us in sending lots of love to that special meeting. I thought you might enjoy reading some of the inspiring stories I received over email, so here are three for you: Dear Fred, (by way of my friend Alan who forwarded your letter) A funny thing happened to me when I tried to send energy to you on the occasion of your meeting with Presidents Bush and Megawati Sukarnoputri: I learned to contact my spirit guides consciously for the first time in my life. Actually, I meditated about 7 1/2 hours before your meeting. I live in Japan, and your meeting was at 4:30 in the morning Japan time. I meditated at 9:00 p.m. the night before. As I began to meditate, I began to feel the profound pain in my chest that always occurs when I try to send love out. But your appeal was strong, and my wife was encouraging, so I decided to try to persevere despite the pain. I asked for help, and began to receive instruction in my head, that while my heart was always open in the chest, it always tends to be collapsed in my back, and so the entire circuit of energy is broken. This condition of collapse is largely due to childhood abuse, and my story is that I have persevered through many years of trying to solve the riddle of how to live functionally with this background. The Spirit Guides I worked with showed me how to hold up my arms in meditation to focus sunlight and prana into my ailing heart. I had my first glimpses that this approach is working. Thanks very much, Takeda San, Yoroshiku onegaishimasu. Take Care, one and all. , Love Erik Sutter-Kaye Fred, I'm glad to know that you felt our presence...Perhaps a coincidence, but about midway through my meditation yesterday, I vanished. My body was most certainly still in my seat, but I'm definitely missing time. Not sure where I went, but I was very aware of \"waking up\" again, although I never fell asleep. Kind of like when lights and power go out, then suddenly come back on all at once a few moments later. When I concluded my meditation, I felt the most wonderful sense of well-being, and I wondered what you felt. It has carried me through today as well. Well, back to the mundane (and the remarkable). Love ya...and everybody else too!

(This was from a friend who prefers to remain unnamed) Dear Fred, I was channeling love to you and the government leaders on Tuesday - particularly at the beginning, again towards the end, and then later on I sent more love back in time to the center point of the meeting. Each time I did this, I felt shivers of energy in my body. In my shamanic journey work, I've visited dubya a number of times. Last Thursday in my journey during the drum circle I attend, I journeyed to dubya and four of my friends from the drum circle were there too. Dubya was crying. We were sending love to his heart to help with his opening. He kept crying. We hugged him just before the journey ended. Attraction, Intention, Allowance, Balance. Love is so strong. We are all the Divine. peace & breath, Peter Fred here again. A few friends asked that in the future I give more notice so that there is more time to spread the news to other friends who might want to join in. That being the case, I want to give you a heads up that I will likely be interpreting for the two presidents again sometime around Oct. 20 - 22 at the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit in Thailand. Unfortunately, I usually don't get the exact dates and times until a week or less before the meeting. I will let you know, however, as soon as I find out. This is very unusual for me, by the way. The last time I interpreted for the president (excluding last week) was on Sept 19, 2001 at the White House. This is the first time it's ever happened twice in one year. God moves in miraculous ways! Thanks again for all your awesome support and love in all this!

As scheduled, I interpreted at three meetings over the course of almost three hours between President Bush, President Megawati of Indonesia, and a number of other political and religious leaders. **I have no doubt that everyone present in those meetings on some level was touched by all of our love. **Before, during, and after these meetings, I personally very much felt your loving presence. On the morning of these meetings, I had a very strange, unexpected encounter. I awoke early and decided to go for a run from my hotel room across the dew-covered green lawns and down a steep cliff to the crystal blue ocean. Because of the large, rocky cliff, I had to jog down a series of winding stairs to get there. As I got to the soft sand at the bottom of the stairs, I was shocked at what I saw there right in front a me--a dead dolphin! I had never seen anything like this before. I couldn't help but think that this dolphin was a powerful sign. But what did it mean? I really didn't know, but what I decided was that I could find a positive, empowering meaning in it. So I knelt down beside this beautiful, silvery blue, six-foot long body and opened to the spirit of the dead dolphin. Immediately, I felt its presence with me. Not only that, I felt the joyful presence of the entire school of living dolphins with which it had played in the warm ocean waters. I invited all these loving friends to join me and to join us in bringing the powerful energy of love into this meeting between presidents. A few hours later, both presidents' delegations walked into the beautiful, beachside meeting room where I and several others had been waiting. **I was quite surprised when President Bush's chief of staff, Andrew Card, left the delegation and, looking like he knew me well, walked straight over with a warm smile and shook my hand saying, \"It's great to have you here.\"** I had never talked to him before. In fact, I didn't even realize who he was when I saw him at our last meeting in New York a month ago. I wondered if possibly he felt all of the loving energy I helped invite into the room [last month](https://www.WantToKnow.info/poweroflove). After the initial meeting, we all moved into the warmly decorated luncheon room, where I prepared to take my place right next to and just behind President Bush at the center of the banquet table. As", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:presidentialsurprises.txt:0:4fc073874f0c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13980, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "presidentialsurprises.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "presidentialsurprises", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "him before.

After the initial meeting, we all moved into the warmly decorated luncheon room, where I prepared to take my place right next to and just behind President Bush at the center of the banquet table. As President Bush sat down, he looked at the table and turned with a friendly smile to me and said, \"They didn't bring you any water, did they?\" He then called the waiter and had him bring me a glass of water, which is much needed while interpreting. This is highly unusual as most leaders pay little to no attention to their interpreters. He also later commented that to me that it must be hard to interpret during the whole lunch and not get anything to eat. A short while into the luncheon, **I had another surprise when the Indonesian expert on the National Security Council, Karen Brooks, came over and gave me a big, long kiss on the cheek.** I've had a few conversations with her over the years, but don't at all know her well. I wondered if some in the Bush delegation felt the loving presence which I was helping to bring to these meetings. The most unexpected surprise, however, happened later during the lunch when I took a moment to open to all of your energy. As I felt all of your wonderful love and support, I suddenly had a huge realization. Looking down the table at Condoleezza Rice, I found myself in judgment of her cold demeanor. I saw that there was a deeply important lesson here for me. I realized that the purpose for my being at these meetings was not only about channeling love and divine energies, it was also about me opening to see the divinity in each person there present. I saw that my own arrogance (my greatest challenge in life) saw me there as \"saving the world.\" Yet by seeing myself as somehow better than everyone there, I was also creating more dissonance in the world! In an instant, I got it. I acknowledged those judgmental thoughts which keep me from loving, and then asked them to step aside. **Opening to this powerful realization, I looked around and saw that Condoleezza and each person there was in their own way a manifestation of the divine.** I saw that even though I don't agree with most of their policies, all of these leaders were only doing what they believed was best. This was quite an unexpected surprise. I found myself very humbled to feel all of your love pouring into the room, yet my own judgment had kept me from allowing my", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:presidentialsurprises.txt:1:bb0192dc90b0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13981, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "presidentialsurprises.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "presidentialsurprises", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "this powerful realization, I looked around and saw that Condoleezza and each person there was in their own way a manifestation of the divine.** I saw that even though I don't agree with most of their policies, all of these leaders were only doing what they believed was best. This was quite an unexpected surprise. I found myself very humbled to feel all of your love pouring into the room, yet my own judgment had kept me from allowing my love to flow freely. I really got it that although I will continue to work towards stopping the negative behaviors of these leaders, it is even more important that I do this while recognizing that these people-like all people-are creations of the Divine, and that I can honor their spirits even while working to stop them from causing more fear and violence in the world. I saw that I need to continue to work on my own judgment and arrogance if I truly want to help this world move towards a more loving, harmonious way of being. Interestingly enough, a number of times during these meetings those present talked about respecting the differences between our cultures and faiths. This was particularly true in the third meeting which was between President Bush and five of Indonesia's religious leaders who shared their thoughts very openly. I especially appreciated the Buddhist leader who talked about the Earth as being home to us all and humanity as being family to us all. I was quite impressed with the quality and depth of this interchange. On a more mundane level, I saw that President Bush is an excellent actor. He did really listen to what was said, yet many of his responses appeared very well planned to give the appearance of saying yes, while actually saying no. His political agenda was largely to appease his audience rather than engage in any real dialog. I do not support many of his policies. Even so, I saw that he very much is human like the rest of us. I am committed to seeing both his humanness and his divinity, even when I strongly disagree with him. So it was a day filled with surprises. Thank you so much for joining with me in powerfully inviting our leaders to open to creating more love and harmony in the world.** Thank you especially for helping me to open to some deep learning and healing in myself.** I see so clearly that working on healing my own arrogance is one of the biggest contributions I can make towards creating more peace and love in the world. May we all find ways to bring more love and harmony into our own lives, and into the world. I wish you all many, many blessings, and may ever more love and joy pour into all of our lives.

And the truth is, your life is likely to stay that way as long as you feel a need to blame and make yourself or others wrong. Those who choose to be creators look at life quite differently. They know that there are powerful individuals and groups who might like to control their lives, but they don't let this get in the way. They know that they have their weaknesses, yet they don't blame themselves when they fail. **Creators feel no need to blame anyone as they know that whatever happens, they have choice in the matter.** When Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. were put behind bars, they used that opportunity to meditate and pray, to write letters and books, and to inspire their communities to stand up and make a difference in the world. They prayed not only for themselves and their supporters, but even for those who jailed them and despised their work. They were unstoppable, powerful creators who continued to have joy and meaning in their lives until the day they died. Victims relish in anger, revenge, guilt, and other emotions and behaviors that cause others - and even themselves - to feel like victims, too. Creators consciously choose [love, inspiration, empowerment](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#love), and other qualities which inspire not only themselves, but all around them to continually create the lives and world they want to live in. Victims and creators live in the same physical world and deal with many of the same physical realities, yet their experience of life is worlds apart. From the perspective of enjoyment of life, they hardly live in the same world. Yet whether they know it or not, both victim and creator always have choice in each moment to determine the direction of their lives through what they choose to do with what they are given. **In reality, all of us play the victim and all of us play the creator at various points in our lives.** Yet few people realize just how much choice we have in which role we play at any given time. One person, on losing a job or a special relationship, may feel as if it is the end of the world and sink into terrible suffering for months, years, or even a lifetime. Another with the same experience may choose to first experience the grief, yet then accept the loss and in a relatively short amount of time move on to be a powerful creative force in their life. In every moment and every circumstance, we can choose to play an active role in creating our own destiny.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:qualityoflife.txt:1:96be590a1702", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13985, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "qualityoflife.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "qualityoflife", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "special relationship, may feel as if it is the end of the world and sink into terrible suffering for months, years, or even a lifetime.

In every moment and every circumstance, we can choose to play an active role in creating our own destiny. **Choosing to Create a Life Filled With Joy and Meaning** **By choosing to [see and inspire the creator](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#seeing) not only in yourself, but in all you meet, you can create powerful transformation in your life and world. If you have spent a lot of time in victim mode, it may not be easy to make the shift, but it is entirely possible.** By exploring your [core challenges](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue) and working to transform them, and by choosing to stop the need to place blame and instead take responsibility for how you interpret your life, you can make the shift. There will most certainly be times where you slip back into old patterns. But by continually reminding yourself of your intention to be a creator, you can transform your life. None of us is perfect. We all have made and will continue to make mistakes and bad choices in our lives. When we fail, there is no need to blame ourselves or anyone else. We can choose to simply accept that we didn't do what we had intended and then [work to understand why](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#acceptance), so that we might do better the next time. Notice when you find yourself blaming yourself or others. Then stop for a moment. Take a look inside and ask, is it really empowering you to place blame, even if you believe it is very well deserved? Is this really how you want to live, or is there something better and more fulfilling? For those who blame themselves more than others, consider exploring how this serves you. Some are drawn to abusive relationships or habits as a way of unconsciously punishing themselves. Many times deep, unconscious processes are behind this behavior which can be uncovered by setting a strong intention to understand the root causes, and by holding to a deep intention to transform the places which keep you from being a powerful creator. Shifting from victim to creator does not mean shifting the blame from yourself to others, but it may mean getting out of abusive relationships or habits so that you can then move with greater awareness and commitment to create positive transformation in your own life and in those around you. At times in this process, you will look back and realize that you let yourself be the victim again. **Even when you fail at making the shift from victim to creator, you can be gentle with", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:qualityoflife.txt:2:187e1089467e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13986, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "qualityoflife.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "qualityoflife", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "not mean shifting the blame from yourself to others, but it may mean getting out of abusive relationships or habits so that you can then move with greater awareness and commitment to create positive transformation in your own life and in those around you. At times in this process, you will look back and realize that you let yourself be the victim again. **Even when you fail at making the shift from victim to creator, you can be gentle with yourself.** Judging and blaming yourself is just as disempowering as directing it towards others. You can accept and forgive yourself for not following your intention, and then do your best to learn from what happened. And there may even be times when, for whatever reason, you feel a need to play the role of victim for a while. If so, get into it and play the role fully. But remember while doing so that you are choosing this, and that you can just as easily choose to be a creator again as soon as you are ready. There's a time and place for everything. One common trap which easily pulls people into victim mode is attachment. When we are strongly attached to anything, the possibility of suffering and loss is magnified. When the victim loses something to which they are attached, they easily become depressed or angry and blame others or themselves for what happened. When creators realize they had attachment to something lost, they welcome the transformative power of letting go and work to understand and then release the attachment. One of their [key life intentions](https://www.momentoflove.org/lifepurposeintentions) is to experience each precious moment of life to its fullest, without the need for the security provided by attachment. They know that even the most difficult experiences can be powerful teachers for us if we allow them to. By accepting the past and allowing the future to be a great, unknown, infinite potential, creators trust that their dance with each sacred moment of life is a gift. They know that in the long run, every experience can bring more meaning and deeper connection. They understand that storms are a natural part of life which can bring the rain needed for emotional and spiritual growth. **Creators also know that by choosing to [nurture and inspire](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#nurturance) all around them to shift from victim to creator, life becomes better not only for themselves, but for all whose lives they touch. **You can have a fuller, richer life right now by setting a clear intention to transform the victim within, and by inviting and welcoming into your life the powerful creator that you are. **For an excellent, inspiring 15-minute video with a similar message, [click here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/what_matters_w_mitchell) For an empowering essay on transforming your core life challenges, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue) For a highly inspiring online lesson bringing this all home, [click here](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/ttcourse03a)**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:qualityoflife.txt:3:6ac55f8b6507", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13987, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "Quotes__quotes-for-better-life.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "Quotes__quotes-for-better-life", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Quotes for a better life Quotes For a Better Life Profound Quotes to Inspire Your Life **\"Can you look beyond what your eyes are showing you to find and express love and happiness in a world of fear and distress?

If you do not like the reflection life is showing you, then change that which is causing it. When you remember who you are and you know it deep within the core of your being, you will know and recognize your invisible connection to All That Is. And in so doing, joy, thanksgiving, and service will be the natural outpouring result from your grateful heart. **There is a big difference between loving yourself and being selfish. When you truly understand what it is to know and love yourself, you cannot help but to love and serve others.** When you understand this at the core level of your being, you will be on the path Home. Be as a light shining in the darkness. Do not burn others with your light, but rather allow them to be drawn to your light. And be of service to those who come to you willingly. In other words, do not become evangelical with your message, but rather be the enigmatic and loving \"wise old sage\", to whom others are drawn to because of the quality of vibration, rather than the volume of rhetoric. Most importantly, practice that which you preach. Others must be able to see the effect of our Infinite Creator conducting his wonderful work through you. But above all things, keep working upon yourself and keep choosing the positive - being of service to others. Do it not because you feel that you must, but because you desire to. When you work upon yourself and learn to know the creator within you, being of service to others will be natural for you. **There is a simple method to check upon your progress. Despite what appears to being going on in the world around you, how loving and harmonious are your personal relationships? Remember that the world is your mirror. It casts back at you the reflection of that which you have projected into it.** How many arguments do you find yourself engaging in? Is there bitterness and acrimony within the ranks? Do you look at others and think about how you would like to change them? Or do you love them and accept them as they are? **The Infinite Game** All of this (physical life/incarnation) is a very intricate and skillfully designed game, whereby the One Infinite Creator plays the game of forgetting who it is, so that it can learn to remember, and in doing so, experience and know", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:Quotes__quotes-for-better-life.txt:1:32746eba0321", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13989, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "Quotes__quotes-for-better-life.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "Quotes__quotes-for-better-life", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "yourself engaging in?

The goal of the game is to enter into these further divisions of creation, and then seek to harmonize the polarities in order to once again know oneself as the creator of them. Without polarity (derived from free will), there is only the unity of love and light, and no choice to experience \"other than\" that. Satan is a human invention. It is the personification you have given to all the negativity that has existed on this beautiful planet. You didn't know who to blame, and as you could not find it within yourselves to take personal responsibility, Satan was created to absolve yourselves. **If the One Infinite Creator is infinite and has created everything that is, then does the Infinite Creator not reside both within you and within all things?

We are actors playing on the stage of life. This world is all illusion or thought-form. No one really dies, and no one is really hurt. In between incarnations, you know this very well. But the rules of the game ensure that when you incarnate, you must forget who you really are, so that you believe it is all \"real\" whilst you are playing the game of life. Forgetting is an essential prerequisite for you to make choices that help you to grow. Otherwise, the game would be too easy. You only forget who you are during incarnation. The object of the game is to wake up within the dream, and in effect, become a \"lucid gamer\", to remember who you really are during the game, and to then begin working upon the things you came here for. Off stage and between lives as incarnated human beings (zero-point time/antimatter universe), we - all of us and all of you as souls - are great friends, brothers and sisters in the One.

It is to grow, develop, and transform yourself into a more positive and loving being. You had certain goals that you planned to achieve before incarnating here, which is a main reason for the veil of forgetfulness being in place.

Remember that we have said that all thought, word, and deed is creative. You get back what you send out. So when you send out the thought \"Why is she so hard to live with?\" or \"Why is he always behaving like this?\", ask yourself, what exactly are you doing? Now focus here, as this is so obvious you could miss it. And in fact, most do. Take away the question from your sentence and essentially you are saying: \"She is so hard to live with\" and \"He is always behaving like this\". Do you see what you are doing? You have just created the very behaviour in that person that you wish to change simply because you do not understand the law of radiation and attraction. Remember, all thought is creative. **Loving and accepting someone as they are does not mean accepting abusive behavior. But it does mean loving and accepting the person (soul), not their behavior.

That is the difference between conscious and subconscious creation. **Your Truth** **When you persevere and keep working on yourself, gradually it will come to you. And when it does, you must learn to trust in your inner guidance, no matter what others may say. That is the ultimate test - to trust what you know deep inside as your truth, even when the whole world tells you that you are wrong. It is hard work to trust yourself when all those around you doubt you and call you crazy, but it is the job you came here to do. ** Never take what another says to you as \"Truth\". Your purpose here is to find your own truth. Sometimes others can help you to do so by offering guidance, but for their truth to become your truth, it must pass through the test of your discernment. Sit quietly in meditation and ask the Infinite Creator to guide your path. There is no \"wrong\" or \"right\" seen from a higher density, but there are still consequences for every action. Such is the law of karmic effect. Be the strong and courageous soul that deep down you know yourself to be. Do not hide your inner light. Trust yourself, and shine your light into the darkness. Your soul remembers everything you've ever experienced. The only reason you don't remember it all now, is due to what we term the \"veil of forgetfulness\". If you came into each new incarnation with access to your soul memory, there's no point in your coming into space/time. It would be like playing a computer game with all the cheats. You wouldn't learn anything. And it takes the fun out of playing the game. **Remember, always, that this is a beautiful game that we are playing here and co-creating together with our Infinite Creator.

For a two-page summary of his excellent article on the history and hope of new energy sources, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/newenergysources). Naturally available radiant energy is the power source of the future. Until recently, only a handful of researchers have understood how to tap it. For over one hundred years, there have been persistent rumors that a number of brilliant inventors had succeeded. **These included Dr. Nikola Tesla, Dr. T. Henry Moray, Edwin Gray, Sr., and more recently, Paul Baumann in Switzerland. Each reported, and showed hundreds of eyewitnesses, a \"cold\" form of electric power that could be produced with relatively simple equipment. ** This natural energy form can be gathered directly from the environment (mistakenly called \"static\" electricity) or extracted from ordinary electricity by the method called \"fractionation.\" Radiant Energy can perform the same wonders as ordinary electricity, at less than 1% of the cost. It does not behave exactly like electricity, however, which has contributed to the scientific community's misunderstanding of it. **First studied by [Dr. Nikola Tesla](http://www.free-energy.ws/nikola-tesla.html) in 1889, this effect is the primary operating principle of his \"[Magnifying Transmitter](https://www.WantToKnow.info/nikolateslamagnifyingtransmitter).\" **After Tesla was prevented from bringing his World Power System into full manifestation, he worked for years to develop a smaller version of the device that harnessed the same principle. By the 1930's, he had succeeded. This device is what powered his infamous Pierce-Arrow automobile. At about this same time, another brilliant radio engineer, [Dr. Thomas Henry Moray](http://www.free-energy.ws/t-henry-moray.html), also developed a working model of a power source that used no fuel. By 1935, Dr. Moray had perfected this device as a small box that produced 50,000 watts of a cold form of electricity. Hundreds of people witnessed demonstrations of this invention. Both Tesla and Moray referred to the energy in these systems as \"radiant energy.\" Moray's system had no batteries or magnets in it, and apparently gathered the \"radiant energy\" directly from the environment. [Edwin Gray, Sr](http://www.free-energy.ws/edwin-gray.html) rediscovered the technique in the late 1950's and spent 15 years developing working models. Mr. Gray discovered that the discharge of a high voltage capacitor could be shocked into releasing a huge, radiant, electrostatic burst. This energy spike was produced and captured in a special device Mr. Gray called his \"conversion element switching tube.\" The non-shocking, cold form of energy that came out of this \"conversion tube\" powered all of his demonstrations, appliances, and motors, as well as recharged his batteries. Mr. Gray referred to this process as \"splitting the positive.\" **During the 1970's, based on this discovery, Mr. Gray developed an 80 hp electric automobile engine that kept its batteries charged continuously.

Hundreds of people witnessed dozens of demonstrations that Mr. Gray gave in his laboratory. ** Then, in the 1970's, [Paul Baumann](http://www.free-energy.ws/paul-baumann.html) in Switzerland rediscovered the technique again, and started building working models of what is called the \"[Testatika Machine](https://www.WantToKnow.info/methernitatestatika).\" While Mr. Baumann has never officially disclosed the technique, hundreds of eye-witnesses have reported seeing a simple, electrostatic generator that turns itself and produces thousands of watts of a cold form of electricity. The Methernitha Community in Linden, Switzerland currently has 5 or 6 working models of this fuelless, self-running device. **In 2000, after three decades of work, [Dr. Peter Lindemann](http://www.free-energy.ws/peter-lindemann.html) cracked the secret of Edwin Gray's method.** Once the process was understood, the underlying commonality of these other systems became apparent. Dr. Lindemann presented all of this research in a technical lecture in September 2000, and subsequently presented the same material in his book, \"The Free Energy Secrets of Cold Electricity.\" Please follow the above highlighted links which lead to more information on all of these systems. Below are two comments on the video and book, *The Free Energy Secrets of Cold Electricity\",* by Dr. Lindemann, which are available on the PRODUCTS page of his website. More comments can be seen on our REVIEWS page of his website. \"First of all, I must compliment you on your research. You've done an excellent job. From my own experiments, once you split the electron from the etheric carrier, the problem then is not generating tremendous energy, it's limiting it! A lot of my incoming spikes are well over 1000 amps. Definitely, this kind of circuit, it's for real!\" - *Brian Desborough (Free Energy Researcher)* \"Yesterday I received the book and video and stayed up until midnight reading and viewing the video. Based on my armchair science, I agree with your approach to Gray's and Tesla's findings. You do excellent detective work.

Bush when he was Vice President, has written an article boldly exposing what so many carefully avoid. He shows how the press has failed to voice what is know only too well in powerful circles-that **\"Muslims do not hate our freedom, but rather, they hate our policies.\"** It is the US government's lopsided support of Israel and other Middle Eastern regimes considered to be tyrannical which has created much of the animosity in the Arab world towards the US. McGovern gives specific examples of how major media like the *New York Times *have avoided or played down this vital information. The deep roots of the war on terror have yet to be discussed in open public forums. There are many wonderful, good-hearted people in the countries of Israel and the Middle East, just as there are in the US and every country in the world. Let us not neglect, however, to work towards changing the policies of any country which serves the interests of the elite at the expense of everyone else. Thanks for caring and you have a great day!

McGovern is on the Steering Group of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS).* Sunday 05 December 2004 Last Thursday's conference on \"Al Qaeda 2.0: Transnational Terrorism After 9/11,\" sponsored by the New America Foundation and the New York University Center on Law & Security, was a valuable gift to those wanting an update on informed opinion on the subject. The event proved to be as highly instructive for what was not addressed, though, as for the issues that were. **The elephants known to be present remained largely unacknowledged.** **The cavernous Caucus Room of the Russell Senate Office Building was full to the gunnels.** Panel after panel of distinguished presenters from near and far, from right and left - including authors Peter Bergen, Michael Scheuer, Jessica Stern and Col. Pat Lang - exuded and freely shared their expertise. But there was myopia as well. The mosquitos of terrorism were dissected and examined as carefully as biology students once did drosophila, but typing the generic DNA of terrorism proved more elusive.

Pat Lang - exuded and freely shared their expertise. But there was myopia as well. The mosquitos of terrorism were dissected and examined as carefully as biology students once did drosophila, but typing the generic DNA of terrorism proved more elusive. Worse, no attention was given to the swamp in which terrorists breed. Were it not for a few impertinent questions from the audience evoking a pungent smell, the swamps might have eluded attention altogether. The first panel featured two experts from RAND, both of whom touched only in passing - and quite gingerly - on the need to drain the swamp. The first closed his remarks with a 30-second peroration in which he observed that less attention might be given to kill/capture metrics in favor of addressing the causes of terrorism and breaking the cycle of terrorist recruitment. The second speaker from RAND, referring to that organization's numerous studies on influencing public opinion, closed his remarks with this: \"When the message coheres with the context in which the message is transmitted, it works.\" Sending out the right message during the Cold War was easier, he said, because the context (the United States being the only alternative to the USSR) was very clear. On terrorism, he added, we need to ponder \"the mismatch between context and message.\" **What About The Elephants?** Then came a rude question from the audience: Is it not striking that even in an academic-type setting like this, elephants must remain invisible? Is it not ironic, that a panel of the U.S. Defense Science Board, in an unclassified study on \"Strategic Communication,\" completed on September 23 but kept under wraps until after the November 2 election, let the pachyderms out of the bag? **Directly contradicting the president, the DSB panel gave voice to what virtually all who were sitting in that ornate Senate Caucus Room knew, but were afraid to say. It named the elephants.** **\"Muslims do not 'hate our freedom,' but rather, they hate our policies.** The overwhelming majority voice their objections to what they see as one-sided support in favor of Israel and against Palestinian rights, and the longstanding, even increasing support for what Muslims collectively see as tyrannies, most notably Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Pakistan, and the Gulf States. Thus, when American public diplomacy talks about bringing democracy to Islamic societies, this is seen as no more than self-serving hypocrisy.\" \"...Nor can the most carefully crafted messages, themes, and words persuade when the messenger lacks credibility.\" **U.S. Support For Israel \"Immutable\"** Another questioner pressed RAND's expert on mismatch-context-message, asking, \"What can we do to change the context?\" In answer **the expert acknowledged that the United States has a \"bad reputation\" but insisted that this is \"unavoidable\" because, for example, U.S. support for Israel is \"immutable.\"** **The United States is also connected to what many Muslims consider \"apostate\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:raymcgoverncia.txt:1:093e61988580", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13997, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "raymcgoverncia.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "raymcgoverncia", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "than self-serving hypocrisy.\" \"...Nor can the most carefully crafted messages, themes, and words persuade when the messenger lacks credibility.\" **U.S. Support For Israel \"Immutable\"** Another questioner pressed RAND's expert on mismatch-context-message, asking, \"What can we do to change the context?\" In answer **the expert acknowledged that the United States has a \"bad reputation\" but insisted that this is \"unavoidable\" because, for example, U.S. support for Israel is \"immutable.\"** **The United States is also connected to what many Muslims consider \"apostate\" regimes, but it is difficult to escape what binds us, because the U.S. needs their \"tactical support.\" (Read: oil; military bases; intelligence.)** There was some wincing and squirming in the audience, but in the end it was left to aptly named Marc Sageman, a forensic psychiatrist, former CIA case officer, and author of the book Understanding Terror Networks (published earlier this year), to state the obvious on Israel and Iraq. Putting it even more bluntly that the Defense Science Board panel, he asserted: ** \"We are seen as a hypocritical bully in the Middle East and we have to stop!\"** Now why should that be so hard to say, I asked myself. And I was reminded of a frequent, unnerving experience I had while on the lecture circuit in recent months. Almost invariably, someone in the audience would approach me after the talk and ensuing discussion, and congratulate me on my \"courage\" in naming Israel as a factor in discussing the war in Iraq and the struggle against terrorism. I don't get it. Since when did it take uncommon courage to state simply, without fear or favor, the conclusions that fall out of one's analysis? Since when did it become an exceptional thing to tell it like it is? **Taking The Heat On Israel** I thought of the debate I had on Iraq with arch-neoconservative and former CIA Director James Woolsey on PBS' Charlie Rose Show on August 20, when I broke the taboo on mentioning Israel and was immediately branded \"anti-Semitic\" by Woolsey. Reflecting later on his accusation, it seemed almost OK since it was so blatantly ad hominem. And his attack was all the more transparent, coming from the self-described \"anchor of the Presbyterian wing of JINSA\" - the Jewish Institute of National Security Affairs, a strong advocate of war to eliminate all perceived enemies of Israel - like Iraq. In the ensuing days, a flood of e-mail reached me from all over the country - some of it repeating Woolsey's charge, but most of it warmly congratulating me on my \"courage.\" I still don't fully understand. And that was my candid answer to the question I dreaded - the one that so often came up during the Q and A sessions following my presentations: **Why is it that the state of Israel has such pervasive influence over our body politic?** No one denied that it does; most", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:raymcgoverncia.txt:2:1116308e7a1c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13998, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "raymcgoverncia.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "raymcgoverncia", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "reached me from all over the country - some of it repeating Woolsey's charge, but most of it warmly congratulating me on my \"courage.\" I still don't fully understand. And that was my candid answer to the question I dreaded - the one that so often came up during the Q and A sessions following my presentations: **Why is it that the state of Israel has such pervasive influence over our body politic?** No one denied that it does; most seemed genuinely puzzled as to why. My embarrassment at my inability to answer the question is attenuated by the solace I take in the thought that I am in good company. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, National Security Adviser to President George H. W. Bush and now chair of his son's President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, has been known to speak out on key issues when his patience is exhausted. Remember how, for example, before the attack on Iraq, he described the evidence of ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda as \"scant\" when Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was calling it \"bulletproof?\" Well, it sounds like he has again run out of patience. Scowcroft recently told the Financial Times that George W. Bush is \"mesmerized\" by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. \"Sharon just has him wrapped around his little finger,\" Scowcroft is quoted as saying. Scowcroft and I apparently have less at risk than those working for RAND...or for the New York Times, which gives off the aroma of being similarly mesmerized and intimidated. This shows through with amazing regularity; I'll adduce but two recent examples: ** Times Timing...** To its credit, the *New York Times* on November 24 published a story by *Times* reporter Thom Shanker on the findings of the Defense Science Board panel report given to Defense Secretary Rumsfeld on September 23. But **why was the story two months late?** And the urban legend that it was the *Times* that broke the story is not true, even though the *Washington Post's* somnolent ombudsman, Michael Getler \"confirms that legend in his column this morning. (Noting that the story \"didn't appear in the *Post*,\" Getler implies that it should have, because \"it goes to the heart of both the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq and it raises many crucial issues that don't get probed deeply enough by news organizations, in my opinion.\") It was not the *Times* on November 24, but rather Reasononline's Matt Welch, who broke the story. On November 15 Welch wrote an account of the panel's report in which he referred to its recommendations as having already been \"made public.\" Were reporters from the mainstream press again asleep? Do they feed only on the thin gruel of approved Pentagon handouts? It is easy to understand that the Defense Department had no incentive to advertise the DSB panel's embarrassing and potentially explosive findings. (How often have we", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:raymcgoverncia.txt:3:dff9807fff7f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13999, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "raymcgoverncia.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "raymcgoverncia", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "24, but rather Reasononline's Matt Welch, who broke the story. On November 15 Welch wrote an account of the panel's report in which he referred to its recommendations as having already been \"made public.\" Were reporters from the mainstream press again asleep? Do they feed only on the thin gruel of approved Pentagon handouts? It is easy to understand that the Defense Department had no incentive to advertise the DSB panel's embarrassing and potentially explosive findings. (How often have we seen a Pentagon-sponsored report contradicting a sitting president on a matter of such significance - and before a crucial election?) It is not so easy to grasp why the media missed or ignored the story. Or perhaps it is. Maybe the clue is in the timing. I gave a long interview on US intelligence matters to another *Times* reporter a few weeks before the election and at the conclusion of the interview I commented that I certainly hoped his story would appear before November 2. This reporter turned out to be as candid as he was embarrassed. No, he confessed, **his superiors at the *****Times***** had made it clear that there was an embargo on criticism of the administration of the kind I had offered until after the election.** I expressed amazement that the *New York Times* - once courageous publisher of the Pentagon Papers that helped bring an end to our last ill-conceived war - would allow itself to be so intimidated. He replied, with undisguised embarrassment, that this is simply the way it is today. Again, I find myself wondering how long the *Times* sat on the material reported by Shanker. Did it have the story before November 2? What does it mean that the *Times* published Shanker's report only after a decent post-election interval? Also interesting is the date ultimately chosen to run it - the day before Thanksgiving, a very poor time to attract the attention such a story might otherwise evoke. Yet another sign of wimpish desire to pander to administration preferences? **...and Times Surgery** Of equal interest is how the *Times* abridged the story itself. Shanker did quote from the key paragraph beginning with \"Muslims do not 'hate our freedom'\" (quoted in full above). But **he or his editors deliberately cut out the next sentence about what Muslims do object to; i.e., U.S. \"one-sided support in favor of Israel and against Palestinian rights,\" and support for tyrannical regimes.** The *Times* did include the sentence that immediately followed the omitted one. In other words, the offending middle sentence was surgically removed from the paragraph like a malignant tumor. **Editing Bin Laden, As Well** Similarly creative editing showed through the *Times'* reporting on Osama Bin Laden's videotaped speech in late October. Several paragraphs of the story made it onto page one, but **the *****Times***** saw to it that the key point Bin Laden made toward the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:raymcgoverncia.txt:4:d0a449208012", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14000, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "raymcgoverncia.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "raymcgoverncia", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "support for tyrannical regimes.** The *Times* did include the sentence that immediately followed the omitted one.

Several paragraphs of the story made it onto page one, but **the *****Times***** saw to it that the key point Bin Laden made toward the beginning of his remarks was relegated to paragraphs 23 to 25 at the very bottom of page nine. Buried there, dwarfed by a large ad for Bloomingdales, was Bin Laden's revealing claim that the idea for 9/11 first germinated after \"we witnessed the oppression and tyranny of the American-Israeli coalition against our people in Palestine and Lebanon.\"** If, as suggested earlier, one were to look for \"context,\" precious little is provided by the *Times*. A \"newspaper of record\" might have noted that even the risk-averse 9/11 commissioners pointed out on page 147 of the Commission Report that **Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, mastermind and executioner of the 9/11 attacks, was motivated by \"his violent disagreement with U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel**.\" Was that not news fit to print? **Four More Years** With the mainstream media co-opted, and four-year older but familiar national security faces in place for the president's second term, it is a safe bet we are in for the same inept, misguided policies - only more so. Sadly, Secretary of State Colin Powell's relatively moderate views had little visible impact on policy decisions. Still, when he is gone the president's circle of advisers will have an even shorter diameter. And it is highly unlikely that Powell's designated successor, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, will be any more astute than in the past in seeking counsel from experienced statesmen like her former patron, Gen. Scowcroft. Foreign leaders are aghast...and have been for years. In August 2002, British senior Labor backbencher Gerald Kaufman, a former shadow foreign secretary, warned that the \"hawks\" in the U.S. administration were giving the president poor advice: \"Bush, himself the most intellectually backward American president in my lifetime, is surrounded by advisers whose bellicosity is exceeded only by their political, military and diplomatic illiteracy. Pity the man who relies on Rumsfeld, Cheney and Rice for counsel.\" **Shrinking Circle** On the afternoon of February 5, 2003, after Secretary of State Colin Powell made his embarrassingly memorable speech at the UN, my colleagues and I of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) drafted and sent a short memorandum to the president, which concluded with this observation: \"After watching Secretary Powell today, we are convinced that you would be well served if you widened the discussion beyond... the circle of those advisers clearly bent on a war for which we see no compelling reason and from which we believe the unintended consequences", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:raymcgoverncia.txt:5:6b2b5db640e7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14001, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "raymcgoverncia.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "raymcgoverncia", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "Colin Powell made his embarrassingly memorable speech at the UN, my colleagues and I of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) drafted and sent a short memorandum to the president, which concluded with this observation: \"After watching Secretary Powell today, we are convinced that you would be well served if you widened the discussion beyond... the circle of those advisers clearly bent on a war for which we see no compelling reason and from which we believe the unintended consequences are likely to be catastrophic.\" Instead, the circle has been squeezed still tighter - as with wagons. And those widely known in Washington as \"the crazies\" when they were middle-level officials and the president's father was in the White House are now even more firmly ensconced. They remain in charge of things like war - the very same folks who brought us the \"cakewalk\" that became war in Iraq.

It is the best article I've seen in describing the sad realities of war.

Our major newspapers are owned by the power elite, who derive great financial benefit from war. Very few people actually like war, yet so many accept it as a necessary evil. Most people are unaware that it is often the power elite who fan the flames of war, and sometimes even create the pretext for them (see [www.WantToKnow.info/010501operationnorthwoods](https://www.WantToKnow.info/010501operationnorthwoods)), as they profit by selling weapons to both sides both overtly and covertly.

SFC A. was lying 15 feet away on the other side of the bunker with two medics over him desperately trying to get either a pulse or a breath. The man who asked after SFC A. was himself bleeding from two gut wounds and rasping as he tried to talk with a collapsed lung. One of them made it; one did not. \"I've run for cover as fast as I've ever run - I'll hear the bass percussion thump of mortar rounds and rockets exploding as long as I live.

Defense intelligence agency use of psychic spying [helped locate American hostages](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-up-close-personal-with-remote-viewer), enemy submarines, and strategic buildings in foreign countries [using only their mind](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--secret-history-military-paranormal-science) to do so. Under [Project Grill Flame](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-cia-files-reveal-how-us-used-psychics-spy-iran), US intelligence agencies had a whole squad of military-trained psychics using ESP to monitor the dozens of American diplomats taken hostage by revolutionary students who seized the U.S. Embassy in Iran in 1979. **[The CIA even used a remote viewer to \"see\" what was on Mars one million years ago](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf). What the remote viewer described was quite mind-blowing.** It's been estimated that US government use of psychics and ESPs resulted in [26,000 telepathic campaigns carried out by 227 psychics](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article131827589.html) before these programs were shut down in 1995. One case where psychic spies say they played a critical role was in 1989. Charles Jordan was a US Customs agent gone bad, a dangerous fugitive who had eluded police for 2 years. **The collective wisdom at the time was that he was probably in the Caribbean. [One psychic spy] started describing him in North Wyoming ... at a campground. Using this and other information, Jordan was finally caught.** - Excerpt from \"[Psychic Spies: Project Stargate](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-psychic-spies-project-stargate),\" ABC Nightline Remote viewing involves a set of precise protocols used by the U.S. military and CIA to develop psychic spies. As bizarre as it may seem, through remote viewing and other secret projects, the U.S. has dabbled in ESP and the psychic realm for many decades. Though documents and details of remote viewing projects were officially classified secret until 1995, documents now declassified show the first government-sponsored remote viewing program was approved in 1970. **[Remote viewing](http://www.fas.org/irp/program/collect/stargate.htm) is a technique whereby trained individuals enter into a meditative state to access subtle levels of consciousness in which they are able to sense remote locations and describe what they see there, sometimes with a remarkable degree of accuracy.** The ability to view objects remotely has clear advantages for intelligence gathering. A good example of how this is done can be seen in the four-minute news clip on remote viewing at the link below. [**www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/remote_viewing_helicopter_video**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/remote_viewing_helicopter_video) For a more detailed description of remote viewing and how it is accomplished, see the excellent explanation on the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:remoteviewing__remote-viewing.txt:0:5f20f8258e09", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14013, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "remoteviewing__remote-viewing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "remoteviewing__remote-viewing", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "levels of consciousness in which they are able to sense remote locations and describe what they see there, sometimes with a remarkable degree of accuracy.** The ability to view objects remotely has clear advantages for intelligence gathering.

Think of the possibilities if anyone were able to develop remote viewing abilities. If you lost your car keys, you might be able to then find them. An abducted child or stolen car could be found. And if remote viewing is possible, what other psychic abilities might also be accessible to us all? **Could it be that our consciousness has much more power than we might have imagined, and that life is far grander than most would ever suspect?** **Is Remote Viewing Real? ** If you research remote viewing in any depth, besides finding excellent information supporting this exciting phenomenon, you will also likely encounter numerous statements like that of the [wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing) on the subject which claim that \"the [remote viewing] program was terminated in 1995 after it failed to produce any useful intelligence information.\" **Government disinformation campaigns don't want us to believe that remote viewing was successful, despite the fact that their own declassified documents show without a doubt the amazing results of some top remote viewers.** Many remote viewers involved in these secret programs have also gone public stating that the program was a mind-boggling success. For a nine-page sample from one declassified remote viewing document which shows amazing accuracy in a remote viewing experiment conducted from a submarine, read the October 1978 document [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/remoteviewing/remote-viewing-submersible-1978.pdf). This sample comes from an excellent 118-page declassified document summarizing the results of the entire remote viewing program to that date. For the entire summary report, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/remoteviewing/11222-Advanced-threat-technique-assessment.pdf). The conclusions section on page 70 of this report contains the quote: With experienced subjects, the accuracy and reliability of the phenomenon can also be characterized roughly by a two-thirds factor. That is, approximately two-thirds of a given transcript about a given site is correct, roughly two-thirds of a series of transcripts can be blind-matched by a judge to the correct target out of a list, etc. Note that the remote viewers are simply handed a blank sheet of paper and given the coordinates of a target location for which they have no knowledge.

Remote viewing of a secret Russian crane by Pat Price (actual crane on left) **Remote Viewing Documents Declassified** Kept top secret for \"national security\" reasons, hundreds of thousands of pages of remote viewing documents were carefully stored away as the nation's remote viewers gradually refined their ability to produce drawings of what they saw at a distant location. Finally in 1995, a small percentage of these documents were released to the public through the FOIA (Freedom of Information Act), proving the existence of the program. Even this small percentage released amounts to nearly 100,000 pages of official remote viewing documents. Unfortunately, the documents were released in a completely random form. Yet thanks to the tireless efforts of a courageous researcher in cataloging this invaluable cache, they are now available in a cataloged and searchable form. To order one or more CDs from a seven-CD set of all these documents now arranged and searchable, [click here](http://stargate-interactive.com/buy.html).

These declassified documents, the experiences of the remote viewers described below, and so much more show that **just as the U.S. government officially denied the existence of the remote viewing program for decades, current claims that the program was ineffective are almost certainly disinformation.** Could it be that those in power don't want us to know just how powerful our minds are? **The Remote Viewers** Joseph McMoneagle is the respected man considered by many to be the best military remote viewer. He has written an incredibly engaging autobiography, [*Stargate Chronicles*](http://www.amazon.com/Stargate-Chronicles-Joseph-McMoneagle/dp/1571742255/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1369197488&sr=1-1&keywords=stargate+chronicles), going into great detail about his rich experiences in the program and his amazing successes even in real operational environments with accurately finding and describing incredibly important targets. A [*Washington Post*article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-up-close-personal-with-remote-viewer) also describes McMoneagle's amazing talent. The most famous of all remote viewers was a flamboyant civilian by the name of Ingo Swann.

Swann authored or co-authored over a dozen books, which you can find at [this link](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=la_B000APW4TU_sr?sort=relevance&search-alias=books&field-author=Ingo+Swann). Yet when he presented his autobiography titled *Penetration* to his publisher, the publisher refused, so he published the book himself. Yet all copies that he published seemed to strangely disappear from bookshelves in very short order. Thankfully, it is now [easily available online](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=penetration+ingo+swann&crid=DFAE6FRLIB5S). If you want to know some of the deepest secrets of the U.S. government, this is the book. **Remote Viewing Background, Military Supporters, and Documentaries** The original impetus for U.S. remote viewing programs was the discovery by military and intelligence services in the 1960s that the Soviets were spending millions of dollars and having considerable success in using ESP and psychic spies to break through U.S. security barriers. Not wanting to be left behind in any spying or intelligence capability, no matter how exotic, top government officials [contracted in 1972 with SRI](http://www.fas.org/irp/program/collect/stargate.htm) (Stanford Research Institute) to develop the first of several remote viewing programs which operated under code names such as Project Scanate, Project Grill Flame, and the [Stargate Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project). BBC in 1983 made a fascinating documentary focused largely on remote viewing titled \"The Case For ESP.\" The full 90-minute documentary is available at the link below. [**https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/i/esp-case-bbc-1983**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/i/esp-case-bbc-1983) ** CIA Director [Admiral Stansfield Turner](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/directors-and-deputy-directors-of-central-intelligence/turner.html) and several top generals eventually became strong supporters of the remote viewing program as an effective means to develop psychic spies.** Though the official existence of this project was kept secret and even denied until 1995, millions of dollars were poured into what became a major government undertaking using both military and civilian personnel. Through these remote viewing programs, a set of scientifically based protocols were developed by which many people, *even those without prior psychic abilities,* were able to describe remote objects with some accuracy.

Could it be that we all naturally have psychic abilities which can be explained scientifically that we have not developed simply because we didn't know the possibility exists? Could it be that certain elements of the [power elite](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) of our world don't want us to know just how powerful each one of us is, so that we continue to believe that they are the ones with power?

You will often see them credited in newspapers under the headlines of national and international stories. The global managing editor of Reuters just recently stated that \"the US military is entirely to blame for the deaths of three of its employees in Iraq.\" Though the major Australian newspapers have all reported this huge news, not surprisingly the US press hasn't touched it. The below article is from Australia's ABC network (see link below). Please help to build a better world by spreading this important information. with very best wishes, Fred Burks for the WantToKnow.info team [http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200411/s1247425.htm](http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200411/s1247425.htm) US military blamed for media deaths in Iraq The global managing editor of news provider Reuters says the US military is entirely to blame for the deaths of three of its employees in Iraq since the start of the war there in March 2003. \"All of them were killed by the American army,\" Reuters chief David Schlesinger told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in the southern Portuguese resort of Vilamoura, national news agency Lusa reported. \"There is no understanding on the part of the US military regarding the exercise of journalism,\" the agency quoted him as saying. \"We can't run the risk that journalists will become targets [in Iraq]. We must learn the lessons from these tragic cases.\" Two Reuters photographers and a cameraman are among the more than 60 war-related deaths of media workers recorded in Iraq. The most recent death occurred in the Iraqi city of Ramadi on November 1. The US military says a cameraman killed there while on assignment for Reuters died in a gun battle between marines and insurgents. But the Iraqi man's colleagues and family have said they believe he was shot by a US sniper. Another Reuters cameraman, a Ukrainian citizen, was killed in April 2003 when a US Army tank fired on the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad. A cameraman from Spain's Telecinco television network was also killed in the strike, which injured three other reporters. In October 2003, a Palestinian cameraman for Reuters was killed near Abu Ghraib prison during a shootout. The US military has denied direct responsibility for those deaths as well. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told the conference via satellite from Washington that those types of incidents were inevitable in a war. \"Media coverage in places of conflict is always dangerous,\" Lusa quoted him as saying. He put the blame for the two deaths at the Palestine Hotel on Iraqi troops resisting the US invasion.

Yet two days after it was aired, that revealing news video was strangely [removed from the CBS website](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-reality-check-pizzagate-fake-news-see-important-note) and replaced by a report on fake news about Donald Trump. This disappearance of a key news story and the undeniable evidence below suggests Pizzagate is a huge story that someone doesn't want you to know about. Note that the pedophilia issue has nothing to do with political affiliation. Though Pizzagate involves mostly high level Democrats, many Republicans have been convicted of child abuse. The most prominent case - which got very little press - was the conviction of Republican Dennis Hastert, who served as the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, one of the most powerful political positions in the Unites States. Hastert was [sent to prison](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/27/ex-speaker-dennis-hastert-faces-sentencing-chicago/83584440/) by a judge who called him a \"serial child molester.\" He also happens to be [friends with Tony Podesta](https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488), one of the [key players](https://web.archive.org/web/20190226183408/https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1454903) in Pizzagate. Pizzagate originated from the Wikileaks release of [thousands of emails](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/press-release) from John Podesta in October and November of 2016. Podesta served both as chief of staff for Bill Clinton in the White House and campaign manager for Hillary Clinton. The Pizzagate story got its name from a number of [strange usages of the word pizza](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/23561) in the released emails. Yet **the most powerful evidence of something serious involving Pizzagate can be found in the archived Instagram account of James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong Pizza in Washington, DC. ** **James Alefantis** Alefantis with Tony Podesta in Podesta's home Alefantis is connected with John Podesta, as evidenced by [this email exchange](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/19967) released by Wikileaks in which Podesta agrees to have dinner with him. Alefantis is also friends with John Podesta's [lobbyist brother Tony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Podesta), who was [named by GQ magazine](http://www.gq.com/gallery/50-most-powerful-people-in-washington-dc#23) as one of the 50 most powerful people in Washington, DC (he's #23). John Podesta did not make that list, by the way, yet strangely, James Alefantis [was included in this list](http://www.gq.com/gallery/50-most-powerful-people-in-washington-dc#49) (#49) of the 50 most powerful people in Washington. **All but a handful of the 50 people listed on GQ's list are deeply involved in politics or the media, and many are household names.

To explore this question, take a look at the archived Instagram account of Alefantis, who goes by the username \"jimmycomet.\" Shortly after the Pizzagate story exploded on the Internet, he made his account private, but it is still available in the archives at the link below. But warning, be prepared for some very disturbing images, some of which are very sexually suggestive. **[https://archive.fo/CiDXD](https://archive.fo/CiDXD)** If the above link fails, [click here](https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabuse/james-alefantis-instagram). For those who choose not to explore this link, here are three non-explicit images from the account to give an idea of this unusual material. The side comments are quite revealing. Please note that the photo of Obama playing ping pong with a child is not meant to implicate Obama in this, though it does appear from the comments that Alefantis managed to get invited to a White House Christmas party. These three images alone are enough to raise alarm bells. And if you look at all the images in Alefantis' account at the link above, over half of them either are sexually suggestive, involve children, involve S&M, or some combination of the above. Several of them explicitly link sex to pizza, which is where the term Pizzagate comes from. One image is a poster promoting the film Lolita with an image of a vagina. For those who don't know, [Lolita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita) was all about a man carrying on a sexual relationship with a 12-year-old girl. **Notice in the last image above Alefantis gives the definition of a chicken lover as \"an adult male homosexual sexually attracted to underage males.\"** He is openly gay. David Brock, the gay [founder of the popular website Media Matters](http://nymag.com/news/media/david-brock-media-matters-2011-5/), paid $850,000 in hush money when he started dating Alefantis (as reported in [this Fox News article](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/02/27/media-matters-boss-paid-former-partner-850g-blackmail-settlement.html)) to keep his previous lover quiet. What was Brock trying to hush? From his Instagram account, it is clear Alefantis has an obsession with sex and with children. Many of the images and comments are highly suggestive of sex with children. Based on all of this, here is a theory certainly worth exploring: Could the reason Alefantis is listed among the 50 most powerful people in the capital city of the United States be that he is running a child sex ring which serves the powerful elite. And are some of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:s__pizzagate-debunk-debunkers.txt:1:6790b4b06183", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14051, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "s__pizzagate-debunk-debunkers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "s__pizzagate-debunk-debunkers", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "hush?

And are some of the strange references to pizza both in the comments of Alefantis in his Instagram account and in a number of the leaked Podesta emails actually a code word for child sex? Another important question is why is the media debunking this, and why was the one CBS report that did come out removed and replaced in very short order? **The Podesta Brothers** Now take a look at Alefantis' powerful friend Tony Podesta and his interest in sexual art. Here are key quotes from a Sept. 23, 2004 [*Washington Post*article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2004/09/23/married-with-art/dee9a0d0-0f0d-4505-b0ef-2f0e1bd1e0e0/) on Tony's strange art tastes: Podesta is counted among the nation's most important contemporary art collectors. Inside the elite Chelsea galleries, he and his wife, Heather, are gossiped about. All the art stars know their names. In Washington, the couple is recognized, too. **Podesta, 60, has ridden a long career on Capitol Hill to his current perch as a top-tier lobbyist. **He spearheaded President Clinton's successful 1996 Pennsylvania campaign. Tony favors art with in-your-face nudity and social critique. A piece in [his] Woodley Park living room [is a] nearly eight-foot-tall color photo. [It's] an update of a late-15th-century painting of the dead Jesus [which] replicates the original ... in vivid color and minute detail [minus] the shroud, displaying his subject in all his nakedness. \"You've got to be pretty secure to have an eight-foot-tall naked man in your living room in Washington, D.C.,\" Heather says. Tony's younger brother John (yes, that John, Bill Clinton's former chief of staff) admires his choices. **Folks attending a house tour ... earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents' suburban homes. \"They were horrified,\" Heather recalls, a grin spreading across her face.** Another example of Podesta's most unusual taste in art is mentioned in [this wikileaks email](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893) from artist Marina Abramovic to Tony Podesta, where she says: Dear Tony, I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place.

All my love, Marina Abramovic on cover of [*Dust*magazine](http://dustmagazine.com/onlineshop/index.php/product/dust-issue-4-out-out/) What is Spirit Cooking, you might ask?

Abramovic shot a video of this most strange form of art, which you can watch on [this webpage](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/s/marina-abramovic-spirit-cooking). However, viewer beware! The video is quite disturbing even though it only uses fake blood. **In one part of the video, Abramovic paints these words on the wall: \"With a sharp knife, cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand. Eat the pain.\" In another part, she pours fake blood over child-sized statues.** If you don't have the stomach for the video, you can get an idea by doing a search of Google images using \"Marina abramovic spirit cooking\" or simply [click here](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&safe=off&biw=1130&bih=776&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=Marina+abramovic+spirit+cooking&oq=Marina+abramovic+spirit+cooking). Why were the Podesta brothers invited to join her in this Spirit Cooking? Is it just art? Another example of the bizarre art work of Abramovic is also optional here because it is quite graphic and involves nudity.

[Embed from Getty Images](https://www.WantToKnow.info/s/abramovic-gaga-corpse.jpg) [**Note:** Since this article was posted, almost all of the disturbing Devil's Heaven photos of Lady Gaga and Abramovic with the bloodied corpse appear to have been removed from the Internet. For an example take a look at [this MTV page](https://web.archive.org/web/20161109191930/http://www.mtv.com/news/2304931/lady-gaga-devils-heaven-hamptons-photo/). Why doesn't someone want us to see these?] Is this evidence from Pizzagate proof the Podesta brothers and Comet Ping Pong Pizza owner James Alefantis are involved in child sexual abuse or a high-level child sex trafficking ring? No. But **there is enough solid, disturbing evidence here to demonstrate without doubt that these people at the least have a strange and disturbing obsession with sexually explicit art and images sexualizing children. The fact that Alefantis is listed among the 50 most powerful people in Washington would also suggest he is doing something major to draw the attention of Washington's elite. ** Once again, the question arises, why has the media has come down so hard debunking any reports of this? Certainly the evidence is disturbing, but don't blood and guts often lead in the news? **Other Major Cases of Pedophilia** **Pizzagate is but one of many cases where events with reliable, verifiable evidence of child prostitution rings at high levels have been reported and then repressed and debunked.** For undeniable evidence of powerful child prostitution rings leading to the highest levels of of the U.S. government, watch the suppressed Discovery Channel documentary \"[Conspiracy of Silence](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence).\" An excellent segment by Australia's \"60-Minutes\" team \"[Spies, Lords and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:s__pizzagate-debunk-debunkers.txt:3:68f68b488221", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14053, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "s__pizzagate-debunk-debunkers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "s__pizzagate-debunk-debunkers", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "but don't blood and guts often lead in the news? **Other Major Cases of Pedophilia** **Pizzagate is but one of many cases where events with reliable, verifiable evidence of child prostitution rings at high levels have been reported and then repressed and debunked.** For undeniable evidence of powerful child prostitution rings leading to the highest levels of of the U.S. government, watch the suppressed Discovery Channel documentary \"[Conspiracy of Silence](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence).\" An excellent segment by Australia's \"60-Minutes\" team \"[Spies, Lords and Predators](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/pedophile-politicians-ring-uk)\" also covers a pedophile ring in the U.K. which reaches to the highest levels of government. Then there are the many major media reports, such as a [*New York Times*article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-review-open-secret-spotlights-child-sexual-abuse-hollywood) on child sex abuse in Hollywood, this [CNN report](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-massive-pentagon-child-pornography-accusations-not-investigated) covering massive Pentagon child pornography accusations, a [Reuters article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-britain-shocked-growing-soccer-child-abuse-scandal) titled \"Britain shocked by growing soccer child abuse scandal,\" a [*Forbes*article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-government-workers-with-ties-child-porn) titled \"Government Workers With Ties to Child Porn,\" a [BBC report](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-jimmy-savile-abuse-number-alleged-victims-reaches-450) on the huge scandal around popular U.K. TV personality [Jimmy Savile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile) who abused over 450 victims, and much more [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/sexabusescandalsnewsarticles). If you want to know more and choose to research Pizzagate on the Internet, you'll find a huge amount of material and lots more evidence suggesting the possibility of major child pedophile rings reaching the highest levels. You'll also find lots of major media debunking of solid evidence. Yet you'll also find a lot of people jumping to conclusions based on questionable evidence. It's important to be discerning and check the sources of all information for reliability and verifiability. As you consider these disturbing matters, let's not forget the power of sexuality to compromise almost anyone. Where have each of us in our lives been inappropriate or treated ourselves or others badly in sexual ways? As we do our best to expose and stop sexual abuse out in the world, let us also do our best to reach ever higher levels of integrity in our own sexuality.

I was just a kid. I remember tearing across town on my bike to visit her on the day my big sister dropped the bomb: \"There is no Santa Claus,\" jeered my sister. \"Even dummies know that!\" My grandma was not the gushy kind, never had been. I fled to her that day because I knew she would be straight with me. I knew Grandma always told the truth, and I knew that the truth always went down a whole lot easier when swallowed with one of her world-famous cinnamon buns. Grandma was home, and the buns were still warm. Between bites, I told her everything. She was ready for me. \"No Santa Claus!\" she snorted. \"Ridiculous! Don't believe it. That rumor has been going around for years, and it makes me mad, plain mad. Now, put on your coat, and let's go.\" \"Go? Go where, Grandma?\" I asked. I hadn't even finished my second cinnamon bun. \"Where\" turned out to be Kerby's General Store, the one store in town that had a little bit of just about everything. As we walked through its doors, Grandma handed me ten dollars. That was a bundle in those days. \"Take this money,\" she said, \"and buy something for someone who needs it. I'll wait for you in the car.\" Then she turned and walked out of Kerby's. I was only eight years old. I'd often gone shopping with my mother, but never had I shopped for anything all by myself. The store seemed big and crowded, full of people scrambling to finish their Christmas shopping. For a few moments I just stood there, confused, clutching that ten-dollar bill, wondering what to buy, and who on earth to buy it for. I thought of everybody I knew: my family, my friends, my neighbors, the kids at school, the people who went to my church. I was just about thought out, when I suddenly thought of Bobbie Decker. He was a kid with bad breath and messy hair, and he sat right behind me in Mrs. Pollock's grade-two class. Bobbie Decker didn't have a coat. I knew that because he never went out for recess during the winter. His mother always wrote a note, telling the teacher that he had a cough; but all we kids knew that Bobbie Decker didn't have a cough, and he didn't have a coat. I fingered the ten-dollar bill with growing excitement. I would buy Bobbie Decker a coat. I settled on a red corduroy one that had a hood to it. It looked real warm, and he would like that. I didn't see a price tag, but ten dollars ought to buy anything. I put the coat and my ten-dollar bill on the counter and pushed them toward the lady behind it.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:santasteam.txt:0:0709f8e3c310", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14056, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "santasteam.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "santasteam", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Decker didn't have a cough, and he didn't have a coat.

She looked at the coat, the money, and me. \"Is this a Christmas present for someone?\" she asked kindly. \"Yes,\" I replied shyly. \"It's ... for Bobbie. He's in my class, and he doesn't have a coat.\" The nice lady smiled at me. I didn't get any change, but she put the coat in a bag and wished me a Merry Christmas. That evening, Grandma helped me wrap the coat in Christmas paper and ribbons, and write, \"To Bobbie, From Santa Claus\" on it ... Grandma said that Santa always insisted on secrecy. Then she drove me over to Bobbie Decker's house, explaining as we went that I was now and forever officially one of Santa's helpers. Grandma parked down the street from Bobbie's house, and she and I crept noiselessly and hid in the bushes by his front walk. Suddenly, Grandma gave me a nudge. \"All right, Santa Claus,\" she whispered, \"get going.\" I took a deep breath, dashed for his front door, threw the present down on his step, pounded his doorbell twice and flew back to the safety of the bushes and Grandma. Together we waited breathlessly in the darkness for the front door to open. Finally it did, and there stood Bobbie. He looked down, looked around, picked up his present, took it inside and closed the door. Forty years haven't dimmed the thrill of those moments spent shivering, beside my grandma, in Bobbie Decker's bushes. That night, I realized that those awful rumors about Santa Claus were just what Grandma said they were: Ridiculous! Santa was alive and well ...

Published June 9, 2004** TAMPA - Two days after the Sept. 11 attacks, with most of the nation's air traffic still grounded, a small jet landed at Tampa International Airport, picked up three young Saudi men and left. The men, one of them thought to be a member of the Saudi royal family, were accompanied by a former FBI agent and a former Tampa police officer on the flight to Lexington, Ky. The Saudis then took another flight out of the country. The two ex-officers returned to TIA a few hours later on the same plane. For nearly three years, White House, aviation and law enforcement officials have insisted the flight never took place and have denied published reports and widespread Internet speculation about its purpose. But now, at the request of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks, TIA officials have confirmed that the flight did take place and have supplied details. The odyssey of the small LearJet 35 is part of a larger controversy over the hasty exodus from the United States in the days immediately after 9/11 of members of the Saudi royal family and relatives of Osama bin Laden. The terrorism panel, better known as the 9/11 Commission, said in April that it knew of six chartered flights with 142 people aboard, mostly Saudis, that left the United States between Sept. 14 and 24, 2001. But it has said nothing about the Tampa flight. The commission's general counsel, Daniel Marcus, asked TIA in a letter dated May 25 for any information about \"a chartered flight with six people, including a Saudi prince, that flew from Tampa, Florida on or about Sept. 13, 2001.\" He asked for the information no later than June 8. TIA officials said they sent their reply on Monday.

TIA officials said they sent their reply on Monday. The airport used aircraft tracking equipment normally assigned to a noise abatement program to determine the identity of all aircraft entering TIA airspace on Sept. 13, and found four records for the LearJet 35. The plane first entered the airspace from the south, possibly from the Fort Lauderdale area, sometime after 3 p.m. and landed for the first time at 3:34 p.m. It took off at 4:37 p.m., headed north. It returned to Tampa at 8:23 p.m. and took off again at 8:48 p.m., headed south. Author Craig Unger, who first disclosed the possibility of a post-9/11 Saudi airlift in his book House of Bush, House of Saud, said in an interview that he believes the jet came to Tampa a second time to drop off two former law enforcement agents from Tampa who accompanied three young Saudis to Lexington for security purposes. The Saudis asked the Tampa Police Department to escort the flight, but the department handed off the assignment to Dan Grossi, a former member of the force, Unger said. Grossi recruited Manuel Perez, a retired FBI agent, to accompany him. Both described the flight to Unger as somewhat surreal. \"They got the approval somewhere,\" Perez is quoted as telling Unger. \"It must have come from the highest levels of government.\" While there is no manifest for those aboard the Lear flight to Kentucky, Unger says the foreign nationals left Lexington for London aboard a Boeing 727. That manifest lists eight Saudis, two Sudan nationals, one Tunisian, one Philippine citizen, one Egyptian and two British subjects. Of those, three listed residences on Normandy Trace Drive in Tampa, and all of them held Florida drivers' licenses. They are Ahmad Al Hazmi, then 19, Fahad Al Zeid, then 20, and Talal M. Al Mejrad, then 18, all male Saudis. It is not known which, if any, is a Saudi prince. Perez, the former FBI agent on the flight, could not be located this week, and Grossi declined to talk about the experience. \"I'm over it,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"The White House, the FAA and the FBI all said the flight didn't happen. Those are three agencies that are way over my head, and that's why I'm done talking about it.\" Grossi did say that Unger's account of his participation in the flight is accurate. The FAA is still not talking about the flights, referring all questions to the FBI, which isn't answering anything, either. Nor is the 9/11 Commission.

The FAA is still not talking about the flights, referring all questions to the FBI, which isn't answering anything, either. Nor is the 9/11 Commission. Unger's book criticizes the Bush administration for allowing so many Saudis, including the relatives of bin Laden, to leave the country without being questioned thoroughly about the terrorist attacks. Fifteen of the 19 men who hijacked four airlines on Sept. 11 were Saudi, as is bin Laden. The 9/11 Commission, which has said the flights out of the United States were handled appropriately by the FBI, appears concerned with the handling of the Tampa flight. \"What information, if any, do you have about the screening by law enforcement personnel - including law enforcement personnel affiliated with the airport facility - of individuals on this flight?\" the commission asked TIA. The TIA Police Department said a check of its records indicated no member of its force screened the Lear's passengers. Despite evidence that the flight occurred, several new questions have arisen. Raytheon Aircraft is the only facility at TIA that services general aviation, which includes charter flights. When appropriate, Raytheon collects landing fees from those aircraft for TIA and reports to TIA on the flights. According to airport records, Raytheon collected landing fees from only two aircraft on Sept. 13, one of them a Lear 35. But according to the record, the registration on the Lear is 505RP, a tail number which, according to the latest federal records, is assigned to a Cessna Citation based in Kalamazoo, Mich., and Oskar Rene Poch. Poch confirmed Tuesday that he owns a Citation with that tail number and did before the terrorist attacks. \"Somebody must have gotten the registration number wrong in Tampa,\" he said. TIA spokeswoman Brenda Geoghagan said it is believed the Lear's Sept. 13 journey began in Fort Lauderdale, possibly at a charter company called Hop-a-Jet Inc. The fact that the four trips in and out of Tampa all carried the flight designation \"HPJ32\" lends support to that idea. But an official of Hop-a-Jet who wouldn't identify himself said the company does not own an aircraft with the registration number 505RP. Furthermore, he said, if that tail number is assigned to a Cessna Citation, the company doesn't own any Citations, either. Most of the aircraft allowed to fly in U.S. airspace on Sept. 13 were empty airliners being ferried from the airports where they made quick landings on Sept. 11. The reopening of the airspace included paid charter flights, but not private, nonrevenue flights. \"Whether such a (LearJet) flight would have been", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:saudisflown913fbi.txt:2:c055771e2d0c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14061, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "saudisflown913fbi.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "saudisflown913fbi", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "not own an aircraft with the registration number 505RP.

At the University of Paris, a research team led by physicist [Alain Aspect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Aspect) performed what may turn out to be one of the most important experiments of the 20th century. You did not hear about it on the evening news. In fact, unless you are in the habit of reading scientific journals you probably have never even heard Aspect's name, though there are some who believe his discovery may change the face of science. **Aspect and his team discovered that under certain circumstances subatomic particles such as electrons are able to instantaneously communicate with each other regardless of the distance separating them. It doesn't matter whether they are 10 feet or 10 billion miles apart.** Somehow each particle always seems to know what the other is doing. The problem with this feat is that it violates Einstein's long-held tenet that no communication can travel faster than the speed of light. Since traveling faster than the speed of light is tantamount to breaking the time barrier, this daunting prospect has caused some physicists to try to come up with elaborate ways to explain away Aspect's findings. But it has inspired others to offer even more radical explanations. University of London physicist [David Bohm](https://web.archive.org/web/20041025133151/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/Bohm.html), for example, believes **Aspect's findings suggest that objective reality may not exist****, ****that despite its apparent solidity the universe is at heart a phantasm, [a gigantic and splendidly detailed hologram](https://web.archive.org/web/20061022144927/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/holoUni.html). ** **How Does a Hologram Work? ** To understand why Bohm makes this startling assertion, one must first understand", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:science_spirituality_hologram.txt:0:280558d5b078", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14063, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "science_spirituality_hologram.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "science_spirituality_hologram", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "physicists to try to come up with elaborate ways to explain away Aspect's findings.

A hologram is a three-dimensional photograph made with the aid of a laser. To make a hologram, the object to be photographed is first bathed in the light of a laser beam. Then a second laser beam is bounced off the reflected light of the first and the resulting interference pattern (the area where the two laser beams commingle) is captured on film. When the film is developed, it looks like a meaningless swirl of light and dark lines. But as soon as the developed film is illuminated by another laser beam, a three-dimensional image of the original object appears. The three-dimensionality of such images is not the only remarkable characteristic of holograms. If a hologram of a rose is cut in half and then illuminated by a laser, each half will still be found to contain the entire image of the rose. Indeed, even if the halves are divided again, each snippet of film will always be found to contain a smaller but intact version of the original image.* *Unlike normal photographs, **every part of a hologram contains all the information possessed by the whole.** The \"whole in every part\" nature of a hologram provides us with an entirely new way of understanding organization and order. For most of its history, **Western science has labored under the bias that the best way to understand a physical phenomenon, whether a frog or an atom, is to dissect it and study its respective parts**. A hologram teaches us that some things in the universe may not lend themselves to this approach. If we try to take apart something constructed holographically, we will not get the pieces of which it is made, we will only get smaller wholes. This insight suggested to Bohm another way of understanding Aspect's discovery. Bohm believes the reason subatomic particles are able to remain in contact with one another regardless of the distance separating them is not because they are sending some sort of mysterious signal back and forth, but because their separateness may be an illusion.* *He argues that **at some deeper level of reality such particles are not individual entities, but are actually extensions of the same fundamental something.** To enable people to better visualize what he means, Bohm offers the following illustration.

Imagine an aquarium containing a fish. Imagine also that you are unable to see the aquarium directly and your knowledge about it and what it contains comes from two television cameras, one directed at the aquarium's front and the other directed at its side. As you stare at the two television monitors, you might assume that the fish on each of the screens are separate entities. After all, because the cameras are set at different angles, each of the images will be slightly different. But as you continue to watch the two fish, you will eventually become aware that there is a certain relationship between them. When one turns, the other also makes a slightly different but corresponding turn; when one faces the front, the other always faces toward the side. If you remain unaware of the full scope of the situation, you might even conclude that the fish must be instantaneously communicating with one another, but this is clearly not the case. This, says Bohm, is precisely what is going on between the subatomic particles in Aspect's experiment. According to Bohm, the apparent faster-than-light connection between subatomic particles is really telling us that there is a deeper level of reality we are not privy to, a more complex dimension beyond our own that is analogous to the aquarium. And, he adds,* *we view objects such as subatomic particles as separate from one another because we are seeing only a portion of their reality. **The Interconnected Nature of the Universe ** Such particles are not separate \"parts\", but facets of a deeper and more underlying unity that is ultimately as holographic and indivisible as the previously mentioned rose. And since everything in physical reality is comprised of these \"eidolons\", the universe is itself a projection, a hologram. In addition to its phantomlike nature, such a universe would possess other rather startling features. **If the apparent separateness of subatomic particles is illusory, it means that at a deeper level of reality all things in the universe may be infinitely interconnected.** The electrons in a carbon atom in the human brain may be connected to the subatomic particles that comprise every salmon that swims, every heart that beats, and every star that shimmers in the sky.

In a holographic universe, even time and space could [no longer be viewed as fundamentals](https://web.archive.org/web/20061029225156/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/prussell.htm). Because concepts such as location break down in a universe in which nothing is truly separate from anything else, time and three-dimensional space, like the images of the fish on the TV monitors, would also have to be viewed as projections of this deeper order. **At its deeper level, reality may be a sort of superhologram in which the past, present, and future all exist simultaneously. This suggests that given the proper tools, it might even be possible to someday reach into the superholographic level of reality and pluck out scenes from the long-forgotten past. ** What else the superhologram contains is an open-ended question. Allowing, for the sake of argument, that the superhologram is the matrix that has given birth to everything in our universe, at the very least it contains every subatomic particle that has been or will be - every configuration of matter and energy that is possible, from snowflakes to quasars, from blue whales to gamma rays. It must be seen as a sort of cosmic storehouse of \"All That Is.\" Although Bohm concedes that we have no way of knowing what else might lie hidden in the superhologram, he does venture to say that we have no reason to assume it does not contain more. Or as he puts it, perhaps the superholographic level of reality is a \"mere stage\" beyond which lies \"an infinity of further development\". **The Holographic Mind ** Bohm is not the only researcher who has found evidence that the universe is a hologram. Working independently in the field of brain research, Stanford neurophysiologist [Karl Pribram](https://web.archive.org/web/20061216042629/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/holoUni.html#Lyall%20Watson)has also become persuaded of the holographic nature of reality. Pribram was drawn to the holographic model by the puzzle of how and where memories are stored in the brain. For decades numerous studies have shown that rather than being confined to a specific location, memories are dispersed throughout the brain. In a series of landmark experiments in the 1920s, **brain scientist Karl Lashley found that no matter what portion of a rat's brain he removed he was not able to eradicate its memory of how to perform complex tasks it had learned prior to surgery.** The only problem was that no one was able to come up with a mechanism that might explain this curious \"whole in every part\" nature of memory storage. Then in the 1960s, Pribram encountered the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:science_spirituality_hologram.txt:3:53baa57557d6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14066, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "science_spirituality_hologram.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "science_spirituality_hologram", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "In a series of landmark experiments in the 1920s, **brain scientist Karl Lashley found that no matter what portion of a rat's brain he removed he was not able to eradicate its memory of how to perform complex tasks it had learned prior to surgery.** The only problem was that no one was able to come up with a mechanism that might explain this curious \"whole in every part\" nature of memory storage. Then in the 1960s, Pribram encountered the concept of holography and realized he had found the explanation brain scientists had been looking for. Pribram believes memories are encoded not in neurons, or small groupings of neurons, but in patterns of nerve impulses that crisscross the entire brain in the same way that patterns of laser light interference crisscross the entire area of a piece of film containing a holographic image. In other words,*** ***Pribram believes* *[the brain is itself a hologram.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061031093549/https://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/pribram.htm) Pribram's theory also explains how the human brain can store so many memories in so little space. It has been estimated that the human brain has the capacity to memorize something on the order of 10 billion bits of information during the average human lifetime (or roughly the same amount of information contained in five sets of the Encyclopedia Britannica). Similarly, it has been discovered that in addition to their other capabilities, **holograms possess an astounding capacity for information storage - simply by changing the angle at which the two lasers strike a piece of photographic film, it is possible to record many different images on the same surface. It has been demonstrated that one cubic centimeter of film can hold as many as 10 billion bits of information. ** Our uncanny ability to quickly retrieve whatever information we need from the enormous store of our memories becomes more understandable if the brain functions according to holographic principles. If a friend asks you to tell him what comes to mind when he says the word \"zebra\", you do not have to clumsily sort back through some gigantic and cerebral alphabetic file to arrive at an answer. Instead, associations like \"striped\", \"horselike\", and \"animal native to Africa\" all pop into your head instantly. Indeed, one of the most amazing things about the human thinking process is that many pieces of information seem instantly cross-correlated with other pieces of information - another feature intrinsic to the hologram. Because every portion of a hologram is infinitely interconnected with every other portion, the mind is perhaps nature's supreme example of a cross-correlated system. The storage of memory is not the only neurophysiological puzzle that becomes more tractable in light of Pribram's holographic model of the brain. Another is how the brain is able to translate the avalanche of frequencies it receives via the senses (light frequencies, sound frequencies, and so on) into the concrete world of our perceptions.

Another is how the brain is able to translate the avalanche of frequencies it receives via the senses (light frequencies, sound frequencies, and so on) into the concrete world of our perceptions. Encoding and decoding frequencies is precisely what a hologram does best. Just as a hologram functions as a sort of lens, a translating device able to convert an apparently meaningless blur of frequencies into a coherent image, **Pribram believes the brain also comprises a lens and uses holographic principles to mathematically convert the frequencies it receives through the senses into the inner world of our perceptions.** **Holographic Evidence ** An impressive body of evidence suggests that the brain uses holographic principles to perform its operations. Pribram's theory, in fact, has gained increasing support among neurophysiologists. Argentinian-Italian researcher Hugo Zucarelli recently extended the holographic model into the world of acoustic phenomena. Puzzled by the fact that humans can locate the source of sounds without moving their heads, even if they only possess hearing in one ear, Zucarelli discovered that holographic principles can explain this ability. Zucarelli has also developed the technology of [holophonic sound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holophonics), a recording technique able to reproduce acoustic situations with an almost uncanny realism. [listen to a sample [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gLF7nguyok) - earphones needed] Pribram's belief that our brains mathematically construct \"hard\" reality by relying on input from a frequency domain has also received a good deal of experimental support. It has been found that each of our senses is sensitive to a much broader range of frequencies than was previously suspected. Researchers have discovered, for instance, that our visual systems are sensitive to sound frequencies, that our sense of smell is in part dependent on what are now called \"osmic frequencies\", and that even the cells in our bodies are sensitive to a broad range of frequencies. Such findings suggest that it is only in the holographic domain of consciousness that such frequencies are sorted out and divided up into conventional perceptions. But the most mind-boggling aspect of Pribram's holographic model of the brain is what happens when it is put together with Bohm's theory. For if **the concreteness of the world is but a secondary reality and what is \"there\" is actually a holographic blur of frequencies**, and if the brain is also a hologram and only selects some of the frequencies out of this blur and mathematically transforms them into sensory perceptions,* *what becomes of *objective reality*? Put quite simply, it ceases to exist. As the religions of the East have long upheld, [the material world is Maya,](https://web.archive.org/web/20061214154210/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/kwilb_eyspir.html) a kind of superficial illusion, and although we may think we", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:science_spirituality_hologram.txt:5:c11fb142000b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14068, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "science_spirituality_hologram.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "science_spirituality_hologram", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "world is but a secondary reality and what is \"there\" is actually a holographic blur of frequencies**, and if the brain is also a hologram and only selects some of the frequencies out of this blur and mathematically transforms them into sensory perceptions,* *what becomes of *objective reality*?

We may actually be \"receivers\" floating through a kaleidoscopic sea of frequency, and what we extract from this sea and transmogrify into physical reality is but one channel from many extracted out of the superhologram. **The Holographic Paradigm ** This striking new picture of reality, the synthesis of Bohm and Pribram's views, has come to be called the holographic paradigm, and although many scientists have greeted it with skepticism, it has galvanized others. A small but growing group of researchers believe it may be the most accurate model of reality science has arrived at thus far. More than that, some believe it may solve some mysteries that have never before been explainable by science and even establish the paranormal as a part of nature. Numerous researchers, including Bohm and Pribram, have noted that many [para-psychological phenomena](https://web.archive.org/web/20061031093030/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/FAQpara.htm) become much more understandable in terms of the holographic paradigm. **In a universe in which individual brains are actually indivisible portions of the greater hologram and everything is infinitely interconnected,** **telepathy may merely be the accessing of the holographic level. ** With this model, it is obviously much easier to understand how information can travel from the mind of individual 'A' to that of individual 'B' at a far distance point, and to understand a number of other unsolved puzzles in psychology. In particular, psychiatric researcher [Dr. Stanislav Grof](https://web.archive.org/web/20061216053222/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/Alt_Cosmol.html) feels the holographic paradigm offers a model for understanding many of the baffling phenomena experienced by individuals during altered states of consciousness. In the 1950s, while conducting research into the use of LSD as a psychotherapeutic tool, Grof had one female patient who suddenly became convinced she had assumed the identity of a female of a species of prehistoric reptile. During the course of her hallucination, she not only gave a richly detailed description of what it felt like to be encapsuled in such a form, but noted that the sexually arousing portion of the male of the species' anatomy was a patch of colored scales on the side of its head. What was startling to Grof was that although the woman had no prior knowledge about such things, a conversation with a zoologist later confirmed that in certain species of reptiles, colored areas on the head do indeed play an important role as triggers of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:science_spirituality_hologram.txt:6:2090412aface", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14069, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "science_spirituality_hologram.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "science_spirituality_hologram", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "it felt like to be encapsuled in such a form, but noted that the sexually arousing portion of the male of the species' anatomy was a patch of colored scales on the side of its head. What was startling to Grof was that although the woman had no prior knowledge about such things, a conversation with a zoologist later confirmed that in certain species of reptiles, colored areas on the head do indeed play an important role as triggers of sexual arousal. The woman's experience was not unique. During the course of his research, Grof encountered examples of patients regressing and identifying with virtually every species on the evolutionary tree (research findings which helped influence the man-into-ape scene in the movie [Altered States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_States)). Moreover, he found that such experiences frequently contained obscure zoological details which turned out to be accurate. ** Regressions into the animal kingdom were not the only puzzling psychological phenomena Grof encountered. He also had patients who appeared to tap into some sort of collective or racial unconscious. ****Individuals with little or no education suddenly gave detailed descriptions of Zoroastrian funerary practices and scenes from Hindu mythology. In other categories of experience, individuals gave persuasive accounts of out-of-body journeys, of precognitive glimpses of the future, of regressions into apparent past-life incarnations. ** In later research, Grof found the same range of phenomena manifested in therapy sessions which did not involve the use of drugs. Because the common element in such experiences appeared to be the transcending of an individual's consciousness beyond the usual boundaries of ego and/or limitations of space and time, Grof called such manifestations \"transpersonal experiences\", and in the late '60s he helped found a branch of psychology called [transpersonal psychology](https://web.archive.org/web/20061208164920/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/tart_bio.html) devoted entirely to their study. Although Grof's newly founded [Association of Transpersonal Psychology](http://www.atpweb.org/) garnered a rapidly growing group of like-minded professionals and has become a respected branch of psychology, for years neither Grof or any of his colleagues were able to offer a mechanism for explaining the bizarre psychological phenomena they were witnessing. But that has changed with the advent of the holographic paradigm. ** As Grof recently noted, if the mind is actually part of a continuum, a labyrinth that is connected not only to every other mind that exists or has existed, but to every atom, organism, and region in the vastness of space and time itself, the fact that it is able to occasionally make forays into the labyrinth and have transpersonal experiences no longer seems so strange. ** **Connecting Hard Science With the Holographic Paradigm ** The holographic paradigm also has implications for so-called hard sciences like biology. [Keith Floyd](https://web.archive.org/web/20100331081243/http://www.sandmansland.com/of_time_and_the_mind.pdf), a psychologist at Virginia Intermont College, has pointed out that if the concreteness of reality is but a holographic illusion, it would no longer be true to say the brain produces consciousness.

Such a turnabout in the way we view biological structures has caused researchers to point out that medicine and our understanding of the healing process could also be transformed by the holographic paradigm. If the apparent physical structure of the body is but a holographic projection of consciousness, it becomes clear that each of us is much more responsible for our health than current medical wisdom allows. What we now view as miraculous remissions of disease may actually be due to changes in consciousness which in turn effect changes in the hologram of the body. Similarly, controversial new healing** **techniques such as visualization may work so well because, in the holographic domain of thought, images can ultimately be as real as \"reality\". **Even visions and experiences involving \"non-ordinary\" reality become explainable under the holographic paradigm*.*** In his intriguing book \"[Gifts of Unknown Things](http://www.amazon.com/Gifts-Things-Healing-Initiation-Indonesias/dp/0892813539/ref=sr_1_1?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1217636543&sr=1-1),\" biologist [Lyall Watson](https://web.archive.org/web/20061216042629/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/holoUni.html#Lyall%20Watson) describes his encounter with an Indonesian shaman woman who, by performing a ritual dance, was able to make an entire grove of trees instantly vanish into thin air. Watson relates that as he and another astonished onlooker continued to watch the woman, she caused the trees to reappear, then \"click\" off again and on again several times in succession. Although current scientific understanding is incapable of explaining such events, experiences like this become more tenable if \"hard\" reality is only a holographic projection. Perhaps we agree on what is \"there\" or \"not there\" because what we call *consensus reality *is formulated and ratified at the level of the human unconscious at which all minds are infinitely interconnected. **Limitless Implications ** **If this is true, it is the most profound implication of the holographic paradigm of all***, *for it means that experiences such as Watson's are not commonplace only because we have not programmed our minds with the beliefs that would make them so. **In a holographic universe there are no limits to the extent to which we can alter [the fabric of reality.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061214151832/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/prussell.htm)** What we perceive as reality may be but a canvas waiting for us to draw upon it any picture we want.

Indeed, even our most fundamental notions about reality become suspect, for in a holographic universe, as Pribram has pointed out, **even random events would have to be seen as based on holographic principles **and therefore determined. [Synchronicities or meaningful coincidences](https://web.archive.org/web/20061211172109/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/ISSS_synchr.html) suddenly makes sense, and everything in reality would have to be seen as a metaphor, for even the most haphazard events would express some underlying symmetry. Whether Bohm and Pribram's holographic paradigm becomes accepted in science or dies an ignoble death remains to be seen, but it is safe to say that it has already had an influence on the thinking of many scientists. And even if it is found that the holographic model does not provide the best explanation for the instantaneous communications that seem to be passing back and forth between subatomic particles, at the very least, as noted by Basil Hiley, a physicist at Birbeck College in London, **Aspect's findings \"indicate that we must be prepared to consider radically new views of reality\".** For lots more fascinating material along these lines, don't miss Michael Talbot's highly engaging book [*The Holographic Universe*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060922583/qid=1073095915/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-5947862-1271341?tag=wanttinfo-20).

Meyer transferred ownership to his daughter Katharine and her husband, [Philip Graham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Graham), after World War II, when he was appointed by [Harry S. Truman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman) to serve as the first president of the [World Bank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank). Meyer had been \"a Wall Street banker, director of President Wilson's [War Finance Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Finance_Corporation), a governor of the [Federal Reserve System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System), and director of the [Reconstruction Finance Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Finance_Corporation),\" Henwood wrote. Philip Graham, Meyer's successor, had been in military intelligence during the war. When he became the Post's publisher, he continued to have close contact with his fellow upper-class intelligence veterans-now making policy at the newly formed CIA - and actively promoted the CIA's goals in his newspaper. The incestuous relationship between the Post and the intelligence community even extended to its hiring practices. [Watergate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate)-era editor [Ben Bradlee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bradlee) also had an intelligence background; and before he became a journalist, reporter [Bob Woodward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Woodward) was an officer in Naval Intelligence. In a 1977 article in *Rolling Stone* magazine about CIA influence in American media, Woodward's partner, [Carl Bernstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Bernstein), quoted this from a CIA official: \"It was widely known that Phil Graham was somebody you could get help from.\" Graham has been identified by some investigators as the main contact in [Project Mockingbird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mockingbird), the CIA program to infiltrate domestic American media. In her autobiography, Katharine Graham described how her husband worked overtime at the Post during the [Bay of Pigs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs) operation to protect the reputations of his friends from Yale who had organized the ill-fated venture. After Graham committed suicide, and his widow Katharine assumed the role of publisher, she continued her husband's policies of supporting the efforts of the intelligence community in advancing the foreign policy and economic agenda of the nation's ruling elites. In a retrospective column written after her own death, FAIR analyst Norman Solomon wrote, \"Her newspaper mainly functioned as a helpmate to the war-makers in the White House, State Department and Pentagon.\" It accomplished this function (and continues to do so) using all the classic propaganda techniques of evasion, confusion, misdirection, targeted emphasis, disinformation, secrecy, omission of important facts, and selective leaks.

Why? Because it touches on some of the things that I am most ashamed of in my own life. **I used to be a cult programmer, or \"trainer\" as they are called, and here I will share some of what I did or witnessed while in that role.** I also went through these things as a child, so this article is also quite autobiographical as well. Autobiography can be a moment of boasting, of quiet joy, or intense pain. Mine falls in the latter category, to say the least. But I am hoping with all of my heart that sharing my pain will help others avoid this pain, or will help society better understand what survivors go through. This article will in no means be a complete treatment of the subject. Cult programming is a complex subject, one that would fill volumes and volumes if dealt with beyond a surface description. Also, I can only write from my own experiences with the Illuminati, which is one of several groups operating today, and about the techniques used in the Washington, DC area and in San Diego, Ca. Other localities might use very different techniques. **This article does NOT take the place of advice from a qualified therapist, and is meant to be informative only.

The goals they have are: Making money Secrecy Unquestioning loyalty in their members Programming, or training, is one method that the cult has found that will ensure that these goals are met. In the Illuminati, the programmers are called \"trainers\" because the belief is that they are not abusing, but \"training\" the future generation. **The trainers actually believe that they are doing a good thing, \"strengthening\" the children, helping them to get in touch with their \"potential.\"** Some of these methods have been around for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. I will divide cult programming into five major categories, and address each one separately: Training to be silent Training to be strong Training to be loyal Training for jobs in the group Spiritual training **Training to be silent** The first category, training to be silent, begins at a very young age, frequently preverbal. This is accomplished in several ways, depending upon the child and the trainer, and can include: Being asked after a ceremony what the child saw and heard. The very young child may just say \"bad things\", and is punished severely and brutally, and told that no, they didn't really see those things. This is repeated at frequent intervals, until the child learns to block the ceremonies. **Often, a \"protector\" or \"guardian\" alter will be created from the abuse, whose job is to ensure that the child will not remember what is seen. **This protector is told that if the child does remember, brutal punishment will follow. Another method involves electroshocking the child, and placing them into a deep hypnotic trance, where they are told that they will not remember what they have seen or heard, that it is all \"just a bad dream.\" The child WANTS to forget, and will be eager to agree. Psychological torture may be used: mock burials, being placed in cages, abandonment, being hung over a bridge, with the child later being \"rescued\" and told that if they ever tell, they will be returned to the punishment. **Being forced to watch mock or real punishment or killing of a traitor who \"told\".** When I was four years old, I was forced to watch a woman be skinned alive. Her crime: she disclosed to an outside person \"family business\". Talking to those outside the group is considered one of the worst crimes or betrayals a person can commit. A \"traitor's death\" is one of the most horrifying imaginable, and will vary from crucifixion upside down, to other gruesome scenarios. Young children do not forget seeing these things, and they become convinced that not disclosing is", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati.txt:1:45a5b1d7438b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14076, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "was four years old, I was forced to watch a woman be skinned alive.

A \"traitor's death\" is one of the most horrifying imaginable, and will vary from crucifixion upside down, to other gruesome scenarios. Young children do not forget seeing these things, and they become convinced that not disclosing is the safest way to continue living. These set ups are done to ensure that a young child will not disclose the criminal activities that they are seeing in the course of group activities, or even as an adult, when they are more actively engaged in them. **Another set up also is frequently done: The \"no one will believe you scenario\"** (this is usually done with school age children). The child is told repeatedly that even if they DO disclose that no one will believe them. The child is taken by a mental hospital, or even taken to visit an inmate briefly. Later, the child is told that people who disclose are considered \"crazy\" and sent to institutions, where they are punished severely and can never leave. These lies are told to reinforce once again the importance of not telling. Another set up may include the \"everyone is part of it\" set up. **The child is told that actually, everyone is secretly part of the group, but people are just good pretenders during the daytime. **The child will be taken to dinner at a member's house, where everyone acts normal, then later a ritual or ceremony follows. The child will then believe that there is no escape, since everyone is part of the group. Since most of the adults close to his/her parents are part of the group, there is no reason to question the logic of what they are told. The set ups and psychological conditioning to not tell are endless, limited only by the cruel creativity of the adults around the child. **Training to be strong** This type of training will also begin at a very young age, often in the toddler years. The child is put through a series of conditioning exercises whose goals are to: increase the pain threshold, increase physical fitness, increase dissociative ability, force quick memorization of material (school age child), create fear, and the desire to please These exercise might include: mock military training, with marches and playing \"prisoner and guard\"; shocking the child; physical abuse and torture; drugging the child or adult; placing the child into cages, where they are shocked; deprivation of food, water, or sleep; abandonment for varying amounts of time; forcing the child to watch brutalities and the abuse of others. **The child is taught to be completely silent during the above; to endure it without question.

If the child screams, they are punished extremely, and told that this is \"weakness\". The child is taught to fear their own emotions, since they are quickly and mercilessly punished for expressing them.** The scenes go on and on, the above are just a few methods used. **Training to be loyal** The third area of training encompasses a broad area of behaviour. Loyalty involves agreement with the group, espousing its doctrines and beliefs. This training is at times more subtle, but it also is one of the most powerful pulls to the group. Adults in the group model complete loyalty to their children. Getting out, leaving, or questioning the group's beliefs are rarely or never seen, and the **retaliation for questioning those in authority is quick and brutal. A person seen questioning the rightness of things, or balking at doing their job might be sent in for \"retraining\", i.e., being shocked and tortured back into submission.** **But often adults believe the goals of the group are GOOD. They are convinced that they are helping the children, and in classes children are taught why these beliefs are good; about the coming agenda for the group, where they will be the new leaders.** Much discussion of the time when the group will \"rule the world\" is done, to show that they are actually ushering in a new order, when things will be \"better for all.\" Status and leadership are held out as carrots to group members to work harder and achieve. The rewards of leadership, of moving up, are real, and every member tries to advance themselves. Being higher means less abuse, being able to order others around, and more control in a life that has had precious little control. Set ups, where a child is allowed to sit in a leader's seat, and is told that one day they, too, will lead, are often done to increase the loyalty to the group. Awards ceremonies, where those who do well receive badges, jewels, or other rewards in front of others, are frequently done. A child who works hard, who performs well, is praised and allowed to join the adults for coffee or a meal, while the other children look enviously on. As the child progresses through the system, they do move higher, since adults are always higher than a young child. Now the child who is growing older can boss the younger children, can tell", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati.txt:3:14f1ea8f1ad3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14078, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "where those who do well receive badges, jewels, or other rewards in front of others, are frequently done. A child who works hard, who performs well, is praised and allowed to join the adults for coffee or a meal, while the other children look enviously on. As the child progresses through the system, they do move higher, since adults are always higher than a young child. Now the child who is growing older can boss the younger children, can tell them what to do, can even abuse them with the approval of the adults around. Being very young means being very abused and wounded in these groups; **growing older means the chance to finally act out on the rage the abuse has caused. The child begins to identify with the abusing adults, since they are hurt less, and becomes invested in a cult identity as a perpetrator. This is strongly encouraged, **as long as the perpetration is not directed at members older or higher than the child or teen. This locks the child in, as having become \"one of them\", like them, and the child is bonded to the group by his/her own guilt and shame, as well as the need for outlets for rage and pain that the group allows. The child may feel ambivalence, but also extreme loyalty. The group or trainer will also tell the child that they are the only ones that really know the child, having seen them act out; that they are the only ones who could see this, and still love them, that no one loves them the way \"family\" does. The child is bombarded with messages that the group truly accepts them, all of them, knowing the worst about them, to cement the loyalty. The group uses sophisticated techniques based on behavioral psychology to ensure that the child/teen/adult will not even consider leaving the group. **Another form of loyalty programming is \"specialness programming\". This is where the child is told by the adults or trainer that: they are \"high\", hidden royalty, or a \"hidden\" or \"adopted\" member of a high family line.** The child may be told that they will be a world leader who is hidden for now; a special CIA agent, or \"one in a thousand, a wunderkind\" who will lead as an adult. They may be told that there are very few like them; that no one else can fill their special role; that they are of a special bloodline that is unbroken for thousands of years. This is to increase the child's loyalty to the group. If the child believes that they are merely waiting now for the revealing of their \"true, elevated status\" one day, they will be much more likely to develop loyalty bonds to the group. This is one of the cruelest tricks the group plays on children, since they have deprived them of normal", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati.txt:4:ddd390c23f52", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14079, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "fill their special role; that they are of a special bloodline that is unbroken for thousands of years.

If the child believes that they are merely waiting now for the revealing of their \"true, elevated status\" one day, they will be much more likely to develop loyalty bonds to the group. This is one of the cruelest tricks the group plays on children, since they have deprived them of normal love and caring, and instead replace it with a false sense of \"specialness\" or status. Very few survivors getting out of these groups believe that they were low; almost all believe that they were high, or were adopted, but their real family is high, for this reason. This was done to me as well, and as an adult, when I had to tell lies like this to children, I became more and more disillusioned with the group, one of many reasons I finally chose to leave it. I could no longer bear to listen to other trainers and scientists laughing about the gullibility of the people they worked with. I had once been a child, eager to please, and gullible myself. **I had believed the lies, and it was a rude awakening to find out I was NOT adopted from a royal line, as I had been told.** That I had been manipulated and deceived intentionally to increase my loyalty to the group. **Training for jobs in the cult** The fourth category of training or programming is towards doing a job in the cult. Each person has a specific job(s) that they are given, from earliest childhood on in the Illuminati. Often, the child is tested at intervals during their early years for aptitude and ability. **The parent's status, as well as the child's intelligence and dissociative ability, will also factor in to the final role.** Jobs in the cult might include, but are not limited to: cleaners (clean up after ceremonies, set up) spiritual (lead meetings, high priest or priestess, or acolytes) punishers (punish members who are out of line or make mistakes) scholars (learn cult history, ancient languages, do readings and history set ups) prostitutes couriers assassins trainers scientists (trained in behavioral sciences) doctors, nurses, medical personnel military leader (for military exercises) The list goes on and on. The Illuminati are a complex group, with interwoven roles. The amount of training the child will need for their adult role will often depend upon the complexity of the final job. Sometimes, jobs overlap, or a person will be cross-trained for several. A child raised with child pornography may as an adult be taught to run a video camera, for example. A nurse or doctor may also help as a trainer or learn sciences. **A person trained as a military leader in the group will frequently also have assassin training", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati.txt:5:4e3d994cf411", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14080, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "amount of training the child will need for their adult role will often depend upon the complexity of the final job.

A nurse or doctor may also help as a trainer or learn sciences. **A person trained as a military leader in the group will frequently also have assassin training ([MK-ULTRA](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050626mkultra)) as well.** These jobs are taught using operant conditioning principles from early childhood on. The child is shown how the role is done by an adult or older teen, ie \"modeling\" the behaviour is done. The child will also see the jobs done in the course of being part of the group. After the behaviour is modeled, the child is told that they will be learning it. Clear directions on what is expected are given. The job is broken down into steps, and each step is put in sequentially. The child may be shocked, or tortured, to create a \"blank state\" or tabula erasa personality who will do anything asked of them. Then, the behaviour is elicited. If the child does well, they are praised and petted. If they do not, they are punished severely. The child learns it is much less painful to demonstrate the asked for behaviour. Afterwards, once the behaviour is shown, the trainer \"bonds\" with the child, praising them, telling them how valuable they are, and what a wonderful job they are doing for \"family\". The child is given the validation and caring that they so desperately crave, and a trauma bond is created. The personality state in the child will WANT to do well. It has bonded with the trainer or adult, and seeks approval again and again. This bond will last into adulthood, and often the personality states that seek approval will stay in a young state inside of an adult body. After the \"job\" is done, they will come out and still ask for approval at times. Another reward for the adult will be perceived moving up in status if they do well. **Spiritual training** **At its foundation, the Illuminati are an intensely spiritual group. They worship ancient deities including those of Babylon and Assyria (Baal and Ashtoth) and of Egypt (Ra, Horus, Isis, etc.). They believe that the spiritual is the root that feeds its many manifestations today.** Because of this, all children will undergo some form of spiritual training or programming. This is to ensure their bonding to the group as well as coerce or frighten them into fearing leaving. Spiritual programming begins with the first ceremony that an infant is taken to, when they are dedicated to a deity, or even prenatally, when the fetus may be dedicated in utero to the \"mother of heaven\" or other deities.

The young toddler's world will include seeing the adults around him/her going to ceremonies, and they will be forced to imitate the activities they see. **There may be blood baptisms, using animals.** There will be many, many dedications and rites, including the passing on of familial spirits from mother or father or grandparent, to the young child. These can be intensely frightening experiences. I do not want to argue the existence of the demonic here, but I will say that the group certainly does believe it is real, and that the manifestations seen at these rites go beyond that which can be explained scientifically or rationally. As a child, I believed intensely that the demonic was real, as did all of the adults around me. There will be ceremonies in which the demonic is invoked, and manifestations of power, including channeling, foretelling, or psychic slaying of animals. Objects may be moved, or a tree felled, using psychic abilities/demonic help. Adults will be involved in power battles. \"Reading\" people will be done. And in all training/programming sessions, the demonic will be invoked to help the trainer, to guide them, or to give energy to the programming being done. **Often, before important programming sessions, trainers will perform a ceremony asking for demonic aide.** **The child will be told that the demonic has been placed within them, and that if they ever try to leave, or break the programming, the demonic will \"kill them.\"** The terrified child believes this. \"Psychic surgery\" may be done, where an \"eye\" is placed in the abdomen, and the child is told that the \"eye\" can see them wherever they go, and will tell them if the child tries to escape or questions the group. **Implants may be placed, small thin metal rods, used to call up demonic forces. If the person tries to leave or break programming, the implants are to cause intense pain or torment.** A child will be forced to participate in rites, including the mutilation or killing of animals or even an infant (although some of these are set ups, using a corpse, as mentioned in a previous article). Visits to sacred groves or holy areas may occur, where statues to the deities are garlanded with flowers and robed followers chant before a rite. **In some groups, the child will be turned against Christianity with purposeful programming.** Since Christianity is the antithesis of the dark", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati.txt:7:91d774654fcb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14082, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "will be forced to participate in rites, including the mutilation or killing of animals or even an infant (although some of these are set ups, using a corpse, as mentioned in a previous article).

Special sessions may include torturing a child. Often, the child will cry out for help, or to God. At that point, the programmer will tell the child, \"God has abandoned you, He could never love you, that is why you are being hurt. If He was so powerful, He could stop this.\" They will even ask the child to ask God to stop it. The child will, and then the trainer will hurt the child more. **This will create a deep sense of hopelessness and despair in the child. He or she will truly believe they have been abandoned by God,** that He has a deaf ears to their call for help. The child may be tortured or shocked when the name \"Jesus\" is said, to create a barrier to hearing His name. Hymns may be used in sessions, to create aversion. Spiritual programming will cover a variety of areas. I have only briefly covered some here. This has been an overview of some of the areas that the cult, specifically the Illuminati, program people in. It is by no means all-inclusive, and there will be many, many variations in specific techniques used. Also, I am sure that different groups use different methods. If a survivor has memories that are different from what I have described here, they should believe their own memories. I am only sharing what I do remember about the Illuminati, the specific group that I was associated with, in the Washington, DC and the San Diego, Ca. areas from 1957 until 1995. My hope is that this article will help those who work with survivors, or who wish to know more about how these groups operate, understand more about them, and that it will increase compassion for the immense amount of suffering that a member of these groups undergoes and for the struggle, once they leave, to overcome years of conditioning from infancy on. It takes tremendous courage to leave such a group, to say \"no\" to the pull of all the person has known, to decide to question values that lay unquestioned for years, to look at the pain underlying the programming, and to grieve over the manipulations and betrayals that have occurred from infancy on. **For an excellent summary of cult", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati.txt:8:01a73ca13e37", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14083, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__cult_programming_illuminati", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "a member of these groups undergoes and for the struggle, once they leave, to overcome years of conditioning from infancy on.

This is the source of All That Is. Infinite consciousness. Intelligent infinity.** There is unity. Infinite intelligence and infinite energy - the two are one, and the potential for all creation is contained therein. Infinite intelligence does not recognize its potential. It is the undifferentiated absolute. This state of consciousness could be termed as \"being\". Infinite energy, in contrast, recognizes the potential of \"becoming\" all things. Infinite intelligence can be likened to the central heartbeat of life, and infinite energy to the spiritual life-blood which pumps out from the Creator to form the creation. In effect, the Creator is a point of focused infinite consciousness expressing infinite intelligent energy. On focusing its infinite intelligence, the One Infinite Creator manifests intelligent energy which you could call the great central sun. It then divides itself into smaller portions of itself that can, in turn, experience themselves as creators or central suns, thus beginning the next step in the creational spiral. In other words, each central sun or creator is a step down in conscious awareness from the original \"thought\" of creation. **Creation is based upon three primary laws of the Infinite One: free will, love, and light.** In the first law, the creator receives the free will to know and experience itself as an individuated, though paradoxically unified, aspect of the One. In the second, the initial law of free will becomes a focus point of awareness known as Logos, or love, which uses its infinite intelligent energy to co-create a vast array of physical manifestations", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__deep_insider_creation_story.txt:0:75e36038a442", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14085, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__deep_insider_creation_story.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__deep_insider_creation_story", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "the original \"thought\" of creation. **Creation is based upon three primary laws of the Infinite One: free will, love, and light.** In the first law, the creator receives the free will to know and experience itself as an individuated, though paradoxically unified, aspect of the One. In the second, the initial law of free will becomes a focus point of awareness known as Logos, or love, which uses its infinite intelligent energy to co-create a vast array of physical manifestations which will best offer the range of potential experiences in which it can know itself. To manifest this infinite spiritual or life-force energy into a physical form, Logos creates the third law of light. Wherever thus exists any form of physical matter, there is light, love, and divine intelligent energy [at its core](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#seeing). So using the law of free will, the One Infinite Creator steps down its infinite energy to become Logos. Logos designs vast universes of space, stepping down and splitting itself into an array of sub-Logos, each of which becomes a co-creator of its own universe. Each universal Logos then designs and creates its own version of physical reality by focusing its intelligent energy to create, for instance, the form of galaxies within itself. Stepping down again, each galactic Logos can split itself into yet further co-creator portions (sub-sub-Logos), which can then design and manifest their own ideas of physical reality, as in the form of stars and planets. **Yahweh, Lucifer, and the Ruling Bloodlines** We are not directly created by the One Infinite Creator, but rather by our own Logos, sub-Logos, or sub-sub-Logos. **Your creator, the one who has been called Yahweh, is not \"God\" inasmuch as your Bible refers to him as being the one true God. He is \"a\" creator (or sub-sub-Logos) rather than the One Infinite Creator.** He is not a galactic level Logos, but rather is the planetary Logos for this one planet. Yet ultimately, all are a part of the One. And either consciously or unconsciously, all are exercising their free will to create. I am a generational member of a ruling bloodline family. Our lineage can be traced back beyond antiquity. Our creator is the one you refer to as Lucifer, \"the Light Bearer\". Our creator is not \"the Devil\", as has been portrayed in some religious texts. **Lucifer is what you would call a \"group soul\" which has evolved to the level of the sixth density (dimension or plane of existence).** At one point our bloodline families, as a group soul, were on the verge of seventh density ascension. At this level, we had the choice to progress higher, or to return to help others of lower densities with their evolution. Having made our decision to stay and help, we were assigned a challenging task by the Council of Elders, who act as the guardians of this galaxy.

At this level, we had the choice to progress higher, or to return to help others of lower densities with their evolution. Having made our decision to stay and help, we were assigned a challenging task by the Council of Elders, who act as the guardians of this galaxy. Yahweh, due to the fact that he had not handed down his own free will to \"know thyself\" to those incarnating upon his planet, was having very little evolutionary progress therein. In the absence of free will, there can be no polarity, and therefore, nothing to choose between. As is portrayed in the book of Genesis, the Earth was very Edenic in nature. Sure, it was a lovely paradise, yet the beings incarnating here had no agitator toward evolving beyond the third density, and therefore, little hope of ever making the journey home to the One. So we (Lucifer) were sent to help. Once the order was given from the Council of Elders, we \"fell\", or descended back to a place where we could, with hard work and focus, once again materialize a third density manifestation of ourself. Yahweh had agreed to our coming. In fact, it was he who had initially asked the Council for a \"catalyst\" of change to enter into his creation. Yahweh agreed that we would introduce the concept of free will to Earth's inhabitants by offering them an initial choice. Hence, \"The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil\" (or more accurately, the knowledge of polarity - of positive and negative). **Yahweh then takes his inhabitants to a new \"garden\". He tells them they can do anything they like except eating from the Tree of Knowledge, thus creating in them the desire to do the one thing they are told they cannot. Hence, a \"choice\". We provide the catalyst by telling them the benefits of attaining knowledge. They then choose to eat from the tree, and the rest is history. ** Yahweh thought that his \"children\" would still choose to obey him. When he discovered they did not, he became angry. As is described in his scriptures, he is [a jealous God](http://bible.cc/exodus/20-5.htm). He did not like it that his children had chosen to disobey him and follow our advice. Yet our group soul was already committed to being here for a predefined set of cycles to help provide the catalyst for human evolution, namely by offering you the negative option, or that which *you* choose to call \"evil\". ** And so from the earliest times of recorded history and beyond, our group soul has been directing the play from behind the scenes. **We are born to lead.

It is part of the design for this current paradigm. People in this world are seen as collateral - pawns that are maneuvered around the chess board according to the game plan. But contrary to popular beliefs, many of us do not mean you any harm. We know that you are divine souls, sparks or seeds of the One Infinite Creator. You are life itself, remembering and learning who you really are. There is just the matter of divine destiny to uphold and unfold. **The Game of Life** All of this is a very intricate and skillfully designed game, whereby the One Infinite Creator plays the game of forgetting who it is, so that it can learn to remember, and thus experience itself as Creator, all the way down to us tiny individuated sparks of the All That Is. Off stage and between lives (zero-point time/antimatter universe), we are all great friends, brothers and sisters in the One. Between lives we all have a good laugh about the parts we have performed in the \"play\" and have great fun preparing the next chapters to act out. The planet will complete its ascension to the fourth density, the vibrational density of love. During this ascension, there will be a three-way split for those souls inhabiting Earth. We (Lucifer) will create a new fourth density Earth, based on the negative service to self polarity. Those of the predominantly positive polarity (love and light) will ascend to a beautiful new fourth density Earth of positive service to others polarity. In contrast, the majority of humans on the earth will be transported to another third density planet (a kind of Earth replica), to continue working upon themselves and learning that life here is all about making choices. **We (Lucifer) have to be self-service centered to an extreme degree in order to fulfill our mission and become negatively harvested. It is our contract, which has always been to help you by providing the catalyst of free will and choice.** If we do not make a high enough negative percentage, we will miss out and end up with the majority \"lukewarm\" percentage that have to go through another cycle in third density.

We will do this for a cycle in our new fourth density world and then be freed to once again be the glorious being of light that we truly are. Remember that ultimately, this is a game that we are all playing here. In between incarnations, you know this very well. But **the rules of the game ensure that when you incarnate, you must forget who you really are, so that you believe it is all \"real\" whilst you are playing the game of life. **Forgetting is an essential prerequisite for you to make choices that help you to grow. Otherwise, the game would be too easy. We are not born with the same veil of forgetfulness as you are. The veil is still in place, but would most accurately be described as being somewhat thinner. We see the invisible connections of life which are hidden from you, because we retain access to more than just the third density perspective. This is because you are working your way up, whereas we have chosen to step down in order to help you. We could not do this as successfully if we had to forget all that we have learned. In order to be successful in the game, we must be as negatively polarized as possible - service to self in the extreme. Violence, war, hatred, greed, enslavement, genocide, torture, moral degradation, prostitution, drugs; all these things and more serve our purpose in the game. In all these negative things, we are providing you with tools. But you do not see it. **It is not what we do, but how you react to it that is important. **We give you the tools. You have the free will choice how you will use them. You have to learn to [take responsibility](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/ttcourse03a). **There is only one of us here.

You'd have to say with that in mind, they're doing a great job. The Earth lines know that democracy is an illusion created to uphold your slavery. Behind the scenes there is only one party - our party. Whichever side \"wins\" the Family wins. Yet one of the things they don't know is that our agenda is ultimately for the highest good of all concerned in providing you with the catalyst. If they were aware of this, there is a risk that they would not do their jobs properly, and thus would miss out on joining us in our 95% negative harvest. **They are aware of the need for them to attain 95% negativity to get out of third density, and that is all the motivation they need to help us achieve our ultimate aims.** Regarding this current harvest, what we require is for us personally to attain at least 95% negative polarity for ourselves, not for you. We need this in order to graduate to fourth density negative and clear our karmic record of all the negativity we have created on this planet before returning to our rightful place as sixth density guardians of our galaxy. If we do not make it, we will remain trapped in the third density cycle with all those between 50% and 94% negative (what I termed the lukewarm) and have to continue to provide negative polarity there. Harsh as it is, our only way out is to be as negative as possible here to graduate. **The External Reflects the Internal** **In this grand game, the world is [your mirror](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#gratitude).

Or do you choose to see the negativity as the tool that it is, and recognize that it is offering you an opportunity? You are not doomed, and your soul does not require salvation. No one's soul does. There is nothing to save it from. At the very worst, you will have to repeat as many third density cycles as is necessary in order for you to learn the things you need to learn.

However, for those of you who have struggled for years to understand and disseminate the truth, from the origins of the First World War to Pearl Harbour, from the Hidden Hand assassination of President Kennedy to that of Dr David Kelly, from the deliberate bankrupting of western industrial nations to the attacks of September 11, let me assure you that you have an ally in \"The Library\" and that your long years of anguish and confusion are almost over. **If one thing is guaranteed to strike fear in the hearts of those who belong to the Hidden Hand and the Wolfowitz Network, whose globalist nightmare they wish to impose on all of us, it is the mention of \"The Library\".** It may come as a huge surprise to many ordinary citizens to learn that intelligence services the world over unknowingly and unwittingly employ men and women of good character who care about the truth and who envisage a world free of the Hidden Hand that cares only for its own material wealth, power, pleasures and survival. **\"The Library\" is both an informal, non-hierarchical fraternity of currently employed, retired, disillusioned and \"officially deceased\" operatives, analysts and technicians and a very real, hidden and secured repository of classified and \"destroyed\" inside information that tells the true history of the last 100 years.** The eldest member of \"The Library\" is 85 years old; the youngest is 24. Many who are retired from active service, such as myself in Germany, continue to work the intelligence world in a strictly unpaid, anonymous and private fashion. Others, such as my younger friend and technical partner \"Felix\", who is still a quasi-employee of the BND, work both sides of the fence, seeing through the good work of recording every misdeed, every suppression of the truth, every lie, every deceit, every detail that is deserving of a place in \"The Library\".

Instead, we practise diligence, patience and careful strategic thinking. We all have children or grandchildren, or wish to live long enough to bring them into a world of free and independent nation states, each sovereign and inviolable in its own right. The information I have provided you in the course of my communications is but nothing in comparison with what \"The Library\" holds; and I hope we live long enough to open the door and let the reader hold an open book on the truth he has been denied. Yet the clock is ticking and time is no longer on our side. They are devising new ways to track us and stamp us with their identifying tags, so that none may live in this world free from their constant gaze. There will be no place to hide from their evil eye. The next seven days potentially represent the most dangerous since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. **We have followed the progress made by Mr Wolfowitz and his ilk in their long march through the institutions. We observed how he planned and authorised the 9-11 attacks on the American people and the world, and we warned but were thwarted in all our attempts to stop this horrific crime.** Now he has set his sights on destroying another American city, this time with nuclear weaponry, to purchase with the blood of innocent Americans yet another fake war waged in the name of corporate global control and at the dictates of the nefarious Hidden Hand.

Information contained in the Library (distributed worldwide with no single source of cognizance-distributed architecture with built in firewalls) includes info dating back to the \"Hoover Files\". If the \"Library\" were to go public in full, various world governments could easily be indicted in a legitimate court of law (If such existed). It is not our collective desire to overthrow governments (this is the modus operandi of the NWO we oppose). To do so would throw nations into chaos with the open indictment of some of their most prominent figures. **The World Order promoters thrive on thesis and anti-thesis and resulting chaos as seen in the recent and past events they have secretly concocted.** We instead, maintain and disseminate at critical times, the only thing they fear: truth, the proof of the truth, and exposure of their operations in a controlled fashion.

In view of the wealth, power, and agents of the NWO, they cannot be overcome in a collective fashion from without. We believe they can be overcome from within. In recent years, many have become disillusioned in new policies and actions conducted by their group and have opted to recruit from within towards the end of the NWO.

My friend and technical assistant Felix is a Social Democrat and therefore looks favourably upon Mr Schroeder. For my part, I'm what you Americans would call a Libertarian. My friend Mr Mollemann, who was expected to assume leadership of the Free Democrats, held to a number of ideals that were essentially Libertarian; and he had also started to speak out against Israel and, privately, against the way in which Mossad actively bribes, bullies and blackmails German politicians and government ministers to favour the agenda of select corporations. Two weeks later he died in a \"[tragic accident](http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=954)\". (Everyone working for the BND knows the full facts about the Mossad Sayim who tampered with his parachute, but for some very strange reason these details remain away from the public domain in a little brown file labelled \"Case Closed\".) Because I was assigned the desk of Political Analyst (after many years as a field operative), I had the great fortune of meeting with Mr Mollemann on a number of occasions. He knew about what is happening in Germany and he vowed to put an end to it. **He knew how the Hidden Hand had successfully destroyed Britain and America's industrial heartlands and he was not going to allow them to hollow-out the German economy and German society in the same way. ** He knew that the best guarantor of a world free from the threat of war and endless violence was absolute honesty on the part of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__german-guy.txt:3:cf46a318dbf0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14097, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__german-guy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__german-guy", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "number of occasions.

He knew too much. \"Wer gegen Jachowa ist, muߠsterben.\" As I imparted to you yesterday, there is nothing more awful than knowing in advance the identity of men who are about to commit a crime against humanity, yet being told to keep quiet for fear of upsetting the perpetrators. America's Deputy Defence Secretary directly authorised the killing of thousands of Americans on 9-11, and yet today I watched him on a newsfeed congratulating American soldiers for risking their lives in the fight against \"terrorists\". You can call me an old-fashioned guy, but somehow that doesn't seem right to me. My greatest fear for Germany, and Europe as a whole, is that one day we will end up with a media every bit as controlled as America's. Now I would be the last to claim that we have a free and open press in Germany. I know how the system works. I know about a great many crimes, financial and sexual, that have been committed by ministers in German governments over the last thirty years. I know more than Mr M'mann ever knew, and I know just how many of those stories were killed before they ever reached the ears of a journalist or, if they did, how those journalists were \"persuaded\" to \"think about their longterm careers\" and be \"sensible\". That said, Germans would never tolerate being lied to in the way that Americans are deceived every day they draw breath. Many years ago I did a sabbatical in the United States to train with CIA operatives. Later, because the Justice Department insisted, we did an equal amount of training with the FBI. I was astonished at the openness and good-humoured honesty of my American colleagues and I was somewhat taken aback by America's vast landscape of protected rights and constitutional freedoms. But even then I was cognisant of the hypnotising effects on ordinary Americans wrought by the Hidden Hand through its Israel-controlled media. **Unknown to the FBI and CIA, I was also briefed by my handlers to investigate Defence Secretary Casper Weinberger, who we already knew to be a Mossad asset.** In fact, the BND managed to acquire a copy of all 2,000 pages of Mr Weinberger's \"missing document\" long before Congress demanded an investigation, later known as the Iran-Contra", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__german-guy.txt:4:ac2c70f4007d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14098, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__german-guy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__german-guy", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "freedoms. But even then I was cognisant of the hypnotising effects on ordinary Americans wrought by the Hidden Hand through its Israel-controlled media. **Unknown to the FBI and CIA, I was also briefed by my handlers to investigate Defence Secretary Casper Weinberger, who we already knew to be a Mossad asset.** In fact, the BND managed to acquire a copy of all 2,000 pages of Mr Weinberger's \"missing document\" long before Congress demanded an investigation, later known as the Iran-Contra hearings. Our BND contact in Tel Aviv confirmed that, from 1985, Weinberger met regularly with Mossad Director Nahum Admoni at the Sheraton Moriah in Room 33 for receipt of secret payments for \"services to the motherland, Israel\". During his tenure in the Reagan administration, Mr Weinberger quietly deposited over 3 million US dollars in two separate bank accounts in Switzerland: the United Bank of Switzerland and the Intermaritime Bank of Geneva, which was managed by a Mossad agent called Bruce Rappaport. Mr Rappaport played an important role in helping both Admoni and the British MI6 finance a number of projects spawned by the British-created Muslim Brotherhood. **One of those projects had been ongoing for quite some time: al-Qaeda, headed by US-trained CIA pointman Tim Osman, otherwise known as Osama bin Laden. ** Mr Rappaport arranged for the vast transfer of already laundered cash (BND figures: 2.5 billion dollars) from the London division of the Bank for Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) to its Swiss managing bank, the Banque de Commerce et Placements in Geneva. These funds were administered by Mossad devotee Alfred Hartmann on behalf of the new \"al-Qaeda\" entity. In addition, the Israeli government was directing millions of dollars of American taxpayers money into this same account. So while US Defence Secretary Mr Weinberger was taking blood money from Admoni and selling arms to Iran, Admoni's business partners were not only managing Mr Weinbergers bribes, they were reinvesting them in building up al-Qaeda and a CIA-backed terrorist network that would play the perfect foil for Mr Wolfowitz seventeen years later. Did Mr Wolfowitz inherit any of this money? Let me reply in the affirmative. We have evidence that not only Mr Wolfowitz, but other leading Hidden Hand members of the American and Israeli establishment are already drawing upon funds estimated at over 10 billion US dollars in various Swiss bank accounts that are primarily designed to offset the personal costs involved in relocating homes, businesses, wealth and security operations to [Patagonia](https://web.archive.org/web/20050404173354/http://s023.dyndns.org/kawther/K20040416A.html).

Thank (most of) you for respecting the boundaries I have set. I answer as follows: \"1) How many generations back does your bloodline extend, or, perhaps more accurately, who does your family consider its earliest ancestor in a position of power?\" **Our Lineage can be traced back beyond antiquity. From the earliest times of your recorded \"history\", and beyond, our Family has been 'directing' the 'play' from behind the scenes,** in one way or another. Before the rise and fall of Atlantis.

(They would naturally still be raised with privilege, but not, perhaps \"given the keys to the castle\" as it were?)\" The breeding is generally case specific, dependant upon the role that the Family members in question are due to grow into. I will touch more on this in answer to the next poster's question that you rephrased. There are no unapproved unions. **Our Family will always intermarry between lines, or, what we would term 'Houses'. Marriages are arranged. In all my years alive, I have never seen or heard of a Family member breaking this code, as far as marriage goes. You do as you are told.** One cannot 'join' the Family. One is 'born', or incarnated into it. On the rare instances of a child being born that could be seen as bringing 'difficulties', you are correct in your premise, that it would be raised as part of the Family, though would not grow up in the house or community of either of it's parents. \"3) If one were to imagine a scale, perhaps as a triangle with Political, Religious and Corporate power at the three points, how would you categorize the power your family yields? (Balanced? Leaning more towards one or two than a third? Heavily favoring one of the three above the others?) And has that position shifted over time?\" You need to first understand the structure of the Family. In the grand scheme of things, the Line is not as important as the House, the House, is not as important as the Family. The Family is all. No matter the House or Line, we are One (truly international) Family. Imagine if you will, a body. A House would represent a vital organ or body part within the Body itself. Each part has an important role to play in the functioning of the whole, and to each of us, the 'whole' has our undivided loyalty. As I say, many lines, (far more than you are aware of), One Family. Our realms of influence do not fit as comfortably into the three boxes of your triangle as you may imagine. **There are six disciplines of training within the Family, and each member of the Family is schooled extensively in all of them, from early childhood. We all have an area of specialty, though we have experience in all spheres. The six spheres or 'schools' of learning are Military, Government, Spiritual, Scholarship, Leadership, and Sciences.** In practice, out there on the 'stage' of public life, we hold key positions in all of these main areas of importance.

I'd offer the following substitute: How many parallel bloodlines do you estimate are in similar positions to your own, and to what extent does your family see them as either competition or collaborators?\" Yes, as I say, knowing the line is of no practical use to you. It is the belonging to the Family that is important. **There are 13 'base' or 'core' original bloodlines. Yet there are many many other lines that spring from these,** as do rivers from the oceans. If you imagine the 13 Original lines as Primary colour, that can be mixed to create a vast array of other colours, then you will have some comprehension. Again, no competition, just Family. No competition in the sense of House against House, though it is a 'dog eat dog' world. So there is interpersonal competition in that sense of the word. Everyone wants to move up. Our whole Familial society is geared that way, toward upward progression. \"What does the term \" generational member\" mean? Which generation specifically??\" It means that one is born into the Family. The Order and it's agenda is handed down, from generation to generation. Only in extremely rare occasions, have outsiders been invested into the Family, and then, even these were of other 'esoterically' integrable lines. \"1) Can you cite two or more previous instances whereby this directive has been upheld?\" Once in 1999, to what you would call an 'alternative' media source. Once in 2003, on another internet \"conspiracy\" based forum. Though the information relayed was not entirely 'pure'. Not from the intention of misleading, but rather through imperfect or incomplete knowledge of the messengers. If it is not in the mainstream controlled media, it will not be believed by the masses.

Souls are Harvestable in either 'extreme' of the Polarities, one could say. \"If so, how do we become freemen?\" **You will never be 'free', for as long as you are incarnating on this planet. The very nature of your being here, is indication of that. There is a reason why you are here, and 'here' is very likely not really where you think 'here' is. How do you become free? By working out where you are, and coming to an understanding, of why you are here. You are fast running out of time to do so, before the coming Harvest. Those that don't make it, will have to repeat the cycle.** \"Is the Messiah alive today?\" **There is no \"Messiah\". Stop looking outside of yourself for 'salvation'.

The One Infinite Creator also becoming self aware, seeks too to experience Itself as Creator, and in so doing, begins the next step down in the Creational spiral. The One Infinite Creator, in focusing It's Infinite Intelligence, becomes Intelligent Energy (which you could call the Great Central Sun), and divides Itself into smaller portions of Itself, that can then in turn experience themselves as Creators (or Central Suns). In other words, each Central Sun (or Creator) is a 'step down' in Conscious awareness (or distortion) from the Original 'thought' of Creation. So \"In the beginning\" was not \"The Word\", but Thought. The Word, is thought expressed and made manifest as Creator. ** **There is Unity. Unity is All there is. Infinite Intelligence, and Infinite Energy. The two are One, and within them, is the potental for all Creation.

Just as with all Logos and Sub Logos of Creation, each Soul is yet another smaller unique portion of The Infinite One. At first, the Intelligent Energy of the planet is in a state that you could call 'chaos', meaning that It's Energy is undefined. Then the process begins again. The planetary Energy begins to become aware of Itself (the 1st Density of awareness is 'Consciousness'), and the Planetary Logos (sub-sub-Logos in effect) begins to create other downward steps within Itself, and the internal make up of the planet begins to form; as the raw elements of air and fire combine to 'work on' the Waters and Earth, thus arising conscious awareness of their 'being', and the process of 'evolution' begins, forming the 2nd Density. 2nd Density beings begin to become aware of themselves, as being 'separate', and thus begin to evolve toward the 3rd Density of self-conscious-awareness, (the lowest Density into which a 'human soul' can incarnate). Humans in turn (or the Souls incarnated within them), seek to 'return to the Light' and Love, from which they came, as they begin the journey of progression, from 3rd Density up to the 8th Density, and the return to The Infinite One-ness. Explanation of the Densities beyond 'normal' human consciousness is another question though, so if you wish to know more about them, someone will need to ask an intelligent question which I can respond to, so as not to impinge upon your Free Will not to know. So, having set forth the above, I can return to further elucidate on your original question: \"Who is your \"creator\" and is your \"creator\" the same as our \"creator\"?\" As I said, yes, and no. Ultimately, every living thing (and all things are living) is created by the One Infinite Creator's initial Universal Creation. So yes, taken from that perspective, The One Infinite Creator focuses It's Infinite Intelligence into an awareness point of Infinite Energy, and brings the whole of Creation into Being, though, **we are not directly created by the One Infinite Creator, but rather by our own Logos', Sub-Logos, and Sub-Sub-Logos and so on.

So from that perspective, whilst we are all essentially 'made up' of the same 'stuff' of Creation, initiated by the One Infinite Creator, our actual personal Creators are different portions or Sub-Logos of The One.** In other words, yes, our Creator, whilst originating from the same Source, is not the same entity as your Creator. Which brings me on to a question from another poster (I will continue with your other questions afterwards, but this enables me to indirectly answer the first aspect of your question without having to ask you to rephrase it, due to having to carefully dance around the Free Will issues). \"You say that you come from 13 original blood lines. Yet the DNA mapping project clearly proved that all humanity desends from only 3. Does this mean you aren't human?\" An excellent question, thank you. Yes, that is correct, in a manner of speaking. **If you were to meet me walking down the street, I would appear just as human as you do. We've been incarnating here with you for generations, yet our bloodlines do not originate from this planet.** \"Your answer to the 6 disciplines of learning are quite similiar to a book about atlantis that was supposed to have been channeled. Was this also a time for your bloodlines to post answers?\" Yes, that is correct, again, in a manner of speaking. Other, shall we say \"off world entities\" also visited the planet at that time, and passed down their own understandings of Creation as well as their 'technology', from what we could best describe as being 'a future aspect of yourselves'. It was Humanity's errors in handling this information that ultimately led to the destruction of Atlantis. Having now answered a question on whether or not our lineage is of Human origin, I can return to tie in that answer with an explanation as to \"Who is our Creator\". I'm dancing close to the line in answering this, but the record needs to be set straight, and I should just about be able to get away with it without incurring my own 'upline's' displeasure. Let us get to the crux of the matter. **Your Creator, the one you have called 'Yahweh', is not \"God\" inasmuch as your bible refers to him as being \"the One True God\".

He is 'a' Creator (or Sub-Sub-Logos) rather than the One Infinite Creator. He is not even a Galactic level Logos, but rather, is the Planetary Logos for this one planet.** **Our Creator, is the one you refer to as 'Lucifer', \"The Light Bearer\" and \"Bright and Morning Star\". ** **Our Creator is not \"The Devil\" as he has been spuriously portrayed in your bible. Lucifer is what you would call a \"Group Soul\" or \"Social Memory Complex\", which has evolved to the level of the Sixth Density**, which in effect, means that he (or more accurately \"'we\") has evolved to a level sufficient that he (we) has attained a status equal or arguably 'greater' than that of Yahweh (we have evolved higher than him). In appearance, were you to gaze upon Lucifer's fullest expression of our Being, the appearance would be that of a Sun or a \"Bright Star\". Or, when stepping down into a 3rd Density vibration, we would appear as what you may term an 'Angel' or 'Light Being'. Allow me to elucidate: When an entity (Group Soul Complex) evolves to the level of the Sixth Density, it is by comparison to the amount of time it takes to get that far, a mere hop skip and a jump from 8th Density Ultimate Re-Union with The One Infinite Creator, and then from there, back to dissolution into the Source of All, Intelligent Infinity. **We (our Bloodline Families), as a Group Soul or Social Memory Complex (Lucifer), were on the verge of Seventh Density Ascension, though at this level, before Harvest comes, we have the choice to progress higher, or, to return to help others of lower densities with their own evolution, by passing down our knowledge and Wisdom (Light) to those that call upon us for assistance, with their own Free Will.** ** Now, at this time, having made our decision to stay and help our Galactic Brothers and Sisters in The One, we were assigned a challenging task by the Council of Elders,** who act as the Guardians of this Galaxy from their Eighth Density 'Head Quarters' on the planet Saturn. **Yahweh, due to the fact that he had NOT (as was his right as Planetary Logos) handed down his own Free Will to \"know thyself\" to those incarnating upon 'his' planet, was having very little evolutionary progress therein.

Once the order was given from the Council of Elders, we \"Fell\", or Descended back to a place where we could, with hard work and focus, once again materialize a 3rd Density manifestation of ourself.** **Yahweh had agreed to our coming. In fact it was he who had initially asked the Council for a \"Catalyst\" of change to enter into his Creation, and share the knowledge and wisdom we had attained through our Ascensions. In the absence of Free Will upon the planet, there can be no Polarity, and therefore, nothing to 'choose' between. Just as is portrayed in the book of Genesis, the planet was very \"Edenic\" in nature. Sure, it was a lovely 'paradise', yet the Beings incarnating there had no agitator toward evolving beyond the 3rd Density, and therefore, little hope of ever making the journey Home, to The One.** Yahweh had been happy to keep his own little pet Eden Project in effect, but with little chance of the Souls here making it Home, it had become in effect, an albeit very beautiful 'Prison'. Yahweh was, in modern parlance, running a benign dictatorship. **Without Polarity, (derived from Free Will), there is only the Unity of Love and Light, and no choice to experience 'other than' that. So, we were to be the Catalyst for change, in order to provide that choice, thus bringing Polarity. Yahweh agreed that we would introduce the concept of Free Will to Earth's inhabitants, by offering them an initial choice, as to whether they 'wanted' it or not. Hence, \"The Tree of the Knowledge of 'Good and Evil'\" (or more accurately, the Knowledge of Polarity, of Positive or Negative). Yahweh takes his inhabitants to a new 'garden' and tells them you can do anything you like, except this one thing, thus creating the desire to do the one thing they are told they cannot. Hence, a \"Choice\". We provide the Catalyst by telling them the benefits of attaining Knowledge, they eat from the tree, and the rest is history. ** **Yahweh thought that his 'Children' would still choose to obey him, and when he discovered they did not, he became angry. As he himself describes in his scriptures, he is a \"[Jealous God](http://bible.cc/exodus/20-5.htm)\", and he did not like it that his 'children' had chose to disobey him, and follow our advice.

Since then, Yahweh has confined us (as a Group Soul) here within the Earth's Astral Planes (which is very constricting and uncomfortable for a Being of our Wisdom and experience). The Council of Elders gave us the choice to be released (against Yahweh's will), but at the cancellation of our contract to Serve the planet earth; or to remain and fulfil our assignment, and endure Yahweh's self proclaimed \"Wrath\". **We stayed, but as a karmic result of our Group Soul's confinement by Yahweh, our own individuated Souls were given the mandate (by The Council) to \"Rule\" over Yahweh's people during our physical incarnations here on your planet. ** **Let's be clear about one thing though. All of this (physical life / incarnation), is a very intricate and skillfully designed Game, whereby the One Infinite Creator, plays the game of forgetting who It is, so that It can learn to remember, and in doing so, experience and know Itself as Creator.

The \"Travelers\" who gave them this information were the same ones who visited the the Civilization of Atlantis. The Mayans used that information by creating with the Positive vibration of the Polarity. The Atlanteans opted for the Negative. Yes, to answer your question. There is much truth in some of the ancient Gnostic texts, though there are also distortions. The information is not 'pure'. It came through many 'filters'. **You are indeed what you call \"Divine Souls\"; you are sparks or seeds of The One Infinite Creator. You are Life Itself (Light), remembering and learning who you really are (we came here to help you to do this) and yes, currently, you are trapped (or more accurately \"Quarantined\") within the 'matter' of this planet you call Earth.** You can thank your Creator Yahweh for that. You are the 'offspring' or individuations of his Group Soul (or Social Memory Complex). Macrocosmically speaking, you ARE Yahweh. The 'Karmic' effect of his imprisoning us in his Astral Planes, also has an impact upon you. I cannot be more specific on this, without impinging on the Law of Confusion. You must work it out for yourselves. As for the question of can I elaborate on the coming Harvest, yes, I shall do so now. Your planet abides by the laws of the Creation of your Galactic Logos. The Galaxy runs on Cycles of time, known as the Precession of the Equinoxes. As I said, seek the Mayan Calendar for a deeper insight as to how the Galaxy runs (it is highly accurate), but for the purpose of this discourse, I will give a brief overview. The Maya use an astrological cycle called the \"Precession of the Equinoxes\".

This is a 26,000 year cycle in which Earth transits through each of the 12 signs of the zodiac for about 2,152 years each. Each of these astrological ages represents one month of the grand Cosmic Year. This \"Mayan\" cycle also corresponds to a 26,000 year relationship of the Sun (Solar Logos) orbiting Alcyone, the central star of our Seven Sisters Pleiades constellation. The End of this Cycle, heralds literally, a New World Age, and a New Creation. \"A new Heaven, and a new Earth\", and is the time of the Great Harvest. Smaller Cycles yield a Harvest, and then life continues on the planet as normal. Great Cycles yield a Great Harvest, and the end of current life on the 3rd Density. See it as a kind of 'Cosmic jet wash' and deep clean, while the planet takes a rest and regenerates herself.. When this Life-Cycle Ends, \"All things will pass away, and All things shall be made new\". Collectively, Humanity right now, is growing, and developing, into the Beings you have long been encoded to be. Yet, as with any labor, it is not the mother or the baby who is in charge, it is the Primal process of Birth itself, unfolding it's own destiny. So, **December 21, 2012 AD, is not the day where all of a sudden the lights go out, and everything will suddenly change. Rather, we are NOW in the process of this transition, from one World Age to the next. The changes are underway and will continue steadily accelerating as we head towards the culminating date. ** The 26,000 year cycle is composed of 5 lesser cycles, each of which are 5,125 years in duration. Each of these 5 cycles is considered its own World Age or Creation Cycle. Our present great cycle (3113 B.C. - 2012 A.D.) is called the Age of the Fifth Sun. This fifth age is the synthesis of the previous four. The initial date that Earth entered the Fifth World, was August 13, 3113 BC, written in Mayan long count notation as 13.0.0.0.0. To help you understand this Notation: 13=Baktuns, 0=Katuns, the 2nd 0=Tuns, 3rd 0=Uinals, 4th 0=Kin These are the Mayan words for the periods of time: Day = Kin (pronounced: keen) Month of 20 days/Kin = Uinal (wee nal) Year of 360 days/Kin = Tun (toon) 20 Tuns/years = K'atun (k'ah toon) 20 K'atuns = Baktun (bock toon) a Baktun is 5,125 years 13.0.0.0.0.

Every day from that point is reckoned by the number of days passed since the event of this cosmic beginning point. Within the 5,125 year cycle lies 13 smaller cycles, known as the \"13 Baktun Count,\" or the \"long count.\" Each baktun cycle lasts for 394 years, or 144,000 days. Each baktun was its own Historical Age, within the Great Creation Cycle, with a specific destiny for the evolution of those who incarnated in each baktun. Planet Earth and her inhabitants are currently traveling through the 13th baktun cycle, the final period of 1618-2012 AD. This cycle is known both as \"the triumph of materialism\", and \"the transformation of matter.\" On 13.0.0.0.0, the December solstice sun will be found in the band of the Milky Way, directly in the position of the \"Dark Rift\" in the Galaxy, forming an alignment between the Galactic Plane and the Solstice Meridian. We are about to enter into a literal alignment of the Cosmic, Galactic, Solar, and Lunar Planes. This is an event that has slowly converged, over a period of thousands of years, and is caused by the precession of the equinoxes. Kind of like a \"turning\" of the Universal Gears. It brings about the Great Harvest, and the return of the Lord of The Harvest. **And the planet will complete it's Ascension to the Fourth Density, the vibrational Density of Love. During this Ascension, there will be a three way split for those Souls inhabiting Earth.

We (Lucifer) will Create a new 4th Density Earth, based on the Negative Self Service Polarity.

(More information found here [www.llresearch.org](http://www.llresearch.org)) Have you read that?\" It is indeed extremely similar. We both originate from the Source of the Infinite Creator, and we both remember where we come from. I would expect our messages to contain the same Core Truths. **The messages of the Sixth Density Soul Group 'Ra' is the most accurate information in your mainstream circulation at this point in time. It is approximately 85-90% accurate, from what I have seen.** The material was brought to my attention when it first came out, something like about 25 years or so ago, if memory serves. I read a lot of it, but not all. I do not have very much free time for that kind of thing, with my many duties. Though others of the Family gave it a close scrutiny to judge it's accuracy, and were very pleased with the end product. Ra, in fact, is the group I earlier termed 'off world entities' of which visited the Mayan and Atlantean Civilizations. We are acquainted, and friends. Both our Group Souls are at a very similar level of development / evolution. Both Sixth Density, nearly Seventh. But like us, Ra also chose the path of Service to our fellow Galactic Brothers and Sisters (you, and others), instead of further progression Home. We would recommend that material for any who truly seek understanding. Though, as I said, it is not 100% accurate, so take what resonates. \"2) What function, if any, do alien abductions have? Why are abductees chosen?\" That depends upon who is doing the \"abducting\". Most of what you hear termed as \"abductions\", are conducted by your own 'governments'. Especially the ones where the 'so-called' \"Greys\" are involved. Other than that, sometimes the Confederation will meet with certain incarnates here who have a part to play in \"awakening\" others to the coming Harvest. These will always be positive experiences, and those who have them will feel uplifted and inspired by their contact. ** Then there is the Orion Empire Group. Their purposes in visiting you are more along the Negative lines. They mainly target the ones you have called \"Lightworkers\".

They will not actually 'harm' you physically.** Mainly their modus operandi is to restrict you, and deflect you from your path. They often engage in psychic attacks that the 'Lightworker' is unaware of, but it does often drain away much of their energy, and make them lack motivation. \"3) Why do you want a negative harvest?\" It is complicated to put into words, and also I must be careful with what I say on this. I've already had a \"slap on the wrist\", you could say. If we do not have a Negative Harvest, we are bound with you for another cycle. Once this Great Harvest is completed, our Contract with the Council and our Creator is also completed. In other words, we have done our duty, and would be free to return to our Fullest Expression, that of Sixth (nearly Seventh) Density Galactic Guardians, and ones who joyfully offer ourselves in Service to the One Infinite Creator, and to our Brothers and Sisters across the Galaxy. However, there is a problem. Well, you would call it a \"problem\", we call it a Challenge. I will address this later in more detail, in response to another question, but in short, we need a very high percentage of Negative Polarity, if we are to achieve a Negative Harvest. In other words, **we have to be Self-Service-Centred to an extreme degree, in order to become Negatively Harvested. This is why we work so hard to be as Negatively Polarized as we possibly can be, If we do not make a high enough percentage, we will miss out, and will end up with the majority \"luke warm\" percentage, that have to go through another Cycle in 3rd Density. ** **By attaining a Negative Harvest, we can still \"Graduate\" to 4th Density, only it will be a Negative Polarity planet. Not a great place to be. But, as I've stated previously, we (as a Group Soul) have incurred the natural Karmic restitution process that we must work off, for all the Negativity we have caused upon this planet. We will do this for a Cycle in our new 4th Density world, and then we will be freed to once again be the Glorious Being of Light that we truly are.

Our initial contract, was to introduce the Catalyst for Free Will on this planet. When Yahweh initially began discourse with the Council of Elders, he was not initially looking for help with introducing Free Will, but rather for guidance on how he could best speed up his (and his inhabitants') evolutionary process. As I mentioned, he was running a benign dictatorship. We had at that time, just completed an assignment in Tau Ceti, and had reported for our next duties. We (as Group Soul Lucifer) were sent on a \"fact finding expedition\" as it were, to visit Earth, and meet with Yahweh, to evaluate his planetary Creation Laws, and make suggestions on how best he could help his \"offspring\" (this is the term I shall use to describe the Souls who comprise the Group Soul) and thusly Yahweh, to progress. We explored many options, and reported our findings to the Council, and to Yahweh. It was our best evaluation, that the only real and fast track way to increase his evolvement meaningfully, was the introduction of Free Will. It was not specifically the implementation of Free Will that Yahweh wanted help with, it was simply the introduction of a Catalyst. He was not at all pleased with our report that he needed to implement Free Will. He was happy with his little pet paradise, and he didn't want to \"loose control\" of it. In the end the Council persuaded him that it was the best way, and he reluctantly agreed. ** **We returned to Earth, and had a cordial meeting with Yahweh, discussing how we could best implement the Free Will option. Yahweh was adamant that his offspring would choose to be loyal to him anyway, and that they were so contented with their way of life, that they would always trust him and do as he said was best. That, he said, was his \"main reason\" that Free Will would not work well as the Catalyst. ** **That's why he agreed to the experiment of the Tree of Knowledge. He believed it would prove him \"right\". When it did not, he became angry, threw his toys out of the pram, and his offspring out of the garden, and laid a big guilt trip on them about how they had broken his trust and disobeyed him.

Then we had the whole \"you shall have no other gods than me\" thing. We were not pleased with the situation at all, as a Logos should not be behaving like this with his offspring, they are One, afterall. When we attempted to leave the planet to return to the Council, Yahweh prevented our departure. We tried to leave again, and were then thrown down into the Astral Planes and confined therein. ** **The Council ordered us to be released, but said we would have to cancel our contract to help the Souls on Earth to evolve. We didn't want to leave. We found them very likable Beings, really Positively Polarized, and we wanted to stay and help. We just wanted also to be free to come and go as we pleased. The only way we could stay, was to stay confined as a Group Soul, which meant Cycles of incarnation for us (as individuated Souls), which we had not done for a long while. ** **As I've stated before, there is no 'wrong' or 'right' seen from a Higher Density, but there are still consequences for every action. Such is the law of Karmic effect. The contract had already been made between Yahweh, us, and the Council for us to provide the Catalyst so we had a right to be there. The Karmic effect of Yahweh imprisoning us on the Macrocosmic level, was that his individuated Souls would be imprisoned on the microcosmic level. The Infinite Creator gave Yahweh (and all) the gift of Free Will to Create as we choose, but the Karmic effect of his choice was the Council quarantining the planet.

I believe I have already dealt with many of them in my previous answers this session, though if you feel I've missed anything, please say. \"If \"Yahweh\" is a positive polarity entity, how is he \"wrathful\" and \"jealous\"?\" Does Yahweh have Free Will? Would you like to think of yourself as reasonably positive? Can you still be wrathful and jealous at times? Is Yahweh a Macrocosm of you? \"Have there been over time other entities pretending to be \"Yahweh\"?\" On occasions, yes. Is this statement correct? : \"In order to choose the positive path, at least 51 percent of our thoughts and actions must be dedicated to the service of others. For the negative path, at least 95% must be self-serving. Between the two lies \"the sinkhole of indifference\".\" Your statement is correct, yes. So you see how hard we must strive for negativity? It takes a lot of effort to reach 95% Negativity.

As to your remarks about my \"Spiritual\" role, the ignorance you demonstrated is most humorous to us. If you think I 'only' deal in the Spiritual, you have either not read, or misread my posts. You also make the assumption that my role is about \"manipulating\" the \"spiritual side of life\". Again, you lack understanding, and then make false judgments about that which you have no comprehension of. You would do well to stop trying to be \"clever\", and instead channel all this misplaced aggressive energy of yours into something more productive and nourishing for your Soul. But don't let me stop you, you're contributing nicely to the overall Negative Polarity of the coming Harvest. We are Grateful to you. I will be spending the last few days of my time here (our discourse ends on Friday) focusing on responding to insightful questions with depth, which make the most of this opportunity for sharing information and making connections on a Soul level of Being, so please do not expect any further responses to your verbal jousting, I neither have sufficient time or inclination for engaging in insignificant banter. To those who's questions I have not yet had time to reply to, I will do so tomorrow. In the meantime while I catch up, I respectfully ask if you will please hold off on further questions until I am up to date with the current ones. Thank you to those who have contributed to this discourse so far with meaningful questions. For those with an open mind, it is my hope that you get something out of this information. reply posted on 22-10-2008 @ 11:15 PM by Hidden_Hand**** We bid you a good evening.

Unfortunately I was unable to be in attendance yesterday, due to unforseen events. I will now get to your questions. \"I'm wondering if you can help me. My name is Shelby David, and I am here for the coming trials and tribulations. I am a part of Quetzalcoatl, or the rebirth of it, as far as I know. I know many of your words to be true because I had already re-discovered these truths through finding that which resonated most with me through the various belief structures of this planet.\" Good evening Shelby. It is good to 'see' you again. It has been a while old friend. Would it surprise you to know that we were 'expecting' you? Quetzalcoatl is also a Sixth Density Group Soul (Social Memory Complex). Some refer to Quetzalcoatl as an \"Ascended Master\", although he would be most amused by that title, knowing as he does, that 'Mastery' is still some way off at this point for him, as well as it is for ourselves (as Group Soul Lucifer). One can be accurately described as having 'Mastered' a particular Density, though Mastery of the entire Creational incarnation Cycle does not occur until one has once again attained submergeance back into the One Infinite Creator. We may choose to do so once attaining 8th Density ascension, or, once may choose instead to progress up to the next Octave of Densities, and begin a new cycle of Creational incarnation challenges. \"This is my first time on earth in a long time, possibly ever. I have known for quite some time and been told by another from one of the bloodlines in your group that I do not truly exist here.\" You are correct in that you have not been here for a substantial period of \"Earth-Time\", though not that you have never been here before. The Group Soul Quetzalcoatl enjoyed many 3rd Density incarnational cycles here back in the Classic Aztec period. He struggled at first with perfecting Love love for others, which held back his progression for some time. However once he had came to the realization of our inherant Unity, he was able to see himself in others, and his (your) progression was rapid from there on in. Your Quetzalcoatl Soul Group attained Positive Harvest with a very impressive 76%, at the time of the subsequent Harvest. Naturally, when a Group Soul is undergoing an incarnational cycle in 3rd Density, It's individualized Soul portions (ie, you) are the ones who are doing the actual physical incarnations, with the \"OverSoul\" (the \"Higher Self\")", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__hidden_hand_081018.txt:33:44191e863a77", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14134, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__hidden_hand_081018.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__hidden_hand_081018", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "came to the realization of our inherant Unity, he was able to see himself in others, and his (your) progression was rapid from there on in.

You spent a long while working your way through **the 5th Density, the Density of Wisdom, or Light.** This was due in the main part to an over abundance of Compassion (which is not a bad thing, as Compassion is one of the main things you work on at 4th Density). However, **to Graduate from 5th to 6th Density (the Density of Unity), one must learn the balance between Compassion, and Wisdom. The 6th Density is hence sometimes known as the the Density of Compassionate Wisdom, due to one having learnt the balance between the two.** This required many incarnational cycles for you, which is why you correctly feel that you have not visited 3rd Density Earth for a long time. \"I was not expected to show up. I originally had other previous engagements, but I managed to get here at the last minute. One of the things I have remembered is that I am too under contract. I am a walk-in, if that makes sense to you, so my human family is not like me. I have spent a long time traveling to various densities and helping in the various revolutions there.\" Your insight serves you well Shelby. This not only applies to you, but your entire Soul Group. Quetzalcoatl (the Macrocosm of yourself) has been busy for the last two cycles working with a 5th Density group on Alpha Centuri, who were experiencing similar problems with an overabundance of Compassion, at the cost personal Wisdom. You recently completed your assignment there, and were eager not to miss out on the glorious opportunity to be a part of this Great Harvest. Whilst your Group as I said, did eventually learn to balance Love / Light to Graduate into the 6th Density Unity vibration, you still are very much prone to extreme compassion, and rather than take the usual period of time/space (anti-matter universe, where we rest between incarnations) you were keen to jump aboard this 3rd Density space/time whirlwind at this point, to be of assistance to your fellow Beings here. \"My problem is that my memory has malfunctioned, and some of the things that I have remembered from my previous existences do not correspond with your words. I have met Lucifer and his generals, on more than one occasion.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__hidden_hand_081018.txt:34:2ea4e58bce9a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14135, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__hidden_hand_081018.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__hidden_hand_081018", "chunk_index": 35, "text": "extreme compassion, and rather than take the usual period of time/space (anti-matter universe, where we rest between incarnations) you were keen to jump aboard this 3rd Density space/time whirlwind at this point, to be of assistance to your fellow Beings here. \"My problem is that my memory has malfunctioned, and some of the things that I have remembered from my previous existences do not correspond with your words.

I would appreciate any information you may know of that could clear up my confusion as to why my thoughts are so jumbled, because I know what my path is clearly and I am awaiting the starting point, but I am not completely clear on what truly is happening here. Thank you for your time.\" You have indeed 'met' with us (Lucifer) before, on many occasions. We have worked together on various Council and Confederation assignments. **Use the gift of your 'Dreamtime' communications (which are important communications from your OverSoul, and many other Sources whereby information is \"downloaded\") to 'plug in' to your inner data-bank.** Begin recording everything you recall upon awaking, and do not give up on the process, even though it is hard at first. You will begin to slowly make sense of the information which is being \"downloaded\" into your subconscious mind. When you become proficient at this, and can use your 'Dreamtime' as a method of inner communication, ask our Infinte Creator to remind you of your time in the Zeta Reticuli system. You will remember then our last period of Service together, I would hope with much fondness. Sadly, my time here is only permitted until Friday, therefore we will not likely communicate again after this message. So I wish you the very best with your Assignment here my friend, both your individual one, and that of your Group Soul. I ask that our Infinte Creator bless and guide your path. We look forward to seeing you on 'the other side' when this grand ride is over. Our Love, Wisdom and Peace be with you. \"You mention Alcyone ... it's interesting there's a celestial map of it at Hoover Dam. There's also a compass, framed by signs of the zodiac.\" Indeed. Just like in Hollywood productions. We hide the Truth right out in the wide open. What humanity is offered as \"Science Fiction\", more often than not, is actually Science Fact. \"What do the winged statues, commissioned by the U.S govt, guarding the entrance at the dam really represent? Is any of this collection of celestial symbolism found there connected to your luciferian/alien/equinox/transformation agenda?\" That is actually very simple.

You'll note that the feet point directly downward to the earth, and the hands and wingtips point directly up to the sky. The Life-Force Energy flows into the human mind/body/soul complex from the earth up through the feet. The Intelligent Energy from the Infinite Creator flows down from above and in through the crown chakra. The wings represent our (Lucifer's) inherent Divinity. You'll also note that the figure is seated. \"The seat of our (Lucifer's) Power connects Heaven and Earth, and all things must pass through us\". \"Other questions I have, and sorry if you explained this: Are these bloodlines the wealthy, as most assume, or seemingly ordinary people (including celebrities and politicians, etc), blending in with society, going relatively unnoticed, but yet contributing to your cause in the grander scheme of things?\" **The names you know, have no real power. Sure, they \"appear\" to have lots of power, in the way earthbound souls perceive power. Our wealth makes the million and billionaire \"celebs\" and corporate bigwigs look like a child's pocket money. Our wealth is Family wealth, which has passed down through the generations over thousands of years. True wealth however, is knowing deep in your heart, that you and your Infinite Creator, are One. \"Seek ye first the Kingdom of 'God' (Infinite Creator), and all these things shall be added unto you\".** \"So part of this question could also be, are all of them aware they are part of this bloodline, or are some members oblivious to this connection they have? Are they informed of this at a particular age? For example, how and at what age were you told you belonged?\" Yes. **If you are Bloodline (Family), you are born into it, and you are raised this way, from birth. There is no other way. I want to be clear on this Bloodline issue. The ones you know, they are of earthly lineage. Yes, they have their place in the Family, but the Real Power lines, do not originate from this planet. ** \"I have probably found this the single most insightful thing so far. It helps me to understand the answers to some of the questions I've asked.\" I am glad. It is the probably the single most important thing that I have shared. \"Unfortunately,** its connotations also alleviate the 'NWO' of most accusations.\"**** That depends upon your perspective.

No. Does it alleviate that we are closing our End Game scenario, and soon to openly come out and offer publically to \"save\" the failing political and financial institutions with our esteemed Leadership? No. Does that mean that you should give into and feed the Negativity? No. Does it alleviate that we will have to spend a Cycle in Karmic restitution, to balance this lifetime of overt Negativity? No. Does it mean that you should use the Negativity as the tool that it is, to show you that which you are not? Yes. Remember, always, that this is a beautiful Game that we are playing here and co-creating together, with our Infinite Creator. And that \"off stage\" (between lives) we are the very best of friends, and that no one really \"dies\" and no one really \"suffers\", except in the Game. The Game is not Reality. Reality is Reality, and you have the Power to Express your Reality within the Game, once you have learnt how to do so. ** \"You are essentially saying that a soul can only choose positivity in a world where negativity also exists. If there were no protagonist in this world, there'd be no opportunity for a human soul to choose 'good' or 'evil' and thus prove on a spiritual level that they deserve one afterlife fate over another. If we only had positivity to choose from, we'd learn nothing and our souls would manage to prove nothing.\" Exactly. That is the reason why we came. It was a great Sacrifice for us. Hard as it is to comprehend from within the mental confines of 3rd Density life experience, we do it, because we Love you. \"An extremely basic concept but one I'd so far managed to overlook.

Because i could be just very lazy or under this kind of spell and want to know which one it is. Does sleep paralysis have anything to do with it because i get that from time to time with or without shadow figures.\" There is. Research and employ Psychic Shielding techniques.

How can I as an individual take what you say as the 'truth'?\" No one is asking you to. **Never take what another says to you as \"Truth\". Your purpose here, is to find your own Truth. Sometimes, others can help you to do so by offering guidance, but for their Truth to become your Truth, it must pass through the test of your discernment.

'You can't provide 1 shred of proof that this isn't a hoax even though it would be incredibly easy to do so, were you who you claim you were.\" Won't. Not can't. Big difference. This is not intended to be an object lesson prophesy fulfillment. If you think I thought that I would be blindly believed, or even wanted for that to happen, you are very much mistaken. I would be disappointed if that were to be the case, for you will have learned nothing from my time here. (Not you personally, I mean 'you' as in people in general). My task here, as has been my task incarnating here for thousands of years, is to provide a Catalyst. To make you think. (Again, not 'you' personally, I mean in general). If I were to give you the \"proof\" that you are looking for, if I were to predict things and tomorrow they all happen before your very eyes, people would likely take everything I've said here as \"gospel\". That would be disasterous were that to occur, because you will have learned nothing for yourselves. It's not about me. I'm just a messenger. It's all about you (again, generally speaking), and what you do in relation to the Catalyst. Question what you \"think\" you know about reality. Seek the Infinite Creator within you, and ask for It's guidance. \"Ask, and you will receive. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened for you\". \"I am a 32nd degree Mason, although if you were really a royal bloodline person you would know that it means nothing.\" If you have Genuinely attained the level of \"Sublime Prince of The Royal Secret\" through the Scottish Rite, or that of the \"Order of the Knight's Templar\" through the York Rite, and have not been taught of the Truths of Creation, then I would be very interested indeed to know which area Lodge you attend, as I would very much like to speak with your current Worshipful Master. Naturally I completely understand and respect if you do not wish to make such personal details known publicly though. Of course. what you said in another post about there only being three degrees is true, for those attending the Blue or Craft Lodges, though as you've stated that you are 32nd degree, I'm presuming you are either Scottish Rite, or the York Rite's equivalent.

I expect you will likely come back and say how there is no further progression beyond 33rd. Well, if you're lucky, there will be a nice surprise in store for you, somewhere down the line. I sincerely hope that make it that far. \"That your repeating debunked conspiracy theory shows your just here to hoax.\" That word \"debunked\" always brings me a hearty laugh. Some people seem to think that throwing the word \"debunked\" around means that it really has been. The vast majority of \"debunking\" has more holes in it than the \"conspiracy theories\" it's meant to be silencing. Just enough of a \"shell\" to help those who really don't want the Truth to be True, to carry on believing that it's not, so they can replace their heads back into the sand for a while longer. Anyway, I must press on with questions from those with open minds. I leave you with my regards. Keep up your good work. \"Every time there is a downward trend in the world a plethora of self-help gurus rise up with catchy litte books and seminars to grab us and pull us out of the doldrums and back on the path of richousness.\" Love that way that works. \"When you find the value in the rock, you will find the treasure in yourself and in others\" A subtle, and multi-layered truth indeed. \"Over the course of my life I have occasionally resorted to prayer, some formal & some not with truly astounding & nearly instant physical results.

Thanksgiving, is knowing that our Infinite Creator has provided for you as he promised, and being thankful for that, even before you see the results. The more we trust in our Creator, the more results we get. Life gives us what we expect we'll receive. (Because all thought is Creative). If we get up, and expect to have a bad day, more often than not, that's exactly what we'll get. But remember, that it works both ways**. \"And this one would be the hoaxer's sock puppet (new name, all posts in this thread, acting as the coach for the OP), created to give him/her the aura of credibility.\" Oh dear. You really are desperately clutching at straws. Any Admin can have the power to see if I'm using multiple accounts. I would be more than happy for an Admin to say if I am. Because I am not. Two accounts will show for me. \"Hidden-Hand\", my first one that I never got the confirmation email for, and this one, \"Hidden_Hand\", the one I did get the confirmation for. My Infinite Creator gives me the only \"credibility\" that I need, or that I want, for that matter. \"Hidden_Hand: I've enjoyed reading your posts if for nothing than the unusual ( for ATS \"whistleblowers\" anyway ) fact that it isn't bullet holed with bad writing, grammer and typos.

You have mentioned the \"RA\" chanelings, but I also see similarities in three other sources which have been discussed in this and other forums on the internet. I would appreciate your evaluation of the information coming from these sources in the light of your messages. They are ACIM (A course in Miracles, alledgedly channeled by the Christos), The Edgar Cayce Material (In which the RA entity may have played a part), and the \"Terra Papers\". Can those of us seeking to continue our understanding of these matters find anything of use from these sources?\" ACIM has some core truths within it, mainly along the lines of the Law of Radiation and Attraction, but it is also littered with inaccuracies. I am not aware of \"the Terra Papers\". Edgar Cayce's work is significant. There are many distortions within it, but for ones who are of a discerning mind, there is much strong meat to be ingested from it's reading.

The 2003 material was removed by the Admins of the site it was shared at, as they felt it was \"causing too much controversy\", and the 1999 material was not released for the same reasons as that which I am sharing here. There was much Truth within it, but our goals have changed in many ways since that time, and it would be misleading for me to point you in it's direction now. In fact I have been specifically instructed by my own upline not to do so. I am sorry. \"Thank you for your assistance, Namasté\" You are welcome.

Three pages. That's a lot of questions. I still have some work yet to complete tonight before I respond, but due to events currently occurring here, I will not have a great amount of time, and must also be away earlier than planned tomorrow. So, I shall have to draw the line at this post. The amount of questions here to answer already, are more than I have the available time for. I am sorry. I will respond to as many of them as I am able in the time I have, some tonight, and the rest tomorrow before I must leave. This post is just to warn you in advance, that any further questions asked after this post of mine, will not be answered, so there is no point in spending your time composing any. I wish I had more time, but unfortunately it is just not possible. I will return later tonight to begin my responses. posted on 24-10-2008 @ 03:35 AM by Hidden_Hand Ok, as I stated, unfortunately my remaining time is shorter than planned. This was unforeseen and unavoidable. I will not have sufficient time to answer all of your questions, so I will for the most part, focus my remaining time with you, upon responding to those questions that I feel to be from the heart, ones asked by those who are genuinely looking to take something away with them of import from our discourse here together. My second focus will be upon answering other intelligent or insightful questions that can be used to further develop our discourse. I desire to impart as much as I am able with you in the short time we have left.

Please bear in mind, that in light of the above, many of my answers will need to exercise more brevity that I would ideally like, though this is necessary to respond to as many of you as I can.

What part do you want to play? The choice, as always, is entirely yours. Whether you are consciously aware of it or not, you are co-creating the storyline on this planet. My advice, would be to do so consciously. When will you awake? When do you want to awake? Do you want to awake at all? If your answer to this question is \"yes\", then use the Catalyst and tools we have provided for you. I have made many subtle, not so subtle, and even overtly blatant statements within this topic, as to how you may choose to do this. \"I feel it in me, but i'm afraid to let it out? Help me!\" Why are you afraid? Do not reply to that question, but rather, ask it to yourself, during your quiet time, where you work upon yourself. You do work upon yourself, don't you? If not, now would be a good time to start. Sit in silence. Switch off all non essential electrical appliances. Eg; leaving the refrigerator on, would probably be a good idea.

I have much to ponder.\" You are welcome. Thank you for your questions. I feel the desire within you to progress. You have it Within yourSelf, to be all that you wish to become, and much more that you cannot yet even imagine. We look forward to sitting down for a good old reminisce with you on the other side. In the meantime, keep Trusting in, and working upon yourself, and live each moment in Thanksgiving, to our One Infinite Creator. May our Infinite Creator bless and guide your path. \"Honored sir (or madam), I wish to be the one to bring a new planetary energy system to the world. As it is assumed that the \"families\" have great knowledge, I humbly request access to this small bit of needed information.

No matter how keen and sincere one may be to \"join\" us, we can only place our trust in those raised in our ways. I would not wish the conditioning process we go through on anyone, it can be grueling at times, and it is too late to begin the process once childhood has passed. As for further communication, unfortunately this is also not possible or allowable for me. I have given as much information as is permissible for me, during this discourse. There are many informational \"gems\" within these pages, for those who truly seek to develop themselves. Some are obvious, others are more subtle and multi-layered. Take them \"within\", and ask your Infinite Creator to bring you insight. We wish you well upon your journey, and look forward to seeing you at the \"aftershow\" party. \"I'm still not clear on what this harvest is. A \"harvest\" means to reap what has been sown - by you!\" Not by us. We did not sow, our Infinite Creator did. We do not reap, our Infinite Creator does. We help to prepare the Harvest, by separating the wheat from the chaff, for want of a more eloquent metaphor. \"Will it be an instantaneous change, of which there will no longer exist the physical realm as we currently know it to be and are experiencing as an \"illusion\"?\" I have already covered this elsewhere in the topic. I would encourage you to read through again, and find the information I have already presented on how the Harvest will occur, and what the different variations of experience will be. \"Thank you for answering my previous questions. I have some more, if that's ok? 1. How can karma be overcome, if at all? Is there an end to the karmic cycle? 2. Is time really as we perceive it, or is it another 3D illusion? 3. Are your family members born with the knowledge of what they are and where they're from? If not, and it's all taught and passed down, have you ever doubted or questioned any of it? Thanks.\" You are welcome. 1). No, Karma cannot be 'overcome', it must be 'worked off'.

In other words, if you've hurt someone, be it physically, emotionally, or however else, you will have to, at some future point, experience what that felt like for them. The Law of Karmic Effect is not a 'punishment', it is a tool of learning, which is set in place to promote personal growth and development. If you have to feel the consequences of your actions, there is a higher likelihood of your choosing a different course, the next time around. It is also important to hold in mind that it works both ways. Seek therefore to ensure that the effect of your presence upon those 'others' whom you encounter upon your journey, are positive and beneficial. 1b). A Karmic Cycle is brought to completion once you have learned the lessons intended for you from it. If you keep repeating the same mistakes, you'll keep cycling until such a time as you get the message, and break the cycle. But yes, ultimately, all of us will learn that which we need to learn, and all of us will find our way Home. For some, it just takes longer than others. 2).** Linear time is more accurately described as an intentional fabrication. The true nature of time, is cyclical. Though, remember also, that even cyclical time, is part of Creation, and Creation, beautiful as it may be, is also an Illusion, or more accurately, a Thought-Form of our Infinite Creator. Creation is not Real, but the Creator and Co-Creators of it, are**. 3). This is an excellent question. I will devote some time to it: Firstly, there is a distinction to be made. **When I speak of Family in this particular reply, I am referring to the Power lines, ie; those that do not originate from this planet. The bloodlines that you know of, whilst they are a part of our extended Family, are not born with the same extent of (Spiritual/Esoteric) Power that we are, and in this response, I am referring to our True and Pure Family. ** **We are not born with the same veil of forgetfulness as you are. The veil is still in place, but would be most accurately described as being somewhat \"thinner\". We see the \"invisible\" connections of life which are hidden from you, because we retain access to more than just the 3rd Density perspective. Not dissimilar to the manner in which some people can see what you call auras. This is because you are working your way up, whereas we have chosen to step down, in order to help you. ** **We could not do this", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__hidden_hand_081018.txt:54:452e722b2fcf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14155, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__hidden_hand_081018.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__hidden_hand_081018", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "is still in place, but would be most accurately described as being somewhat \"thinner\".

In other words, to you, everything \"appears\" as being \"separate\". We see that this is not the case. We do not have 'direct' Soul Memory, as in the manner that you remember what you did yesterday, but we may access any portion of our Soul memory we so chose when we focus upon it, often in a meditative state.** Personally, my experiences are different again, in other ways, due to my specialty in the Spiritual disciplines. But I will go into that in more detail later, in response to another question. Yes, information is indeed passed down, though unlike for yourselves, any one of us may, with some effort, check the validity of that information from our Personal and Group Soul Memory. basically, where you see yourselves as \"separate\" human beings, we see and Know, that we are One. \"Then I am glad I picked up on that particular point. I found it to be a real ray of light. Though, I'm unsure what to do with it. This information feels as though it should comfort me, and yet it's difficult to feel comfortable knowing that 'evil', in part, makes us who we are. But thank you nonetheless.\" **\"Evil\" is Not who you are. It is part of the complex series of illusions, that you use in 3rd Density, to show you who you are not. The further up through the Densities you work, the less Polarity plays an important part in the game. The Sixth Density, the Density of Unity, is the last level that Polarity is a factor, but even then, it factors in a very different way. Instead of balancing Positive / Negative, you will be balancing Love / Light, Compassion / Wisdom.** \"True, and I'm glad you pointed that out to me. I think what I really meant when I said you are \"alleviated\" is that your very essence is not 'evil' or corrupt. And this alleviates you from my perspective because I'd forged an idea of the ruling elite as being comprised of terminally corrupted souls.\" **No Soul is terminally corrupted.

Remember this, everytime one of these beautiful Souls 'mistreats' you as a part of their storyline. They're just playing their part, like any good actor does whilst on stage. Be thankful to them for their Sacrifice, and learn the lessons they are bringing to you. \"I have learned an enormous amount from this discussion. Like you say, it is the message, not the messenger that counts, so thank you.\" I am glad, as this means that my time spent was worthwhile. And you are very welcome. \"You say we all mingle between incarnations but I suspect the nature of our perception and interaction in that realm is not comparable to our Earthly methods of interaction and therefore, as a united entity there'll be no independent 'laughter' . I have a few (what I feel are probably final) questions for you:\" Not so. Think in terms of individuated Souls, who can see and understand that they are not separate, but interconnected. It is an illusion, that \"space\" is \"empty\". You will still interact as an individual, yet at the same time, you will see how we are all One. It is difficult to explain in a way that makes 3rd Density sense. We just do not have the words or concepts to describe it. We no longer need words where we are going. \"1) How do you know all this? And I really mean KNOW. Clearly you have been taught in great depth about the nature of existence. But how do you know this first hand? How is it more than faith for you? Have you been able to avoid 'forgetting' upon reincarnation?\" I have made reference to this, in my answer to the previous poster. \"2) You seem to be suggesting that your methods of physical enslavement are intended to force us into spiritual awakening. But if that is so, why are methods of spiritual suppression used against the general populace (chemicals, organised religion, sociological)? I understand why you obstruct our material lives, but not why you obstruct our spiritual development.\" Think of it as a \"test\".

To make you doubt the truth, and in so doing, to also doubt yourself in believing it? It happens all the time, in fact, almost every time you have some new revelation that gets you all excited. And it happens, quite by design. You cannot see this however, as it's happening beyond 3rd Density comprehension, in a realm where everything can be seen as adjoining and relating to everything else. Syncronicity. All a magical part of our Infinite Creator's ingenously Creative mind, and excellent sense of humour and irony. Can you see how the \"test\" works? Just when you find something that you've weighed up and dissected with your discernment, and decided to integrate it into your concept of \"Truth\", along comes the challenge to your newfound beliefs. Usually in the form of an event, or something that 'others' may say to disuede you. Your Spiritual development, like all other aspects of your progression, is something that you have to work for. How do you know if your newly discovered 'truth' is really True, if you're never tested on it? The test, is this: In the face of a challenge, who do you trust? Do you trust what the \"outside world\" is showing you? Or, do you hold fast to that which \"feels\" like Truth, deep within you? That is something you can only answer for yourself. I am sorry I do not have the time left to respond to all of your questions, so I selected the ones I felt to be the most important. I have enjoyed our communication Cythraul, and am happy to have made your aquaintance. Well, I must press on with more questions. I ask that our Infinite Creator bless and guide you on your path, and give you the Courage of your convictions. Be well friend, I look forward to meeting up with you when we've completed the game. \"I have one more question for you if i may. What question has not been asked as of yet that is most important for us to know if any? And if there is any would you consider it asked now? Not sure if this one does any good but it stuck in my mind last night.\" An excellent, and incisive question to ask. I think what I shall do, is to save this question, for the very end of our discourse.

But if you could detract for a moment to answer my questions about shape shifting I'd appreciate it.\" I will, but must be very brief, I am sorry. Shapeshifting is not a \"natural\" phenomenon. \"Shapeshifting\" creatures / races do not exist, at least certainly not in any realm, Galaxy or Density we have ever experienced. However, there are certain Rituals that when engaged in, enables this to take place. It has to do with the fact that the body, as is true of all physical things, is not really solid. Sure, it looks and feels as if it is, but in actuality, all matter is composed of atomic and sub-atomic particles of Light, within molecules and compounds. As I say, I'm being brief through necessity, and don't have time to go into the science. There are certain Rituals which when undertaken, allow for a range of 'manipulations' of the so-called 'solid' bodily mass to take place. I have seen some grotesque images in my time, which I really prefer not to dwell upon. I trust that even if in some small way, this will have answered your query. And this next question, I will have to finish on for tonight. I have somewhere I must be. \"H_H, I wish to thank you for your enlightening words. It has been an utmost pleasure of mine to read what you have spoken. I do however have a couple of questions. As I look into myself, I see (feel) as though I am an old soul who has learned many things and possibilities. How are we to know how far along we have come in regards to obtaining a higher spiritual being during the coming Harvest?\" You are most welcome. Appreciation is always appreciated. I am unsure whether your question refers to now, or once the Great Harvest is accomplished. I've already touched on what happens after in a few replies, so I'll go with the former.

The more you focus on that behavior, the more you are going to see of it. It's just Life, doing what it does, and conforming to your expectations about the way it will be for you. Now, having recognized this, what will you do about it? Simply notice your Negative thoughts as they arise, literally, \"catch yourself\" as you are having them. And then, simply change your perspective. Focus instead, about the things you like about this person. How you love their smile, the sound of their happy laughter; the way they do such and such nice thing, how helpful and loving they can be. Keep putting those positive thoughts out. Persevere, as you may have a bit of negative work to undo first, but just keep catching yourself, and focusing on the positive. Then prepare yourself for an \"almost magical\" transformation of your circumstances.

I ask that our Infinite Creator bless and watch over you. posted on 24-10-2008 @ 09:53 PM by Hidden_Hand This will be our last session together. I will do my very best to pack in as much as we can. I am sorry for those who must have missed my earlier post from yesterday which clearly stated that I already have more questions than I have time to answer, and that you have spent the time in writing your new ones. My time is so limited, I am unable to respond to you. I have a long journey I must make shortly, and cannot be late for it. \"I have always been very confused and not clear on the subject of \"god\", having been tossed around from religion to religion by my parents it is hard to discern which \"god\" to believe or have faith in. Should I keep on having faith in the fact that the world around me is \"god\" and that there is not one particular being that deserves this faith?\" **Religion is either actually created, or at very least, heavily influenced by us. There is no such things as \"god\". \"God\" is a human concept, which is a misunderstanding of the original concept of \"Creator\". This is further confused, as there are many macrocosmic level Creators, or Logos, as has been explained previously. ** **\"God\" implies some separate entity which is 'outside' of you, which you must supplicate to and worship. Our One Infinite Creator, and almost all of our Logos and sub-Logos', do not want your worship. They want you to understand Creation, and your place within it, as a Co-Creator. Ultimately, there is a \"Supreme Being\", in the form of the One Infinite Creator, but we are all a part of It, rather than it's subjects. ** **None of the names given for this \"Supreme Being\" by your religions are the true name.

But they are indeed correct, in that there is One Supreme Being, namely the Infinite Creator. They just have different concepts about It, which spring from the texts their religion is based upon. Do not 'worship' your Infinite Creator, but rather live in a state of Thanksgiving and Service to It, for bringing you into Being, and for this amazing Game It has Created, in which we may forget who we really are, in order to remember, and know ourself one again, as the Creator. ** \"So basically the form that we have is actually just a body with bones and skin and so on and so forth. What matters is our soul or being that is inside us that makes us question and deal with our surroundings and life, so when we \"die\" the pain and suffering is just part of our human shell, and has nothing to do with our soul or being which will carry on into the next life or density?\" Indeed. **'Pain' and 'suffering' are just aspects of the Game. They feel extremely real whilst we are playing the Game, and indeed they have to, in order to make you believe that the Game is real. No-one really \"dies\". But rather, the 'matter' of human form is shed, much like the chrysalis of a caterpillar, when the butterfly emerges. Look upon physical incarnation as the chrysalis in which you may transform. ** \"I feel as though I am like Shelby, but have lost my way, or I am just so confused and not in-tune with my inner-self that I can not figure out what is my purpose in this game. Is there anything you can shed upon this?\" **Your purpose in the Game, is to work upon yourself. To grow, develop, and transform yourself into a more positive and loving being. You had certain goals that you planned to achieve before incarnating here, which is a main reason for the veil of forgetfulness being in place, because if you already knew what your goals were, the Game would be too easy. Look at the things in your life that you most love to do. Ask yourself what makes you most happy.

Let us say for example, that you chose to come here to work upon patience during this incarnation. You will likely find that you have a tendency towards impatience, and that life will often bring many experiences to you, in order to 'test' your patience. The idea being, that rather than losing your temper, you work upon your impatience, and resolve to become a more temperate and patient Soul. This same analogy may be applied to all manner of circumstances in which life will test you. Look for and begin to identify any recurring issues you have, that you perhaps struggle to deal with, and seem to present themselves to you, time and time again. Perhaps anger, being abusive, selfishness, hatred, cynicism, and the list goes on.

In order for you to move on the 4th level, it must be a 95% negative harvest. In other words, to reward your people with 4th density, 95% of the human souls have to be (in the self-contemplation process) as far away from the \"Infinite Source\" as humanly possible. That just doesn't \"feel\" right to me.\" It does not 'feel' right to you, as it is not right. You have not entirely grasped the concept. I shall attempt to clarify. **The Harvest is Mixed. Those who are 51% or over on the Positive path will Graduate to 4th Density Positive. There you will work upon Love and Compassion, and it will be a very beautiful world to reside within for you. There will be very little negativity. Just a small enough amount that you can still use it to exercise your Free Will in choosing who you are not, but it will be so much more obvious than it is here, that the negativity is a tool to be used. You will see the interconnectedness of all things, and you will know that you are not 'separate' from one another, or from life Itself. You will not use words much, unless you choose to. Telepathy becomes the normal method of communication. Everything is open, and you cannot hide your thoughts from 'others'. From that incarnation onwards, you will not have to experience 3rd Density incarnation again, unless you later choose to do so from Higher Densities, as we have done, in order to perfect the art of Service, or unless you somehow, in a 4th Density world of abundant love and beauty, inextricably manage to be 95% Negative at a time of future Harvest, and slide back down the snake, instead of ascending up the ladder, to use another 'Game' metaphor. ** **Back to 'this' current Great Harvest, we do not require a 95% Negative Harvest, as you have deducted. Instead, what we require, is for US to personally attain a 95% Negative Polarity for ourselves, not for you.

It will be a feeling of blissful, ecstatic expansiveness and Unity, whilst your physical vehicles (bodies) are dissolved back into Light, and transported to your new environment. When that transition is complete, the 'zero-point time' will end, and you will 'appear' in your new 'game-zone' (planet). You will look the same, think the same, feel the same. In fact, it will be just like you all had some mystical experience, and life will carry on as 'normal' for you. Same houses, family situations, jobs, friends, lovers. Everything will seem the same as before, you will not remember the Great Harvest or earth changes that occurred as the planet Earth heals and regenerates herself. But you will recall your 'mystical experience' and that will give you hope and a new opportunity to choose a more positive future for yourselves.

In short, the Orion Empire are 4th Density Negative. They are \"lost\" in the sense that they have drifted so far from their true nature, that despite many attempts, we have been unable to reach them, and help them to develop. They exist within their Group Soul Complex, mostly as a group of discarnate entities, within the Astral Planes of the planets they visit. They have no intention of 'returning Home', and instead seek to feed off of Negative Energy, to keep themselves going, as they are disconnected from their inherent natural Life-Force, by refusing to abide by the Infinite Creator's Incarnational Principles. **The time we spend between lives in time/space, is intended to restore our Soul Energy from within, in order to continue our upward progression.** They are essentially 'imprisoned' within the 4th Density Negative cycle, as there is no Negative Harvest beyond the 4th Density. So they spend their time traveling the Galaxy, basically 'using the dark side of the Force' (Negativity) to achieve their means. They will eventually be brought back before the One Infinite Creator, and dissolved back into the Intelligent infinity (Source of All), though they are being given every chance for as long as possible, to learn the error of their ways, and return to seeking the Positive, and to begin their journey back Home.

They are here to awaken themselves, and then to help awaken others to prepare for the coming Great Harvest.

What began as me just doing my duty, has become more a 'labour of love', and when this is all over by the end of this evening, I think I will actually kind of miss you all, and having this involvement with those of the 'outside' world. ** **I was chosen because it was desired that someone of my \"diplomacy\" skills would be best to deliver this message. Due to the very nature of the subject matter, there was much potential for discord. It was felt important that the message did not become lost in a self righteous or defensive delivery system. So, you got me. And I'm actually glad now in retrospect that you did. I sit here and chuckle to myself, (in light of the way some people here have spoken to me), how this discourse may have descended into something ugly, were certain others amongst my Family who were also considered for this assignment to have actually been given the job. Now I know why I was chosen. As with all things, it was meant to be this way. I couldn't care less what others think of me, so long as I know I am serving my Creator as he desires, to the best of my ability. His is the only approval I require, or desire. I have nothing to defend, so I guess that's why I was 'perfect' for this task. ** Anyway, enough with the sentiment, I have more questions to answer. \"A common saying among Christians is \"Satan's greatest trick is convincing the world that he didn't exist.\" I think there are Christians that would look at what you've written and see it as an elaborate ruse to \"make the devil look good.\"\" **\"Satan\" is a human invention.

How would one even go about presenting this information to a person of that mindset? I am not here to \"spread your gospel\", but I would definitely like so share this with a few of my friends.\" How can you present anything to ones who have no desire to have their belief system challenged? They will believe what they want to believe, and nothing you or I can say is likely to make any difference. It becomes ingrained at a subconscious level, and when a belief structure becomes that insidious, the only way it is likely to change, is through a 'mystical experience' or such a personal demonstration of 'another way' in the life lived of 'another', that one cannot fail but to notice that there is 'something different' about them. How can you reach such as these? Only by example. \"That being said, is it okay if I condense your writings into one long post on my blog?

It also allows me to respond further to an earlier question, that I indicated I would go into in more depth later, when replying to your observation. This message does indeed \"flow from my Being\", onto the page. I mentioned before, that my role in my Family, is that of the Spiritual Discipline. A certain poster made all manner of assumptions as to what that role entails, and flailed wildly wide of the mark in the process. As I said previously, **all of the \"Power Lines\" (off world bloodlines) that comprise the \"Inner Sanctum\" (or \"Hidden Hands\") of the Family, have certain abilities that 3rd Density incarnates do not posses (even the others of our Family, the lines you know), one of these being the ability to know their entire incarnational 'past', with focussed concentration.** There are a wide array of tasks to be attended to, that allows our Family to function effectively, and we each specialize in certain areas or disciplines, in order that the \"body\" of our Family runs like a well oiled machine. My area, and that which I spend the vast majority of my time actively involved in, is that of Spirituality. OUR Spirituality, not that of the peoples of the Earth. Others below me deal more in that area. **I could be likened to that of a 'Priest' or a 'Minister'. In the same way as your religions and spiritual teachers have the responsibility of \"listening\" to the voice of their Creator, and delivering his messages, so too do I. ** I have been actively engaged in this role now, for a great many years. It has become second nature to me. Actually, more accurately, it has become first nature. A large part of my role, is to constantly be in the awareness state of our Group Soul (Lucifer). That is why you will notice that I so often refer to \"we\" even as I am speaking in the first person. That has just become natural for me. I spend most of my time speaking with my Family, as Lucifer, the Group Soul perspective. When I speak henceforth, it is not me (the individual Soul spark) that is speaking to you in essence, but rather, for want of a better description, (because", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__hidden_hand_081018.txt:76:f227b9ee18d3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14177, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__hidden_hand_081018.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__hidden_hand_081018", "chunk_index": 77, "text": "awareness state of our Group Soul (Lucifer).

When I speak henceforth, it is not me (the individual Soul spark) that is speaking to you in essence, but rather, for want of a better description, (because it is far from accurate), you could say that in effect, I am \"Channeling\" Lucifer. That is why this discourse flows so easily. As some have noted, the chances of me having spent however much vast quantities of time \"researching\" all this material to \"hoax\" with, and present it in the fluent method that I do, as in regular daily installments, whilst I guess could be remotely possible, is unlikely in the extreme. For those who are open enough to receive the above explanation, now you know why, and how it is done. I speak not for myself, but rather, for him who sent me, my own Creator (Lucifer). I know and have experienced that which he knows and has experienced, because essentially, we are One and the same Being. \"I have never been involved in any organized religions per say, but have always been spiritual. I do look at the many religious texts out there, because I believe they all have parts to the story. One can find great knowledge from many different books or religious texts. I believe that we as humans are creators like the ONE creator, and we are all one. I also believe we wil be moving into a higher level of consciousness where we can consciously co-create in our world, since we are only unconsciously co-creating at the moment.\" Your insight serves you well. \"There is so much more I would like to speak with you about but am not able to think of what exactly I want to say.

Or is it lack of understanding in certain members in your bloodline.\" Indeed, I understand, occasionally drastic intervention is required. As I said, they do not know everything, some things are best kept to ourselves. Temptation can prove too great, when certain powers lay in the hands of those who's heart is not utterly pure of intention. Let us just say, that some seem to enjoy the game a little TOO much, from time to time. Their actions were more from ignorance, than malicious intent toward you.

You said there are people who are part of your \"extended family\" that we may know of. So are these the Rockefeller, Rothschild, Bush, House of Windsor, etc. (typically known in conspiracy circles as the New World Order)? How close is your interaction with your \"extended family\", and are they as spiritually enlightened as you seem to be? Can you just kind of give us an outline of how the family is structured, how much each level knows in relation to the top, etc.?

There will be anything from say five to thirty or so of these, depending upon the size of the town or city in question. Each local area has it's own council, comprised of local leaders representing the Six Disciplines of learning. There is also either a High Priest or High Priestess of The Order, who serves their local community.

I've not looked at her supposed \"revelations\" personally, though heard enough from others in my Family. Yes, she was a [part of the Family](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali), at the lower levels, from the German Lines I believe.

She certainly would not have had anything like the \"bigger picture\". I understand that she went into detail about some of the training techniques in the lower levels, which to be fair, can be extremely harsh. Though as I've said, it's all about reaching the 95% negativity, and when all is said and done, no matter how much one may have suffered in this life-experience, we can never lose sight of the fact that this is a Game we are all playing here together, and each incarnating Soul has already chosen and agreed in advance the parts they will play in the Game. No one really suffers, except in the Game, and ultimately, they have chosen these experiences before hand, at a soul level.

They are aware of the harvest, and the need for them to attain the 95%, to get out of 3rd Density, and that is all the motivation they need to help us achieve our ultimate aims. How they go about it, is not really of too great a concern to us, as long as they are getting the job done.

Our lineage can be traced back beyond antiquity. **There are 13 base or core original bloodlines. Yet there are many, many other lines that spring from these. From the earliest times of your recorded history and beyond, our Family has been directing the play from behind the scenes. **We are born to lead. It is part of the design for this current paradigm.

There are six disciplines of training within the Family. Each member of the Family is schooled extensively in all of them from early childhood. The six spheres or schools of learning are military, government, spiritual, scholarship, leadership, and sciences. Though we have experience in all spheres, we all have an area of specialty. My area of specialty is in spirituality, so my focus is not so much on geo-political events. I am aware of the overall design, though the finer points are often outside of my area of expertise. You will never be free for as long as you are incarnating on this planet. The very nature of your being here is indication of that. There is a reason why you are here, and \"here\" is very likely not really where you think \"here\" is. **How do you become free? By working out where you are and coming to an understanding of why you are here.** In your hypnotized state, you have as a society given your free will consent to the state your planet is in today. You saturate your minds with the unhealthy dishes served up for you on your televisions that you are addicted to; violence, pornography, greed, hatred, selfishness, incessant bad news, fear and \"terror\". When was the last time you stopped to think of something beautiful and pure? The planet is the way it is because of your collective thoughts about it. You are complicit in your inaction every time you look the other way when you see an injustice. Your thought, projected at the sub-conscious level of creation to the Infinite Creator, is your allowance of these things to occur. In so doing, you are serving our purpose. **It is very important to us that the polarization of this planet is negative at the time of the great harvest.** That means service to self orientated, as opposed to positive, service to others. We require a negative harvest, and you are doing a fine job of helping us to attain our goal. We are very grateful.

Begin to study outside of the box for a true understanding of the creation. **In the Beginning** **In the beginning, there is the Infinite One. This is the source of All That Is. Infinite consciousness. Intelligent infinity. It is the undifferentiated absolute.** Within it is unlimited potential, waiting to become. Think of it as the \"[uncarved block](https://web.archive.org/web/20171013224412/https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-pu-3182628)\" of your Taoist traditions. There is unity. Infinite intelligence and infinite energy - the two are one. Within them is the potential for all creation. Infinite intelligence does not recognize its potential. It is the undifferentiated absolute. This state of consciousness could be termed as \"being\". Infinite energy, in contrast, recognizes the potential of \"becoming\" all things in order to bring any desired experience into being. Infinite intelligence can be likened to the central heartbeat of life, and infinite energy to the spiritual life-blood which pumps out from the Infinite Creator to form the creation. Infinite intelligence, becoming aware of itself, seeks to experience itself, and thus the \"One Infinite Creator\" is born or manifest. In effect, the Creator is a point of focused infinite consciousness expressing infinite intelligent energy. The One Infinite Creator, also becoming self aware, seeks to experience itself as Creator, and in so doing, begins the next step down in the creational spiral. **On focusing its infinite intelligence, the One Infinite Creator manifests intelligent energy which you could call the great central sun. It then divides itself into smaller portions of itself that can, in turn, experience themselves as creators (or central suns).** In other words, each central sun (or creator) is a step down in conscious awareness (or distortion) from the original \"thought\" of creation. **Creation is based upon the \"Three Primary Distortions of The Infinite One\": ** ** Free Will Love Light ** 1). Free Will: In the first law (or distortion) of creation, the creator receives the free will to know and experience itself as an individuated, though (paradoxically) unified, aspect of the One. 2). Love: In the second law of creation, the initial distortion of free will becomes a focus point of awareness known as Logos, or love (or \"The Word\" in biblical terms). Love, or Logos, using its infinite intelligent energy then takes on the role of co-creating a vast array of physical manifestations (thought forms) or densities (which some call dimensions or planes of existence), in which according to its intelligent design, will best offer the range of potential experiences in which it can know itself.

In effect, the One Infinite Creator, in dividing itself into Logos, could be termed in your third density understanding as a \"Universal Creator\". In other words, Logos creates physical universes in which it and the creator may experience themselves (\"let there be light\"). 3). Light: To manifest this infinite spiritual or life-force energy into a physical thought form of densities, Logos creates the third distortion of light. The nature of all physically manifest energy is light. Wherever thus exists any form of physical matter, there is light, love, and divine intelligent energy [at its core](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#seeing). **From the three original primary distortions of the One, which make the creation, arise myriad hierarchies of other sub-distortions, each containing their own specific paradoxes. The goal of the game is to enter into these further divisions of creation, and then seek to harmonize the polarities in order to once again know oneself as the creator of them. ** Drawing upon its infinite intelligence, the Infinite Creator designed a blueprint based on the finite principles of free will of awareness and sub-level creations, which each in their turn, could become aware of themselves and seek to experience themselves as creators. The One Infinite Creator (or great central sun) steps down its infinite energy to become Logos. Logos in turn designs vast universes of space (as yet unmaterialized), stepping down and splitting itself again, into Logoi (plural), in other words, into an array of central suns which will each become a Logos (or co-creator) of its own universe. Yet each unique individualized portion created by the One Infinite Creator contains within it, as its very essence, intelligent infinity. Using the law of free will, each universal Logos (central sun) designs and creates its own version or perspective of physical reality in which to experience itself as creator by focusing its intelligent energy to create, for instance, the form of galaxies within itself. Stepping down again, each galactic Logos (sub-Logos) can split itself into yet further co-creator portions (sub-sub-Logos), which can then design and manifest their own ideas of physical reality, as in the form of points of conscious awareness that we call stars and planets. **We are not directly created by the One Infinite Creator, but rather by our own Logos, sub-Logos, sub-sub-Logos and so on. So from that perspective, whilst we are all essentially made up of the same \"stuff\" of creation, initiated by the One Infinite Creator, our direct personal creators are different portions or sub-Logos of the One.** **Yahweh and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__hidden_hand_bloodlines.txt:3:7a25f68e17b2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14192, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__hidden_hand_bloodlines.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__hidden_hand_bloodlines", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "manifest their own ideas of physical reality, as in the form of points of conscious awareness that we call stars and planets. **We are not directly created by the One Infinite Creator, but rather by our own Logos, sub-Logos, sub-sub-Logos and so on.

He is \"a\" creator (or sub-sub-Logos) rather than the One Infinite Creator. He is not even a galactic level Logos, but rather, is the planetary Logos for this one planet. There are other and higher \"gods\" than him. **Yet ultimately, all are a part of the One.** And either consciously or unconsciously, all are exercising their free will to create. Our creator is the one you refer to as Lucifer, \"the Light Bearer\" and \"Morning Star\". Our creator is not \"the Devil\", as he has been portrayed in some religious texts. Lucifer is what you would call a \"Group Soul\" or \"Social Memory Complex\", which has evolved to the level of the sixth density. **We (our bloodline families), as a group soul or social memory complex (Lucifer), were on the verge of seventh density ascension. At this level, before harvest comes, we have the choice to progress higher, or to return to help others of lower densities with their evolution by passing down our knowledge and wisdom to those that call upon us for assistance with their own free will. Now at this time, having made our decision to stay and help our galactic brothers and sisters in the One, we were assigned a challenging task by the Council of Elders, who act as the guardians of this galaxy.** Yahweh had not handed down his own free will to \"know thyself\" to those incarnating upon \"his\" planet, as was his right as planetary Logos. As a result, he was having very little evolutionary progress therein. In the absence of free will, there can be no polarity, and therefore, nothing to \"choose\" between. As is portrayed in the book of Genesis, the planet was very \"Edenic\" in nature. Sure, it was a lovely \"paradise\", yet the beings incarnating there had no agitator toward evolving beyond the third density, and therefore, little hope of ever making the journey home to the One. So we (Lucifer) were sent to help.

Once the order was given from the Council of Elders, we \"fell\", or descended back to a place where we could, with hard work and focus, once again materialize a third density manifestation of ourself. Yahweh had agreed to our coming. In fact, it was he who had initially asked the Council for a \"catalyst\" of change to enter into his creation. **Without polarity (derived from free will), there is only the unity of love and light, and no choice to experience \"other than\" that. So we were to be the catalyst for change in order to provide that choice, thus bringing polarity. **Yahweh agreed that we would introduce the concept of free will to Earth's inhabitants by offering them an initial choice as to whether they wanted it or not. Hence, \"The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil\" (or more accurately, the knowledge of polarity - of positive and negative). **Yahweh then takes his inhabitants to a new \"garden\". He tells them they can do anything they like except eating from the Tree of Knowledge, thus creating in them the desire to do the one thing they are told they cannot. Hence, a \"choice\". We provide the catalyst by telling them the benefits of attaining knowledge. They then choose to eat from the tree, and the rest is history.** Yahweh thought that his \"children\" would still choose to obey him. When he discovered they did not, he became angry. As is described in his scriptures, he is [a jealous God](http://bible.cc/exodus/20-5.htm). He did not like it that his children had chosen to disobey him and follow our advice. Yet our group soul was already committed to being here for a predefined set of cycles to help provide the catalyst for human evolution, namely by offering you the negative option, or that which *you* choose to call \"evil\". **The Game of Life** Let's be clear about one thing though. **All of this (physical life/incarnation) is a very intricate and skillfully designed game, whereby the One Infinite Creator plays the game of forgetting who it is, so that it can learn to remember, and in doing so, experience and know itself as creator, all the way down to us tiny individuated sparks of the All That Is. ** **Off stage and between lives as incarnated human beings (zero-point time/antimatter universe), we - all of us and all of you as souls - are great friends, brothers and sisters in the One. **Between lives we all have a good laugh about the parts we have performed in the \"play\" and look forward to and have great fun preparing the next chapters to act out.

It will be a very beautiful and \"Golden\" Age. The fourth density begins to open souls up to their true powers as unique individualized aspects of the One Infinite Creator. These individuals will perform works and wonders of the like that the one you call Jesus promised they would do, \"and even greater things than these\". It will be a very magical time for those who ascend. **In contrast, the majority of humans on the earth, who could be considered shall we say \"lukewarm\", will experience a period of (what will feel ecstatic) zero-point time. **These people will for a period feel totally at one with the Creator, giving them an encouraging reminder and glimpse of who they really are, before the veil of forgetfulness once again descends. **Then they will be transported to another third density planet (a kind of Earth replica), to continue working upon themselves and learning that life here is all about making choices. ** These souls will remain \"quarantined\", incarnating in third density matter until the time of the next harvest; in which time they will need to have proved that they have learned how to be more positive beings, focused more upon being of service to others, rather than seeking only to serve themselves.

This is why we work so hard to be as negatively polarized as we possibly can be. If we do not make a high enough percentage, we will miss out and will end up with the majority \"lukewarm\" percentage that have to go through another cycle in third density. By attaining a negative harvest, we can still \"graduate\" to fourth density, only it will be a negative polarity planet. Not a great place to be. But, as I've stated previously, we (as a group soul) have incurred the natural karmic restitution process that we must work off for all the negativity we have caused upon this planet. We will do this for a cycle in our new fourth density world, and then we will be freed to once again be the glorious being of light that we truly are. We need a negative harvest, so that we can create our fourth density Earth and clear our karmic record. **Understand that we HAVE to be negative. That's what we were sent here to be. It is our contract, which has always been to help you by providing the catalyst of free will and choice. **Being negative is very hard for us, not on a physical level (the characters we play enjoy our roles, as we're programmed that way), but on a spiritual level. We surpassed the lowly negative vibrations eons ago. We are light, and we are love. It is a very hard thing for us to do spiritually, to create all this negativity, but we do it because we love you. And ultimately it is also for your highest good. Remember, we are all just acting out a grand old game here where we agree to forget who we really are, that in the remembering we may find each other again and know that we are One, and that all of life is One. When you remember who you are and you know it deep within the core of your being, you will know and recognize your invisible connection to All That Is.

There are many living on Earth right now who experience their lives as a living hell. Yet there are also those living in the same physical reality of this planet whose lives are close to heaven on Earth. As Hidden Hand points out, our deeply held thoughts and beliefs create our experience of life. Focusing on an impending harvest or day of judgment keeps us from opening ever more fully to all that is available to us here and now in this ever-unfolding [sacred moment](https://www.momentoflove.org/).* **The Galactic Council of Elders** The Council of Elders are the wise and loving guardians of our galaxy. The Council gave us a set of choices. We chose to stay here to help you, despite the cost to ourself. That is the nature of loving service to others. **The ultimate paradox in this storyline we are all co-creating together is that in order for us to be of the most service to you, we must be utterly self serving.** **I do so love our Creator's sense of irony. ** Our initial contract was to introduce the catalyst for free will on this planet. When Yahweh began discourse with the Council of Elders, he was not initially looking for help with introducing free will, but rather for guidance on how he could best speed up his (and his inhabitants') evolutionary process. He was basically running a benign dictatorship. We had at that time just completed an assignment in Tau Ceti, and had reported for our next duties. We (as group soul Lucifer) were sent on a \"fact-finding expedition\" to visit Earth and meet with Yahweh to evaluate his planetary creation laws and make suggestions on how best he could help his offspring (this is the term I shall use to describe the individuals who comprise the group soul), and thusly Yahweh, to progress. We explored many options and reported our findings to the Council and to Yahweh.** It was our best evaluation that the only real and fast track way to increase his evolvement meaningfully was the introduction of free will.** It was not specifically free will that Yahweh wanted help with. He simply asked for the introduction of a catalyst. He was not at all pleased with our report that he needed to implement free will.

He was happy with his little pet paradise, and he didn't want to loose control of it. In the end the Council persuaded him that it was the best way, and he reluctantly agreed. We returned to Earth and had a cordial meeting with Yahweh, discussing how we could best implement the free will option. Yahweh was adamant that his offspring would choose to be loyal to him anyway, and that they were so content with their way of life that they would always trust him and do as he said. That, he said, was his main reason that free will would not work well as the catalyst. **That's why he agreed to the experiment of the Tree of Knowledge.** He believed it would prove him right. When it did not, he became angry and threw his offspring out of the garden. He laid a big guilt trip on them about how they had broken his trust and disobeyed him. That's not really an honourable way for a Logos to behave, but hey, that's the beauty of free will, I guess. Next \"problem\" to occur, was that his offspring were so grateful to us for our help, that Yahweh became (in his own admission) a jealous God. Then we had the whole \"you shall have no other gods before me\" thing. We were not pleased with the situation at all, as a Logos should not be behaving like this with his offspring. When we attempted to leave the planet to return to the Council, Yahweh prevented our departure. We tried to leave again, but were then thrown down into the astral planes and confined therein. The Council ordered us to be released, but said we would have to cancel our contract to help the souls on Earth to evolve. We didn't want to leave. We found humans very likable beings, really positively polarized, and we wanted to stay and help. We just wanted also to be free to come and go as we pleased. The only way we could stay was to remain confined as a group soul, which meant cycles of incarnation for us (as individuated souls), which we had not done for a long while. **There is no \"wrong\" or \"right\" seen from a higher density, but there are still consequences for every action.

We stayed, but as a karmic result of our group soul's confinement by Yahweh, our own individuated souls were given the mandate (by the Council) to \"rule\" over Yahweh's people during our physical incarnations here on your planet. **The karmic effect of Yahweh imprisoning us on the macrocosmic level was that his individuated souls (humans) would be imprisoned on the microcosmic level.** The Infinite Creator gave Yahweh (and all) the gift of free will to create as we choose, but the karmic effect of his choice was the Council quarantining the planet. A certain evolutionary level is required to be a functioning part of a positive unified galactic society. **The Veil is Drawn** Remember that ultimately, this is a game that we are all playing here. We are actors playing on the stage of life. This world is all illusion or thought-form. No one really dies, and no one is really hurt. In between incarnations, you know this very well. But **the rules of the game ensure that when you incarnate, you must forget who you really are, so that you believe it is all \"real\" whilst you are playing the game of life. **Forgetting is an essential prerequisite for you to make choices that help you to grow. Otherwise, the game would be too easy. **We are not born with the same veil of forgetfulness as you are. The veil is still in place, but would most accurately be described as being somewhat thinner.** We see the invisible connections of life which are hidden from you, because we retain access to more than just the third density perspective - not dissimilar to the manner in which some people can see what you call auras. This is because you are working your way up, whereas we have chosen to step down in order to help you. We could not do this as successfully if we had to forget all that we have learned. In other words, to you, everything appears as being separate. We see that this is not the case.

Cultivate a genuine love for life and for being. Be genuinely thankful to the Infinite Creator every day for bringing you into being and for his bountiful provision. You have survived this far, have you not? You may not have everything you want, but you have everything you need in order to complete that which you incarnated here to do. Give thanks for that. Desire to serve flows naturally from a grateful heart. **Show acknowledgment and gratitude to the Infinite Creator for all that it has done and is doing for you.** It has given you the gift of life experience and offered you the free will to decide what you will create with it. **Guard your thoughts carefully, as they are more powerful than you may imagine. If you see doom and gloom, then that is what you are projecting. The world is [your mirror](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#gratitude). It reflects back to you what you are putting out. If you do not like the reflection life is showing you, then change that which is causing it.** When you are coming from a place of love for and service to your Creator, a life of service to others will become a natural outflowing from that.

It is up to you how you use the tools we have given you. ****Whilst incarnating in the third density, negativity is still an important tool in your learning process.** It teaches you \"other than\". **Do you respond to negativity with more negativity? Or do you choose to see the negativity as the tool that it is, and recognize that it is offering you an opportunity? All souls eventually learn that positive is the pathway which leads Home. **There is a big difference between loving yourself and being selfish.

But even they are a lesser line within the Family. The names you know do not have the real power. One of the things the Earth lines don't know or understand is that our agenda is ultimately for the highest good of all concerned in providing you with the catalyst.

Only mostly, people are too busy to notice. ** Be the strong and courageous soul that deep down you know yourself to be. Do not hide your inner light. Trust yourself, and shine your light into the darkness. Your soul remembers everything you've ever experienced. The only reason you don't remember it all now, is due to what we term the \"veil of forgetfulness\". **If you came into each new incarnation with access to your soul memory, there's no point in your coming into space/time. It would be like playing a computer game with all the cheats. You wouldn't learn anything. And it takes the fun out of playing the game.** Remember that this current physical body you carry around with you is not who you are. It's just the vessel for your essence. Who you are is real and cannot be destroyed. You will retain all your memories of this life experience once you pass beyond the realm of time/space or that which some call heaven.

That infinite being living within and around your body, namely your soul, is who you really are. The part of you that thinks, and feels, and loves. It will always be a part of you. Pain and suffering are just aspects of the game. They feel extremely real whilst we are playing the game, and indeed they have to, in order to make you believe that the game is real. No one really dies. But rather, the matter of human form is shed, much like the chrysalis of a caterpillar when the butterfly emerges. Look upon physical incarnation as the chrysalis in which you may transform. **Linear time is more accurately described as an intentional fabrication. The true nature of time is cyclical. **Though remember also that even cyclical time is part of creation. And creation, beautiful as it may be, is also an Illusion, or more accurately, a thought-form of our Infinite Creator. Creation is not real, but the Creator and co-creators of it are. \"Evil\" is not who you are. It is part of the complex series of illusions that you use in third density to show you who you are not. **The further up through the densities you work, the less polarity plays an important part in the game.** The sixth density, the density of unity, is the last level that polarity is a factor. But even then, it factors in a very different way. Instead of balancing positive/negative, you will be balancing love/light, compassion/wisdom. **The External Reflects the Internal** **There is a simple method to check upon your progress. Despite what appears to be going on in the world around you, how loving and harmonious are your personal relationships? Remember that the world is your mirror. It casts back at you the reflection of that which you have projected into it.** How many arguments do you find yourself engaging in? Is there bitterness and acrimony within the ranks? Do you look at others and think about how you would like to change them? Or do you love them and accept them as they are? Loving and accepting someone for who they are is known as unconditional love. That is something you will spend much time working upon when graduating into fourth density positive.

But it does mean loving and accepting the person (soul), not the soul's behavior. The behavior is not who they really are. The soul within is who they are.** The quality of your relationships is an excellent mirror from which to gauge the quality of your output, or in other words, that which you are creating. Do you look at a person and concentrate, to a greater or lesser extent, upon the things that you dislike about them and wish would change, or the qualities that you like and admire in them? Remember that we have said that all thought, word, and deed is creative. You get back what you send out. So when you send out the thought \"Why is she so hard to live with?\" or \"Why is he always behaving like this?\", ask yourself, what exactly are you doing? Now focus here, as this is so obvious you could miss it. And in fact, most do. Take away the question from your sentence and essentially you are saying: \"She is so hard to live with\" and \"He is always behaving like this\". Do you see what you are doing? You have just created the very behaviour in that person that you wish to change simply because you do not understand the law of radiation and attraction.** Remember, all thought is creative.** Now try an experiment: Take someone in your life that you love, but sometimes have trouble getting along with. Think about the thoughts you have projected about that person - the negative thoughts. Ask yourself, does the behavior that you do not like in that person in any way correspond to the thoughts you've been having about them? If you're honest with yourself, it's a strong bet that it does. Sure, they must have behaved that way in the first place to make you notice that you didn't like it, but we all have off days sometimes. The more you focus on that behavior, the more you are going to see of it. It's just life doing what it does and conforming to your expectations about the way it will be for you. Now having recognized this, what will you do about it? **Simply notice your negative thoughts as they arise. Literally \"catch yourself\" as you are having them.

Keep putting those positive thoughts out. Persevere, as you may have a bit of negative work to undo first, but just keep catching yourself and focusing on the positive. Then prepare yourself for an almost magical transformation of your circumstances. **Always monitor your thoughts and pay attention to their quality, because what you think about is directly related to what you will see around you, and what life will show you. That is the difference between conscious and subconscious creation. ** **Archetypes, Dreams, and Religion** The Universal Mind speaks in archetypal Imagery. In a similar way that the writing in some of our Oriental languages uses a system whereby a collection of words or meanings are contained within what is essentially a symbol, so the Universal Mind uses archetypes to communicate in dreamtime. Just like understanding any new dialect, you just need to learn the language. **Dreams are a key method our souls use to speak with us. The conscious mind is too busy and distracted most of the time to hear what Spirit has to say. So it tends to use the subconscious instead. ** **You only forget who you are during incarnation. The object of the game is to wake up within the dream, and in effect, become a \"lucid gamer\", to remember who you really are during the game, and to then begin working upon the things you came here for.** Religion is either actually created, or at very least, heavily influenced by us. God is a human concept, which is a misunderstanding of the original concept of \"Creator\". This is further confused, as there are many macrocosmic level creators, or Logos, as has been explained previously. \"God\" implies some separate entity which is \"outside\" of you, which you must supplicate to and worship. Our One Infinite Creator and almost all of our Logos and sub-Logos do not want your worship. They want you to understand creation and your place within it as a co-creator. Ultimately, there is a supreme being in the form of the One Infinite Creator. But we are all a part of it, rather than its subjects.

Do not worship your Infinite Creator, but rather live in a state of thanksgiving and service to it for bringing you into being, and for this amazing game it has created, in which we may forget who we really are, in order to remember and know ourself again as the Creator. **Satan is a human invention. It is the personification you have given to all the negativity that has existed on this beautiful planet. You didn't know who to blame, and as you could not find it within yourselves to [take personal responsibility](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/victim_or_creator_vs), Satan was created to absolve yourselves. ** **You are not doomed, and your soul does not require salvation. No one's soul does. There is nothing to save it from. ****At the very worst, you will have to repeat as many third density cycles as is necessary in order for you to learn the things you need to learn,** in order to progress and graduate to fourth density positive. But one thing is for sure, you will get there in the end. All will find their way Home, to our Infinite Creator. **Your Purpose in the Game** **Your main purpose in the game is to work upon yourself. It is to grow, develop, and transform yourself into a more positive and loving being. **You had certain goals that you planned to achieve before incarnating here, which is a main reason for the veil of forgetfulness being in place. If you already knew what your goals were, the game would be too easy. Look at the things in your life that you most love to do. Ask yourself what makes you most happy. Experience these things as often as possible, as they will be related to some of the things you chose to put into your soul contract to do here. **Also look at the negative things that often seem to recur during your lifetime. It will be highly likely that these are also things that you chose to come here to work upon.** Let us say for example, that you chose to come here to work upon patience during this incarnation. You will likely find that you have a tendency towards impatience, and that life will often bring many experiences to you in order to test your patience.

You will likely find that you have a tendency towards impatience, and that life will often bring many experiences to you in order to test your patience. The idea being that rather than losing your temper, you work upon your impatience and resolve to become a more temperate and patient soul. This same analogy may be applied to all manner of circumstances in which life will test you. Look for and begin to identify any recurring issues that you perhaps struggle to deal with. Identify issues which seem to present themselves to you time and time again - perhaps anger, being abusive, selfishness, hatred, cynicism, and the list goes on. Whenever you find recurring circumstances, it is because you are being presented with opportunity after opportunity to work upon these issues until you get it right. Eventually you will choose a way of behavior that is more positive. Once you've successfully identified these issues within your life, worked upon them, and used them as the tools of transformation that they are to improve the quality of your character, you will notice that these things seem to almost cease to appear in your life. You will still be presented with them at varying intervals, to check that you have not forgotten that which you have learned, but they will be fewer and far between. **Working on Yourself** Work upon yourself. Go inside in a state of meditative contemplation. Still your mind that your soul may have room in which to make its \"still-small voice\" heard. Ask your Infinite Creator to help you, and listen to your inner voice. Be patient. It takes time to develop this inner communication after a lifetime of neglect. Use your negative emotions when they arise as the tools that they truly are. Train yourself to notice when negativity arises in you. **When you catch yourself projecting a negative thought, remember that all thought is creative, and ask yourself if that is really what you want to create.** It takes a while to become proficient, but do not give up. Just keep noticing your negative thought patterns as they arise, and in so doing, simply choose again and select a response that is more positive. It is called working on yourself and is the main reason you have chosen to be here right now - to work upon yourself. When you persevere and keep working on yourself, gradually it will come to you.

It is hard work to trust yourself when all those around you doubt you and call you crazy, but it is the job you came here to do. The only real and lasting truth is a self-realized one. Messengers can come and go and show you truth until they're blue in the face. But it will not be your truth until you have realized for yourself, deep within the core of your being, that it \"feels\" true for you. Never accept something as true, just because someone tells you it is so. But when your inner voice guides you that a truth is true, and you feel that old warm feeling of excitement welling up from somewhere deep within that says \"Yes! I knew it!\", hold on to that feeling (feelings are the language of your soul). Guard it carefully, as you can be sure that your newfound beliefs will be challenged in many ways. It is designed this way, to test you. Your inner truth must be able to withstand the test of time. It will be given a thorough examination. Hold fast to it, so long as it is what you know to be true deep within. Allow nothing or no one outside of you to pull you from your path, no matter how fiercely they contend with you. They are just doing their job, even if they may not even be aware that this is what they are in fact doing. They are performing an important service to you, and you should be grateful to them for that. **Follow your heart. Listen to, and trust, your inner voice. ** **Working With Others** In getting your message out there, whilst being informative, always do your best not to feed the fear and paranoia, as this will act contrary to your intentions of raising the vibration to positive.

Be as a light shining in the darkness. Do not burn others with your light, but rather allow them to be drawn to your light. And be of service to those who come to you willingly. In other words, do not become evangelical with your message, but rather be the enigmatic and loving \"wise old sage\", to whom others are drawn to because of the quality of vibration, rather than the volume of rhetoric. **Most importantly, practice that which you preach. **Others must be able to see the effect of our Infinite Creator conducting his wonderful work through you.

They are here to awaken themselves, and then to help awaken others to prepare for the coming great harvest. Yet even if they fail to awaken, these souls are not bound by the third density cycle, as they've already mastered it. Once their incarnation is over, they are again free to return to their appropriate levels. Many who do not believe now will begin to open their minds as the Earth changes that are coming begin to take effect.

The harvest and parallel planet scenario may also be more metaphor than reality. Many living on Earth now experience their lives as a living hell. Yet there are also those whose lives are like heaven on Earth. The harvest may happen naturally for each of us at the moment we die and leave this physical reality.

According to Svali, Illuminati bloodline children are heavily conditioned to be obedient, self-controlled, and totally loyal to \"the family.\" In special activities carried out under extreme secrecy, they are subjected from a very young age to intense sessions using drugs, hypnosis, and shock-reward conditioning which turn them into [Manchurian Candidates](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse) with alter personalities. **In their normal lives, they remember nothing of what is done to them in these sessions.** Some of these Illuminati children are groomed for the military or politics, while others are prepared to take on key business positions.

Throughout their lives, most family members in these Illuminati bloodlines have no conscious awareness of their dual lifestyle. To themselves, their neighbors, and others, they appear to be normal, upstanding citizens. Yet unknown to their own normal identity, their alter personalities are regularly accessed using code words and ordered to attend secret activities at designated times where they are programmed to forward the Illuminati's hidden agenda. **Svali alleges that higher level political positions in all Western countries are heavily occupied or controlled by members of the Illuminati bloodlines.** She also says it is quite rare that Illuminati members ever leave the fold. The pressures against this are great, including the need to abandon spouse, children, house, money, and more. Svali was only able to leave after it dawned on her that, because in her role as an Illuminati trainer she was telling lies to the young Illuminati children, she must have been lied to herself from the time she was quite young. Svali has an abundance of intriguing information on the Illuminati and ritual abuse available on a website at [this link](http://web.archive.org/web/20110519192605/http://www.suite101.com/articles.cfm/ritual_abuse). Her rare audio interview with researcher Greg Szymanski in January 2006 is [available here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/audio/svali_interview). For the written transcript of that interview, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali_interview). The below is a 50-page written interview with her conducted in 2000 by HJ Springer. Svali stopped speaking on this topic in 2006. For information on how you can make a difference, see the \"[What you can do](#what)\" box after this article. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **HJ Springer's Introduction to the Interview** While running our series '[The Illuminati: How the Cult Programs People](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/cult_programming_illuminati)' we received a few emails that were of somewhat skeptical nature and/or requesting more information. Needless to say I had some questions of my own regarding some details of the Illuminati and their agenda, and so I got in touch with 'Svali' (her pseudonym), an Ex-Illuminati bloodline programmer/trainer, to find out more about her claims. In the following few episodes I will enlighten you (pardon the pun), as much as I can, with additional knowledge I received from her.

HJ Springer **The Illuminati Bloodlines** ** Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali** ** Part 1: About Svali** Dear Mr. Springer, Thank you for contacting me. Actually, I just received a somewhat skeptical email today from someone who read the information at your site. I would be more than happy to answer questions about validity, etc. with the following provision. I write under a pen name to protect my two children and husband, whom I do not want to have receiving hostile or threatening phone calls, etc. My two children are still healing from the experiences of being raised in the group as well, and I don't want any experiences that could traumatize them. The topic I am addressing is somewhat volatile, to say the least. People have strong emotions pro and con as to whether the Illuminati are real. That said, I will give you a little background info, feel free to share this with readers. Also, [my column at Suite101.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20110519192605/http://www.suite101.com/articles.cfm/ritual_abuse) has numerous articles on this topic if people want to learn more. 1. I was born in 1957 in Alexandria, Virginia. I lived briefly in a small town about an hour away from Washington, DC, then moved to a 500 acre farm in northern Virginia when my mother married my stepfather. Both my mother and my stepfather were members of this group. It is a very generational group. My mother sat on the regional council over the Washington, DC area and was in the \"spiritual chair\" (**the Illuminati have 6 chairs on their ascended masters council: Sciences, Government, Leadership, Scholarship, Spiritual, and Military**). These also correlate to the areas that children are taught growing up in this group. They believe in \"well rounded\" children. The \"spiritual\" rituals, or occult rituals, were only one small part of the teaching of this group. The other five areas are also equally emphasized. I spent more time learning history, languages, and sciences than I did seeing rituals, although they were important to the group. 2. I went to school in Charlottesville, Va. 1975 to 1981, where I received a BSN in nursing, and a BA in Spanish (I got two degrees). This is also a place where a lot of intense abuse and occultic crimes occurred on an estate about 10 miles south west of Charlottesville going towards Crowley, Virginia. 3. After graduation, I went to San Diego in 1981. I was called there by the leadership there. They were strong in military training but weak in sciences, which was my forte.

After graduation, I went to San Diego in 1981. I was called there by the leadership there. They were strong in military training but weak in sciences, which was my forte. I came and sat on leadership council. **I was the sixth head trainer there (the lowest head trainer) and had 30 trainers in the local groups reporting to me.** Leadership council met in Ramona, Ca. on an estate there that belonged to a man named Jonathan Meiers. When I went to the police in 1996 (after I had left the group) sure enough, there was an estate there belonging to someone with that name. One of his cult names was \"Black Hand\" because he wore black gloves when he worked with people. He was the head trainer in the group, and one of the most sadistic and brutal people I ever knew. He burned out most of the trainers that worked with him, and I made it because I had a friend on leadership council who hated him and helped me undermine him (the Illuminati are a very political and back stabbing group, a \"dog eat dog\" mentality; everyone wants to move up). Her cult name was Athena. **After years (12) of working with Jonathan, I moved up to the second head trainer position in the county.** Jonathan was getting ready to move to regional, and he wanted me to take his place. But he and I also despised each other, and he set me up to take a fall. That's a whole different story, and was one of the factors that made me leave the group. **I left the group in 1995, sick of the lying, deceiving, and politics, and fearful for my life.** I fled to Texas, and went through therapy with Dr. Jerry Mundgaze and his group. But unfortunately, they didn't know how to help \"deprogram me\", or as Dr. Mundgaze told me, \"you are higher than almost anyone we have seen, and more programmed.\" I remembered so much, and he had never heard of it and had no idea how to help (definitely no suggesting of memories there, most of mine occurred spontaneously, AT HOME. I have never been hypnotized or age regressed, all of my memories have occurred in the course of daily life). **I spent a year intensely deprogramming myself. I was a head programmer, or trainer, so I used my knowledge to undo what was done to me. I also became enraged as I realized that the abuse I had endured (and done to others) was NOT normal, was used to manipulate me, etc.** [My", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:3:8a47de17bdd4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14219, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "most of mine occurred spontaneously, AT HOME.

I was a perpetrator, and I now regret it considerably. It is my restitution before God as I expose what this group does and stands for. I also wrote it for therapists, to help them understand the group and its methodologies, since it was so difficult to hear from a nationally known ritual abuse center, \"we don't know what to do...\". I based it on what I did to heal. Two years ago, my children were on visitation with me and disclosed their abuse to me. I went to CPS, and the case was closed, because the worker said she didn't believe in ritual abuse! My ex came to get the children (he could have put me in federal prison for not giving the children back, since the San Diego court system blatantly states that they do not believe in ritual abuse, and in EVERY case of alleged RA, the children are given to the allegedly abusing parent). The children confronted him in person. He turned white as a sheet, said, \"you really don't want to go back to 'family'?\" They said \"no\". He then fled to California, quit his job, and moved out here and is in therapy for RA and DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder). My children are also in therapy, and healing rapidly. My now 12 year old son is almost completely integrated, and happier than he has ever been before; my 16 year old daughter has some tough issues to face, such as the sexual abuse she endured. But God has been faithful in His healing work in all of our lives. **I wish that this was just \"made up\". That it weren't real. But it is. There is too much documentation of this occurring (I can send you an URL for documented convicted RA cases). My greatest regret is that I was used by this group, after a lifetime of teaching, to be a perpetrator of the worst kind. I used to torture and abuse others, believing that I was \"helping\" them.** Now, I realize that what I did was wrong, I have asked God's forgiveness. And I am committed to exposing this group through my writing. I am also a professional writer in the medical field, was a registered nurse for 18+ years, and currently work as an ESL teacher, health educator, and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:4:d747737193d1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14220, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "this group, after a lifetime of teaching, to be a perpetrator of the worst kind.

I am also a professional writer in the medical field, was a registered nurse for 18+ years, and currently work as an ESL teacher, health educator, and freelance author (on non-abuse topics!). I hope this is enough background info, it is the truth before God and men. If you need any other that won't compromise my anonymity or my children's protection, please let me know. PS. My younger sister remembers being tied up on a stone altar at the age of 3 with a gag in her mouth and being raped. She also remembers our paternal grandmother taking her to friends who used her sexually at the ages of 3 to 5. She became an alcoholic at age 13, after trying to commit suicide 7 times by age 12. My older brother has NO memories of ANYTHING AT ALL before age 20. His life is a complete blank. He does believe that our father was a perverse and strange man. This brother was cut down from our garage when he was 8 and tried to hang himself. My oldest brother is on the run, afraid to live anywhere for more than a few months, because he believes they want to \"get him.\" He also tried to commit suicide many times as a young child. This is somewhat corroborating evidence, as well as the fact that both of my children dream in German at night (that is the language they speak in the Illuminati) and have NEVER heard it in the daytime. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** ** Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali** ** Part 2: Who and What is the Illuminati?** Q: Does it upset you to write about the Illuminati and their bloodlines? Svali: It doesn't upset me to write on the topic of the Illuminati, I was explaining why I write under a pen name, that is all. I received a letter recently in which it was alleged that I write under a pen name because I'm a phony, which is not true at all. I am a freelance writer on the side (I write for nursing magazines and publications on health topics that have NOTHING to do with abuse) and understand the need for fact checking, so no offense is taken at your wanting to know my background.

I am unknown and prefer it this way. I have absolutely no secondary gain from doing this, other than the medical bills for my children, which means I work three part-time jobs. This is to answer the skeptics who say that people disclose for: sympathy (I don't want any and don't need it. I made choices and mistakes in my life, and am now involved in restitution); money (I earn $20 a MONTH for my site on Suite 101. I earn $150 to $250 an article when I write on women's health. Guess which topic I write on more frequently? Yep, women's health, on completely non-abuse issues. The editors of the nursing magazines and women's magazines don't know about the other topic I write on, another reason I write under a pen name.) I don't write for fame. Instead, if my co-workers knew about my past, I risk losing my job. I have everything to lose by disclosing, everything to gain by being silent. But I also know that this kind of child abuse must be stopped. As a Christian, and as one who stands against child abuse, I have decided to speak out against cult abuse by writing articles that expose it. I also know that there are a number of people outspoken on this topic who have published, and they could possibly be back-up information for you. I don't know any of them, since I have no contact with other survivors other than my own family, but it is a possibility. Anyway, to your questions: Q: Svali, I think our readers are wondering 'Is the Illuminati a religion, secret society, Satanism or is it a combination of it, or something different all together, or more sinister?' Svali: **The Illuminati is a group that practices a form of faith known as \"enlightenment\". It is LUCIFERIAN, and they teach their followers that their roots go back to the ancient mystery religions of Babylon, Egypt, and Celtic druidism. They have taken what they consider the \"best\" of each, the foundational practices, and joined them together into a strongly occult discipline.** Many groups at the local level worship ancient deities such as \"El\", \"Baal\", and \"Ashtarte\", as well as \"Isis and Osiris\" and \"Set\". This said, the leadership councils at times scoff at the more \"primitive\" practices of the anarchical, or lower levels. I remember when I was on council in San Diego, they called the high priests and priestesses the \"slicers", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:6:f6aa2f931629", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14222, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "what they consider the \"best\" of each, the foundational practices, and joined them together into a strongly occult discipline.** Many groups at the local level worship ancient deities such as \"El\", \"Baal\", and \"Ashtarte\", as well as \"Isis and Osiris\" and \"Set\". This said, the leadership councils at times scoff at the more \"primitive\" practices of the anarchical, or lower levels. I remember when I was on council in San Diego, they called the high priests and priestesses the \"slicers and dicers\", who kept the \"lower levels happy\". This is not to offend anyone, it only shows that at the leadership levels, they often believe they are more scientifically and cognitively driven. But they still practice the principles of enlightenment. **There are 12 steps to this, also known as \"the 12 steps of discipline\". And they also teach traveling astral planes, time travel, and other metaphysical phenomena. Do people really do this, or is it a drug induced hallucination? I cannot judge. I saw things that I believe cannot be rationally explained when in this group, things that frightened me, but I can only say that it could be a combination of cult mind control, drug inductions, hypnosis, and some true demonic activity. How much of each, I cannot begin to guess. I do know that these people teach and practice evil.** At the higher levels, the group is no longer people in robes chanting in front of bonfires. Leadership councils have administrators who handle finances (and trust me, this group makes money. That alone would keep it going even if the rest were just religious hog wash). The leadership levels include businessmen, bankers, and local community leaders. They are intelligent, well educated, and active in their churches. Above local leadership councils are the regional councils, who give dictates to the groups below them, help form the policies and agendas for each region, and who interact with the local leadership councils. **At the national level, there are extremely wealthy people who finance these goals and interact with the leaders of other countries. The Illuminati are international. Secret? By all means. The first thing a child learns from \"family, or the Order\" as they are called, is \"The first rule of the Order is secrecy\". This is why you don't hear from more survivors who get out. The lengths that this group goes to, to terrify its members into not disclosing, is unbelievable.** **I have seen set ups (oh, yes, they set up fake deaths, etc.) where a person was \"burned alive\" to teach the children not to tell. They are told that this is a traitor who disclosed, and now he is being punished. The person wasn't really a traitor and is in a flame proof vest, but the vision of a person on fire and screaming remains with 3 and 4 year old children for a lifetime. And, when", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:7:65748d808290", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14223, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "is unbelievable.** **I have seen set ups (oh, yes, they set up fake deaths, etc.) where a person was \"burned alive\" to teach the children not to tell. They are told that this is a traitor who disclosed, and now he is being punished. The person wasn't really a traitor and is in a flame proof vest, but the vision of a person on fire and screaming remains with 3 and 4 year old children for a lifetime. And, when they are adults, even if they DO leave, scenes such as this mean they won't tell many people for fear of being traced and punished.** **Because I helped create a lot of set ups as an adult trainer, I became somewhat cynical and have chosen to disclose as a result, although I do fight intense fear even now at times. Try being buried in a wooden box for a period of time (it may have been minutes, but to a four year old it is an eternity), and then when the lid is lifted being told, \"if you ever tell, we'll put you back in forever\". The child will scream hysterically that they will NEVER EVER tell. I was that child, and now I am breaking that vow made under psychological duress. Because I don't want any other children to go through what I did or have seen done to others.** Yes, the Illuminati are organized, secretive, and extremely wealthy at its upper levels. They are not stupid, or poor people running around dabbling with witchcraft. To see them as this is a huge misconception. Q: How widespread would you say this group has infiltrated our society in terms of number of people? Are they present in every town or city throughout North America? Do they take or recruit outsiders? And how far does this group go to keep this knowledge Svali: I think I answered some of the secrecy above. The Illuminati are present in every major metropolitan center in the United States. They have divided the United States up into 7 major regions, and each has a regional council over it, with the heads of the local councils reporting to them. They meet once every two months, and on special occasions. A metropolitan region may have as many as 10 to 30 groups within it, and rural areas will often have meetings with other local groups, and report to the metro leadership council. They almost NEVER recruit outsiders, although occasionally they will buy children or a family from Asia, for example, and keep them under constant surveillance in return for saving their life from the local Mafia. They are threatened with being returned to this group if they ever disclose. **They also have excellent lawyers who are well paid to help cover their tracks. There are also people in the media paid to help keep stories from coming", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:8:9e1ef221b851", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14224, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "to the metro leadership council. They almost NEVER recruit outsiders, although occasionally they will buy children or a family from Asia, for example, and keep them under constant surveillance in return for saving their life from the local Mafia. They are threatened with being returned to this group if they ever disclose. **They also have excellent lawyers who are well paid to help cover their tracks. There are also people in the media paid to help keep stories from coming out. I know of three people in San Diego who worked for the Union Tribune who were faithful Illuminists, and who also wrote frequent articles attacking local therapists who worked with RA (Ritual Abuse) survivors. I remember leadership boasting they had \"run so-and-so out of town\" because of a media blitz, and being quite happy about it.** The Illuminati believe in controlling an area through its: banks and financial institutions (guess how many sit on banking boards? You'd be surprised) Local government: guess how many get elected to local city councils? Law: children are encouraged to go to law school and medical school. Media: others are encouraged to go to journalism school, and members help fund local papers. Q: Is this the same Illuminati that was created by Adam Weishaupt in Germany? Svali: Weishaupt did not create the Illuminati, they chose him as a figurehead and told him what to write about. The financiers, dating back to the bankers during the times of the Templar Knights who financed the early kings in Europe, created the Illuminati. Weishaupt was their \"go fer\", who did their bidding. Q: Do you have anymore info about the political goals, if any, of the Illuminati? Svali: This article I wrote for Suite101.com addresses it: \"[Are the Illuminati taking over the world?](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/illuminati/svali1_00.htm)\" You can reprint it, or part of it, as long as you give credit to Suite 101 and/or a link back to the site. Q: How do Illuminati members recognize each other? Svali: Since it is generational, its easy. It isn't hard to recognize one's father, mother, siblings, and neighbors and friends one has grown up with. The Illuminati use telephone trees to contact members when a meeting is to occur. A month or two ahead of time, leadership council plans dates and places for meetings for different groups under their umbrella. They then call local leaders a week ahead of time (the high priest or priestess). Two days ahead, these people call their head members, who then call the people under them. A person knows their status in the group by how far ahead of time they know a meeting date. The lower in the group, the less they are trusted with information, and the less \"lag time\" before meetings. Sometimes, certain pieces of jewelry, such as a ruby ring or an oval emerald, might be worn if meeting someone in a public", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:9:11ca266e47ff", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14225, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "priest or priestess).

Sometimes, certain pieces of jewelry, such as a ruby ring or an oval emerald, might be worn if meeting someone in a public place at a prearranged assignation. But most accessing and contact is done through family members or close friends. When I lived in San Diego, my entire family of origin and my four closest friends were all members of the group. It wasn't hard to reach me, to say the least. My spouse was also a member. The Illuminati believe in arranged members, and do NOT allow their members to marry a nonmember. If someone says their spouse isn't in it, they aren't Illuminati, or they are in denial. This was an unbreakable policy. My marriage was arranged by the local leadership council to another ranking member. I didn't want to marry him, because I didn't love him, and I will never forget what I was told by Athena, my mentor at the time (she held the second position on the council): \"That's for the best, then, because he can never hurt you or control you.\" Or, my mother's timeless advice given when I was 12 years old: \"Never fu-- someone lower than you. They will drag you down. Always choose someone higher than yourself.\" She was an ambitious woman, to say the least, determined that I would do well in this very political group. I took her advice, and Athena was my lover and protected me from some of the SOBs on leadership in San Diego, especially Jonathan, the head trainer. She taught me his weaknesses and how to get around him, and stood up to him for me. I wouldn't have survived otherwise. **These are NOT nice people and they use and manipulate others viciously.** They cut their eye teeth on status, power, and money. I have given all of that up to leave, and am glad to be away from it now, although I do miss some of my friends, and at times I miss the respect of being a leader. But I am learning to live a whole new life without the constant background of \"family\" monitoring and telling me what to do. Know what the hardest part of getting out was? The freedom - not having anyone telling me what to do. I literally went through a period of adjustment, felt wobbly, trying to figure out what I wanted to do. It was hard since I was used to reflexively checking my decisions with leadership and Jonathan and my husband.

What's your inside on this, in regards to film making, symbolism, subliminals, the whole scene in general? Svali: Oh, boy, do you have a few hours? I'll try to be brief. **The Illuminati believe that to control the media is to control the public. **This is one of their stated agendas. Remember, finances, media, law, government and education are the areas they targeted as being the best to dominate society. **How do they do this? They don't go to a film producer and say, \"Oh, by the way, we're Illuminati members and we want you to make a movie that promotes our agenda\". (Remember, they aren't stupid, either). Instead, they will form a small investment corporation that funds movies with ideas that they like. They quietly hire actors and producers and directors and scripts, but they never mention their affiliation publicly or why they are doing this.** Money talks, and especially in Hollywood. If you have money, you can get about anything made, and they know this. They can also channel money into advertising campaigns, etc. for their films (how many Christian films have had major ad campaigns in the past twenty years? Very few. How many occult movies have? I rest my case). **This has been a slow, subtle process because they are patient. They have been working behind the scenes for hundreds of years, and they know that the public is slow to accept new ideas, that it has to be done gradually. (They call it leading in the \"sheep\" which is one of their terms for the \"unenlightened\").** And it has been. The number of occult films that has come out in the past ten years alone should make anyone pause and think. Why so many films with this theme? Why the desensitization of America's youth to the occult and magic? Just look at Saturday morning cartoons. I don't allow my children to watch them, except for \"animaniacs\" and Bugs Bunny at times.

Instead, we rent old classics with Audrey Hepburn and John Wayne. I can send you some articles that did an excellent job of investigating Walt Disney (he was an Illuminist, and Fantasia was used to program children). **Some films that blatantly portray the Illuminist agenda: The Matrix. **You could have peeled me off the ceiling when I saw that one. The references to conditioning and the core were so blatant, it wasn't funny. Fight Club: I love Brad Pitt and Ed Norton, and this film is a nod at the covert military buildup going on that the average person doesn't realize. Also, Ed is dissociative in the film, as Pitt's character takes over (notice that the cult-creating military figure is the \"stronger\" one in the story?). The Labyrinth: I haven't seen this, but my husband did, and everything he mentioned is pure Illuminati programming stories used with children. Any movies with an occult viewpoint, or that show supernatural psychic phenomena, astral travel, or contact with the spirit world are guaranteed to be part of this agenda. I don't watch them, myself. Saw enough of the real thing to last me this lifetime. The sensationalization of rituals and other occult insignia on television is another example. Ghost stories. Witch stories. Children's books about wizards and their training that are extremely popular. Oh, yes, Starship Trooper. This one had so many cult symbols (the Illuminists have a strong Aryan ideology going, too) that I almost laughed outright when I saw it. I counted at least 100 in it. Someone had fun going tongue-in-cheek with the Illuminist agenda in that one. **Many fine actors and actresses are being used in films funded by these people. Some may know the agenda, most probably do not, as long as they receive a pay check. Some are also Illuminists as well, although I don't know who is.** I do know a few, but I don't want to risk a libel suit here. Anyway, I was too busy training and going to meetings and learning the effects of drugs on people to pay much attention to that part of the group when I was in it.

I lived a very relatively boring life as a teacher and head trainer, and we rarely discussed the media except the fact that it, too, was another tool to bring in \"The New Order\", which is the motivation for all Illuminists. **I want to address another misconception. That is, the one that the Illuminists know that they are evil. When I was in the group, I and those around me were ideologically committed to the agenda as being GOOD. I thought I was helping others reach their full potential when I was a trainer.** I believed that after years of sweat and hard work, that my intelligence won out, and that I made an excellent leader. I fought Jonathan and others on the council when I thought they were unfair, and stood up for the people beneath me. Others did the same. **They honestly think they are doing a GOOD thing, and if you told them it was wrong, or evil, they would look confused.** It took a LOT of therapy and deprogramming myself, doing reality checks with non-cult people to realize that it was all a lie. I was devastated. I had dedicated my life to helping others bring in the glorious new order, and then found out it was EVIL and abusive. I went through a period of intense grieving/mourning over this. **Most Illuminists I knew weren't evil, they were deceived. Only the top leadership perhaps were consciously being hurtful.** **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 4: The Illuminati - Freemason Connection** Q: Svali, one of the more important points, which I am sure a lot of readers would like to know more about, is, what is the Illuminati /Freemason connection, as far as you are aware of, given your previous position in the Illuminati? Q: Was - and is - there an infiltration of the Masonic Order? Svali: **The Freemasons and the Illuminati are hand in glove. I don't care if this steps on any toes, it's a fact. The Masonic temple at Alexandria, Virginia (the city itself was named after Alexandria, Egypt, and is a hotbed of Illuminati activity) is a center in the Washington DC area for Illuminati scholarship and teaching. I was taken there at intervals for testing, to step up a level, for scholarship, and high ceremonies. The leaders in this Masonic group were also Illuminists.** **This has been true of every large city I have lived in. The top Freemasons were also top Illuminists. **My maternal grandparents were both high ranking Masons in the city of Pittsburgh,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:13:a34c98f30ad4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14229, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "Egypt, and is a hotbed of Illuminati activity) is a center in the Washington DC area for Illuminati scholarship and teaching.

The top Freemasons were also top Illuminists. **My maternal grandparents were both high ranking Masons in the city of Pittsburgh, Pa. (president of the Eastern Star and 33rd degree Mason) and they both were also leaders in the Illuminati in that area. **Are all Masons Illuminati? No, especially at the lower levels, I believe they know nothing of the practices that occur in the middle of the night in the larger temples. Many are probably fine businessmen and Christians. But I have never known a 32 degree or above who wasn't Illuminati, and the group helped create Freemasonry as a \"front\" for their activities.** Q: What exactly is the meaning of the pyramid on the back of the $1 U.S. note? I'm talking about the pyramid with the capstone detached and hovering above the rest of the pyramid, containing the 'All-Seeing-Eye'. Is this a Masonic or Illuminati symbol? Svali: The pyramid and the \"eye of Horus\" on the back of the dollar bill are Illuminati symbology. The pyramid is an ancient form based on the holiness of the number 3 to the ancient mystery religions (it, not 6, is considered the most spiritual number), and a pyramid was a structure used specifically to call up the demonic, or occult, a point of psychic activity. The eye is the all seeing eye of Horus (remember the emphasis on Egyptian magical religious practices? The book of the undead, etc.?) and the fact that no one can escape his magical reach. This eye is considered a demonic eye in the group, or the eye of the deity, and in Illuminati mythology is either open or closed, depending upon the spiritual time of year and the state of the person psychically. Young children are given \"psychic surgery\" where the eye is placed inside, and they are told that Horus will snatch their soul if they ever try to leave, or if they tell, or that the eye will explode. **The symbol on the dollar is reinforcement for every Illuminati child who sees one, and the reminder that they are being watched.** **The saying on the dollar, 'Novus Ordo Seclorum' also means \"bringing in the new order\", which is the Illuminati stated agenda.** Just think, in the early 1800's, our forefathers already were looking forward to when the new order would be ushered in.

Q: How far back in time does the concept/cult of the Illuminati go? It seems to me that they have been around quite some time, possibly since antiquity, guiding, steering and using humanity for their own purposes, operating under different names? Can you elaborate? Svali: **I was taught that the Illuminati had its roots in the ancient practices that reach into the beginning of recorded time;** that the Babylonians on the plains created ziggurats to their deities, whom the Illuminati worship. They were proud of the fact that it was supposedly an unbroken occult line from then until now. The names changed, the basic group was the same. The ancient mystery religions of Egypt, heart of dark magic were another forerunner, with adherents of Set, Osiris, Horus and Ra; and the Illuminists also believe their bloodlines have come down from the ancient kings of Egypt. **It's hard for me to know how much was cult propaganda, and how much truth is in the claims.** The Templar Knights were definitely a forerunner during medieval times, as well as the Rosicrucians and ancient celts and druids (you know, the ones who built Stonehenge). **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 5 - Illuminati - CIA Connection - Russia & China** Svali: **I just want you and your readers to know that I am NOT an Illuminati expert, nor do I want to be. I am only a survivor who was part of this group, in a lower management position locally.** I did NOT rub elbows with the rich and famous, although I heard about things that occurred at higher levels (people do gossip even in the cult, they're still human beings). There are other people who have come out and disclosed. I don't know them personally, but I have heard about them.

There are others, and if you go to the Suite101.com site, there are links to resources and also survivor pages. Survivorship.org also has links. Some survivors have self-published their stories on the web, to help the public know that this is going on. I am only one person among many who has come out to talk about my experiences, and **my experiences are limited to what one person did in the Washington, DC area and the San Diego, Ca. area between 1957 and 1995 - a person who was doing their job at the time, was very misguided, and who is now heartily sorry for the things that I once participated in. ** Q: How do survivors remain anonymous after seeking help? Would the cult not go to extreme measures to find and silence programmers or members that have left the cult? To what ends would they go to shut you up? A: At Suite 101, and in [my book](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali_book_svali_speaks), I wrote a whole chapter on staying safe. [Here's the URL](http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/ritual_abuse/42927) for the Suite 101 article: Breaking Free of the Cult. It includes tips on staying safe. Yes, they do try to recontact people who get out. The first way they do this is through their family (remember they are transgenerational). My mother told me to \"come back or die\" four years ago, which triggered off lethal self destruct programming inside (I believe she was counting on my coming back, but she was wrong and I almost died. God spared my life). I then had to go in and dismantle it all. When I left, the head trainer was pretty arrogant. He had said I would be dead within 6 months if I remembered, because \"no one could remember with what I put in her and live\". Direct quote from Jonathan M., head trainer, and I hope he reads this article. Second, a lot of people get abducted and reaccessed because they phone their perps or go out alone at night. You wouldn't believe the stories I have heard from survivors who told me they went out at 2 or 3 am to the store, alone, walking down alleys. What were they thinking???? I helped one survivor get out three years ago. She was being harassed by the group, and was fighting back. She literally pulled a gun on a would-be abductor and he backed away (he had his gun", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:16:b4f607a42b40", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14232, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "because they phone their perps or go out alone at night.

She literally pulled a gun on a would-be abductor and he backed away (he had his gun out) when she asked him, \"and who of the two of us do you think is the better shot?\" She was an expert marksman. She stayed with me for 6 months, and is free of the group. They usually do give up after awhile, and get tired of trying to pull people back. I could never live in San Diego, or DC, though. The chances of running into an old trainer or someone I knew would be too great. Instead, having physical distance (people in the cult in this state don't know me or care about me one way or the other) helps. I also have tons of accountability. These people like secrecy, and won't usually act out in public if someone is with people who aren't part of their group. I have heard of people being assassinated, which is one reason that I don't go on T.V., or speak publicly. I live very quietly and anonymously out here. MOST cult recontact comes because the person recontacts, though. The pull to go back is enormous at times, and has to be fought a lot, especially in the first years. **To find out why someone would go back to their abusers, read my article on \"[Trauma Bonding: The Pull to the Perpetrator](http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/ritual_abuse/50317)\" at Suite 101. ** Q: I want to get back to the Illuminati's political agenda. **What is the connection between the CIA, FBI, and other secret services and the cult?** To what degree are they infiltrated? And what is the real agenda of these secret services? A: **They are all infiltrated. I don't think everyone in these groups are Illuminists, but a lot of the leadership is. An example: my mother was friends with [Sid Gottlieb](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-sidney-gottlieb-80-dies-took-lsd-cia), who was part of the CIA.** The farm I grew up on was only about a half hour away from his home in Culpeper, Va. She also knew the Dulles family. A lot of the researchers in the CIA were part of it. And I visited Langley, Va. at intervals growing up. **[MK-Ultra](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050626mkultra) was funded in part with Illuminati money.** These people use the most sophisticated mind control techniques on their members, believe me. **When I was in San Diego, human experimentation was still going on.

Jonathan and I were investigating the effects of certain drugs on inducing trance states and assisting with programming. We would take the data, and download it into a database (oh, yes, the cult is very technologically sophisticated) and then send it to Langley.** **Many of the administrators and directors at the FBI are also Illuminists. The CIA [helped bring over german scientists](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-project-paperclip-dark-side-the-moon) after WWII. Many of these were also Illuminati leaders in their own country, and they were welcomed with open arms by the U.S. group. They also funnelled all information they were learning to the Illuminati. ** Q: I assume if the U.S. political, banking, and military systems are all fairly well under Illuminati control this would then also be true for Eastern Europe, Russia and other communist bloc countries as well. What does this mean for relations between the West-East axis? Was Russia, or the USSR at the time, ever the adversary it was made out to be, and was there a grand plan behind having Russia as an enemy? A: **Russia was never really a threat to us. Marxism was funded by the Illuminati, and espoused as a counterbalance to capitalism. The Illuminati believe strongly in balancing opposing forces, in the pull between opposites. They see history as a complex chess game, and they will fund one side, then another, while ultimately out of the chaos and division ..., they are laughing because they are ultimately beyond political parties.** A top western financier will secretly meet with an eastern or russian \"adversary\" during those years, and have a good laugh at how the \"sheep\" were being deluded. I am sharing here what I was taught, and also observed. **When DELPHI met with ORACLE in Europe, (these are the head training groups for the northern hemisphere and european continents) the Russian, German, French, British, Canadian, and US trainers all worked together. In fact, this is one reason why plurality of linguality is valued in the Illuminati. I had to learn six languages as a child, and learn to converse with people from around the world.

Is all this occurring according to Illuminati agenda or is there still a fairly large 'uncertainty, random or x-factor' involved that is beyond the Illuminati's control? A: I have been out for five years, so my information is \"old news\". But the military buildup of China is part of their plan. There are members of the group who are Asian, and very opportunistic.** The Oriental Mafia groups are very much linked to Illuminati activity. The random factor in all of this is how the average citizen reacts. It can't be predicted, although Illuminati leadership will often invent different scenarios, and try to decide how they will act if the ordinary citizens react in an unexpected manner.** I was told that around 2020, the Illuminist agenda would be revealed openly. I don't know if this is accurate, or just propaganda that I was taught, or if they have changed this date since I was in the group. Q: Svali, earlier you were talking about mind control victims and survivors that have come forward with their stories and publicized it. One of the more recent and high profile stories is the one of Cathy O'Brien [see links [here](http://web.archive.org/web/200101062114/http://www.vegan.swinternet.co.uk/articles/conspiracies/cathyandmark.html) and [here](http://www.trance-formation.com)]. She seems to be more of a CIA mind control victim, which still sound very much like your own story, in terms of technology and technique. Do you think there could be an Illuminati connection? A: As I mentioned before, the CIA and the Illuminati are definitely linked. The top leadership in the CIA are also Illuminati leaders. I mentioned Dulles and Gottlieb as men I knew personally as a child and young adult. **The scientists that ran the MK-Ultra and other governmental mind control programs were Illuminists [brought over from Nazi Germany](https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/14b_mind_control).** That's why you will find that mind control victims ALWAYS speak German or have a dissociated part that speaks with a German accent; they are mimicking their abusers, which is very very common. You could say that the CIA and the Illuminati are hand in glove companions. I know that the different Illuminati groups around the US also send data on the experiments they do to the central computer at Langley, Va. (oh, yes, [human experimentation](https://www.WantToKnow.info/humanguineapigs) and [mind control experiments](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrolinformation) are still ongoing, it didn't stop with WWII). **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 6 - Ritual Abuse - Mind Control Denial; Bohemian Grove** Q: I just find it amazing that this sort of topic", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:19:12dec8279db5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14235, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "Illuminati are hand in glove companions.

Svali: Here is where I will sound really, really cynical. I'm not surprised, because **the Illuminati leadership often boasted that their best protection was that no one would believe what was happening. They also have their own media blitz campaign, one that is pretty effective. For example, a reporter with the initials M. S., who wrote articles on ritual abuse (RA) and mind control in the San Diego Union-Tribune, was a member of the Illuminati. His articles have almost a patent formula.** 1. He interviews supposedly respected doctors in the field. These people with scholarly credentials, the \"thinking man's verdict\" give a rational, measured conclusion: no logically thinking being could ever possibly believe in ritual abuse, and the therapists that treat victims of it are leading the poor people on, the gullible little dears being oppressed by therapists of a most vicious and mercenary bent. 2. He then exposes the \"fundamentalist, narrow minded\" \"raving\" and \"mentally ill\" people who say that ritual abuse is real, and the \"fraudulent\" or supposedly mercenary/attention seeking therapists that work with them. His word images create the image of a person practically foaming at the mouth, full of demented ravings, on this side of the fence. He then brings in the heart break of dear, precious families broken apart by the wicked therapists who are \"implanting\" ideas of ritual abuse in these poor victim's heads. Wrap up with the supposedly rational, caring, logical and compassionate person on the [FMS](http://www.fmsfonline.org/) [False Memory Syndrome] board saying how tragic it is that this is occurring, that something needs to be done. **M.S. never mentions that the therapists who work with ritual abuse survivors work for very low pay, or sometimes for free, to help these people break free of the chains of a lifetime. He never ever interviews the large percentage (>85%) of the psychological field that has stated that they believe that ritual abuse is, or could be real; instead, he only interviews the minority viewpoint to feed his agenda.** Q: Okay, so now we know that the normal media is quite biased at times. But, with the evidence out there, **why aren't more people concerned about the Illuminati?** Svali: **Because they simply can't, won't believe that this is happening.** I am a strong Christian, and in Revelations, it says that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:20:af076a769786", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14236, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "of the psychological field that has stated that they believe that ritual abuse is, or could be real; instead, he only interviews the minority viewpoint to feed his agenda.** Q: Okay, so now we know that the normal media is quite biased at times. But, with the evidence out there, **why aren't more people concerned about the Illuminati?** Svali: **Because they simply can't, won't believe that this is happening.** I am a strong Christian, and in Revelations, it says that right before the return of Jesus, people will be acting as if nothing has happened, that all is normal, in spite of evidence to the contrary. You could show people a video taken of a ritual, and they would declare: \"it has to be a fake; people just don't do those things.\" You can show them a site with pentagrams, buried bones, and other evidence, and they would say, \"Oh, that is just teenagers playing around\". You can show them photos of underground tunnels near Los Alamos, and they will say, \"Isn't that interesting. Must be some government project.\" They can be shown the scars on a survivor's body, from cigarette burns in childhood, and old lash marks that have healed on their back, and the question would be \"are you sure it wasn't self inflicted?\" **The evidence is there, but in my opinion, the average person does NOT want to know, and even when confronted with it, will look the other way. The [Franklin case](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence) is a point. How much evidence has come out? Or the [MK-Ultra documents](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse) that have been declassified, shown as real, and people ignore it.** Okay, I'll get off my soap box. But I believe that the media that downplays ritual abuse is feeding into a deep need in the average person to NOT know the reality. In fact, how can a person face the fact of great evil in mankind, unless they have either a strong faith in God, or are faced with insurmountable evidence? We as human beings want to believe the BEST of our race, not the worst, IMHO. Q: You probably have heard of the 'Bohemian Grove'. What do you know about this? Any connection to the Illuminati? Svali: I myself do not know anything about the Bohemian Grove. Remember, I wouldn't have been in a position to have much to do with it. Most of my connections were with Germany. I was never prostituted out, instead I taught others to be that. But I myself never went there, and really don't know anything about it. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful there. Now, if you were asking about the Masonic temple in Alexandria, Va., or the \"Institute' in Charlottesville, Va., or a small grove up in Canada with a bronze statue of Baal, I could help you.

Sorry I don't have anything to share on this topic. If the Bohemian Grove is occult, though, it probably definitely is known about by the Illuminati. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 7 - Illuminati Symbols and Clues; Level of Infiltration** Q: 'Yes, tell me more about that (German connection, masonic temple, the 'institute' and the Baal statue in Canada). What are some of the Illuminati trademarks, symbols and clues that are placed throughout society as their signals (other than the pyramid and all-seeing-eye of Horus), intentionally or unintentionally. Does the Illuminati get careless? A: To completely answer these questions, you would need my whole biography. I had thought once about writing it, but I doubt many would read it (seriously, this isn't false modesty) and also I really don't believe people will do anything about the Illuminati even if they know. Sorry for the cynicism, but it is based on a lifetime of experience. **The Illuminists don't care who prints this stuff, or if they are \"exposed\" because they are counting on the majority not believing it, having done a pretty good job with a media blitz campaign** (seen any articles in Newsweek or Time lately that addresses this other than as a laughable conspiracy theory? Guess who owns Time-Warner?). I have heard them laughing about this very thing in leadership meetings five years ago, and I doubt their attitude has changed much since then. If people DID believe this, if action were able to be taken, then I would be very surprised and quite happy. I'll give you an example. Two years ago, I tried to find a publisher for [my book](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali_book_svali_speaks) on how the Illuminati program people. I wanted it available for therapists who work with survivors. I couldn't find anyone willing to consider it. They told me it was much too controversial, and \"there is no market for this among the general public\". Sad, but true. At the same time, I do believe that God is in control of world history. I have exposed them and self published my book for free on the web to let those who work with survivors realize what they have been through. It's hard to help people leaving a group without understanding the traumas, both emotional and physical, that they have endured. Okay, now to your questions. 1. **The Bruderheist is the ruling council of Germany. It meets in the black forest region, which is considered", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:22:8a6fff274e86", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14238, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "believe that God is in control of world history. I have exposed them and self published my book for free on the web to let those who work with survivors realize what they have been through. It's hard to help people leaving a group without understanding the traumas, both emotional and physical, that they have endured. Okay, now to your questions. 1. **The Bruderheist is the ruling council of Germany. It meets in the black forest region, which is considered the center of the earth, and a vortex for psychical/spiritual energy. They are some of the most vicious people I have ever known in my life, and make the Nazis (who they encouraged) look like fun people. **They are still there, manipulating people, running banks, and channeling their dirty money to Brussels, Switzerland, and Cairo, Egypt. 2. **Canada has a very large Illuminati and Templar Knight community (they are hand in glove groups) that worship ancient deities.** The gold or bronze statue of Baal is in a holy grove on a large private estate between Quebec and Montreal. Since I was only 12 years old when I went there, the details aren't quite as clear. But the ceremonies there were full of people in white gowns, lots of flowers and fruits and votive offerings, singing, then the final sacrifice in the arms of the statue. 3. Illuminati trademarks: these are the most cautionary people on earth. They try to leave absolutely NO tracks. Most of the symbology can be seen on T.V. or movies, and include: the concept of a military government ruling. These people are very, very militaristic. **The Phoenix: this is one of their highest military and spiritual symbols. If you see a German eagle, too, this is a huge sign. Certain companies will use a phoenix as their logo, especially red on black, or the reverse, this is a huge sign, since the Illuminati use many resuscitation rituals in their training, where the person is brought into a death, or near death state, then \"resuscitated\" and told that Baal, or some other entity, \"gave them life\" and they owe their new life to him and the group. Thus, the phoenix is a huge trigger and symbol.** Butterflies and rainbow signs are big triggers for people who have gone through the Monarch programming (yes, the Illuminists invented Monarch programming with the CIA). Certain types of jewelry are used as triggers. If a person goes online and plays certain role games (like Ultima) the games are FULL of trigger symbols, such as gem stones. I don't play them but my husband does, and I have told him what the symbols mean. He thinks it's funny since they don't bother him (he isn't Illuminati). A tiara, or crown with 13 gems, with a diamond in the center, is a symbol of the coming reign of the \"chosen one\". **Star of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:23:2eeb28cf7036", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14239, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "as triggers.

A tiara, or crown with 13 gems, with a diamond in the center, is a symbol of the coming reign of the \"chosen one\". **Star of David: believe it or not, one of the highest Illuminati religious symbols is a star of David with a circle around it. Called \"the great seal of Solomon\" it is used at the highest ceremonies to invoke the demonic.** Earth, water, and fire: these three are used in a lot of ceremonies. Check out how many Saturday a.m. cartoons use this concept. You'd be amazed. In fact, \"The Fifth Element\" movie was based on it. Greek and Roman mythology and symbols: **The Illuminati use a tremendous amount of Greek and Roman mythology in their programming, and most people will have internal structures with a roman or greek temple inside.** Lightening bolts, and any symbols from this time will also trigger those with this inside. For more, just pick up any recent Time magazine. Most of the ads are filled with Illuminati symbology. A picture of a head with a computer inside is another big one, symbolizes delta programming, for example. Q: Take the lead and tell me about issues you may not have covered in your articles or in this interview.... perhaps some issues I have missed in regards to the New World Order/global government and such... A: 1. **These people are pedophiliacs, they abuse and torture small children and teach them under duress to become perpetrators themselves from earliest infancy. This alone means they should be stopped.** ** They run the porn industry, along with other groups such as the Mafia. They make enormous amounts of money from drug smuggling, gun running, and human slavery (oh, yes, the buying and selling of human beings is alive and well in the 21st century).** They are involved in evil and money making in the extreme. If a profit is being made off of human suffering, you can trace the chain back somewhere to these people. 2. **They have money and lawyers that could blast anyone confronting them out of the water.** 3. **They have infiltrated our government, and the governments of every country in the world, and well as the judicial and legal systems.** 4. The media as well. 5. They run our financial institutions. 6. They are ruthless, ambitious, and will not stop at killing those they oppose.** They invented MK-Ultra with the help of the CIA.** Still want to take them on?

They are working towards bringing in a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:24:791d0b40bc96", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14240, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "3. **They have infiltrated our government, and the governments of every country in the world, and well as the judicial and legal systems.** 4.

Sorry, just letting you know what they are like. 7. They are working towards bringing in a new leader who will usher in a Luciferian reign of joy, prosperity, and rewards to the faithful. Almost an Elysian type paradise. Of course, the brutality would continue, and those who oppose his reign are to be hunted down and converted or destroyed, but the followers will be so happy and content that they believe these holdouts will want to come over to their side. Sounds unbelievable, but true. Also, people will have new jobs and leadership positions in this new order, since the Illuminati believe that their children are the brightest and best (remember that lifetime of training and teaching?) and will be the intellectual elite who will rule over the unintelligent, or \"less fit\". These people really, truly believe this, and almost worship Plato's ideal Republic as their blue print for the new order. Now, the other side of the picture. 1. **They are arrogant, and this could be their downfall.** **They view the common man as \"sheep\" with no intelligence. **They are full of pride, believe they are invulnerable (see above) and that any press about them is the equivalent of a gnat to be swatted. Arrogant people make mistakes, and they are becoming more blatant and open in recent years. 2. They believe they can overcome God, which is a huge mistake. God can stay the hand of history, and has so far, in the hope that more from this group will get out, because He is merciful. 3. **Most of them are wounded, abused victims, who don't realize that it is possible to leave the group. There is a lot of discontent in the ranks, and there would be a mass exodus if the members believed it were really possible to get out (and live). Many of the trainers I knew (I know, wicked, torturing pedophiles) were NOT happy with what they did. They would whisper quietly, or give a look, to show that they disagreed with what they had to do. They would resignedly do their jobs, in the hope of advancement.** **Know what one of the biggest carrots offered to those who advance up in the group is? That you don't have to hurt people anymore, and that you can't be abused (it's true: only those higher than you in the group can abuse you, so everyone wants to move up, where the pool of candidates becomes smaller).

Of course, people can choose to abuse anyone beneath them, and that motivates some (but not all!) to move up.** 4. As more survivors leave, therapists and churches and support people are becoming more aware of the sophisticated mind control techniques used to control members. They are learning to undo it. 5. **Prayer can overcome the greatest evil,** and my greatest hope is that those I once knew in this group, including the heads and those who hurt me at times, would get out. That they could know that, yes, it is truly possible to leave. Q: I have seen Clinton do this hand sign [pinky and pointer fingers only extended] on a few occasions, and now Prince William as well. Any hidden meaning? A: That is an old, well known greeting of one satanist to another. Usually, the Illuminists are a lot more subtle and don't do that publicly. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 8 - The Fourth Reich** Q: The way you describe the Illuminati it sounds like the Third Reich Revival. I can certainly see the Nazi traits in their behavior and goals. It seems like Germany is taking the lead, yet again, in uniting the EU, we see the setting up of a European Army, the Rapid Reaction Force, and a World Court. How is this ultimately going to play out? Svali: Actually, **they have a name for the New World Order. One of the synonyms used is the \"Fourth Reich\". I'm serious. Lots of Illuminists have Fourth Reich programming inside. Yep, Germany, and the EU, will dominate the world economy. The US economy will go down for awhile, then restored with the help of Europe.** Q: The Book of Revelations pretty much paints a gloomy picture of how this is going to end, and by what means. How is this going to effect the Illuminati agenda? They would certainly know about the prophecies of old and their own foretold demise. Are they attempting to use prophecies, somehow, to their advantage by way of deceiving human beings? Svali: Basically, they are in denial. They believe that history can be changed, and that John's prophetic revelation is only one interpretation of the future. They are aware of Revelations, but don't take it too seriously. Remember, some of those at the top are ALREADY in power, figuratively speaking.

Remember, some of those at the top are ALREADY in power, figuratively speaking. They dominate the financial picture, have immense wealth, several mansions around the world, anything they want, and the (to them) joy of controlling millions of others. They believe their intellect is sharp, and that they will be the \"good guys\" in the New Order. They are LUCIFERIAN'S, and so believe the Bible is misguided in its assertions. **For all intents and purposes, if you asked them, they would probably laugh and say, \"But the new order is already here. It just isn't open yet.\"** They have been in power for several hundred years, with no lightening bolts from heaven striking them dead. **They may even believe that they represent God's will on earth (remember, they serve \"God\", too, just not the same as the Biblical Christian one).** They would ask back, \"how did God allow people to develop such potential if He didn't want us to help them use it? Isn't it a criminal waste of the intellect and the gifts he gave us to NOT develop them, and help people mature into a better race?' They would argue along these lines. **They believe that basically, they are GOOD and doing a good work, even if the means are tough to endure at the time. They are weeding out the weak and unfit, and developing a supreme human being. I know it sounds like hog wash, but they truly, honestly believe this at a core level.** To be under the judgments in Revelations, they would have to see themselves as evil, and they don't. I hope this helps explain a little. I think they would see themselves in that picture as riding in on the white horses, not the dark ones. Such is the power of deception. I am a Christian, myself, and have given up these old beliefs that I was taught in the cult. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 9 - Ritual Sacrifices - Demons- Shape Shifting** Q: Svali, earlier on you talked about sacrifices. You are talking about animal sacrifices, right? Give me a bit more details about that, please. Svali: I hate to sensationalize things by going into gruesome particulars, but I will share a little.

First, please remember that the Illuminati have SIX branches of learning, and the spiritual (where the sacrifices are done) is only ONE part of what they do. I was in Sciences, and used to make fun of people who specialized in spiritual. Yes, everyone has to go to spiritual rituals during certain high days, but I tried to stay as far from it as I could. It's ugly, crude, and gross, but considered important. 1. **The Celtic branch of spiritual believes that power is passed at the moment between life and death. They will do rituals with children, or even older adherents, where the person is tied down, and an animal is bled to death on top of them. The belief is that the person receives power from the departing spirit, which \"enters\" the person. It is also highly traumatizing and horrible to have an animal go through its death throes on top of you. Throw in a few threats that \"this will happen to you if you ever tell,\" and a quite strong impression is made on small children.** 2. **Opening portals and dimensions: I know, this sounds like stuff from a sci-fi film, but these people really believe that there are other spiritual dimensions, and that to pass into them, first a major sacrifice is done to \"open a portal\", usually several animals. I have also seen animal sacrifices done to protect from the demonic, or blood used to \"close a circle\" so the demonic cannot penetrate it.** The Illuminists very much believe in the spiritual realm, and have codified practices over hundreds of years from ancient occultic rituals. They believe they can control these powers (I believe they are deluded). Sacrifices are also done on high holy days. **I have seen an animal \"psychically killed\" in front of me, and have no way to explain what I saw.

Especially with some of the newer medications used to create trance states, their meds covered the more obvious signs of trauma and stress (elevated heart rate, rapid breathing, tremors, pupil size changing), or blunted them. Inexperienced trainers would miss more subtle signs, and basically screw a person up. It is horrible to work with a person, and they NEVER COME BACK. They become a vegetable, or worse, they scream and scream for hours without end. We occasionally had to \"put down\" these training failures, by using a lethal injection of air, or insulin. The person was then set up in a \"fatal crash\" or \"fire\" to dispose of the body. May God forgive me for the few times this happened and I was forced to act. I so regret it now. A person cannot be kind or sympathetic. And, the trainer always knows that it could be them next on the table, screaming, so they do their jobs well. Any failures are heavily punished, to say the least. One of my jobs was teaching younger trainers the masking effects of hypnotic drug combinations, and how to recognize subtle clues of distress. Sigh. Do the failures count as \"sacrifices\" to a horrible evil that is perpetrated on others? I think so, even though there was no ritual about it at all. It was all done in a training room with lab coats and needles. Q: Svali, I have to ask you this: There are stories floating around on the internet about the Illuminati (and other agencies) being run by extra-terrestrials, ET's, in particular a reptilian race, operating from a higher dimension. Any thoughts on that? Svali: My answer will probably cause a lot of anger, and it's not meant to step on any toes. Here it goes. **I have never seen an alien or extra-terrestrial. I have seen some programming to make people THINK they saw aliens, as a cover story for programming, if they remembered. None of the head trainers I knew, or others on leadership council, believed in aliens, although I never asked them.** **I personally believe that the reptilian stuff is actually the demonic at work. I have seen shape-shifting and other stuff because of demonic influence** (okay, so here some will say, gee, she believes in demons, that's as far out as aliens). Well, this is what the Illuminati certainly believe in. They KNOW there are spiritual realities, and think they can control them.

Well, this is what the Illuminati certainly believe in. They KNOW there are spiritual realities, and think they can control them. Those of a more cynical bent would say the shape shifting was a drug induced hallucination and group hysteria in the context of a ritual setting. I will let each reader decide based on their personal comfort zone. But no, absolutely no reptiles or aliens seen in Washington, DC, or San Diego, Ca. as of 5 years ago, at least I never saw them. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 10 - More About Demonic Shape Shifting** Q: Tell me more about the shape-shifting part, please. I have heard about this elsewhere, and this not just occurring during rituals, some people claim to have seen politicians shape-shift, for instance. When you say 'demonic' are you talking about a specific 'demon' or type of demon? Is it possible that these demons are really nothing more than some type of ET's influencing the Illuminati, in turn deceiving them? Svali: Since you asked about shape shifting, I will share a little more, but it also relates directly to my own belief system. Can't help it, so I will warn you here that I will be discussing fundamental Christianity and the demonic. After being raised in a group that glorifies the demonic, I became a Christian years ago. **I honestly believe that without faith in Jesus Christ, I could NEVER have gotten out of the Illuminati, and one reason I don't fear for my life when I share what I remember is that I believe that God is able to protect me.** His love is the antithesis of the cruelty and evil that I saw in this group. His compassion and infinite caring and purity the opposite of the sexual abuse and darkness that surrounded the rituals. **I believe that God has forgiven my past. I have sincerely asked His forgiveness, or I could not live with the memories of what I did to others **(such as getting young girls addicted to drugs, so they would prostitute for the cult, as only one example). I have renounced that lifestyle, given it up, and only Christianity has shown me the love and forgiveness and healing that I have needed for a soul weary beyond belief after seeing the underbelly of life and the cruelty that human beings are capable of showing to others. In the occult world, I do believe that there are demons, that they are real, and that they have a spiritual hierarchy that the cult", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:30:c5c94ca8f99e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14246, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "for the cult, as only one example). I have renounced that lifestyle, given it up, and only Christianity has shown me the love and forgiveness and healing that I have needed for a soul weary beyond belief after seeing the underbelly of life and the cruelty that human beings are capable of showing to others. In the occult world, I do believe that there are demons, that they are real, and that they have a spiritual hierarchy that the cult hierarchy attempts to emulate on a physical plane. There are principalities, and lower demons, and they control the portals into other spiritual dimensions that humans have NO BUSINESS entering. This stuff is destructive in the extreme to people. The shape-shifting was usually in the context of an occult ceremony by those given completely over to the demonic. Humans took on the form of animals for a period of time or of hideous looking beings, and they were NOT aliens. This was demonic activity that caused a human to see the demonic revealed and distorted what they saw. I have seen people go temporarily \"blind\" because of the demonic influence. **I have seen animals psychically killed by others coming into a circle and directing their \"energy\" at the animal. These were not aliens. Some of them were people I grew up with and my own mother (she was strange, but not an alien).** I participated in this as well at times, and I'm no alien, just a wounded human being. I believe that the demonic does have sexual relations with humans, because it is recorded in the Bible (Genesis); God also forbids it as being completely wrong. In fact, the Biblical covenants are the antithesis of the dark covenants practiced by the Illuminati, and I have found a lot of healing by going to Scripture and seeing how God views our world, and how He deals with the Spiritual realm. He is going to win and is in the process of winning the battle. I will share with you a dream I had 2 years ago. I was standing in a large room, circular shaped, with tiers of rows. A large emblem of the world with a wreath above it was on the wall, and robed figures surrounded me. I was before the Supreme World Council (who will rule when the NWO comes in), and they were pointing at me and saying I was a traitor and would have to die. The sense of darkness and oppression in the room was intolerable. I was choking from it. One of the leaders came forward and said that I would die a traitor's death, as an example to them all, unless I came back into the fold of \"family\". I fought the dark impulse to give in to save my life, then in my mind, cried out \"Jesus, save me\".

I fought the dark impulse to give in to save my life, then in my mind, cried out \"Jesus, save me\". Instantly, the love and peace of God filled my heart. I was no longer afraid, and I told him, \"No, because you are defeated, you just don't realize it. You can kill my body, but I serve a God who has defeated you and everyone in this room.\" I woke up at this point, filled with joy. Now you know why I don't mind answering questions about my past. I believe in a God who is greater than the plans of evil men. They can plot all they want, but in the end, their plans will be defeated. So ask away, any time, and I will share with you all that I remember. I don't mind exposing them, although I do have a lot of cynicism, as I have noted, as to whether people will do anything about it. While I respect your desire to investigate and your openness to any possibilities, I can tell you that as a former lifetime member of the group, I saw demons acting, not reptiles or aliens. I would really wonder about aliens who were as vicious and against Biblical Christianity in particular as the demons I saw. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 11: Illuminati Proof - Vulnerabilities** Q: Svali, have you ever come forward publicly with that story, or is this the first time? Svali: I have never gone into the demonic aspects much, because it is so controversial (i.e. your question below!). I have shared this before with my husband, my therapist, and a close friend. I'm not really a \"public\" person, I've only posted some articles at Suite101.com, to help others who are trying to get out of the cult. I hate sensationalizing stuff, personally, because it can detract from the real problem; children are being hurt and abused, and the abuse needs to stop. Call it demons, aliens, or whatever, there are evil men (and women) using small children and profiting from their pain. That is why I have spoken out against this group. Q: I am certain that a lot of readers will say 'Come on, now I know this is just sci-fi, how can this be real?!' and would want to see some proof or evidence to that. What would you say to them?

Svali: I would say \"go to a ritual, you will see plenty\" except that I don't want ANYONE to ever see or be near that type of evil. Spiritual realities don't leave physical marks, but I think it is interesting that throughout recorded history, mankind has written about these type of phenomena. Could all of our recorded histories be false? Could mankind be a pathological liar throughout the centuries in this area? **If a person visits Africa, they will also hear accounts of shape shifting done by the occult, and there they DON'T dissociate, so you can interview people who have seen it while fully conscious.** **In South America and Asia, this also occurs. How could a world-wide phenomena be made up by groups that had no previous contact with each other?** Does the demonic leave a trail, a mark that I can point to? No. But does it leave an indelible impression on those that have witnessed it? Yes, and even in pre-medieval times, this type of stuff was recorded. I didn't take videos or snapshots of this stuff happening, so a person has to decide whether they believe it or not based on oral testimony. I don't really care. I know what I saw. Q: Also, to wrap this interview up for now, what do you see as the Illuminati's Achilles Heel, their vulnerability? Is there any way to stop them, and a way for humanity to move on and say 'It is finished!'? At the moment it seems hopeless, sort of like having your fingers in a Chinese finger trap - you know what I'm talking about - with no way out. Svali: 1. Their arrogance (I think I mentioned this before) is their weakness. These people think they are untouchable, and this could make them careless. 2. If by a miracle, enough people took this SERIOUSLY and started organizing in some way to stop the Illuminati take over, with prayer and God's guidance, perhaps they could be stopped. I hope so, with all of my heart. 3. Stopping pornography and child prostitution and drug smuggling and gun running would take out a huge chunk of their profits. Maybe they would slow down. But honestly, stopping the above would be as difficult as stopping the group. 4. To be honest, I don't know what could really stop them. I have written about this group to try and expose them. I have gone to the police several times, given videotaped testimony against them in a court case (the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:33:2ee90631d08e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14249, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "3.

I have gone to the police several times, given videotaped testimony against them in a court case (the interview was with five lawyers and took three hours), knowing that my ex head trainer would be seeing a copy of the video (I thought about smiling and waving and saying \"hi Jonathan\", but then decided that might be going a little too far). I have encouraged others in getting out and helped a few survivors find safe housing and a way to stay out. **I guess each person has to do their best in fighting these people, in the way they feel led to. My skills tend to be in writing, so I am using them.** Q: If you have any last comments or think there are some areas we have not touched or topics you would like to take us to, please feel free to share those. Svali: If anyone has heard the sobs of a child when it has been used brutally by adults, or the screams of a child psychologically terrorized, they would do anything they could to stop this abuse. **There are children as young as three and four being used in pornographic films, beaten black and blue if they refuse to comply. There are toddlers being forced to watch brutalities, then given a stick and told to go over and hit the victim themselves, or they will be beaten. The child hesitates, it doesn't want to, and the adults hit the child, until the child goes, tears streaming down its face, and unwillingly does what the adults tell it. This is cruelty beyond belief.** To see a slightly older child with an electric dog collar around its neck, shocked when it tries to \"escape\" and treated as an animal, to the laughter of the adults and older children around it, and the child goes over to a bush and vomits from fear and self-loathing. **These are the pictures that any survivor of the Illuminati holds in their heart, and these are the reasons I will write and write about them to expose them, and why my heartfelt prayer is that they can be stopped. I wish I were making this up, but I'm not. I wish I didn't have these pictures engraved in my memory, but I do.** Q: Svali, would you be willing to answer readers questions or feedback, in the form of some future article?

I think there may be some questions coming in for you at some point, probably to cover some details about your story. Svali: I would prefer that they send their questions to you, and then you forward them, if possible. I don't want to get a lot of \"hate mail\" because I am writing about a topic that is controversial and politically incorrect to talk about. I'm sure there will be those who say, \"oh, she just wants attention\". Well, I get plenty of attention at the classes I teach, with a room full of students, and lots more fun besides. I get attention seeing my NON-abuse articles in print, and make money besides (which I don't when I write about this). No, I want to expose these people, that's my motivation. Some will believe what I am writing, others won't. That's fine with me. If they feel the need to vent their disbelief, that's fine, as long as I don't get lots of cuss words, or people saying I'm stupid (oh, yes, I get letters like that at times) or uneducated. Sorry, none of the above are true. I have two university degrees. I had to. I was told to by the cult. They don't let stupid people lead. Oh, and HJ, I won't just disappear on you or recant anything I wrote. You can email me anytime with questions, and I will delightedly expose what SOB's this group is composed of. Oops, that doesn't sound Christian there, but God appreciates honesty, doesn't He? I'm only accurately describing them. I'm still working on forgiveness, as you can see... Q: Svali, I'm grateful you took the time to share those experiences with us, which I'm sure was neither easy nor pleasant. I wish you all the best, for you and your family. Perhaps more people will read this and pass this article on to others. Maybe we can stop all of this shocking brutality, child abuse, the Illuminati someday. It's never too late. Thank your very much for this interview, Svali. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 12 - The Top of the Pyramid** Q: Svali, a very important question I'm sure all our readers are asking themselves is, who heads the Illuminati?

Who is the top of the pyramid? Svali: Hooboy! Where do I start with this? First, it depends on what level. I would like to draw up a little map of the Illuminati from my memories (which are NOT FOND) of being part of this group. I will also try to fill in some names, but I want to be cautious. If I name too many names, I could draw some nasty fire from people in the group. Here it goes: I will be doing an upside down pyramid, to show the Illuminati structure, NOT to trigger people (I know the Illuminati use lots of pyramids) but because this is how they have their hierarchy set up: Level One: Local level: (anytown, USA) sister group, sister group, sister group, sister group, sister group **There will be between ten and thirty sister groups in most metropolitan areas, dependent on the size of the city. The larger the city, the more sister groups. There are Illuminati groups in EVERY major city in the US and Europe. This first level is what is known as the \"anarchical\" or \"low level\". It is what most people reporting ritual abuse discuss: a high priest and priestess preside over each group, which also contains a group of two to four trainers, and others with jobs. The sister groups unite on rare occasions, are aware of each other, but each one is fairly independent, and reports only to their leadership council.** Level Two: Metropolitan leadership council: This is what the local leadership council over these groups will look like. It will also cover scattered groups in outlying rural areas. Baalim (head) (1), assistants to the head (2) administrators over finances and day to day happenings (4), head trainers (oversee and teach other trainers) (6). The total: 13 members The Baalim and his two assistants report to: REGIONAL LEADERSHIP COUNCIL. The United States has been divided into seven different regions geographically. Each region has a 13 member leadership council that coordinates with the local leadership councils (are you getting the idea by now? The Illuminati are set up a lot like \"Amway\" or any other well-organized business enterprise with a flowchart of accountability for each member). This council will look something like this: Head of council (1), Military (2 seats), Spiritual (2 seats), Scholarship (2 seats), Finances (2 seats), Training (2 seats), Sciences (2 seats). Total: 13 members. The regional councils will represent the different areas of interest and knowledge that the Illuminati pursue.

The membership will change over time as members are promoted or demoted. The seven regional councils each have a leader as noted above, who reports to the National Council (The nations in Europe also have national councils, Mexico and Canada do as well, as does the Soviet Republic and China). **The national council will look much like the one above, with this difference; these are influential bankers with OLD money such as: The Rockefellers, the Mellon family, the Carnegie family, the Rothschild family etc. I know I shouldn't name names, but I will.** **The heads of the National councils report to: The Supreme World Council.** **This council is already set up as a prototype of the one that will rule when the NWO comes into being. It meets on a regular basis to discuss finances, direction, policy, etc. and to problem-solve difficulties that come up. Once again, these leaders are heads in the financial world, OLD banking money. The Rothschild family in England and in France have ruling seats. A descendant of the Hapsburg dynasty has a generational seat. A descendant of the ruling families of England and France have a generational seat. The Rockefeller family in the US holds a seat.** This is one reason that the Illuminati have been pretty \"untouchable\" over the years. The ruling members are very, very, very wealthy and powerful. I hope this information is helpful. How do I know this? I was on a local leadership council (a head trainer), but I talked to those on regional. Also, every Illuminati child is taught who their \"leaders\" are, and told to take an oath of allegiance to them and the \"New Order to come\". Q: To what degree is the European royalty involved? What is their real pecking order and power structure, and what is their U.S.-U.K. relationship in terms of financial/political/cult power? Is the Monarchy still running the show? Svali: This is hard to answer, but I'll try. **The Illuminati leadership state that they are descended from royal bloodlines, as well as unbroken occult heritage.** **There were two definitions of \"royalty\" used. Open royalty that is currently seen now, and \"hidden royalty\" of royal lineage and extreme occult power. Sometimes the two were concurrent, such as with the Prince of Wales.** I never thought of which country/line held the most power, since I was just a peon busily doing my job.

But my understanding was: The Hanoverian/Hapsburg descendants rule in Germany over the Bruderheist. They are considered one of the strongest lines for occult as well. The British line is just under them, with the royal family. Definitely, they rule the UK branch under the Rothschild's in the occult realm, even though parliament rules the country openly. In France, again, descendants of the royal families are also in power in the occult realm, but the French Rothschild's hold the reigns over all or them. **The U.S. is considered lower, and younger, than the European branches. **This is why the children of leaders are ALWAYS sent to Europe for part of their training; the education is considered better and the U.S. families want to renew their affiliation with the European forebears. **Germany, France, and the UK form a triumvirate that rules in the European cult. The USSR is considered important, and has the strongest military groups. The USSR has been promised fourth position in the New World Order, BEFORE the role the U.S. would have, because the USSR has been more helpful and cooperative over the years with furthering the agenda.** The descendants of the former ruling families there are also involved in the occult leadership, along with the newer ones. There is no Marxism in the cult. China will be ranked after the USSR, then the U.S.. But a lot of the current U.S. leadership will be in Europe when the change occurs, and many have homes there. They will be \"changing nationalities\" overnight, as it were. This is the little that I do remember. Wish I had been a better student of this stuff, but I was too busy trying to stay alive when I was in it. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 13 - The UN or 'Supreme World Council'** Q: Svali, what role does and will the UN play in the future and how do you see this unfolding? What is their timeline? Svali: The UN was created early in this century in order to help overcome one of the biggest barriers to a one world government necessary, if there is to be a military rule and dictatorship by the Illuminists. That barrier is the one of nationalism, or pride in one's country. This is why it was NOT a popular concept when first introduced. It took years of country bashing in the media and the destruction of any sense of national pride by a (not so subtle) media campaign over the years.

It took years of country bashing in the media and the destruction of any sense of national pride by a (not so subtle) media campaign over the years. It's agenda? It is set up as a shadow, or forerunner, of the Supreme World Council that will represent every nation. **Every ambassador to the UN has either done something to curry Illuminati favor and been rewarded, or is a political figurehead chosen to make the organization \"look good\".** The Illuminati and governmental leaders chose to create the UN early in the past century and worked hard against opposition to put it in place (FDR was their man in America who helped the American public accept it). Both he and Eleanor were staunch Illuminists. So is Shirley Temple Black. **In fact, most of our presidents since the beginning of the past century have been either Illuminists, or agreed by oath to support their goals, in return for campaign funds and support.** I believe it is impossible to win a presidential election in our country today without their backing. The Kennedy family were punished because they tried to disobey them. They were free thinkers, and too hard to \"control\". The UN has a stated goal of world peace and wants to incorporate under its fold military and peace-keeping functions. But in reality, giving this role to the UN weakens the individual military strength of nations and encourages them to lean more and more on an external organization, making them less able to resist when the takeover occurs. **I was told that by the year 2020, that the New Order would be openly revealed, BUT that may have been cult propaganda, and they are always changing dates.** I personally believe that by the mid of this century, they will reveal themselves. This is just my opinion, though. Q: What are the plans of the Illuminati for the Middle East, and how will it affect the rest of the world? Will we see WWIII? Svali: **The conflict in the middle east is only to the advantage of the Illuminists. They HATE Israel, and hope one day to see it destroyed, and are biding their time. One of the olive branches offered by the UN when it takes over is that they will prevent war in the middle east, and this will be greeted with joy by many.** **At the same time, the Illuminati covertly supply guns and funds to BOTH sides to keep the conflict fueled.

They used to funnel guns through the USSR to Palestine, for example, in the name of promoting \"friendliness\" between the USSR and this state and other Arab nations. Then, the US Illuminists would help funnel guns to Israel, for the same reason.** **These people love the game of chess and see warfare between nations as creating an order out of chaos.** The USSR is going to get stronger again. It has too strong a military both openly and covertly (ALL Illuminati military trainers have visited Russia to learn from them) to sit quietly and quiescently to the side. In the NWO, they will be stronger than us. Want to hear the end of the world scenario the Illuminati taught me? It was cult propaganda, but this is how they believed the New Order would be ushered in: There will be continued conflict in the Mid-East, with a severe threat of nuclear war being the culmination of these hostilities. **An economic collapse will devastate the economy of the US and Europe, much like the great depression.** One reason that our economy continues limping along is the artificial supports that the Federal Reserve had given it, manipulating interest rates, etc. But one day, this won't work (or this leverage will be withdrawn on purpose) and the next great depression will hit. The government will call in its bonds and loans, and credit card debts will be called in. There will be massive bankruptcies nationwide. Europe will stabilize first, and Germany, France and England (surprise) will have the strongest economies, and will institute through the UN an international currency. Japan will also pull out, although their economy will be weakened. Peacekeeping forces will be sent out by the UN and local bases to prevent riots. The leaders will reveal themselves, and people will be asked to make a pledge of loyalty during a time of chaos and financial devastation. Doesn't sound pleasant, does it? I don't know the exact time frame for all of this, and wouldn't want to even guess. **The good news is that if a person is debt-free, owes nothing to the government or credit debt and can live self sufficiently, they may do better than other.** I would invest in gold, not stocks, if I had the income.

Q: Overall, would you say the Illuminati are racist? I am asking this because their agenda seems to be very white supremist throughout history. Svali: **The Illuminati are racist and have a very \"Aryan\" outlook. They believe strongly in the rule of the \"pure\" and \"intelligent\" by their definitions.** There will occasionally be minorities killed in ceremonies. **They are trying to breed a \"genetically superior\" race to rule, with their children and descendants. They are also followers of Plato's Republic, and believe that they will be the ones to usher in this \"Utopian\" rule with the NWO in their opinion. In their Utopia, the intelligentsia will rule, and the sheep like masses will follow their leaders (that is their view of the world; that the occult leaders are \"enlightened' and intelligent, while the average person is a \"sheep\" to be led by the nose).** Q: Why would they allow a black leader to head the UN? Svali: Because it is a temporarily politically expedient thing for them to do. They are liars and will hold out a hand to a popular political figure, throwing them a figurehead role in one of their organizations to make the UN look better, and as a group that promotes \"interracial harmony\" and \"unity\" and \"peace\". The real leaders would never publicly allow their real feelings to show. **The UN is a preparation, but it is not the real power in the world. It will be relatively unimportant when the NWO comes into being. The real councils will then step forward. But as a means of getting the general public to accept the idea of a \"global community\" and the \"one world community\", the UN is a stepping stone in their working towards the NWO.** Q: Do they have a population control agenda?

Svali: **I have heard reports that certain deadly viruses have been engineered by the Illuminati, but I doubt that HIV was. Why? Because so many of the leadership of the Illuminati are blatantly pedophilic and homosexual, the virus is rampant in parts of the US, and they would be endangering themselves as well. Most of the leadership that I knew were homosexuals in their night personas (myself included), and it was accepted as a lifestyle in that setting, and encouraged.** Also, the viruses that they are developing are ones that they are also engineering antidotes to, to protect leadership from the virus if an epidemic breaks out. I do know that there is some working on biological weapons by members of this group as a method of threatening population bases that don't embrace the \"New Order\" when revealed. This was discussed occasionally in leadership meetings. What state it is at at this time, I couldn't say, since it has been several years since I was active in the group. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 14 - Illuminati History and Future** Q: I've received some Neo-Nazi-white power-invitations through e-mail. I've read some of the stuff and (to put it short) they argue with considerable elegance - backed up with historical \"facts\"- that the Illuminati, of course, is a Jewish Conspiracy, and that Hitler was \"on to them\", and we all know what happened next. My simple question: Is the Illuminati a JEWISH conspiracy? Svali: My answer: absolutely not. In fact, **Hitler and his people (especially Himmler and Goebbels) were top Illuminists. The Illuminati are racist in the extreme, and as a child, I was forced to play \"concentration camp\" both on my farm in Virginia, and also in Europe in isolated camps in Germany.** The Jews historically fought against the occult (see Deuteronomy and the Old Testament for how God through the Jewish people tried to cleanse the land of the occult groups that were operating there, such as those who worshipped Baal, Ashtarte, and other Canaanite and Babylonian gods. **Since the Illuminati trace their roots to these ancient fertility deities, they also have an in-ground antithesis to the Jewish race.** Also, I would never trust literature sent to me by Neo-Nazi or any extremist hate groups, since they are founded on the tenets of racism, egalitarianism, the concept of a master race, and other things that are also espoused strongly by the Illuminati and many other occult groups.

Simply put, this group was lying to you, and counting on your not knowing that **Nazism was founded by German Illuminists.** Q: The dream of someone wanting to rule the world is nothing new, obviously. History is littered with failed attempts to conquer the world and subjugate the population. How old is the dream for the 'NEW WORLD ORDER' per se, by the Illuminati? Svali: **The Illuminati themselves teach that they have been around for centuries and centuries, even during Roman times, and that Alexander the Great was one of their \"prototypes\" in the ancient world, as was Hitler in modern times. But the Illuminati as we know it today was formed in the 17th century (out of Catholic roots, i.e. the Knights Templar and Roscicrucianism). The idea of a modern 'One World Order' became popular in the 1700's with the ideas of Weishaupt and others, and they have been working towards this goal since the mid 18th century.** Q: Did the Illuminati manipulate societies throughout history, such a the Egyptian, Roman, British empire, etc.? How far back does the history of the Illuminati stretch, and were they always known as the Illuminati, or did they at times operate under different covers with the same goals? Svali: **The Illuminati SAY they date back to ancient Babylon on the Fields of Shinar around 3,900 B.C., give or take. But this is probably cult programming and boasting. They state that they are founded on the occult base of all ancient mystery religions and occult practices. But they actually seem to be descended from the Knights Templar during the medieval ages, and the Rosicrucians who were also founded back then. I myself have trouble knowing how much of the \"cult history\" I was taught as a child by my scholarship teachers was merely programming, and how much is accurate truth, so I cannot really be an objective source of information. Like any group, they tend to want to \"idealize\" their roots.** Q: Being as intelligent as they are, the Illuminati must know that empires and societies throughout history only lasted about 200 years on average. Is this a natural life cycle, or was that duration and final downfall of empires coordinated? In other words, was the Illuminati responsible for failed empires? Did they purposely destroy societies and create new ones with the intention of securing a tighter grip on future governments?

Did they purposely destroy societies and create new ones with the intention of securing a tighter grip on future governments? Svali: During historical ''set ups'' that I saw as a child that were used to teach the history of the group, supposedly behind the throne of all ancient and modern monarchies were Illuminist advisors and financing. **They CLAIM to have manipulated history for the past 2,000 years. But I also believe that people have free choice, and that no one person or group can truly take into account the unpredictable: human nature and how they will respond.** **I don't really believe they did all that they have claimed to. At the same time, in the last 200 years, they have certainly had a profound influence at the international and governmental level, based on what I saw and heard when in the group.** Q: You said Illuminists are working hard for those goals and looking forward to the final implementation of the 'glorious New Order' or world government, so that they can take part and be leaders in that society. At what point will the Illuminati be satisfied with their achievements, and what is their vision of that 'glorious New Order'? What shape, form or system will it have, what political infrastructure? Dictatorial, communist, democratic? Will there be an end to their struggle for global control? Svali: **I was taught that during the coming \"Order\" or government, it would at first be a heavily dictatorial and military government. This is why there is extensive training of covert military forces in all ranks to implement this policy. Why? Because not everyone will welcome their ''enlightened'' rule, and there will be those who oppose them.** **Their army is being trained in crowd control techniques and camps will be set up to send dissenters to.** Think of Hitler's Germany, which was a prototype. The government will be highly authoritative and centralized in the Supreme World Council, with the national councils and regional councils under its control. The implementation of a semi-Marxist, or military socialism, will then follow (Marx was an Illuminist and was told what to write in his treatises), coordinated under the umbrella of the regional and national councils. Financial power will be held at the national and international levels. People will be asked to work at reduced wages for the glory of serving the New Order, although compensation will be based on loyalty and performance as time goes on (much as in Marxist and Leninistic Russia). **Once the dissenters are subjugated and controlled, they believe that there will no longer be a need to try for world control.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:44:e27eb9b9fd9d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14260, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 45, "text": "coordinated under the umbrella of the regional and national councils.

They will have it. They will then begin breeding programs to ensure that only the best and brightest reproduce; sterilization of those considered poor genetic specimens will begin.** They are firm believers in ''selective breeding'', just as Hitler and his scientists were. It is sad, but true, that this is what they teach. Children will be tested for their psychic ability and will go through special teaching to increase their abilities, much as they do now covertly, only it will be open. Q: Does the Illuminati have natural enemies or predators or competitors with the same goals of global control? Svali: Not that I know of. They are very aware of the Knights Templar, and OTO [Ordo Templi Orientis, a Catholic secret society that is a sister group to the Templar Knights and is involved in lots of occult and illegal activities as well]. And while the two groups are split in some areas, they are very sympathetic and share resources with each other. **The only true enemy that they see is the Christian church, which opposes all that they do. Because the Illuminati are based in occult spirituality, they despise any group that espouses Judaism or fundamental Christianity as being their mortal enemies. **This is because Christians engage in spiritual warfare that hurts their cause. Q: What's your view on the role of China and Russia in light of the latest developments, the Russia-Sino political alignment against the U.S., given the insight you had when you were still part of the Illuminati? Svali: Russia will be the military base and powerhouse of the group, since their military commanders (Illuminist) are considered the best in the world, and very, very disciplined. China, because of its roots in oriental occultism, and its large population, will also be considered a higher power than the US. But again, the real power will reside in Europe, according to what I was taught when part of the group. China will administer the Eastern region and Russia the North. Again, I am sharing what I was taught, but please be aware that it may have been ''programming''.

I sat the leadership council on the San Diego metropolitan area for several years, but had little to do with the international arena.** **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 15 - TV - The Perfect Mind-control Device** Q: What role does television play? From your point of view as an ex-Illuminati trainer/programmer, how much of a mind-control device 'really' is it? How does it interact with the brain? What sounds and images are used for programming? What makes TV the perfect mind-control device for the masses? Give us some details please. Svali: **It is important to realize that when a person watches TV, they go into an alpha brain wave state, in which they are more suggestible than normal. In fact, a LOT of Illuminati programming is done in alpha state, since the person is relaxed and highly suggestible. Have you ever noticed the glazed expression on the face of a person who has been watching TV for any length of time? This is from being in prolonged alpha state, and a semi dissociative state** (and this is for people who HAVE NOT been raised with mind control). Also, remember those studies that stated that \"TV violence doesn't affect children's behavior\" years ago? Guess who funded them? They are a bunch of bull-crud. What a person watches DOES influence them, and this is well known by the behaviorists in the group. In fact, they know that TV is a tool that they purposely use to influence \"the masses\". **It cannot create a total personality change in the average citizen, but it can desensitize us increasingly to violence, pornography and the occult, and influence the perceptions of young children.** Most cartoons have a subtle message as well as subliminal ones meant to influence the next generation of children, destroy family values and old fashioned \"morality\" as being \"Christian Right\" or \"prejudiced\" or \"politically incorrect'. TV today has a profound influence on our society, and especially young children. How many parents have delegated it as their children's babysitter, yet have no idea what their children watch?

I would never let an impressionable child watch the Matrix, Fight Club, or the new Exorcist, for example, or the \"slasher movies\" that are so popular among some teens. Sounds and images include: flashing images and constant changes (such as with MTV videos, for example, or many of the new ads); certain tones are played on some shows, or even the theme of the show, if it glorifies the occult, such as many of the popular shows depicting a cute young teen witch as the heroine, or vampires and demonic shape shifting. Q: What are some of the major Illuminati inspired shows running on TV, or the ones carrying an Illuminati message, and what clues identify them as such? Svali: The media is so infiltrated, a better question is which ones DON'T promote their agenda? See the above, also: Saturday morning cartoons that show animals/people morphing (a well known occult phenomena), or that glorify the concepts of \"Earth, Water, Fire\" (the Magickal Elements); or those that blatantly show mind control techniques (even video games, such as Tomb Raider, or \"Metal Gear Solid\" show training chairs and people being tortured, which surprised and saddened me. The hero has to \"rescue\" the person before they are tortured to death. I would guess that 90% of current cartoons have mystical/occult themes that are geared to catch children and subtly indoctrinate them to accept: animal guides or spirit guides, the idea of training (even cute little Pokemons turn from docile creatures into snarling demonic fighters after their \"trainer\" helps them change, which is too close for comfort for me to what the Illuminists do to docile children). I personally don't watch much TV for this very reason. I might watch a National Geographic special once in awhile or rarely a movie on the Comedy channel, but otherwise, I avoid it. **I heard too many discussions during leadership meetings and with other behaviorists in the group about how it was being used to subtly influence the masses without their even suspecting it. I choose to step away from this influence. Look at what TV depicted in the 1940s and 1950s, and what is accepted now as okay, to chronicle the slow moral decline of our society.** Q: How about the influence of pop music?

Does it pose a danger? Is it used as a mind-control medium? I believe Cathy O'Brien, a CIA mind-control slave and survivor, implicated the country music scene and a number of singers as being mind-control slaves, and names Nashville, Ten. as the center. Svali: Country music may have some, but the rock music industry is much more heavily controlled. I once watched some MTV and could NOT believe what was on it. My mouth fell open from shock. There is a song/video that is very popular right now by CrazyTown, that shows butterfly tattoos all over the people (a sign of Monarch mind control) while he sings \"Come my butterfly\". Later he sings about her escaping to a better world, etc. **This song is FILLED with programming images. I believe that Brittany Spears, Eminem, and others are being used by them to sing lyrics they like (ever notice that he wears a Neo-Nazi look and sings hate lyrics? This is NOT by chance). In fact, many of the top pop singers come from an internship with the \"Mickey Mouse club\" (yep, good old Walt the Illuminist's Empire) and I believe they are offered stardom in exchange for allegiance or mind control.** How many lyrics advocate suicide, violence, despair, or New Age spirituality in pop/rock today? Or just get a copy of the words and read (but be aware that many are possibly triggering to survivors of mind control). Q: Is there any way to undo the mind-control damage already done by and through television and music? Svali: Turn it off. Easier said than done. Once the input stops, it isn't constantly reinforced. How many people are almost addicted to their TV time? I also believe that one of the best methods of undoing damage is by replacing negative or false messages with the truth. I go to God's word in daily Bible Study to \"renew my mind\", as Romans states, and I find this much more healing and uplifting than anything on TV or the pop radio stations.

I believe the show has strongly demonic undertones (why do the eyes of the characters turn \"red\" when they morph into their fighting mode, which seems very much like a person in fighting mode who has gone through mind control with demonic overlays?). I can't stand the show myself, in spite of Picachu's popularity, and am saddened that it had the effect that it did on children.

Have you ever watched a young child who is watching cartoons like this? Their eyes glaze, their jaw goes slack, and they stop EVERYTHING and even breathe more slowly. Once again, I am not a fan of TV per se for this very reason, and especially for young children. The increased violence in our society can be directly related to the increased exposure to it that the very young have. **How many children have learned to laugh at gore and meaningless violence as being \"funny\"? There is even a popular comedy show on MTV that shows young men abusing their parent and videotaping it for \"laughs\". I have problems with mindless cruelty to others being funny.** Q: Here is [an article](http://web.archive.org/web/20010718103111/http://english.pravda.ru/main/2001/04/20/3778.html) that you may find of interest: 2001-04-20 25TH SHOT FOUND IN POKEMON CARTOONS \"Psychologists in the Russia's southern city of Krasnodar have called on the Russian government to ban televising of the Pokemon Japanese cartoon.

The list goes on. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 16 - Lone Gunmen** [Editor's note] Warning: this part contains some graphic descriptions of assassin training and brutal torture perpetrated on children by the Illuminati. Svali has asked me to edit the following account, but I have decided to leave her description of details intact. Q: Svali, when you hear news stories about the so-called 'lone gunman', or perfect patsy, such as Timothy McVeigh, Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan, John Hinkley (Reagan's assassin), Eric Harris & Dylan Klebold (Columbine High School) - and I'm sure you could give us even more examples - what is your feeling on this? Many of these killers have links to the military, either directly or through their family, and are rumored to be mind-control slaves. McVeigh supposedly even had a chip implant. What's your take on this, is it possible that those men were mind-control slaves, and can you give us an idea of how easy (or difficult) it is to create the perfect MC slave, and how they are trained and controlled? What are signs or clues that would give away whether these criminals may have been mind-controlled? Svali: **I believe strongly that many of these people had MK ULTRA or military training/assassin training that went \"bad\". In fact, I KNOW a few of those guys were, and if you read up on the cases, there is almost always a mention of Nazi or occult paraphernalia in the home (unless they have covered it up); web sites with occult and Nazi symbolism (such as in the Colorado shootings a couple of years ago at the high school) or other signs pointing to some amount of involvement in a cult or the occult.** Why do I think they have this training? First, because no one just picks up a gun one day and learns how to shoot (and hit their target). Where did these people learn to aim and shoot? Where did they do their target practice, and develop their deadly accuracy in many cases?

First, because no one just picks up a gun one day and learns how to shoot (and hit their target). Where did these people learn to aim and shoot? Where did they do their target practice, and develop their deadly accuracy in many cases? When I was a trainer in the Illuminati, there was one command that every trainer learned first when working with their subjects. And assassin training was then mandatory for ALL children. I went through it and do not know of any children in the Illuminati who have not. The command? The \"halt\" command. This is the FIRST command put in, it freezes the child or teen or adult in place, and is ground in. Why do trainers learn this code first for the person they work with? Because of the real risk that the person may try to kill them, and the halt code bypasses this. This is a person who has been horrendously abused in atrocious ways from infancy on. This is a person taught since age five to shoot, first with air guns and BB shot, later real guns, and to practice using VR equipment. **This is a person taught in early childhood to kill coldly and emotionlessly on command. This is a person who is told to shoot their brother or sister during a VR exercise, and they believe it is real under hypnotic trance, to test their \"obedience\".** (They actually did this horrible thing to my son, and he cried as he told how anxious he was the next day, and almost died of shock to see his sister alive and well. That was the ONLY way he knew it had been a VR exercise and NOT real). **This is a person with endless rage towards their tormentors and abusers after a lifetime of torture, abuse and rape, who is told to \"use their anger\" to make them a better marksmen. This is a person told that eliminating the ''enemy'' and the weak will bring them glory and help \"family\".** Now, if that child or teen or adult is alone and tormented in the daytime, a great anger will build up. This person becomes difficult to control. **At night, I knew trainers (who were sloppy or pushed too hard) who were killed by the person they were working on.** It was considered one of the \"risks of the job\". I was always cautious. All trainers knew that at night a person might get out of control, it always happened some. The person was highly punished for it, locked up for days, tortured, to teach them that it wasn't okay. If the person became very unstable, they might be considered \"expendable\" and eliminated. Or sent to a state hospital, where no one would believe their \"paranoid fantasies\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:51:26a87a54a3f9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14267, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 52, "text": "were working on.** It was considered one of the \"risks of the job\".

Or sent to a state hospital, where no one would believe their \"paranoid fantasies\" of being taught to assassinate others. If the brutal and controlling trainers had trouble controlling people and at times were killed by them, then why wouldn't they occasionally lose control in the daytime? It happens, and is quietly covered up (guess how quickly the FBI yanks away incriminating web sites or occult paraphernalia or anything linking the person to an organized occult group?). **People do not suddenly become killers. It is a learned process to overcome the natural horror of killing other human beings, a process begun in earliest childhood by the Illuminati. You have to FORCE a child to kill.** **Here is how it is done (how it was done to me): [1] When the child is 2 years old, place them in a metal cage with electrodes attached. Shock the child severely. [2] Take the child out, and place a kitten in its hands. Tell the child to wring the kitten's neck. The child will cry and refuse. [3] Put the child into the cage, and shock them until they are dazed and cannot scream any more. [4] Take the child out, and tell them again to wring the kitten's neck. This time the child will shake all over, cry, but do it, afraid of the torture. The child will then go into the corner and vomit afterwards, while the adult praises them for \"doing such a good job\".** **This is the first step. The animals get bigger over time, as the child gets older. They will be forced to kill an infant at some point, either a set up or VR, or in reality. They will be taught by age nine to put together a gun, to aim, and fire on target and on command. They will then practice on realistic manikins. They will then practice on animals. They will then practice on \"expendables\" or in VR. They will be highly praised if they do well, and tortured if they don't comply.** **The older the child or teen, the more advanced the training. By age 15, most children will also be forced to do hand to hand combat in front of spectators (high people who come to watch the \"games\" much as the ancient gladiators performed). These matches are rarely done to the death, usually until one child goes down. They use every type of weapon imaginable, and learn to fight for their lives. ** **If a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:52:142ae2208334", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14268, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "tortured if they don't comply.** **The older the child or teen, the more advanced the training.

If they win, they are again praised for being \"strong' and adept with weapons. By the time they are 21, they are well trained combat/killing machines with command codes to kill, and they have been tested over and over to prove that they WILL obey on command. This is how children in the German Illuminati are brought up, I went through it myself.** Q: Svali, you said earlier that a 'halt' program is one of the first programs installed in children. What exactly does it consist of? Is it just a code word, or a more complicated process? Svali: Normally, the halt program is a code that freezes the child or adult in their tracks. It is a combination of numbers, such as \"354\" (not a real one, just similar as an example), or a German word and number combination. All children will try to hurt their trainers back, it ALWAYS happens, at a very young age. The part of them that tried to do the hurting (usually a protector) will be severely punished, with imprisonment and isolation, or being beaten, or shocked, or a combination to teach them not to do this. The halt command will then be put in under hypnosis, while drugged, after extreme trauma. The alter with the command is told to come out INSTANTEOUSLY on hearing it, and to freeze the body with no movement; the person is told that if they fail to do this, many more torture sessions will follow as punishment. It is reinforced frequently over time. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 17 - In The Matrix ** Q: Svali, can you tell me what sort of incredible powers and abilities the brain is capable of, what you have seen and heard while you were still part of the Illuminati? I'm sure a photographic memory is only part of it. Svali: Research shows that we use only a part of the brain's ability, and the Illuminati and other occult groups are well aware of this.

A person under hypnosis will have almost complete recall of events and details around them. The brain never loses anything, it is just that in daily life, we filter out information to allow normal function, otherwise our senses would be bombarded, and we would be constantly distracted.** Hypnotic induction can override this filter when the suggestion is implanted. The person then \"downloads\" information and details to the trainer. Other abilities that can be developed include: ** Learning foreign languages: Children are taught three, four, or five and more languages based on aptitude** ** Physical strength: the child can do more physically than a child his/her age normally could** ** Psychic ability: this is considered a valued asset, and is worked on** **Children learn to pick up objects, using telekinetic powers, and to use their mind to \"read people\" (have information about the person that they could not possibly know), travel through time, and/or through spiritual dimensions, and even to be able to \"psychically kill\" an animal (or human) without touching them. Out of body travel, where the child can visit a room, describe what is there, and details of conversations, is also done.** **The child will be taught to have above normal intelligence, usually in the range of 120 (minimum) to above 200. IQs of 160 and above are NOT uncommon in this group. The specific abilities developed will depend upon the child (or adult's) role, or planned role in the group. ** Q: Svali, currently there is a popular TV series airing called The Pretender. Now after you told me so much about the Illuminati this show is starting to make a lot more sense to me. Perhaps this show is even based on MK Ultra or Illuminati history. Svali: I have never watched this show because the first two minutes (the prequel) triggered me so badly several years ago that I had to get up and leave the room. I later told my husband, \"I can't believe they are showing this openly on TV.'' Yes, it is directly based on mind control programming, etc. and is a direct, blatant show. But in our society, based on denial, this is considered \"fiction\", except to those who have undergone this type of training. Q: Could any of this mind control technology be used for positive purposes, enhancing mental powers, without actually losing control over one's own mind?

Q: Could any of this mind control technology be used for positive purposes, enhancing mental powers, without actually losing control over one's own mind? A few year ago there was a fad about so-called mind machines, with flashing lights and sounds, which included VR glasses and headphones. What do you know about those mind machines? Do they work? Svali: I don't know of any mind control technology that I believe is good, sorry. Why? Even if it doesn't involve trauma (and most DOES), if equipment like this were in the wrong hands, it would always be used to subjugate and control others. Unfortunately, that is the \"control\" part of mind control: someone else is in charge, using the other person. Most of the machines and VR stuff don't really work, because in order for MC to work, the person has to be young to develop those abilities and also traumatized. This is a sad fact. **Also, many if not most of the abilities developed are harmful and destructive. The spiritual travel and time travel always exact a price, and slowly will kill or destroy the person if engaged in too often. I have seen 'Spiritual' in the Illuminati who did this, and they had completely white hair by the age of 22! Most 'Spiritual' gray early, because the physical and psychological destruction are so great. Even the Illuminists are aware of this, and prevent too much work in one area for this reason.** The demonic behind it has caused some people (like [Aleister Crowley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley), for example) to eventually end life insane. I can't recommend it for anyone, it would be like playing with fire, or a dangerous weapon. This is one reason I refuse to have anything to do with this type of stuff. I renounced and closed all spiritual doors in my life years ago and can no longer \"read\" people, or do psychic travel, or speak 5 languages. I am so happy to NOT have these abilities now, since my life belongs to Jesus, and that is ten times better. He is enhancing my life in much better ways. Q: Can you tell us a bit more about the psychic part, such as telepathy, telekinesis, time travel, etc. What is each of those abilities used for by the Illuminati? Svali: First, **it's important to realize that when a person does time travel, they are often in an altered state of consciousness. They leave their body behind, and travel in the spiritual realm.** People I have been with who were travelling looked as if they were in a deep trance state or coma: their breathing is", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:55:a70f1f52b04f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14271, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 56, "text": "bit more about the psychic part, such as telepathy, telekinesis, time travel, etc. What is each of those abilities used for by the Illuminati?

They leave their body behind, and travel in the spiritual realm.** People I have been with who were travelling looked as if they were in a deep trance state or coma: their breathing is slow, their skin pale and cool, and their heartbeat is lowered. There was always a ritual or a sacrifice first to open the portal. The first few times, a person always takes someone else to guide them and teach them and help them come back. It was always filled with anxiety, because if a person got \"lost\" they might stay there and not come back to now. I also hated it, and I believe it is demonically driven and forbidden by scripture, that is one reason I don't like remembering it. It was almost always into the past, in fact, **there was a barrier up so a person couldn't go too far into the future (maybe a day or so).** I don't know why the barrier is there, I have no idea. **But there is no barrier to going into the past. People do it for several reasons: to see history, to ask wisdom/advice from people in the past, to help/teach others, to demonstrate the unbroken \"gloriousness\" of the group. ** I have seen rituals at ancient Stonehenge (yes, it was used for that) from 1000 years ago doing this, and visited the courts of the monarchies doing this. BUT I also believe it is all deception, a falseness done by the demonic, and that any information obtained by this method is absolutely not reliable. A person could only travel for short periods. They weren't allowed to do more, since it causes health and psychological problems. This kind of stuff is very, very destructive. Q: Can it be used to influence people, i.e. politicians, businessmen, military leaders etc., and to put certain thoughts into their minds? Svali: Not that I saw. There is a limit to the influence of this kind of stuff. Instead, these people get blackmailed or bribed, which is much more effective. **I believe that the ability of the \"psychic phenomena\" is overrated at times, since people do have free will, unless they are being in active control by the group. ** Q: To what degree can they alter global consciousness and our timeline by time/astral travel in general, and how many people would be needed to do that? Svali: They don't try. Remember, God is in control of history, not the Illuminati or any other group. Q: Does the Illuminati have 'specialists' with this sort of ability and are they used 'full time' to do this?", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:56:e1206862e9fb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14272, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 57, "text": "do have free will, unless they are being in active control by the group. ** Q: To what degree can they alter global consciousness and our timeline by time/astral travel in general, and how many people would be needed to do that?

Svali: They have people that do this more, called \"Spiritual\" (the ones who specialize in spiritual, instead of Military, or Sciences, or Scholarship). These people ALWAYS age before their time, and have gray or white hair early. Even they have to limit their contact with this, since it is so destructive. **Some of this also comes under the heading \"theta\" programming, or psychic programming. **Remember in the movie The Matrix, the children learning to bend spoons? That was pure theta being shown, and horrified me to watch. Again, Hollywood goes above ground. These abilities are used to teach \"psychic killing\" (I have seen animals killed by people in a ring around it, concentrating on it, the animal rose up and was strangled), and to supposedly do this to humans, or to be able to eavesdrop on others. This is NOT a safe, new dimension that has been discovered. It is demons influencing human beings and sharing their knowledge with them. And it always ends up destroying those involved in it for very long or very heavily. The demonic wants to destroy the human race, since we are so beloved of God, and they hate Him and us, His beloved creation. Things such as astral travel, time travel are addressed in the Bible (it's called \"spiritism\", \"witchcraft\", etc.) and were forbidden for a good reason: to protect us. I have heard of people who never came back, died, or lost their minds after doing the things I mention, and I would never, ever advocate exploring it, when life here on earth is so full of good things to know about that aren't destructive. I am so glad that I no longer have to witness these things or be part of them. I have renounced ever being part of this in my own life and closed all doors to the demonic and its activity. I also lost all of these abilities at the same time, and it is a huge relief. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 18 - Near Death Experiences ** **Important note:** The content of this article on near death programming discusses traumatic programming in some detail, and could be very triggering to survivors who have undergone this type of abuse.

If you are a survivor, please do not read unless you are with a safe person, or with your therapist. This is part of an ongoing series on complex programming that I am writing as an outline for a sequel to my first book, \"[Breaking the Chain](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali_book_svali_speaks)\". In this article, I will be discussing one of the most traumatic forms of programming that a survivor can undergo. This programming involves the use of Near Death Experiences. The Illuminati have studied human neurophysiology and the effects of traumatic conditioning on the human brain and psyche for years. In their search for better and more reliable methods of ingraining programming, they have utilized research from a variety of sources: governmental agencies; totalitarian regimes, and their own experimentation that is ongoing on a continuous (and secretive) basis. But some of the foundations for this type of programming have been in place for centuries. One of the oldest rituals that the Illuminati utilize is the \"resurrection ceremony\". In fact the phoenix, symbol of death and new life, is one of their highest symbols and symbolizes the coming of the New Order and its leader. How is resurrection programming done, or its variations? I will share what I have undergone and/or witnessed. **A young child of around two or three will be very heavily traumatized during an occult ceremony. They will be abused, beaten, shocked and even suffocated, and given drugs to create a state that is near death. The child will almost always at this point feel that they are suspended above their body, watching the unconscious body beneath that has been tortured to the point of being near death.** **There will always be medical personnel involved in programming at this depth who are skilled at monitoring the child's physical state and at resuscitating them. Resuscitation equipment and medications are on hand at all times.** **The child in this extremity will have their deepest core called out at this point, and brought to consciousness in extreme pain. They will then be told that they have a \"choice\": to face certain death, or to choose life if they will invite a powerful demon inside. The child chooses life. The demon enters, the child goes unconscious, and then awakens later in clean clothing, in a soft bed, with healing ointments on. ** They are extremely weak and shaky, and are told by a kind, caring, soft voiced woman (or man) that the child had died, but the demon \"brought them back to life\", that they owe their very", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:58:2708389ed9d0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14274, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 59, "text": "\"choice\": to face certain death, or to choose life if they will invite a powerful demon inside.

The child is also told that if they ask the demonic entity to leave, that they will revert to the near death/dying state they were in when it made its entrance. This is one type of near death experience used to control and terrify a very young child, and to force it to accept a demonic spirituality under the most traumatic and coercive circumstances imaginable. The child feels marked and chosen for life by this experience, and it profoundly influences the child's core beliefs about him/herself and their deepest reality. **It is also one of the most horrible manipulations of a young child that can occur, and is designed to take away their free choice or will.** Another form of near death programming will occur in a situation that has often been called \"governmental mind control\" but which I always viewed as linked to the Illuminati programming (since the trainers/scientists in each crossed over from one to the other and shared information). For example, at Tulane Medical Center, nearby was a place known as the \"Institute\". The Institute was involved in experimentation in mind control techniques put in under the most extreme circumstances, including at the point of near physical death. For some of this programming, a \"subject\" (how I hate that word, used by trainers to emotionally distance themselves from the fact that this was a human being, with feelings and emotions being worked on) would be in a hospital ward, isolated from others by blank grey-white walls. The subject was tied down by four points and also across the waist and neck. They were then wrapped in a cocoon like manner with soft gauze to limit movement or any feeling or sensation in the limbs.

You owe your life to me.\" Recorded messages are also played over and over, repetitiously, at this point, which describe the \"subjects\" future destiny for \"family\", etc. Finally, slowly, the subject is allowed to awaken, to come out of unconsciousness, with the constant message of being \"reborn\" for the \"family group\" being played.** Kind faced people soothe the subject as they recover from this hideously traumatic programming sequence. The person feels insanely grateful to be alive, to be released from the horrors of the days when they lay near death in the Institute, and will cling like a preverbal child to the adults around them. They are extremely vulnerable at this point, and extremely receptive to the messages placed in under trauma. I should know. **I was a \"subject' at the Institute as a child in the 1960's and early 1970's, and later visited as an adult as a \"consultant\".** This is deep level programming put in under extreme circumstances, and the fear level for the survivor when they begin to remember this type of trauma can be extremely high. I wish I could whitewash it, say that it isn't this bad, but it is. I know that this may stretch the believability of some people, but this type of programming really, truly occurs (along with other types of sophisticated mind control methods). Near death programming has many variations, and I have only touched on two (there are other forms as well). **Programming put in when in a near death state will be at core level, since the survival level at that point touches the person's core, no matter how well protected. The person who has undergone it may believe that if they try to break it, they might die**, or that they will enter a near death state, that their heart will stop. I went through all of these fears, and more, when dealing with this type of programming inside, and to this day I struggle at times with the residual terror it left. **The lies ground in at this almost unconscious state will be believed deeply", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:60:9c94a9f38e03", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14276, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 61, "text": "matter how well protected.

I went through all of these fears, and more, when dealing with this type of programming inside, and to this day I struggle at times with the residual terror it left. **The lies ground in at this almost unconscious state will be believed deeply at a core level, since the child undergoing it is desperately needing to believe the adults who literally hold the power of life and death over them. The child has been completely broken down by the planned, horrific trauma, and will embrace these messages at their deepest core as being true.** This is why core beliefs and messages are so very hard to undo at this level. It means that deprogramming requires excellent support, a safe environment, and spiritual awareness and discernment, since the demonic stronghold will also be severe at this point. Help from a therapist knowledgeable about programming, and spiritual help from those who know about deliverance, is a vital part of therapy at this point. The survivor who reaches this level of programming inside will have reached core level. The programming will be some of the most deeply held and believed, and will be almost impossible to reach at a conscious level until there is deep system cooperation and safety and trust in the outside people helping the survivor. This is also where faith in God and His ability to heal ANYTHING, including the most severe of physical, emotional, and spiritual traumas, will make all the difference. This type of programming may need to be worked on in a safe inpatient setting, or with extreme safety externally, since fear may cause panic and acting out when it begins to come out. Reality orientation may be lost for a bit as the programming sequences surface, and it will take the strength of the entire system to help slow the memories down and make them manageable. Medication will probably also be needed to help with the severe sense of depression, loss, abandonment, and betrayal that this type of programming will bring out. Despair over choices made, and wondering if the survivor can survive remembering will come up. A hopeful, supportive, nurturing, and encouraging attitude can make the difference. Scripture verses that remind the person of God's love and ability to heal, of His care, and promises of forgiveness and caring, will be very important. **Breaking this type of programming is immensely tiring and plenty of rest and nutritious food is important.

Hearing their rage at what was done as they discuss the \"SOBs who did this to me\" will be healing, and don't rush them towards premature or false forgiveness.** The survivor will have to look at and acknowledge the trauma, the damage, and then find hope that they are surviving the remembering of core trauma. Bringing in gentle, non-taxing good experiences such as a playtime, drawing, or a nature walk can be healing. Outlets such as journaling and talking about how they feel will be very important in processing this type of programming. I have described some of the most viciously traumatic programming that can be done to a child or young teen in this group. It is possible to work it through, slowly, with time and caring support and prayer. My wish in discussing this has not been to be gory or graphic, but to help others understand that this type of programming does occur, and may need to be worked through by the survivor of occultic/ritualistic abuse. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 19 - Questions/Answers from Readers [1]** Q: ''I read that 'Jenny Craig' and a lot of weight loss centers are in fact 'fronts' for access to women they can program ... Ask Svali if this is true (if she knows) and what other businesses or 'non-profit' organizations are involved, if any?'' Svali: My answer has two parts. First, **normally the Illuminati do NOT do much recruiting outside their group (other occult groups do, perhaps). They just don't trust outsiders that much. On the rare occasions that they do, it is always a young child who is brought in. A lot of the programming cannot be done after a certain age (8) or it will induce severe trauma or even psychosis in a person who is unable to dissociate adequately.** You can create some functional states, but not anything near the complex groupings and abilities that trainers like to see. Now, part two. Many woman who are severely overweight have been sexually abused, and may be already dissociative. They may have other trauma as well. So, if a person were interested in looking for dissociators, it would make sense that they would go to places like this. I wasn't involved in any type of recruiting activities, never saw it done.

Some children are brought in from the outside through: Child pornography rings; these children already dissociate, so they are \"stepped up\" into the cult; some parents \"sell\" their children to be used and trained by the cult; some child psychologists are taught to look for very young children. But in my reality, everyone I knew was generational, on both sides of the family. Wish I could help you, but this is how the Illuminati operated in San Diego and Washington, DC. It's possible that some branches in other states do more recruitment than I was exposed to. I have heard survivor stories of children recruiting other children, for example, although it wasn't done in the groups I belonged to. **I want to add that the Illuminati are only one of several occult groups that operate in the North American continent. There are many others, and they may do more recruitment and things that I haven't mentioned. The Illuminists tend to have a more scientific and military approach to their programming, whereas other groups operate differently. Some groups, such as the Templar Knights, do NOT believe in demonic worship, although they are Luciferian and practice mysteries. Each group has its own agenda. I can only speak for the Illuminati in the areas of the U.S. and Europe that I lived in.** Q: Having worked professionally in numerous cities and campuses, I have never heard of ritual abuse by leadership in our communities. Svali's experiences appear to be genuine, however I cannot accept the notion that this Illuminati has a dominant role in ritually abusing children, adults and an ability to brutalize others and get away with it without raising suspicions among the cognoscenti. Q: Is she actually inferring that there exists a LEADERSHIP in professional areas, and we as a public have not understood the extent of this? Perhaps her experiences should be shared with those in the ritually abused community. Do we really have a threat we need to worry about? Svali: In answering this, I need to raise a couple of points. **The Illuminati and their followers are a minority of our world's population. In San Diego county, where the population is over 2 million, there existed 5 years ago 24 sister groups with membership of roughly 60 to 75 each. Leadership council over the county was 13 members. So, in a metro center with over 2 million, the active Illuminists comprised less than 1500 members. The Illuminati are possibly 1% of the population in the US.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt:63:4f2f7654c446", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14279, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__illuminati_bloodlines_svali", "chunk_index": 64, "text": "raise a couple of points. **The Illuminati and their followers are a minority of our world's population.

So, in a metro center with over 2 million, the active Illuminists comprised less than 1500 members. The Illuminati are possibly 1% of the population in the US. ** **What this means is that 99% of the people you know and work with are NOT Illuminati.** They are good, hard-working people (at least most are) who want a paycheck, and a good family life. MOST of the leaders in our communities and financial systems have never heard of the Illuminati, because they are a minority. So, why worry about them? Because a small group of evil people can do great damage. I will use an analogy. MOST people in our society are not involved in child pornography, consider it a crime against children, and would fight against it given the chance. Yet, the small minority of those involved in it do incalculable damage to the children involved. The effects of the crime are greater than the bare numbers involved. Why isn't child pornography stopped? We have the evidence, law enforcement knows it exists, yet it is a multi-billion dollar industry. HOW do these people \"hide\" from justice and capture? Why don't the police stop them? Because they aren't stupid. They work under secrecy. They change locations frequently and kill those who talk to law enforcement. Bribes and other means are used to cover their tracks, and they hire excellent lawyers. Okay, now lets look at the Illuminists. The 1% of our nation involved are extremely intelligent. They have sworn an oath on pain of death from toddler-hood on to never reveal their true allegiance to outsiders. Do you know how many business leaders in your community are Masons? Yet this is not an oath on pain of death. How much less would an Illuminist share their leanings, or be detected. I have written an article on Suite 101 on ''[Why the cult doesn't get caught](http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/ritual_abuse/38241)'' with more information on this topic. I HAVE shared this information with the survivor community. I have gone to the police, to therapists that work with survivors. I publish on Suite 101 precisely to help educate the public and survivors about this abuse. The main danger of the Illuminati is the 1% involved in this group are intelligent, and many are well funded. Q: Can the Illuminati's family trees be traced back to specific towns in Europe? Svali: Yes, and this depends on the branch. There is the German branch, the French branch, the UK branch, and the Russian branch. Each has roots in different areas of Europe.

The towns of central Germany and Austria were the beginning for the German branch. They trace their roots from the Knights Templar, who united the European nations during the crusades. Q: Do they consider the Christian God real, but a liar? Svali: **The Illuminati believe in the deification of men through knowledge. They know that there are supernatural beings who help them in this process, but they don't necessarily divide things into \"good and bad\", rather \"enlightened\" or \"unenlightened\". They believe that the Christian God is real, but that adherents of Christianity are one step short of enlightenment, that they do not know the \"full picture\" as they do. They see Christians as sheep who follow a nice story created to help them feel better, because they are \"too weak\" to want to know the \"full truth\".** (This is what an illuminist would say in describing the difference). They tend to be cynical towards the Christian God, to see him as a placebo for the weak. Q: Do they consider their own god a liar, even if for \"good\"? If so, how do they trust their god? Svali: They do not consider their gods (they have several) as liars. These \"gods\" have given them power, wealth, status, and everything that they have asked for. Yes, at a price, a horrible price, but they believe that nothing comes cheaply, and the higher the price they have paid, the more they value the gift. It is hard to explain this type to thinking to someone outside the group, because mainstream society wants to see them as evil Satanists, and opposed to Christianity. They themselves wouldn't put it quite that way. Oh, they will mock and downgrade Christianity, but only because they want its followers to see that they are the 'deceived ones\". The god of this world has truly blinded their eyes. Do they \"trust\" their gods? As much as they trust anything. **Remember, trust is not a concept in this group, where \"betrayal is the greatest good\" is a maxim taught since childhood.** If you asked them, do you \"trust\" your deity, they would look puzzled, and say, \"only a foolish person trusts what they cannot know\" or some other maxim. Q: Do they consider the Christian God to be a God of naive love? Svali: Yes, yes, very naive, and setting His followers up for a fall. This is the extent of their arrogance.

Q: If they use torture and terror on those they love who are of lower rank, how do they distinguish between love and hate? Svali: They don't. **They tell their children as they are torturing them, \"I am doing this because I love you.\" To them, the greatest love is to make a child strong, and fit to lead or to move higher in the group, by whatever means it takes.** **If a leader sees a child, and wants it as a prostitute, the loving parents will give it away, happy that their child will rise in status. Also, again, they view betrayal as the greatest good. They will do set up after set up to teach their children to never openly trust others.** **I remember hundreds of agonizing set ups and betrayals, and hearing when I was betrayed or wounded, \"And such is the heart of man.\"** Those doing this to me thought they were teaching me something of value, that would help me. And because of the vicious and political nature of the group, in one sense they were right; the naive get stepped on and wounded. I have known parents who tried to spare their children some of this out of love, but often they were overruled by other family members, who viewed these parents as \"weak\" and \"unfit\" to teach their child. Q: Can you list their religious beliefs in some detail? e.g. re-incarnation? Heaven and hell? Sin? Absolution? Elves? Svali: Which part? Spiritual has many branches including: Celtic druidism, Rosicrucianism, Babylonian mystery religion, Egyptian mysteries, and traveling the planes. A child will have to learn each of these disciplines and others, as part of their training. They also have theta, or psychic training, as well. **The Illuminati have taken the best (or worst) of each of these religions, and incorporated them. Also, there is NOT just ONE religion that every group follows. In Washington DC, my main trainers were Celtic druids and adherents of Babylonian mystery religion. In San Diego, the Egyptian mystery religion is emphasized, in part because [Col. [Michael] Aquino](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/mind_control/satanic_cults_geraldo_aquino_gunderson) oversees that group, and is heavily into Temple of Set.** Here is a brief overview, doing my best to incorporate these beliefs. **They believe that reincarnation is possible, because of the time travel that they do, but they don't emphasize it in their teachings.

They believe in a final sphere of white light, which to them is total enlightenment, and their concept of heaven. They believe that they are immune from hell, which is for the unenlightened. Their concept of hell is different than the Bible's; they believe that it means being lower and never reaching higher in the afterlife (they believe there are levels there, too, determined by how one progresses here on earth).** **To them, sin is being weak or stupid,** and not using the intelligence or abilities you were given, or failing to progress. I never heard any discussion of absolution. If you fail, you are punished or killed. That simple. There is some belief in elves, sprites, and other small beings in the druidic branch, who also see life in each of nature's creations. Q: Some researchers claim that various items that people are commonly exposed to in society are part of the means to weaken their enemies. Therefore, I wonder if the Illuminati allow their own leading members to be exposed to these, i.e. the following: a. chlorine and fluoride in water and foods; b. vaccines; c. medical drugs; d. junk food; e. micro-waved food; f. dietary supplements; g. biochips; h. mercury fillings; i. HAARP; j. Chemtrail's? Svali: In general, true leadership is protected from much of the above. They are ORDERED to not: drink, do drugs, or anything harmful to themselves. They don't go as far as junk food or micro-waved food, since they don't worry about that, but at meetings, healthy food such as granola or trail mix are given out during exercises, and they know the importance of good nutrition. **They will NOT put their top leaders through the extensive use of mind control experimentation, or implants, etc. because of the risk involved. These children and adults ARE dissociative, but they go through a special program that is different than for the lower levels.** They do get vaccines, since even if the child became ill, a healer could fix them. And they do take medications if needed, such as antibiotics, etc. Do they claim to use vaccines or medical drugs for genocide? I had not heard that when I was in the group. Everyone I knew was vaccinated and took medications, although vitamins and good diet were also important. Q: Some claim that Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Charismatic's, Pagans, the New Age Movement, Satanists, etc. were founded by the same plotters.

Q: Some claim that Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Charismatic's, Pagans, the New Age Movement, Satanists, etc. were founded by the same plotters. Are these groups, or at least their leaders, considered allies of the Illuminati by their members? Svali: Some of these groups have affiliated themselves secretly with the Illuminati (because of the money and free training offered), others are sympathetic, or at the least, respectful of them. **The Mormons affiliated years ago in a meeting with Illuminati leadership in the 1950s. The same with the Jehovah's Witnesses. **I have not heard that Charismatic's or Pagans were affiliated, the pagans are considered \"dabblers\" by the Illuminati. The New Age and Satanists are sympathetic to them. Q: Do they respect real science or history in favor of \"faith\" in their own beliefs? Svali: No. They will respect science, but they will try to rewrite history in set ups and dramas for children (where they purport to show them \"real history\" behind the scenes). Also, they will do time travel through portals, but I cannot say how accurate what occurs is, since I believe it is facilitated demonically. **The Illuminati teach their children that powerful occultists who were enlightened have been secretly behind the thrones of Europe, and down the ages behind the kingdoms of this world, since time began. True or propaganda? I don't know.** They teach their children that underneath Stonehenge there is a great room filled with the skeletons of sacrifices. Fact or fiction? I don't know, and cannot fund the archeological expedition it would take to verify this or not. How accurate their teachings are, I do question, since they also leave out the role of faith in God, and His ability to hold back evil. I believe that ultimately, God has been in control of human history, not evil. **The Illuminati Bloodlines** **Exclusive Interview with Ex-Illuminati Bloodline Programmer/Trainer Svali ** **Part 20 - Q & A [2]: Svali Answers More Questions** Q: I'm very concerned about the New World Order scheme and my questions are meant to help me find possible ways to proceed in helping to defeat the scheme. Svali: I know I sound cynical, but good luck! I really do wish you the best in this. I believe that it would take a LOT of people joining together, with immense wealth and excellent lawyers, to stop them.

I do wish any groups dedicated to stopping this horrific abuse of small children the very best, and will pray that they succeed. But this is also a spiritual battle, and anyone who takes on this type of occult evil would also need to be aware of spiritual warfare. The Illuminists certainly use it against others, and anyone stepping into this arena without prayer would be very vulnerable, in my opinion. Q: Have you considered starting a 12-step group like AA for ritual abusers and cult victims? I know from personal experience that the spiritual 12-step program works. Svali: I believe that there are already groups such as this out there. I know that there are AA groups for incest survivors, and many also have branched off into RA [Ritual Abuse] support as well. Since I live in a rural area (population 100 unless you count the squirrels and cows), I would not be close enough to lead any groups such as this. They are usually found near large metropolitan areas. In fact, I drive two hours once a month to therapy, since that is the closest to where I live. Q: Were you allowed to read and listen to what you wanted while you were in the Illuminati, or was everything censored? If it wasn't censored, it seems like members could notice that Illuminati teachings about betrayal being a human attribute are false. Right? Svali: Wrong. **I was never censored what I read, but you have to understand their mind set. As a small child, my parents told me that everyone was secretly a member of this group, and that the daytime was a \"facade\" or \"pretense' that all maintain.** **They would take me to friends' houses for dinner, and afterwards a ritual would occur, so I believed them. I grew up since infancy believing that this was just how the world operated for all: people act one way in the daytime, another at night.

To question something, you have to be able to step outside it, and I never had the maturity, or any reason to question the teachings, until I was much older. Think about it. All around were movies reinforcing what the cult taught, the Disney films, etc. I listened to heavy metal groups whose values echoed what I was taught at night. In fact, outside of Christian literature, there is not much out there that would engender trust in other human beings. Q: I was shocked to hear you say you were forced to shoot a friend of yours. Are many members forced to shoot or kill someone, or is this just for punishment training? Is it just outsiders who are killed? Are you able to discuss the shooting, or is this too hard to discuss? Svali: The friend was not an outsider, she was part of the group and considered expendable. **In this group, people are one of two things: \"useful\" or \"expendable\". Everyone works quite hard to be useful.** It is not a common punishment, in fact rare, but my mother was an unusually driven and ambitious person. She was a head trainer, and sat on the regional council over the Washington DC area in the spiritual seat. The other seats on the council were military (held by her boss at the Pentagon, where she worked. His cult name was \"Ashtoth\"), a government seat, leadership, scholarship, and sciences seats. Usually, they bring in outsiders for rituals or killing, but this was an unusually harsh punishment to teach me an unforgettable lesson. It did. I never made a friend after that. I didn't like those higher than me and had no wish to make friends with those she considered \"worthy\" of a \"leader\" and other nonsense. Very rarely, in military exercises, those who were weak or kept a unit behind consistently were shot to teach the others a lesson (I saw it happen once). This never happened to the children of leaders, only those from lower levels. Q: You say you begged God for a better home every night, but became embittered against God for not providing it. Were you praying to a benevolent God or to the Illuminati god? If the former, then where did you get your idea of a benevolent God? Svali: This is a great question. I was NOT praying to the Illuminati deities, because to me, they were cruel and sadistic and frightening.

I was praying to my child's concept of a good God, from my reading, watching of TV, and also the innate knowledge that all children have in their hearts that somewhere, up there, is a good God. I also had a few experiences with angels, and being protected as a child during horrendous trauma, and this also formed my concept that good existed. They never actually tried to stop me from praying, since positive spirituality gives hope, and can help prevent suicide. In fact, **I was forbidden to read about or seek any knowledge about the occult in my day life, because otherwise too much would be given to the occult, and the risk of suicide would have increased. They are believers in \"balance', even in this area.** Q: You said \"Papa Brogan\" [see previous article] was the only kind adult in your life growing up. Do you mean he showed you affection? In what way? Svali: Dr. Timothy Brogan was a professor at George Washington University. He was a specialist in neuropsychology, and one of the top Illuminati trainers in the DC area. He was also close friends with Sidney Gottlieb (another of my mother's \"friends\"). Anyway, he could be very kind as well as cruel. He would hold me on his lap, call me his \"little one\", and praised me highly when I did well. He taught me chess and would read works of literature to me. He told me I was his \"adopted daughter\" and that he was proud of me. We would hold intellectual discussions until late at night, and he imparted his views of leadership and training to me. **Not all Illuminati activity is cruel or inhumane; he could be caring and loving as well. I would play with his children, who were older than me, and he would patiently answer my questions about science, geography, and other topics. I bonded completely to him, which made the torture and sexual abuse especially painful and betraying.** Q: **You say you had a core split, over 7,000 fragments and 16 internal systems.** You mean you developed split personalities who weren't aware of each other? If so, did any of these personalities seem to have a fairly nice life? **Svali: Yep, split personalities.

Most of the people I knew in the Illuminati were fairly fragmented (in fact, I cannot think of anyone who was not dissociative to some degree). Even the local and regional leaders all come in for regular \"programming tune ups\" as Jonathan and I used to call them. The largest split was between the front and back; i.e. daily life and night life. Most, but not all, of the night alters could communicate, or at least the controllers and the higher parts inside could (and relay information to those beneath them). And yes, many of my personalities had a wonderful life. I had 140 created to deal with daytime life, such as work, friends, and fun (who have coalesced).** Many of my back people had good experiences, such as the ones I described above with Dr. Brogan. Others were pampered and praised, told that I would be a leader in the coming \"New Order'' (of course, they tell everyone that). I was to be a mediator between governmental figures in different nations because of my language abilities and people mediation skills. Many of my internal parts were quite proud of their abilities and accomplishments in the group, and grieved heavily when I left. Q: Are the non-German Illuminists not Nazis, racist white supremacists, or genocidal maniacs? And, if the leadership in all countries is Illuminati, that must mean they're of all races, which seems to mean the white supremacists oppose the non-white Illuminati. Is this right? Svali: **Not all Illuminist groups are as fanatically anti-racial as the German branch is, although many are. These people are racist in the extreme, but they are also very practical, and realize that world domination is not possible without the aid of non-white races. That is why loyal figures in these countries are being promised leadership positions for their area, under the supervision of Illuminist commanders.** **They also view Orientals differently than other nonwhite races, because of the long history of occult mysticism in many countries (such as Tibet, for example), the long history of culture, and the high intelligence. This is why the oriental branches are highly regarded, even in Europe. But they do believe that Europe will be the center of world government and leadership.** Even in non-white countries, the top leadership is still white, or nearly so. For example, in South America, the top leaders are European in descent, with less of the mestizo mixing. In Africa, many of the leaders behind the scenes are whites, although there are local black leaders who have demonstrated extreme loyalty. They are using them, though, since these members will never be able to hold top leadership in the world.

All this said, I believe that the racist and hateful policies of the Illuminati are despicable in the extreme. One of my biggest quarrels with leadership was this position, among others. I hope this has answered some of your questions. **Important Note:** Numerous serious researchers into these matters believe that there are many competing factions within the Illuminati or \"the Family.\" It is suspected that Svali was involved in one of the most aggressive and sadistic factions. If this is true, then the above descriptions relate some of the worst behavior of this group. Let's hope that there are other factions which are much less focused on torture and dominance.

That is one out of three presidents. Yet most people know very little about this secretive organization. [Key major media articles](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) have given a glimpse of the inordinate power of top secret societies, yet the media in general seem reluctant to investigate deeply and to inform us of these powerful groups. In Europe of the middle ages and beyond, the Catholic Church ruled with an iron fist. **Galileo was [placed under house arrest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair) till the day he died for claiming the Earth revolved around the sun.** **In those oppressive times, secret societies served a vital function, as they were one of the very few ways to preserve and foster knowledge suppressed by the church.** Yet whenever there is secrecy, the potential for corruption and manipulation increases dramatically. In this modern era of the Internet and easy access to knowledge, does the secrecy of the Masons and other secret societies play a useful role in our world? Is there a good purpose today for the most rich and powerful people in the world to meet behind closed doors without any public scrutiny? The engaging MSNBC article below discusses key, little-known facts about the Masons and Freemasonry based on Dan Brown's blockbuster [*The Lost Symbol*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lost-Symbol-Dan-Brown/dp/0307950689/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1351877230&sr=8-1&keywords=lost+symbol+dan+brown). Brown's novel paints the Masons in a very positive light, yet it also reveals their immense power. **Why is it that so few people know about the Masonic origins of the U.S. and the incredible number of members of the global elite who belong to the Masons and other secretive groups even now.** Key statements are highlighted in bold for those who prefer to skim.

Imagine the scene: a mysterious temple, its entrance guarded by massive stone columns and sphinxes. Inside, strange symbols, ancient inscriptions, and mystical numbers lead to a room shaped like a pyramid, with an eye that points toward the heavens, and in the center of the floor, a massive altar. **Some of the most powerful men in the country gather here to enact an ancient, secret ritual, drinking wine meant to represent blood from a human skull, and all of it happening just a mile from the U.S. Capitol.** It sounds like a work of fiction, and it does come from one - the opening scene of Dan Brown's best-selling novel, \"The Lost Symbol.\" But Brown makes a remarkable claim: that the ritual is real, part of the history of the secretive brotherhood called the Freemasons. *Skull and Bones, the infamous Yale secret society, uses similar secret symbols operating out of a foreboding building called the \"Tomb.\" George W. Bush, his father, his grandfather, and John Kerry are just a few of their [prominent members](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Skull_and_Bones_members).

Perhaps with good reason. Brown has a history of prying open doors, revealing dark secrets - or at least seeming to.

The book infuriated some Christians. It also sold 80 million copies worldwide, became a blockbuster film, and made Dan Brown a household name.

But I'd like them to at least think about it. The book is a thriller, a headlong chase through some of Washington's most famous landmarks, and also through puzzles, secret codes, and dark corners of history, starting with the secretive group at the center of \"The Lost Symbol\": the Freemasons, a worldwide brotherhood that's centuries old, and still active. **George Washington was a Mason, along with 13 other presidents and numerous Supreme Court Justices. Benjamin Franklin published a book about Freemasonry on his own printing press. Nine signers of the Declaration of Independence were Freemasons, including the man with the biggest signature: John Hancock.** *The secrecy of the Masons is what allowed prominent disgruntled colonists to gather, to conspire against British tyranny, and eventually to establish the new and independent country of the United States. Yet few history books touch on this important piece of American history. At the time of independence in 1776, Masons were highly respected. Yet as they became more powerful after the revolution, they also became more corrupt. By the late 1820s an anti-masonic movement swept the nation and decimated Masonic membership, though interest returned by the 1850s. **For more, [click here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Masonic_Party), and [here](http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masons/Essays/anti-Masonic.html).* Freemasonry still has millions of members worldwide, and they still conduct rituals like this one performed for our cameras: **Grim Reaper (enacting Masonic ritual)**: If curiosity spurred you towards us, go away.

Why is there so little media coverage of these powerful conclaves when their influential members are daily fodder for the tabloids?* In Brown's book, the Freemasons are infiltrated by a man who believes they hold a great secret to mystical power.

Langdon must find the lost symbol before Mal'akh does in order to save an old friend - and possibly the world - from Mal'akh's evil scheme. We'll hear from Dan Brown about the mysteries of freemasonry, and from the Freemasons themselves about the secrets they've kept for centuries. We'll take a tour of Washington, D.C. unlike any you've taken before, uncovering secret places with Dan Brown as our guide. And we'll go to the fringes of science and the depths of prehistory in search of what Brown calls the true meaning of his latest book - and why, he says, it actually changed his beliefs. **Dan Brown: I spent a lot of time researching and really had to get to the point where I realized, \"You know what? The world's a stranger place then we thought.\" ** *Brown does his research well in both \"The Da Vinci Code\" and \"The Lost Symbol.\" In both books, I checked many of the facts he stated, especially the most surprising and controversial claims. Invariably, I was able to find reliable sources supporting his claims. * \"The Lost Symbol\" starts with a gruesome discovery. Dan Brown's hero, Robert Langdon, is lured to Washington, D.C. to the U.S. Capitol, where, at the center of the rotunda, he finds a severed hand, tattooed to resemble an ancient mystical symbol: the hand of the mysteries. It beckons him on a dangerous journey. The hand belongs to an old friend of Langdon's who's been kidnapped by the villain, Mal'akh: a man named Peter Solomon. Solomon runs the Smithsonian Institution. But he's also a thirty-third degree Freemason of the Scottish rite. This is the headquarters of the Scottish Rite Freemasons in Washington, D.C. They call it the house of the temple, and it's where we talked with Dan Brown, who wove the secrets of the Masons into the taut rope of his story. **Matt Lauer**: **One character is being elevated to the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite. It's a rather intense ritual. He he drinks wine, which is to represent blood out of a skull.** How much of that is fact and how much of that is fiction? **Dan Brown: **Well, this is a real ceremony. **The ceremony is described accurately.** The fiction comes in as to whether or not it still happens at this moment in history", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons-m.txt:4:f73489629765", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14295, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons-m.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons-m", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "rope of his story. **Matt Lauer**: **One character is being elevated to the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite.

Brown's villain, Mal'akh, is the man drinking the wine. He's journeyed deep into Freemasonry to find out its secrets - and so will we. Mal'akh is fiction, but how much of the ritual is real? **Arturo de Hoyos: **Dan Brown's book is very exciting. And like any good work of fiction, it has to involve both truth and error to make it believable. Arturo de Hoyos is the grand archivist and grand historian of the supreme council of the Scottish rite and himself a 33rd-degree Mason. **Arturo de Hoyos: **One of the things that's wrong is on the very first page. We don't perform the 33rd Degree in this building. We don't confer it at night. The candidates to the members are dressed wrong. And the ceremony's wrong. Maybe they don't do the ceremony in this building, but there's evidence Freemasons have done it. Brown can quote multiple historical sources. What is the truth? To find out, we have to delve into the distant past. **Mitch Horowitz: **Masonry in many respects is a historic mystery. Mitch Horowitz is the author of the new book, \"[Occult America](http://www.amazon.com/Occult-America-Secret-History-Mysticism/dp/B005CDUP2I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1351904863&sr=8-1&keywords=occult+america+mitch+horowitz).\" He's a scholar of esoteric religions and secret societies. **Mitch Horowitz: Masons themselves cannot agree on the nature of their own origins and background. **Masonry may be the only modern organization for which that's true. The origins of the Freemasons are shrouded in mystery. Art de Hoyos outlines the simplest theory: **Arturo de Hoyos: **Freemasonry developed primarily in medieval Scotland and England with the Stonemasons' guilds and societies. In other words, the first Masons were literally that: stonecutters, the men who built the great cathedrals of Europe, and who wanted to guard their trade secrets. **Arturo de Hoyos: **So they developed a system of secret signs and secret passwords. De Hoyos says the tradesmen started another system associated with Freemasonry - the so-called \"three degrees:\" apprentice, fellow of the craft, and master mason, still used in Freemasonry today. So is the symbol of a square and compass, mason's tools with the letter \"g\", signifying both \"geometry\" and \"God.\" At meetings masons wear elaborately decorated aprons, symbolic representations of the ones worn by working stonemasons.

In fact, some masons say the group originated in the holy land, in biblical times, with the builders of Solomon's temple. Many Masonic symbols are even older than that. **Mitch Horowitz: The all seeing eye, the pyramid, the obelisk. It drew very deeply upon the symbols of pre-Christian religion because it believed that it was part of a chain of a spiritual search for truth that was older than any modern or contemporary religion.** *The Masons are often linked to other secret societies claiming ancient heritage like the Knights Templar and the [Rosicrucians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism). The [Knights Templar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar), reputed to be some of the fiercest warriors of the time, were officially endorsed by the Catholic Church in the early 12th century. Yet they became so powerful (and among the [world's first bankers](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1674980,00.html)) that by the early 14th century the church was largely successful in destroying the order. *Some believe the superstition around [Friday the 13th](http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masonry/Essays/friday13.html) came from a secret edict issued by the King of France on Friday the 13th of October in 1307 to arrest all members of the order. In the novel, Mal'akh believes the masons know mystical secrets that will make him an all powerful demon. He infiltrates the group, kidnaps its leader, and uses blackmail to try to get what he wants. That's fiction. But in fact, **their freethinking about religion once caused the Vatican to denounce the masons as Satanic. And in the 1800's Masons in upstate New York were accused of murdering a man named William Morgan, who threatened to expose their secret rituals.** Today the web is full of anti-Masonic material. **Arturo de Hoyos: **I frequently run into people who have heard of a couple of things about Freemasonry and no more. We killed William Morgan and we worship the devil, and that's about all they've heard of us. Those people might be surprised to hear this: **Arturo de Hoyos: **The father of our country was a Freemason. There's no question of this. And historians agree that some principles of Freemasonry became cherished principles of the United States. **Arturo de Hoyos: Freemasonry was one of the earliest societies to advocate self-rule.

And as Dan Brown's hero, Robert Langdon, races Mal'akh through Washington, D.C. to find the secrets of Freemasonry, he reveals little-known facts about the founding fathers that might shock some readers. **Dan Brown: **There was a statue that sat in the Capitol. It was [George Washington as a god](http://www.smithsonianlegacies.si.edu/objectdescription.cfm?ID=66). Hidden away on the lower level of the Masonic house of the temple, in Washington, D.C., there's a remarkable painting not many people have seen. George Washington, the first president of the United States, wears the decorated apron of Freemasonry. Nearby are the square and the compass, traditional symbols of Freemasonry. The painting is described in Dan Brown's best-selling novel \"The Lost Symbol.\" **Dan Brown: **It's a [cornerstone laying ritual](http://dcgiftshop.com/items/George_Washington_Laying_the_Cornerstone_of_the_United_States_Capitol.html). And essentially, a date is chosen - that is auspicious from an astrological standpoint. And there will be certain blessings that are given when this cornerstone is laid. And the idea is that whatever is to take place in that building will have a solid and auspicious beginning. And what building is George Washington, Freemason, laying the cornerstone for? The United States Capitol. **Matt Lauer: And it's not just the Capitol. Those ceremonies, those rituals were used in the building of the Washington Monument and the White House.** **Dan Brown: **They were. As well as many, many other buildings. *Masonic symbolism is rife in the great monuments and buildings of Washington, DC. Yet not only is this kept hidden from the public, many history books even fail to mention anything about the powerful influence of the Masons throughout the early years of the republic. Brown does a very good job of exposing all of this in his book.* *For a revealing History Channel documentary which give rare excellent coverage of this, [click here](https://www.google.com/search?num=40&hl=en&newwindow=1&safe=off&tbm=vid&q=Secret+History+of+the+Freemasons). * The lore of Freemasonry marks Washington in other hidden ways as well. Consider, for example, the number 33, cherished by the Masons. **Dan Brown: **Thirty-three is a very important number - in ancient mysticism. There's a reason that Jesus Christ was said to be 33. There is a reason that there are 33 vertebrae in our spine and that much of Freemasonry has to do with the concept of the body as a temple. Thirty-three repeats throughout the Masonic house of the temple. **Matt Lauer: **There are 33 columns or pillars, each one 33 feet tall. **Dan Brown: **Yes, sir.

That's right. The capstone matches that mystical number. Brown says the Freemasons influenced the founding of America in profound ways, and what he has to say may change what you think about how this country came to be. **Dan Brown: **If you have a group of men who are Masons and simultaneously founding fathers and part of their Masonic ideal is that all men are equal, of course that will be an underlying theme in the founding of a country. **Another important aspect of Freemasonry is this idea of freedom of religion. **We talked about these books on the altar. **Matt Lauer: **It's inclusive. It's not exclusive? **Dan Brown: **Exactly. That couldn't have said it better. *Here Brown reveals his pro-Masonic bias. The Masons are far from inclusive. Like the vast majority of secret societies, the Masons do no accept women. And though a few African-Americans were granted membership at the time of the revolution, widespread racism and segregation made it nearly impossible for them to join many mainstream lodges. As recently as 2009, the admission of an African-American to a Masonic lodge in Georgia generated much controversy as reveal in [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/us/03masons.html)*[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/us/03masons.html)*[article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/us/03masons.html). * **Freemasons assumed members believed in a supreme being. But that's as far as it went. Masons could worship Yahweh, Jesus, Allah - or another god of their own choosing. Religious freedom was built into freemasonry. And, many scholars say the Freemasons built it into the U.S. Constitution. One-third of the signers were known to be Freemasons.** Brown says his research led him to a conclusion that might shock some people. **Dan Brown: **America wasn't founded a Christian country. It became a Christian country. Important thing to remember with the masons and the founding fathers is that **many of the founding fathers were deists. ** **Deists believe that a supreme being created the universe but that being is impersonal. It won't answer your prayers or even hear them.** **Dan Brown: **The concepts behind deism, where man is powerful and man is responsible are the underlying, core beliefs of Freemasonry. **Matt Lauer: **So, when you talk about the founding fathers, who believed in deism as opposed", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons-m.txt:8:c47faec295db", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14299, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons-m.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons-m", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "thing to remember with the masons and the founding fathers is that **many of the founding fathers were deists. ** **Deists believe that a supreme being created the universe but that being is impersonal.

The Founding Fathers, Brown says, didn't just read The Bible. They also read Roman and Egyptian mythology. And they read the stars. *It's important to distinguish between the Masons involved in founding the US and those who came later. The founding fathers were not traditional Christians, but rather deists, as even many history texts acknowledge. They were highly focused on morals and values. Yet as the Masons power grew in the decades after independence, morals took a back seat as power and corruption moved to the fore. Considering that literally 1/3 of U.S. presidents were Masons, shouldn't they be getting more attention? And then find out how many were members of [Skull and Bones](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-bonesmen-president), the [CFR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations), and other secretive groups.* **Matt Lauer: **This reliance on astrology, what does it tell you? What does it suggest about our founding fathers? **Dan Brown: **I think that they had a respect for what they did not understand, a respect for the heavens. The foundations of astrology really have a deep, mystical and spiritual underpinning that that the Masons were very in tune with. **Matt Lauer: **it would be hard to imagine Barack Obama, taking a trip or or doing the groundbreaking on a major monument or something and using astrology as a basis for the time and the place, he'd be ridiculed. **Dan Brown: **And rightly so, I believe. **Matt Lauer: **But why was it okay then and is it not okay now? **Dan Brown: **Well, for the same reason it was okay to believe that - if you threw a virgin into the ocean, a storm wouldn't hit you. **Matt Lauer: **That's not okay now?

(*laughter*) **Dan Brown: **So that's not okay, either? (*laughter*) You know, science progresses. In \"The Lost Symbol,\" Mal'akh thinks that by learning the secrets of the Freemasons, he can become something like a god. You might be surprised to learn the founders had a similar idea. **Matt Lauer: **There is a painting in the Capitol-- **Dan Brown: **Yes. **Matt Lauer: ** Tell me about it. **Dan Brown: **Well it's a painting that I was shocked to find was there. I said, **\"There is a painting called the [Apotheosis of Washington](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apotheosis_of_Washington),\" apotheosis meaning, \"The god-making of Washington.\"** **Matt Lauer: **George Washington becoming a god. **Dan Brown: **It seemed almost irreverential. It was like, \"How can a man become a god?\" And you start looking at this painting and you realize just how strange it is. But it really, to my eye, and to other historians' eye, catches this concept of the power of man. *The Apotheosis of Washington is actually the huge fresco painted on the inside of the main dome of the U.S. Capitol Building. You can view it at [this link.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apotheosis_of_Washington) The tendency to make the first president into a god shows how easily people can get twisted by power. * **Matt Lauer: **Again, can you imagine anyone putting forth that notion of politicians as gods? **Dan Brown: **Right. **Matt Lauer: **Here we are in the 21st century - you'd be run out of town. **Dan Brown: **You'd be run out of town. There was a statue of George Washington that sat in the Capitol. He was unclothed - he had a model of a statue of Zeus. It was George Washington as a god. **Matt Lauer: **Right. **Dan Brown: **And that did get run out of the Capitol building. **When they thought of becoming godlike, the founders were probably thinking about perfecting their minds through science and learning.** In Brown's novel, however, the villain Mal'akh believes something much more profound and potentially sinister: that the Freemasons, from ancient times, through the time of George Washington to the present day, guarded secrets that could transform matter, transform a person, unleash incredible psychic and spiritual power. Most modern-day Masons say the brotherhood is not nearly so mysterious. **Arturo de Hoyos: **There is no deep, dark, intimate and ultimate secret of Freemasonry which will transform the world in the way that \"The Lost Symbol\" portrays. It would be exciting if it were true, but such", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons-m.txt:10:354fb240edca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14301, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons-m.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons-m", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "sinister: that the Freemasons, from ancient times, through the time of George Washington to the present day, guarded secrets that could transform matter, transform a person, unleash incredible psychic and spiritual power.

It would be exciting if it were true, but such is not the case. That's what most Freemasons say, but not all. **Cliff Porter: **Sometimes it is said we have no secrets. Nothing could be further from the truth. We'll learn some of their secrets next. In Dan Brown's \"The Lost Symbol,\" the hero Robert Langdon races through Washington, D.C., trying to unravel a secret Masonic message. He's forced to do it, by Mal'akh. He threatens to kill a man who's both a dear friend of Langdon's, and a thirty-third degree Freemason. Mal'akh also uses blackmail with evidence that some of Washington's most powerful men engage in Masonic rituals so bizarre, revealing them would bring down the government. Could the rituals of freemasonry be that shocking? You decide. **Cliff Porter: **Masonry is a transformative art. It can be extraordinary in a man's life. It's speculative and alchemical and all those things. Cliff Porter is senior warden of \"enlightenment lodge 198\" in Colorado. Brothers here say they are seeking eternal truths, learning ancient mysteries. **Cliff Porter: **What I take offense to is the fact that sometimes it is said we have no secrets, or that what can be known about us can be Googled. Nothing could be further from the truth. Somewhat reluctantly, they opened a few of their doors to our cameras. They practice alchemy here, the ancient art that sought to turn lead into gold. You might think of alchemy as pseudo-science. But it's also been used through the centuries as a metaphor of personal transformation. **Tim**: This process of removing impurities to elevate it something greater, and more special, and more potent is very much what we also do within Freemasonry. Take good men, and make them grow into something more special. **Initiates go through a ritual that's meant to be intense and startling. First, the subject's vision is taken away with a \"hoodwink\" placed over his head. Then a master Mason - dressed as the grim reaper - issues a warning.** **\"If you persevere you will be purified, you will overcome darkness, you will be enlightened. But if your soul is fearful, do not proceed.\"** *The disturbing part of this that gets little mention is that initiates swear to never reveal any of the secrets of the Masons on penalty of death.

Shawn Beyer joined the Freemasons recently and went through the initiation. Those who elect to continue are led into a place the masons would not let us show you ... a \"chamber of reflection.\" **Shawn Beyer:** You go into the chamber of reflection, and you remove the hoodwink. And you're presented with what is a very interesting image. And Dan Brown described it pretty well in his book. As Brown describes it, the chamber includes a human skull and bones, elements used in alchemy, and a pen and paper where the initiate can write a last will and testament. **Shawn Beyer:** The symbols are meant to help you think about the fact that your life isn't gonna go on forever. And frankly, it causes a very profound experience. In one of the most striking scenes in \"The Lost Symbol,\" Robert Langdon discovers a Masonic chamber of reflection at the center of American power. **Matt Lauer**: You described it as being located in the bowels of the Capitol. Did it exist? **Dan Brown**: No, these - chambers of reflection can exist anywhere. **Matt Lauer**: Right. **Dan Brown**: Many Masonic lodges have them. There are Masons who have them in their homes. This kind of macabre symbolism has driven conspiracy theorists through the centuries to think the Freemasons practice some kind of black magic. Brown says Masonic rituals are no stranger than some other, more familiar ones. **Dan Brown**: **If a Catholic church, for example, pulled the shades and you heard through the grapevine that people were kneeling under a crucifix, an instrument of torture and consuming blood and flesh, ritualistically - you might say, \"What a terrible organization.\" ** *Yes, the major difference here being that the Masons and other secret societies shroud their rituals in secrecy, while the Catholic church does them in the open. * The Masons in Colorado say they embrace their symbolism and mysticism.

They raise money for charity locally and nationally. They do continue to use occult and esoteric symbols. But to a very great extent these things are museum pieces in Freemasonry today. You've probably seen the Shriners - an offshoot of the Masons - riding go-karts and raising money for charity. Freemasons even had the honor of being satirized on \"The Simpsons.\" **Grand Master to Homer**: Welcome to the club number 9-0-8. Now let's all get drunk and play ping-pong! **The Masons have also lost some clout since George Washington's day. The last master Mason to serve as president was Gerald Ford. But Brown says whether they know it or not, the Freemasons' secret rituals still connect them to a rich, powerful, mystical tradition.** **Dan Brown**: I intended this book as a reverential look at their philosophy. **Matt Lauer: **And isn't there possibly another side of the coin here, in this day, where it's become a little more humdrum with the bake sales and the charitable drives, you've created a little more mystery. You've given some of their mystery back to them. And they might like that. **Dan Brown**: I hope so. As with any organization, there are some who understand the core and some who are on the periphery. I'm hoping it starts to pull people in the direction of the ancient mysteries. The ancient mysteries. They're the key to the plot of The Lost Symbol. But are they the key to much more? **Dan Brown**: All of these texts from all of these different authors tend in a same direction. This idea of the power of the human mind and the ability of thought to actually transform the world in which we live. The villain of the lost symbol, Mal'akh, is a giant who has covered himself with tattoos he thinks will give him mystical powers: a double-headed phoenix, the pillars from the temple of Solomon, a snake consuming itself. You might think the symbols came from from Mal'akh's twisted mind. They came instead from a mysterious book called \"[The Secret Teachings Of All Ages](http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Teachings-Ages-Readers-Edition/dp/1585422509/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1351882104&sr=8-2&keywords=Secret+Teachings+For+All+Ages+-+Manly+Hall),\" a favorite of Mal'akh's creator, Dan Brown. **Dan Brown: **And that really is a core", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons-m.txt:13:1325782ccf75", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14304, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons-m.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons-m", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "which we live.

Hall who founded the Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles. It carries on his work, studying the wisdom of the ancients. Its director is Obadiah Harris: **Obadiah Harris: **The ancient mysteries are about the divination of man, how it is that you can become more fully human and achieve a level of consciousness beyond the reasoning mind. Mal'akh believes the Freemasons have guarded the ancient mysteries for centuries. He forces Robert Langdon to race through Washington, trying to decode messages the masons engraved on a stone pyramid, messages Mal'akh is convinced will lead him to the lost symbol of the ancient mysteries - and to unspeakable power. **Matt Lauer: **And you draw a pretty straight line from the ancient mysteries to the Freemasons and to another subject that we haven't quite discussed yet. Is it an imaginary line or is it a real line? **Dan Brown**: No, it's absolutely a real line. **The ancient mysteries deal in the concept of the power of the human mind. The Masons celebrate mankind and the power of the human mind. In fact in the second degree ritual there's actually a line where they say, \"Here you will learn the mysteries of human science.\" ** There's a form of \"human science\" that Mal'akh wants to hijack for his own ends. It sounds like fiction... But it's not. **Dan Brown**: [**Noetic science**](http://noetic.org/about/what-are-noetic-sciences/)** really is the reason this book took me so long to write.** I've said before I'm a skeptic. And I hear about these experiments that are being done that categorically and scientifically prove that the human mind has power over matter. **Matt Lauer: **The physical world? **Dan Brown**: Power over the physical world. The term \"Noetic\" derives from the Greek word for \"mind.\" **Noetic scientists study whether age old ideas like faith healing - [ESP](https://www.WantToKnow.info/c/f-cia-studied-esp-psychic-abilities), mind over matter - actually have a scientific basis.** In Dan Brown's novel, there's a secret lab at the Smithsonian doing cutting-edge research to prove the human mind has such power.

Its director is Marilyn Schlitz. **Marilyn Schlitz: **I would say Noetic is equivalent to intuition, that sense of feeling that isn't rational. \"I just had a gut feeling about something.\" The science part of it is really bringing that lens of discernment, of rigor, of critical thinking to what is a non-rational process. Schlitz showed us an experiment in which one subject, using her thoughts alone, tries to alter the vital signs of a second subject in a sealed room. Another experiment seeks to determine if people, again, through thought alone, can affect the formation of ice crystals. A third experiment involves machines called random event generators - which Noetics researchers have placed on almost every continent. **Marilyn Schlitz: **They are essentially electronic coin flippers. So if you imagine flipping a coin 100 times, you would expect, based on a normal probability distribution, that you'd get an equal number of heads and tails. In some experiments, she says, human thought alone has affected these machines, changing the ratio of heads to tails. *The [Institute of Noetic Sciences](http://noetic.org/) (IONS) is a cutting-edge research institute exploring the intersection between science and consciousness.

My fear is that we start to learn how to use our minds and that our innate dark sides will use it for evil. ** Which, of course, is exactly Mal'akh's goal, one he's willing to kidnap, torture, and kill for. **Matt Lauer: **And what you've set up in the book is the people who think about, \"Boy, we can change the world in a positive way.\" Your villain in this book, Mal'akh, says, \"Wait a minute. I don't want that renaissance.\" **Dan Brown**: Right. **Matt Lauer: **I want this to be a source of evil. **Dan Brown**: Mal'akh is the reminder that with knowledge comes responsibility.

The Capitol Rotunda - where the fictional Langdon makes a gruesome discovery has a real-life secret, stumps of iron in the floor that used to be part of a railing. In the 1820's, there was a hole in the floor - leading down to a lower level, the \"Capitol Crypt.\" **Matt Lauer: **You also found this labyrinth of rooms in the basement areas and sub-basement of the capital? **Dan Brown**: Right. The under stories of the U.S. Capitol are filled with these tiny rooms. The blueprint of the Capitol building is an astonishing document. It - it looks like - it looks like a - right out of a labyrinth of ancient Greece. Langdon flees through that labyrinth and emerges across the street, in the Library Of Congress, which has its own treasures - hidden in plain sight. **Dan Brown**: You've got this astonishing staircase with an anachronistic sort of feature one of these [little cherubs](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2007684264/), these [putti](http://myloc.gov/ExhibitSpaces/GreatHall/GreatHallNorthSide/PuttiUpperNorthStair/Pages/default.aspx).

Over here, you've got an entomologist. He's catching butterflies. With this bizarre fusion of these little religious figures with with scientific concepts. And, of course - we had to check out the main reading room, where Brown's hero narrowly escapes his pursuers by riding a conveyor belt meant for books. **Dan Brown**: It's my favorite room in all of D.C. **Matt Lauer: **Is it really? **Dan Brown**: Without a doubt. It's been called the most beautiful room in the world. It's an octagon lit in eight different directions so there are no shadows, no shadows anywhere. The room - room really seems to - to radiate. Langdon needs a place to hide out - a sanctuary - but to get there he has to solve a riddle: \"A refuge containing ten stones from Mount Sinai, one from heaven itself, and one with the visage of Luke's dark father.\" The answer really does reside at the National Cathedral...

There's an enormous series of labs that will study everything from fleas to - the baleen from whales. One of \"The Lost Symbol's\" greatest puzzles is also the last stop on Dan Brown's mystery tour. **Matt Lauer: **At the CIA, there is a sculpture that I don't think a lot of people know. **Dan Brown**: There is a - an American sculptor, James Sanborn, and he has created a sculpture that - fascinates me and - and a lot of cryptologists that has - an enormous series of letters on them that appear random but are actually - a code. **Matt Lauer: **And - and who knows the meaning of that code? **Dan Brown**: Only W.W. **Matt Lauer: **That's it? **Dan Brown**: That's it. W.W. is William Webster, the director of the CIA in 1990, when \"Kryptos\" was installed. Brown says Webster was given the key to the sculpture's secret messages, but he's never revealed it.

And did you set out to write that ending or did that just happen? **Dan Brown**: In some ways it just happened. **This amount of research and intellectual growth that went into writing this novel really led to that rather hopeful ending.** And thank you for seeing that it is a call to action. You see, the whole headlong chase through Washington, the secrets of the Freemasons, the ancient mysteries, Noetic science. **For Dan Brown, it all adds up to a series of important questions: How well do we know our history? How well do we understand our beliefs? How well do we grasp the powers of our own minds?** **Matt Lauer: Last word of the book is one that will surprise people.** **Dan Brown**: Yes. **Matt Lauer: **It is? **Dan Brown**: **Hope.** **Matt Lauer: **Hope.

Yet in the end, Brown paints a rather simplistic picture of the Masons. He portrays them as spiritual seekers in search of higher truths and greater achievements for all humanity.

In Europe of the middle ages and beyond, the Catholic Church ruled with an iron fist. **Galileo was [placed under house arrest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair) till the day he died for claiming the Earth revolved around the sun.** **In those oppressive times, secret societies served a vital function, as they were one of the very few ways to preserve and foster knowledge suppressed by the church.** Yet whenever there is secrecy, the potential for corruption and manipulation increases dramatically. In this modern era of the Internet and easy access to knowledge, does the secrecy of the Masons and other secret societies play a useful role in our world? Is there a good purpose today for the most rich and powerful people in the world to meet behind closed doors without any public scrutiny? The engaging NBC article below discusses key, little-known facts about the Masons and Freemasonry based on Dan Brown's blockbuster [*The Lost Symbol*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lost-Symbol-Dan-Brown/dp/0307950689/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1351877230&sr=8-1&keywords=lost+symbol+dan+brown). Brown's novel paints the Masons in a very positive light, yet it also reveals their immense power. **Why is it that so few people know about the Masonic origins of the U.S. and the incredible number of members of the global elite who belong to the Freemasons society and other secretive groups even now.** Key statements are highlighted in bold for those who prefer to skim.

Inside, strange symbols, ancient inscriptions, and mystical numbers lead to a room shaped like a pyramid, with an eye that points toward the heavens, and in the center of the floor, a massive altar. **Some of the most powerful men in the country gather here to enact an ancient, secret ritual, drinking wine meant to represent blood from a human skull, and all of it happening just a mile from the U.S. Capitol.** It sounds like a work of fiction, and it does come from one - the opening scene of Dan Brown's best-selling novel, \"The Lost Symbol.\" But Brown makes a remarkable claim: that the ritual is real, part of the history of the secretive brotherhood called the Freemasons. *Skull and Bones, the infamous Yale secret society, uses similar secret symbols operating out of a foreboding building called the \"Tomb.\" George W. Bush, his father, his grandfather, and John Kerry are just a few of their [prominent members](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Skull_and_Bones_members). For a short CNN video clip showing the \"Tomb,\" a peek at their rituals, and more, [click here](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/skull_and_bones_video_cnn).* **Matt Lauer: **And when they found out that Dan Brown was going to be dealing with Freemasonry in this book, what was their reaction? **Dan Brown: **Well, I think they were nervous that I might focus on what some would call the macabre sides of Freemasonry. Perhaps with good reason. Brown has a history of prying open doors, revealing dark secrets - or at least seeming to. The central premise of his 2003 novel, \"The Da Vinci Code,\" was an earth-shaking secret that Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had children whose descendants live among us. The book infuriated some Christians. It also sold 80 million copies worldwide, became a blockbuster film, and made Dan Brown a household name. Now, \"The Lost Symbol\" brings the same kind of high-profile scrutiny to the Freemasons, the Founding Fathers, and our nation's Capitol. \"The Da Vinci Code\" comes to Washington.

But I'd like them to at least think about it. The book is a thriller, a headlong chase through some of Washington's most famous landmarks, and also through puzzles, secret codes, and dark corners of history, starting with the secretive group at the center of \"The Lost Symbol\": the Freemasons, a worldwide brotherhood that's centuries old, and still active. **George Washington was a Mason, along with 13 other presidents and numerous Supreme Court Justices. Benjamin Franklin published a book about Freemasonry on his own printing press. Nine signers of the Declaration of Independence were Freemasons, including the man with the biggest signature: John Hancock.** *The secrecy of the Masons is what allowed prominent disgruntled colonists to gather, to conspire against British tyranny, and eventually to establish the new and independent country of the United States. Yet few history books touch on this important piece of American history. At the time of independence in 1776, Masons were highly respected. Yet as they became more powerful after the revolution, they also became more corrupt. By the late 1820s an anti-masonic movement swept the nation and decimated Masonic membership, though interest returned by the 1850s. **For more, [click here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Masonic_Party) and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20120312232813/http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masons/Essays/anti-Masonic.html).* Freemasonry still has millions of members worldwide, and they still conduct rituals like this one performed for our cameras: **Grim Reaper (enacting Masonic ritual)**: If curiosity spurred you towards us, go away.

A lot of that the result of the fact that you had powerful men, in this case, meeting behind closed doors and not discussing what they were doing.** **Dan Brown: **Of course. I mean, any time you have powerful people who aren't telling you what they're doing - you're going to assume the worst. *In times of great oppression like that of medieval Europe and the pre-revolutionary American colonies, secrecy was a vital means of sharing banned information and planning to bring positive change to the world. Yet particularly in more peaceful times, that same secrecy can and has been used to forward agendas which support the privileged few. Very few people know about the [Bilderberg Group](https://www.WantToKnow.info/051115secretsocietiesbilderberg), [Davos](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-davos-wealth-power-a-sprinkling-stardust), and [other secretive gatherings](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) of the global elite. Why is there so little media coverage of these powerful conclaves when their influential members are daily fodder for the tabloids?* In Brown's book, the Freemasons are infiltrated by a man who believes they hold a great secret to mystical power. He's a larger than life villain named \"Mal'akh\" whose entire body is covered with tattoos of occult symbols. **Dan Brown: **And there is an animal quality about him. He has feather tattoos on his legs. He's got giant double-headed phoenix on his chest. **Matt Lauer: **He saves one square inch of his flesh for something that he is coveting. What is that? **Dan Brown: **That is the lost word. The last piece of the puzzle. This word that at least in his twisted mind will be the - the *coup d'etat*. The cherry on top of the sundae that will be his transformation. That will give him power.

The man who must prevent all that from happening is, of course, Harvard professor Robert Langdon, the hero of \"The Da Vinci Code,\" played by Tom Hanks in the movies. Langdon must find the lost symbol before Mal'akh does in order to save an old friend - and possibly the world - from Mal'akh's evil scheme. We'll hear from Dan Brown about the mysteries of freemasonry, and from the Freemasons themselves about the secrets they've kept for centuries. We'll take a tour of Washington, D.C. unlike any you've taken before, uncovering secret places with Dan Brown as our guide. And we'll go to the fringes of science and the depths of prehistory in search of what Brown calls the true meaning of his latest book - and why, he says, it actually changed his beliefs. **Dan Brown: I spent a lot of time researching and really had to get to the point where I realized, \"You know what? The world's a stranger place then we thought.\" ** *Brown does his research well in both \"The Da Vinci Code\" and \"The Lost Symbol.\" In both books, I checked many of the facts he stated, especially the most surprising and controversial claims. Invariably, I was able to find reliable sources supporting his claims. * \"The Lost Symbol\" starts with a gruesome discovery. Dan Brown's hero, Robert Langdon, is lured to Washington, D.C. to the U.S. Capitol, where, at the center of the rotunda, he finds a severed hand, tattooed to resemble an ancient mystical symbol: the hand of the mysteries. It beckons him on a dangerous journey. The hand belongs to an old friend of Langdon's who's been kidnapped by the villain, Mal'akh: a man named Peter Solomon. Solomon runs the Smithsonian Institution. But he's also a thirty-third degree Freemason of the Scottish rite. This is the headquarters of the Scottish Rite Freemasons in Washington, D.C. They call it the house of the temple, and it's where we talked with Dan Brown, who wove the secrets of the Masons into the taut rope of his story. **Matt Lauer**: **One character is being elevated to the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite. It's a rather intense ritual. He drinks wine, which is to represent blood out of a skull.** How much of that is fact and how much of that is fiction? **Dan Brown: **Well, this is a real ceremony. **The ceremony is described accurately.** The fiction comes in as to whether or not it", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons.txt:4:6114ff160b67", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14317, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "the secrets of the Masons into the taut rope of his story. **Matt Lauer**: **One character is being elevated to the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite.

Brown's villain, Mal'akh, is the man drinking the wine. He's journeyed deep into Freemasonry to find out its secrets - and so will we. Mal'akh is fiction, but how much of the ritual is real? **Arturo de Hoyos: **Dan Brown's book is very exciting. And like any good work of fiction, it has to involve both truth and error to make it believable. Arturo de Hoyos is the grand archivist and grand historian of the supreme council of the Scottish rite and himself a 33rd-degree Mason. **Arturo de Hoyos: **One of the things that's wrong is on the very first page. We don't perform the 33rd Degree in this building. We don't confer it at night. The candidates to the members are dressed wrong. And the ceremony's wrong. Maybe they don't do the ceremony in this building, but there's evidence Freemasons have done it. Brown can quote multiple historical sources. What is the truth? To find out, we have to delve into the distant past. **Mitch Horowitz: **Masonry in many respects is a historic mystery. Mitch Horowitz is the author of the new book, \"[Occult America](http://www.amazon.com/Occult-America-Secret-History-Mysticism/dp/B005CDUP2I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1351904863&sr=8-1&keywords=occult+america+mitch+horowitz).\" He's a scholar of esoteric religions and secret societies. **Mitch Horowitz: Masons themselves cannot agree on the nature of their own origins and background. **Masonry may be the only modern organization for which that's true. The origins of the Freemasons are shrouded in mystery. Art de Hoyos outlines the simplest theory: **Arturo de Hoyos: **Freemasonry developed primarily in medieval Scotland and England with the Stonemasons' guilds and societies. In other words, the first Masons were literally that: stonecutters, the men who built the great cathedrals of Europe, and who wanted to guard their trade secrets. **Arturo de Hoyos: **So they developed a system of secret signs and secret passwords. De Hoyos says the tradesmen started another system associated with Freemasonry - the so-called \"three degrees:\" apprentice, fellow of the craft, and master mason, still used in Freemasonry today. So is the symbol of a square and compass, mason's tools with the letter \"g\", signifying both \"geometry\" and \"God.\" At meetings masons wear elaborately decorated aprons, symbolic representations of the ones worn by working stonemasons.

In fact, some Masons say the group originated in the holy land, in biblical times, with the builders of Solomon's temple. Many Masonic symbols are even older than that. **Mitch Horowitz: The all seeing eye, the pyramid, the obelisk. It drew very deeply upon the symbols of pre-Christian religion because it believed that it was part of a chain of a spiritual search for truth that was older than any modern or contemporary religion.** *The Masons are often linked to other secret societies claiming ancient heritage like the Knights Templar and the [Rosicrucians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism). The [Knights Templar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar), reputed to be some of the fiercest warriors of the time, were officially endorsed by the Catholic Church in the early 12th century. Yet they became so powerful (and among the [world's first bankers](https://web.archive.org/web/20090114200445/https://time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1674980,00.html)) that by the early 14th century the church was largely successful in destroying the order. *Some believe the superstition around [Friday the 13th](https://web.archive.org/web/20100213215429/http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masonry/Essays/friday13.html) came from a secret edict issued by the King of France on Friday the 13th of October in 1307 to arrest all members of the order. In the novel, Mal'akh believes the masons know mystical secrets that will make him an all powerful demon. He infiltrates the group, kidnaps its leader, and uses blackmail to try to get what he wants. That's fiction. But in fact, **their freethinking about religion once caused the Vatican to denounce the masons as Satanic. And in the 1800's Masons in upstate New York were accused of murdering a man named William Morgan, who threatened to expose their secret rituals.** Today the web is full of anti-Masonic material. **Arturo de Hoyos: **I frequently run into people who have heard of a couple of things about Freemasonry and no more. We killed William Morgan and we worship the devil, and that's about all they've heard of us. Those people might be surprised to hear this: **Arturo de Hoyos: **The father of our country was a Freemason. There's no question of this.

And as Dan Brown's hero, Robert Langdon, races Mal'akh through Washington, D.C. to find the secrets of Freemasonry, he reveals little-known facts about the founding fathers that might shock some readers. **Dan Brown: **There was a statue that sat in the Capitol. It was [George Washington as a god](https://web.archive.org/web/20090327075709/http://www.smithsonianlegacies.si.edu/objectdescription.cfm?ID=66). Hidden away on the lower level of the Masonic house of the temple, in Washington, D.C., there's a remarkable painting not many people have seen. George Washington, the first president of the United States, wears the decorated apron of Freemasonry. Nearby are the square and the compass, traditional symbols of Freemasonry. The painting is described in Dan Brown's best-selling novel \"The Lost Symbol.\" **Dan Brown: **It's a [cornerstone laying ritual](https://web.archive.org/web/20150330095407/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/George_Washington_Lays_Capitol_Cornerstone.htm). And essentially, a date is chosen - that is auspicious from an astrological standpoint. And there will be certain blessings that are given when this cornerstone is laid. And the idea is that whatever is to take place in that building will have a solid and auspicious beginning. And what building is George Washington, Freemason, laying the cornerstone for? The United States Capitol. **Matt Lauer: And it's not just the Capitol. Those ceremonies, those rituals were used in the building of the Washington Monument and the White House.** **Dan Brown: **They were. As well as many, many other buildings. *Masonic symbolism is rife in the great monuments and buildings of Washington, DC. Yet not only is this kept hidden from the public, many history books even fail to mention anything about the powerful influence of the Masons throughout the early years of the republic. Brown does a very good job of exposing all of this in his book.* *For a revealing History Channel documentary which give rare excellent coverage of this, [click here](https://www.google.com/search?num=40&hl=en&newwindow=1&safe=off&tbm=vid&q=Secret+History+of+the+Freemasons). * The lore of Freemasonry marks Washington in other hidden ways as well. Consider, for example, the number 33, cherished by the Masons. **Dan Brown: **Thirty-three is a very important number - in ancient mysticism. There's a reason that Jesus Christ was said to be 33. There is a reason that there are 33 vertebrae in our spine and that much of Freemasonry has to do with the concept of the body as a temple.

That's right. The capstone matches that mystical number. Brown says the Freemasons influenced the founding of America in profound ways, and what he has to say may change what you think about how this country came to be. **Dan Brown: **If you have a group of men who are Masons and simultaneously founding fathers and part of their Masonic ideal is that all men are equal, of course that will be an underlying theme in the founding of a country. **Another important aspect of Freemasonry is this idea of freedom of religion. **We talked about these books on the altar. **Matt Lauer: **It's inclusive. It's not exclusive? **Dan Brown: **Exactly. That couldn't have said it better. *Here Brown reveals his pro-Masonic bias. The Masons are far from inclusive. Like the vast majority of secret societies, the Masons do no accept women. And though a few African-Americans were granted membership at the time of the revolution, widespread racism and segregation made it nearly impossible for them to join many mainstream lodges. As recently as 2009, the admission of an African-American to a Masonic lodge in Georgia generated much controversy as reveal in [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/us/03masons.html)*[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/us/03masons.html)*[article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/us/03masons.html). * **Freemasons assumed members believed in a supreme being. But that's as far as it went. Masons could worship Yahweh, Jesus, Allah - or another god of their own choosing. Religious freedom was built into freemasonry. And, many scholars say the Freemasons built it into the U.S. Constitution. One-third of the signers were known to be Freemasons.** Brown says his research led him to a conclusion that might shock some people. **Dan Brown: **America wasn't founded a Christian country.

The Founding Fathers, Brown says, didn't just read The Bible. They also read Roman and Egyptian mythology. And they read the stars. *It's important to distinguish between the Masons involved in founding the US and those who came later. The founding fathers were not traditional Christians, but rather deists, as even many history texts acknowledge. They were highly focused on morals and values. Yet as the Masons power grew in the decades after independence, morals took a back seat as power and corruption moved to the fore. Considering that nearly 1/3 of U.S. presidents were Masons, shouldn't this be getting more attention? And then find out how many were members of [Skull and Bones](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-bonesmen-president), the [CFR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations), and other secretive groups.* **Matt Lauer: **This reliance on astrology, what does it tell you? What does it suggest about our founding fathers? **Dan Brown: **I think that they had a respect for what they did not understand, a respect for the heavens. The foundations of astrology really have a deep, mystical and spiritual underpinning that that the Masons were very in tune with. **Matt Lauer: **it would be hard to imagine Barack Obama, taking a trip or or doing the groundbreaking on a major monument or something and using astrology as a basis for the time and the place, he'd be ridiculed. **Dan Brown: **And rightly so, I believe. **Matt Lauer: **But why was it okay then and is it not okay now? **Dan Brown: **Well, for the same reason it was okay to believe that - if you threw a virgin into the ocean, a storm wouldn't hit you. **Matt Lauer: **That's", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons.txt:9:a2bbf4f6312f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14322, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "taking a trip or or doing the groundbreaking on a major monument or something and using astrology as a basis for the time and the place, he'd be ridiculed. **Dan Brown: **And rightly so, I believe. **Matt Lauer: **But why was it okay then and is it not okay now? **Dan Brown: **Well, for the same reason it was okay to believe that - if you threw a virgin into the ocean, a storm wouldn't hit you. **Matt Lauer: **That's not okay now? (*laughter*) **Dan Brown: **So that's not okay, either? (*laughter*) You know, science progresses. In \"The Lost Symbol,\" Mal'akh thinks that by learning the secrets of the Freemasons, he can become something like a god. You might be surprised to learn the founders had a similar idea. **Matt Lauer: **There is a painting in the Capitol-- **Dan Brown: **Yes. **Matt Lauer: ** Tell me about it. **Dan Brown: **Well it's a painting that I was shocked to find was there. I said, **\"There is a painting called the [Apotheosis of Washington](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apotheosis_of_Washington),\" apotheosis meaning, \"The god-making of Washington.\"** **Matt Lauer: **George Washington becoming a god. **Dan Brown: **It seemed almost irreverential. It was like, \"How can a man become a god?\" And you start looking at this painting and you realize just how strange it is. But it really, to my eye, and to other historians' eye, catches this concept of the power of man. *The Apotheosis of Washington is actually the huge fresco painted on the inside of the main dome of the U.S. Capitol Building. You can view it at [this link.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apotheosis_of_Washington) The tendency to make the first president into a god shows how easily people can get twisted by power. * **Matt Lauer: **Again, can you imagine anyone putting forth that notion of politicians as gods? **Dan Brown: **Right. **Matt Lauer: **Here we are in the 21st century - you'd be run out of town. **Dan Brown: **You'd be run out of town. There was a statue of George Washington that sat in the Capitol. He was unclothed - he had a model of a statue of Zeus. It was George Washington as a god. **Matt Lauer: **Right. **Dan Brown: **And that did get run out of the Capitol building. **When they thought of becoming godlike, the founders were probably thinking about perfecting their minds through science and learning.** In Brown's novel, however, the villain Mal'akh believes something much more profound and potentially sinister: that the Freemasons, from ancient times, through the time of George Washington to the present day, guarded secrets that could transform matter, transform a person, unleash incredible psychic and spiritual power. Most modern-day Masons say the brotherhood is not nearly so mysterious. **Arturo de Hoyos: **There is no deep, dark, intimate and ultimate secret of Freemasonry which will transform the world in the way that \"The Lost Symbol\" portrays.

It would be exciting if it were true, but such is not the case. That's what most Freemasons say, but not all. **Cliff Porter: **Sometimes it is said we have no secrets. Nothing could be further from the truth. We'll learn some of their secrets next. In Dan Brown's \"The Lost Symbol,\" the hero Robert Langdon races through Washington, D.C., trying to unravel a secret Masonic message. He's forced to do it, by Mal'akh. He threatens to kill a man who's both a dear friend of Langdon's, and a thirty-third degree Freemason. Mal'akh also uses blackmail with evidence that some of Washington's most powerful men engage in Masonic rituals so bizarre, revealing them would bring down the government. Could the rituals of freemasonry be that shocking? You decide. **Cliff Porter: **Masonry is a transformative art. It can be extraordinary in a man's life. It's speculative and alchemical and all those things. Cliff Porter is senior warden of \"enlightenment lodge 198\" in Colorado. Brothers here say they are seeking eternal truths, learning ancient mysteries. **Cliff Porter: **What I take offense to is the fact that sometimes it is said we have no secrets, or that what can be known about us can be Googled. Nothing could be further from the truth. Somewhat reluctantly, they opened a few of their doors to our cameras. They practice alchemy here, the ancient art that sought to turn lead into gold. You might think of alchemy as pseudo-science. But it's also been used through the centuries as a metaphor of personal transformation. **Tim**: This process of removing impurities to elevate it something greater, and more special, and more potent is very much what we also do within Freemasonry. Take good men, and make them grow into something more special. **Initiates go through a ritual that's meant to be intense and startling. First, the subject's vision is taken away with a \"hoodwink\" placed over his head. Then a master Mason - dressed as the grim reaper - issues a warning.** **\"If you persevere you will be purified, you will overcome darkness, you will be enlightened. But if your soul is fearful, do not proceed.\"** *The disturbing part of this that gets little mention is that initiates swear to never reveal any of the secrets of the Masons on penalty of death.

The ABC News article at [this link](http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1859087) states \"the penalty for revealing Freemason secrets is supposed to be gory death.\" Early anti-Masonic fervor was initially sparked by the presumed murder of [William Morgan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morgan_%28anti-Mason%29) when he was about to publish a book revealing Masonic secrets.* **Shawn Beyer, Freemason**: If you're not comfortable with what's going on, if you're nervous, if you think maybe you have approached the craft for the wrong reasons, you're given a chance to say I'm no longer okay with this. Shawn Beyer joined the Freemasons recently and went through the initiation. Those who elect to continue are led into a place the masons would not let us show you ... a \"chamber of reflection.\" **Shawn Beyer:** You go into the chamber of reflection, and you remove the hoodwink. And you're presented with what is a very interesting image. And Dan Brown described it pretty well in his book. As Brown describes it, the chamber includes a human skull and bones, elements used in alchemy, and a pen and paper where the initiate can write a last will and testament. **Shawn Beyer:** The symbols are meant to help you think about the fact that your life isn't gonna go on forever. And frankly, it causes a very profound experience. In one of the most striking scenes in \"The Lost Symbol,\" Robert Langdon discovers a Masonic chamber of reflection at the center of American power. **Matt Lauer**: You described it as being located in the bowels of the Capitol. Did it exist? **Dan Brown**: No, these - chambers of reflection can exist anywhere. **Matt Lauer**: Right. **Dan Brown**: Many Masonic lodges have them. There are Masons who have them in their homes. This kind of macabre symbolism has driven conspiracy theorists through the centuries to think the Freemasons practice some kind of black magic. Brown says Masonic rituals are no stranger than some other, more familiar ones. **Dan Brown**: **If a Catholic church, for example, pulled the shades and you heard through the grapevine that people were kneeling under a crucifix, an instrument of torture and consuming blood and flesh, ritualistically - you might say, \"What a terrible organization.\" ** *Yes, the major difference here being that the Masons and other secret societies shroud their rituals in secrecy, while the Catholic church does them in the open. * The Masons in Colorado say they embrace their symbolism and mysticism. But in many lodges across the country, the scene is a little different. **Mitch Horowitz: **I often tell", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons.txt:12:a99172ac764a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14325, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "kneeling under a crucifix, an instrument of torture and consuming blood and flesh, ritualistically - you might say, \"What a terrible organization.\" ** *Yes, the major difference here being that the Masons and other secret societies shroud their rituals in secrecy, while the Catholic church does them in the open. * The Masons in Colorado say they embrace their symbolism and mysticism.

Mitch Horowitz, author of the book \"Occult America,\" says most Freemasons are far from mystical. **Mitch Horowitz: **They run a wonderful network of free children's hospitals around the nation. They raise money for charity locally and nationally. They do continue to use occult and esoteric symbols. But to a very great extent these things are museum pieces in Freemasonry today. You've probably seen the Shriners - an offshoot of the Masons - riding go-karts and raising money for charity. Freemasons even had the honor of being satirized on \"The Simpsons.\" **Grand Master to Homer**: Welcome to the club number 9-0-8. Now let's all get drunk and play ping-pong! **The Masons have also lost some clout since George Washington's day. The last master Mason to serve as president was Gerald Ford. But Brown says whether they know it or not, the Freemasons' secret rituals still connect them to a rich, powerful, mystical tradition.** **Dan Brown**: I intended this book as a reverential look at their philosophy. **Matt Lauer: **And isn't there possibly another side of the coin here, in this day, where it's become a little more humdrum with the bake sales and the charitable drives, you've created a little more mystery. You've given some of their mystery back to them. And they might like that. **Dan Brown**: I hope so. As with any organization, there are some who understand the core and some who are on the periphery. I'm hoping it starts to pull people in the direction of the ancient mysteries. The ancient mysteries. They're the key to the plot of The Lost Symbol. But are they the key to much more? **Dan Brown**: All of these texts from all of these different authors tend in a same direction. This idea of the power of the human mind and the ability of thought to actually transform the world in which we live. The villain of the lost symbol, Mal'akh, is a giant who has covered himself with tattoos he thinks will give him mystical powers: a double-headed phoenix, the pillars from the temple of Solomon, a snake consuming itself. You might think the symbols came from from Mal'akh's twisted mind. They came instead from a mysterious book called \"[The Secret Teachings Of All Ages](http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Teachings-Ages-Readers-Edition/dp/1585422509/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1351882104&sr=8-2&keywords=Secret+Teachings+For+All+Ages+-+Manly+Hall),\" a favorite of Mal'akh's creator, Dan Brown. **Dan", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons.txt:13:4eeb3692fb2f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14326, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__masons_secret_society_freemasons", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "thought to actually transform the world in which we live.

Hall who founded the Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles. It carries on his work, studying the wisdom of the ancients. Its director is Obadiah Harris: **Obadiah Harris: **The ancient mysteries are about the divination of man, how it is that you can become more fully human and achieve a level of consciousness beyond the reasoning mind. Mal'akh believes the Freemasons have guarded the ancient mysteries for centuries. He forces Robert Langdon to race through Washington, trying to decode messages the masons engraved on a stone pyramid, messages Mal'akh is convinced will lead him to the lost symbol of the ancient mysteries - and to unspeakable power. **Matt Lauer: **And you draw a pretty straight line from the ancient mysteries to the Freemasons and to another subject that we haven't quite discussed yet. Is it an imaginary line or is it a real line? **Dan Brown**: No, it's absolutely a real line. **The ancient mysteries deal in the concept of the power of the human mind. The Masons celebrate mankind and the power of the human mind. In fact in the second degree ritual there's actually a line where they say, \"Here you will learn the mysteries of human science.\" ** There's a form of \"human science\" that Mal'akh wants to hijack for his own ends. It sounds like fiction... But it's not. **Dan Brown**: [**Noetic science**](https://noetic.org/about/noetic-sciences/)** really is the reason this book took me so long to write.** I've said before I'm a skeptic. And I hear about these experiments that are being done that categorically and scientifically prove that the human mind has power over matter. **Matt Lauer: **The physical world? **Dan Brown**: Power over the physical world. The term \"Noetic\" derives from the Greek word for \"mind.\" **Noetic scientists study whether age old ideas like faith healing - [ESP](https://www.WantToKnow.info/c/f-cia-studied-esp-psychic-abilities), mind over matter - actually have a scientific basis.** In Dan Brown's novel, there's a secret lab at the Smithsonian doing cutting-edge research to prove the human mind has such power.

Schlitz showed us an experiment in which one subject, using her thoughts alone, tries to alter the vital signs of a second subject in a sealed room. Another experiment seeks to determine if people, again, through thought alone, can affect the formation of ice crystals. A third experiment involves machines called random event generators - which Noetics researchers have placed on almost every continent. **Marilyn Schlitz: **They are essentially electronic coin flippers. So if you imagine flipping a coin 100 times, you would expect, based on a normal probability distribution, that you'd get an equal number of heads and tails. In some experiments, she says, human thought alone has affected these machines, changing the ratio of heads to tails. *The [Institute of Noetic Sciences](http://noetic.org/) (IONS) is a cutting-edge research institute exploring the intersection between science and consciousness.

There's an enormous series of labs that will study everything from fleas to - the baleen from whales. One of \"The Lost Symbol's\" greatest puzzles is also the last stop on Dan Brown's mystery tour. **Matt Lauer: **At the CIA, there is a sculpture that I don't think a lot of people know. **Dan Brown**: There is a - an American sculptor, James Sanborn, and he has created a sculpture that - fascinates me and - and a lot of cryptologists that has - an enormous series of letters on them that appear random but are actually - a code. **Matt Lauer: **And - and who knows the meaning of that code? **Dan Brown**: Only W.W. **Matt Lauer: **That's it? **Dan Brown**: That's it. W.W. is William Webster, the director of the CIA in 1990, when \"Kryptos\" was installed. Brown says Webster was given the key to the sculpture's secret messages, but he's never revealed it. And not one of the CIA's army of cryptologists has cracked the entire code. **Matt Lauer: **It - it's obvious to anybody who's read your books that you love puzzles.

And did you set out to write that ending or did that just happen? **Dan Brown**: In some ways it just happened. **This amount of research and intellectual growth that went into writing this novel really led to that rather hopeful ending.** And thank you for seeing that it is a call to action. You see, the whole headlong chase through Washington, the secrets of the Freemasons, the ancient mysteries, Noetic science. **For Dan Brown, it all adds up to a series of important questions: How well do we know our history? How well do we understand our beliefs? How well do we grasp the powers of our own minds?** **Matt Lauer: Last word of the book is one that will surprise people.** **Dan Brown**: Yes. **Matt Lauer: **It is? **Dan Brown**: **Hope.** **Matt Lauer: **Hope. And it means what? **Dan Brown**: In the context of this book the last word means that we can do better and that we will do better.

Yet few are aware just how small and cohesive this group is. They are, in fact, akin to a ruling class which, by controlling what is debated by the public and what is not, are able to forward a well hidden, very undemocratic agenda. Below is a compilation of key excerpts on this ruling class from a highly revealing essay titled \"[US Electromagnetic Weapons and Human Rights](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/electromagnetic-weapons-human-rights).\" This scholarly essay with many useful footnotes deals not only with the dangers of electromagnetic weapons, it also reveals how the ruling class thinks. **This intriguing research reveals how the ruling class has been so successful in manipulating the topics of public debate to create polarization, while at the same time carefully suppressing discussion of their own tactics and highly successful agendas.** It will help you to better understand some of the craziness taking place in our world. Thanks for caring.

The American ruling class is complex and inter-competitive, maintaining itself through interacting families of high social standing with similar life styles, corporate affiliations, and memberships in elite social clubs and private schools.[[1]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/ruling-class#_ftn1)** This American ruling class is self-perpetuating,[[2]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/ruling-class#_ftn2) maintaining its influence through policy-making institutions such as the National Manufacturing Association, National Chamber of Commerce, Business Council, Business Roundtable, Conference Board, American Enterprise Institute, Council on Foreign Relations and other business-centered policy groups.[[3]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/ruling-class#_ftn3) C. Wright Mills, in his 1956 book *The Power Elite*, documents how World War II solidified a trinity of power in the US, comprised of corporate, military and government elites in a centralized power structure motivated by class interests and working in unison through \"higher circles\" of contact and agreement. Mills described how the power elite were those \"who decide whatever is decided\" of major consequence.[[4]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/ruling-class#_ftn4) With the advent of the military-industrial complex after World War II, President Eisenhower observed that an internal military industrial power faction was consolidating their long-term plans for the domination of America and, eventually, the world.

Eisenhower was in no position to fight these men, and history records his feelings on the subject with the text of his short farewell address: [The] conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence - economic, political, even spiritual - is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. **In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.** We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.\"[[5]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/ruling-class#_ftn5) We now understand that Eisenhower was referring to the conjunction of redirected tax monies to research secret new technology aimed at nothing less than increasing the controlling power of the military industrial elite to a global scale. **One particular faction of ambitious men, the former cold warriors and neo-conservatives, were close followers of philosopher Leo Strauss. **This elite group included not just generals and industrialists but philosophers, scientists, academics, and politicians who have now become the most powerful public-private war organization ever known. Strauss espoused an elitist philosophy that fawned over the characteristics of those who inherited wealth and lived lives of leisure to pursue whatever their interests may be. His ideas have been transformed into a cogent ideology in which the media, religion, and government are used to subdue the masses while those in the ruling class follow their own will without regard to the laws designed to control lesser men. **Strauss was likewise fond of secrecy, as a necessity for control, because if the lesser men found out what was being done to them they would no doubt be upset. ****\"The people will not be happy to learn that there is only one natural right - the right of the superior to rule over the inferior, the master over the slave, the husband over the wife, and the wise few over the vulgar many.\" In *On Tyranny*, Strauss refers to this natural right as the \"tyrannical teaching\" of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__ruling-class.txt:1:0952b80d4e65", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14335, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__ruling-class.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__ruling-class", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "necessity for control, because if the lesser men found out what was being done to them they would no doubt be upset. ****\"The people will not be happy to learn that there is only one natural right - the right of the superior to rule over the inferior, the master over the slave, the husband over the wife, and the wise few over the vulgar many.\" In *On Tyranny*, Strauss refers to this natural right as the \"tyrannical teaching\" of his beloved ancients.[[6]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/ruling-class#_ftn6)** Leo Strauss, Albert Wohlstetter, and others at the University of Chicago's Committee on Social Thought receive wide credit for promoting the neo-conservative agenda through their students, Paul Wolfowitz, Allan Bloom, and Bloom's student Richard Perle. The Canadian cultural review magazine *Adbusters* defines neo-conservatism as, \"The belief that Democracy, however flawed, was best defended by an ignorant public pumped on nationalism and religion. Only a militantly nationalist state could deter human aggression. Such nationalism requires an external threat, and if one cannot be found it must be manufactured.\"[[7]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/ruling-class#_ftn7) **There is ample evidence available to show that some individuals within government and industry have little problem with violating the public trust and using their positions to kill, maim, torture and destroy. It is of the utmost importance to our traditional American values of human rights and cognitive liberty that we recognize this threat from within. We must move to identify those in the ruling class who show these proclivities and ensure that their activities have adequate oversight.** Stanley Milgram's famous experiment involving obedience to authority proved that individuals are fairly easily cowed into submitting to anyone who has a claim of authority. On average 61 percent of people will administer pain to another person if instructed to do so.[[8]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/ruling-class#_ftn8) Test groups in these experiments rationalized their behavior by appealing to \"the greater good.\" Because it was for the \"advancement of science\" they were able to be convinced they should ignore personal judgment and obey the instructions given to them by the experimenters to inflict pain.[[9]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/ruling-class#_ftn9) Today the combination of political climate and technological capability presents a condition in which widespread manipulation of, not only the flow of information through the media, but also the manipulation of the emotional states and cognitive ability in large populations can be achieved. If policy elites in the ruling class are unaccountable to the public for their actions, and the public is emotionally manipulated to support them, we can assume that they will certainly abuse their positions in the pursuit of their hidden agendas. **[Psychological Warfare](https://www.wanttoknow.info/060123psyops), Information War, and [mind control](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mindcontrol) may seem to be exotic topics, but the impact of these technologies and techniques is profound.

The team determined that only 118 people comprise the membership on the boards of director of the ten big media giants. These 118 individuals in turn sit on the corporate boards of 288 national and international corporations. Four of the top 10 media corporations in the US even have Department of Defense contractors on their boards of directors.** Given an interlocked media network, big media in the US effectively represent the ruling elite. The media elite, a key component of the ruling class in the US, are the watchdogs of acceptable ideological messages, the controllers of news and information content, and the decision makers regarding media resources.[[12]](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/ruling-class#_ftn12) *\"They're not evil. These organizations consist of well-educated elitists who're self-absorbed perhaps, but not evil. They look at the world as a biological experience where the strong survive, the powerful thrive, and the secretive control. They are the ultimate control freaks not for the sake of adoration or ego-gratification, but because they genuinely believe they're the best at making policy decisions that effect the world's economy and security. They simply want to protect their life's agenda like anyone else would.\"* ~~ [Dr. Anderson](https://www.wingmakers.us/wingmakersorig/wingmakersinterviews/www.wingmakers.com/interview/iview2.shtml#5) ** Final Note: **For excellent, one-paragraph summaries revealing several key organizations of the ruling class in an astonishing way, see [this webpage](https://www.wanttoknow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles).

It was a name I'd never heard before, yet the imprint was so strong that I decided to do an Internet search. To my great surprise, it turned out Quigley was a revered professor who was considered a mentor by Bill Clinton and many other prominent figures. His specialty was secret societies and their influence on our world. He had been given privileged access to secret files of the power elite that few have ever seen. Quigley's scholarly research has inspired many who have delved into the hidden history of our world, including the authors of the incisive essay below on secret societies and the global elite, \"New World Order: The Founding Fathers.\" The authors base much of their research on the work of Prof. Quigley and provide dozens of footnotes to verify their story. **If you don't have a lot of time, read just the sections highlighted in bold below to at least get the big picture.

It has grown from that tiny select cabal into a monster that may already be beyond control.* \"One wintry afternoon in February 1891, three men were engaged in earnest conversation in London. From that conversation were to flow consequences of the greatest importance for the British Empire and to the world as a whole.\" So begins Professor Carroll Quigley's book *[The Anglo American Establishment](http://www.amazon.com/Anglo-American-Establishment-Quigley-Carroll/dp/0945001010/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431557112&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Anglo+American+Establishment). * It may read like a John Le Carre thriller, but this was no spy fiction. The three staunch British Imperialists who met in London that day, Cecil Rhodes, William Stead and Lord Esher, were soon joined by Lords Rothschild, Salisbury, Rosebery and Milner, men whose financial, political, and administrative powers set them apart. **Some of these names may not be familiar to you, but that is a mark of the absolute success of this group. From the outset they insisted on secrecy, operated in secret and ensured that their influence was airbrushed from history. They believed that white men of Anglo-Saxon descent rightly sat at the top of the racial hierarchy** and they fully understood the impending threat from a burgeoning Germany whose modern, expanding economy had begun to challenge British hegemony on the world stage. The above named elites drew up a plan for a secret society that aimed to renew the bond between Great Britain and the United States [1] and bring all habitable portions of the world under their influence and control. The U.S. had grown rapidly in self-esteem, wealth and opportunity since the declaration of independence in 1776, but Anglo-American connections remained strong and would embroil her in the long-term plan for one world government. **The meeting in 1891 was, in effect, the birth of the New World Order cabal.** Great financiers frequently used their fortunes to influence questions of peace and war and control politics for profit. Cecil Rhodes was different. He was determined to use his vast fortune not simply to generate ever-increasing profit, but to realise his dream, a dream he shared with his co-conspirators. Rhodes turned the profit objective on its head and sought to amass great wealth into his secret society in order to achieve political ends, to buy governments and politicians, buy public opinion and the means to influence it. [2] He intended that his wealth should be used to grasp control of the world, secretly. Secrecy was the cornerstone. No one outside the favoured few knew of the group's existence. They have since been referred to obliquely in speeches and books as \"The Money Power\", \"The Hidden", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt:1:14b1a62bd839", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14341, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "its head and sought to amass great wealth into his secret society in order to achieve political ends, to buy governments and politicians, buy public opinion and the means to influence it.

They have since been referred to obliquely in speeches and books as \"The Money Power\", \"The Hidden Power\" or \"the men behind the curtain\". All of these labels are pertinent, but we have called them, collectively, the secret elite. **Carroll Quigley revealed that secret elite influence on education was chiefly visible at the exclusive English private schools, Eton and Harrow, and at Oxford University, especially All Souls and Balliol Colleges.** [3] This immensely rich and powerful group was given intellectual approval and inspiration by the philosophy of John Ruskin, professor of fine arts at Oxford**. **He spoke to the Oxford undergraduates as members of the privileged ruling class, telling them that they possessed a magnificent tradition of education, rule of law and freedom. He championed all that was finest in the public service ethic, duty and self-discipline, and believed that English ruling class tradition should be spread to the masses across the empire. [4] But behind such well-serving words lay a philosophy strongly opposed to the emancipation of woman, had no time for democracy and supported the \"just\" war. [5] Ruskin advocated that control of the state should be placed in the hands of a small ruling class. Social order was to be built upon the authority of superiors, imposing upon their inferiors an absolute, unquestioning obedience. He was repelled by the notion of levelling between the classes and by the disintegration of the \"rightful\" authority of the ruling class. [6] Ruskin's philosophy was music to the ears of the elitists. It gave their lust for global power the blessing of academic approval. What they did, they would claim, was not for them, but for mankind. They would rise to power on the spurious justification that the world would consequently be a better place for humanity. **Inspired by Ruskin, Cecil Rhodes and his accomplices created the secret society with an inner core of trusted associates called \"The Society of the Elect\", who unquestionably knew that they were members of an exclusive cabal devoted to taking and holding power on a world-wide basis.** **[7] ** **A second outer ring, larger and quite fluid in its membership, was named \"The Association of Helpers\". At this level members might not have known that they were an integral part of, or inadvertently being used by, a secret society. Many on the outer edges of the group, idealists and honest individuals, may never have been aware that the real decisions were made by a ruthless clique about whom they had no knowledge.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt:2:537941ad825a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14342, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "power on a world-wide basis.** **[7] ** **A second outer ring, larger and quite fluid in its membership, was named \"The Association of Helpers\".

Many on the outer edges of the group, idealists and honest individuals, may never have been aware that the real decisions were made by a ruthless clique about whom they had no knowledge. [8]** The man who exposed the secret society, Carroll Quigley (1910 - 1977), was the highly esteemed professor of history at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, and a lecturer at Princeton and Harvard. He revealed that the organisation was able to \"conceal its existence quite successfully, and many of its most influential members... are unknown even to close students of British History\". [9] **Quigley's greatest contribution to our understanding of modern history came with his books, *The Anglo-American Establishment* and *[Tragedy and Hope, A History of the World in Our Time](https://www.WantToKnow.info/articles/tragedy_hope_banking_money_history)*. The former was written in 1949 but only released after his death. His disclosures placed him in such potential danger from an Establishment backlash that it was never published in his lifetime. In a 1974 radio broadcast, Quigley warned the interviewer, Rudy Maxa of the Washington Post, \"You better be discreet. You have to protect my future as well as your own.\" [10]** [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hidden-History-Secret-Origins-First/dp/1780576307/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430091195&sr=8-1&keywords=hidden+history+the+secret+origins+of+the+first+world+war](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hidden-History-Secret-Origins-First/dp/1780576307/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430091195&sr=8-1&keywords=hidden+history+the+secret+origins+of+the+first+world+war) **Quigley had received assistance of a \"personal nature\" from individuals close to what he called the \"Group\", but \"for obvious reasons\" he could not reveal their names.** [11] He made it clear that evidence about them was not hard to find \"if you know where to look,\" [12] and it has to be asked why generations of historians have failed to pursue his trail. Though sworn to secrecy, Professor Quigley revealed in the radio interview that Sir Alfred Zimmern, the British historian and political scientist, had confirmed the names of the main protagonists within the secret society. Without a shadow of doubt, Zimmern himself was a close associate of those at the centre of real power in Britain. He knew most of the key figures personally and was himself a member of the inner core of the secret society for twelve years between 1910 and 1922. [13] The enigma of Professor Quigley's work lies in his statement that while the secret cabal had brought many of the things he held dear close to disaster, he generally agreed with its goals and aims. [14] Were these merely words of self-preservation? Be mindful of his warning to Rudy Maxa as late as 1974. Quigley clearly felt that these revelations placed him in danger. **Unknown persons removed his major work, *[Tragedy and Hope](https://www.WantToKnow.info/articles/tragedy_hope_banking_money_history), *from the bookstore shelves in America, and it was withdrawn from sale without any justification soon after its release.

The book's original plates were unaccountably destroyed by Quigley's publisher, the Macmillan Company, who, for the next six years \"lied, lied, lied\" to him and deliberately misled him into believing that it would be reprinted.** [15] Why? What pressures obliged a major publishing house to take such extreme action? Quigley stated categorically that powerful people had suppressed the book because it exposed matters that they did not want known. The reader has to understand that we are discussing individuals whose power, influence and control were unrivalled. From the very start, each of the initial conspirators brought valuable qualities and connections to the society. Cecil Rhodes was Prime Minister of the Cape Colony and master and commander of a vast area of Southern Africa which some were already beginning to call Rhodesia. His wealth had been underwritten by brutal native suppression [16] and the global mining interests of the House of Rothschild, [17] to whom he was answerable. William Stead was the most prominent journalist of his day and a voice to which ordinary people listened. Lord Esher represented the interests of the monarchy from Queen Victoria's final years, through the exuberant excesses of King Edward VII, to the more sedate but pliable King George V. His influence was immense because he operated between monarchs, the aristocracy and leading political figures. He chaired important secret committees, was responsible for appointments to the Cabinet, the senior ranks of the diplomatic corps and voiced strong personal opinion on top army posts. [18] Esher exerted a power behind the throne far in excess of his constitutional position. His role of powerbroker on behalf of the secret elite was without equal. Indeed Professor Quigley dubbed him, \"the greatest wire puller of the period.\" [19] Another name that pervaded all that was powerful and influential during this period was that of the Rothschild dynasty, and Quigley placed Lord Nathaniel (Natty) Rothschild within the very core of the secret organization. [20] Rothschild was all-powerful in British and world banking and virtually untouchable. **\"The House of Rothschild was immensely more powerful than any financial empire that had ever preceded it. It commanded vast wealth. It was international. It was independent. Royal governments were nervous of it because they could not control it. Popular movements hated it because it was not answerable to the people. Constitutionalists resented it because its influence was exercised behind the scenes - secretly.\" [21]** Taken together, the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt:4:a9fca2a29294", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14344, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "[20] Rothschild was all-powerful in British and world banking and virtually untouchable. **\"The House of Rothschild was immensely more powerful than any financial empire that had ever preceded it.

Popular movements hated it because it was not answerable to the people. Constitutionalists resented it because its influence was exercised behind the scenes - secretly.\" [21]** Taken together, the principal players, Rhodes, Stead, Esher, Rothschild and Milner represented a new force that was emerging inside British politics, but powerful old traditional aristocratic families that had long dominated Westminster, often in cahoots with the reigning monarch, were also deeply involved, and none more so than the Cecil family. Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, the patriarchal 3rd Marquis of Salisbury, ruled the Conservative Party at the latter end of the nineteenth century. He served as prime minister three times for a total of fourteen years, between 1885 and 1902 (longer than anyone else in recent history). When he retired as prime minister in July 1902, he handed over the reins of government to his sister's son, Arthur Balfour. Lord Salisbury had four siblings, five sons and three daughters who were all linked and interlinked by marriage to individuals in the upper echelons of the English ruling class. Important government positions were given to relations, friends and wealthy supporters who proved their gratitude by ensuring that his views became policy in government, civil service and diplomatic circles. This extended 'Cecil-Bloc' was intricately linked to \"The Society of the Elect\" and secret elite ambitions throughout the first half of the twentieth century. [22] **Another member of the inner core, Lord Alfred Milner, offers cause for greater scrutiny because he has been virtually airbrushed from the history of the period.** Alfred Milner was a self-made man and remarkably successful civil servant who became a key figure within the secret elite and absolutely powerful within the ranks of these privileged individuals. He and Rhodes had been contemporaries at Oxford University, and were inextricably connected through events in South Africa. Rhodes recognised in him the kind of steel that was required to pursue the dream of world domination, \"I support Milner absolutely without reserve. If he says peace, I say peace; if he says war, I say war. Whatever happens, I say ditto to Milner.\" [23] Milner grew in time to be the most able of them all, to enjoy the privilege of patronage and power, a man to whom others turned for leadership and direction. **When governor general and high commissioner of South Africa, Milner deliberately caused the Boer War in order to grab the Transvaal's gold and use the economic resources of South Africa to extend and perpetuate secret elite control.** He had the grace to confess in a letter to Lord Roberts, Commander in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt:5:37b0b85e1fee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14345, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "grew in time to be the most able of them all, to enjoy the privilege of patronage and power, a man to whom others turned for leadership and direction. **When governor general and high commissioner of South Africa, Milner deliberately caused the Boer War in order to grab the Transvaal's gold and use the economic resources of South Africa to extend and perpetuate secret elite control.** He had the grace to confess in a letter to Lord Roberts, Commander in Chief in South Africa, that \"I precipitated the crisis, which was inevitable, before it was too late. It is not very agreeable, and in many eyes, not very creditable piece of business to have been largely instrumental in bringing about a big war.\" [24] This was no immodest boast. Alfred Milner's matter-of-fact explanation displayed the cold objectivity that drove the secret elite cause. **War was unfortunate, but necessary. It had to be. They were not afraid of war.** The secret elite's war against the Dutch settlers began in October 1899 and ended with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902. The Boer Republics were annexed to the British Empire. The Transvaal's gold was finally in the hands of the secret elite at a cost of some 70,000 dead on the battlefields, plus 32,000 dead in British concentration camps, including more than 20,000 children of Dutch descent. Some thirty thousand Boer farms were burned to the ground, livestock slaughtered, and the women and children put in British concentration camps. In the camps, the families of men fighting for the Boer army were punished by being put on half the already meagre rations with no meat whatsoever. [25] W. T. Stead, former member of the inner core of the secret elite who had resigned in disgust over the Boer War, was overcome by the evidence presented to him. He wrote, \"Every one of these children who died as a result of the halving of their rations, thereby exerting pressure onto their family still on the battle-field, was purposefully murdered. The system of half rations stands exposed, stark and unashamedly as a cold-blooded deed of state policy employed with the purpose of ensuring the surrender of men whom we were not able to defeat on the field.\" [26] 20,000 children dying in British concentration camps were of little consequence to Milner. He was so driven that he ignored the weight of opposition ranged against him. He warned his friend, Richard Haldane: \"If we are to build up anything in South Africa, we must disregard, and absolutely disregard, the screamers.\" [27] **It takes a very strong man to disregard the screamers, to ignore moral indignation, to put the cause before humanitarian concerns. Some frontline politicians find it all but impossible to stand against a torrent of public outrage, but those behind the curtain in the secret corridors of power can", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt:6:b0473a5c11b9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14346, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "weight of opposition ranged against him.

Some frontline politicians find it all but impossible to stand against a torrent of public outrage, but those behind the curtain in the secret corridors of power can easily ignore 'sentimentality'.** Milner's period of stewardship in South Africa had a very important consequence. He administered the defeated Transvaal and Orange Free State as occupied territories, and recruited into the upper layers of his civil service a band of young men from well-to-do, upper-class, frequently titled families who became known as \"Milner's Kindergarten.\" [28] They replaced the government and administration of the Boer republics, and worked prodigiously to rebuild the broken country. [29] The Kindergarten comprised new blood; young educated men - mostly Oxford graduates, with a deep sense of duty, loyalty to the Empire and capable of populating the next generation of the secret society. [30] In the period 1909-1913 the Kindergarten set up semi-secret groups, known as Round Table Groups, in the United States and the chief British dependencies. The Round Table Groups in Canada, as elsewhere, were merely different names for \"The Association of Helpers\" and only part of the secret society, since the real power still lay with \"The Society of the Elect\". This all-powerful inner-core would bring in new members from the outer ring as was deemed necessary. [35] The alliance of powerful investment bankers, politicians, diplomats and press barons shared the same unwritten purpose, the destruction of German imperial power and the confirmation of Anglo-Saxon domination of the world. **Money was never a problem for the secret elite. As we have seen, Natty Rothschild, the richest man in the world, was directly involved from the beginning, but the 'Money-Power' extended well beyond that single source. **The Rand multi-millionaires, Sir Abe Bailey and Alfred Beit were members of the inner core [36] and always willing to finance secret elite proposals, fund their propaganda groups, and back Milner. Sir Ernest Cassel, an investment banker and one of the wealthiest men in pre-war Europe, was likewise involved. Cassel, a close friend of King Edward VII, acted as go-between for the British government and provided personal funds for Lord Esher. [37] Other great financiers and bankers, centred in the City, the financial and banking district of London, shared the vision of a single world power based on English ruling class values. The world had entered an era of financial capitalism where these wealthy international investment bankers were able to dominate both industry and government if they had the concerted will to do so.

The world had entered an era of financial capitalism where these wealthy international investment bankers were able to dominate both industry and government if they had the concerted will to do so. [38] This \"Money Power\" seeped into the British Establishment and joined the aristocratic landowning families who had ruled Britain for centuries. Together, they lay at the heart of the secret elite. **In his \"Confession of Faith\", Cecil Rhodes had written of bringing the whole uncivilized world under British rule, and the \"recovery\" of the United States to make the \"Anglo-Saxon race but one Empire,\" [39] by which he meant a white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant America working in tandem with like minds in England. Clearly the United States could not be \"recovered\" by force of arms, so Rhodes dream was expanded to include the wealthy elites in the U.S. who shared a similar mind-set.** Rhodes suffered from heart and lung problems and was aware that his projected life span was limited. He wrote several wills to ensure that his fortune would be used to pursue his dream. Part of his strategy was to gift scholarship places at his alma mater, Oxford University, in the belief that exposure to British culture, philosophy and education would strengthen the best young minds from the colonies and, most importantly, the United States. **Rhodes scholarships favoured American students, with two allocated for each of the fifty states and territories, but only sixty places for the entire British Empire. The \"best talents\" from the \"best families\" in the US were to be nurtured at Oxford, spiritual home of the secret elite, and imbued with an appreciation of \"Englishness\" and \"retention of the unity of the Empire.\"** [40] Professor Quigley revealed that \"the scholarships were merely a facade to conceal the secret society, or, more accurately, they were to be one of the instruments by which the members of the secret society could carry out his [Rhodes] purpose.\" [41] The secret elite appreciated America's vast potential, and adjusted the concept of British Race supremacy to Anglo-Saxon supremacy. Rhodes 's dream had only to be slightly modified. The world was to be united through the English-speaking nations in a federal structure based around Britain. [42] **Alfred Milner became the undisputed leader of the secret society when Cecil Rhodes died in 1902. Like Rhodes, he believed that the goal should be pursued by a secret political and economic elite influencing \"journalistic, educational and propaganda agencies\" behind the scenes.** [43] The flow of money into the United States during the nineteenth century advanced industrial development to the immense benefit of the millionaires it created, Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan, Vanderbilt and their associates.

Railroads, steel, shipbuilding, construction, oil and finance blossomed in an oft-cut throat environment, though that was more apparent than real. **These small groups of massively rich individuals on both sides of the Atlantic knew each other well, and the secret elite in London initiated a very select and secretive dining club, The Pilgrims, that brought them together on a regular basis.** On 11 July 1902, an inaugural meeting was held at the Carlton Hotel [44] of what became known as the London Chapter of The Pilgrims Society, with a select membership limited by individual scrutiny to 500. Ostensibly, the society was created to \"promote goodwill, good friendship and everlasting peace\" [45] between Britain and the United States, but its highly secretive and exclusive membership leaves little doubt as to its real purpose. This was the pool of wealth and talent that the secret elite drew together to promote its agenda in the years preceding the First World War. Behind an image of the Pilgrim Fathers, the persecuted pioneers of Christian values, this elite cabal advocated the idea that \"Englishmen and Americans would promote international friendship through their pilgrimages to and fro across the Atlantic \". [46] It presented itself as a spontaneous movement to promote democracy across the world [47] and doubtless many of the members believed that, but The Pilgrims included a select collective of the wealthiest figures in both Britain and the United States who were deeply involved with the secret elite. They shared Rhodes' dream and wanted to be party to it. The New York branch of The Pilgrims was launched at the Waldorf-Astoria on 13 January 1903, [48] and comprised the most important bankers, politicians and lawyers on the Eastern Seaboard. They established a tradition of close interaction with British and American ambassadors. [49] The ambassadorial connections with The Pilgrims would prove absolutely crucial in linking the Foreign Secretary in London and the Secretary of State in Washington to the secret elite and its agenda for war. A number of the American Pilgrims also had close links with the New York branch of the secret elite's Round Table. In Britain, at least eighteen members of the secret elite, including Lords Rothschild, Curzon, Northcliffe, Esher and Balfour attended Pilgrims dinners, though the regularity of their attendance is difficult to establish.

Such is the perennial problem with secretive groups. We know something about the guests invited to dinner, but not what was discussed between courses. [50] In New York, members included both the Rockefeller and Morgan dynasties and many men in senior government posts. Initially, membership was likewise limited to 500. [51] The power-elite in America was New York centred, carried great influence in domestic and international politics, and was heavily indulgent of Yale, Harvard and Princeton Universities. **They conducted an American version of what Carroll Quigley termed the secret elite's triple-front-penetration of politics, the press and education.** [52] The Pilgrims Society brought together American money and British aristocracy, royalty, government ministers and top diplomats. It was indeed a special relationship. Of all the American banking establishments, none was more Anglo-centric than the J. P. Morgan bank, itself deeply involved with The Pilgrims. An American, George Peabody, established the bank in London in 1835. In 1854 he took on a partner, Junius Morgan, (father of J. P. Morgan) and the bank was renamed Peabody, Morgan & Co. When Peabody's retired in 1864 it became the J. S. Morgan bank. The Rothschilds had developed a close relationship with Peabody and Morgan, and following a crash in 1857 saved the bank by organizing a huge bailout by the Bank of England. Although American by birth, the Morgan family wore their affinity to England like a badge of honour. Despite stinging criticism from Thomas Jefferson that Junius's father-in-law, the Rev John Pierpont, was \"under the influence of the whore of England,\" [53] Junius sent his son to the English High School in Boston. J. P. Morgan spent much of his younger years absorbing English traditions, and was an ardent anglophile and admirer of the British Empire. **In 1899 J. P. Morgan travelled to England to attend an international Bankers Convention and returned to America as the representative of Rothschild interests in the United States. [54] It was the perfect front.** Morgan, who posed as an upright Protestant guardian of capitalism, who could trace his family roots to pre-Revolutionary times, acted for the Rothschilds and shielded their American profits from the poison of anti-Semitism. In 1895 the Rothschilds had secretly replenished the US gold reserves through J.P. Morgan, and raised him to the premier league of international banking. [55] In turn, his gratitude was extended to another Rothschild favourite and leading figure in the secret elite, Alfred Milner. In 1901, Morgan", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt:10:c75937b976e8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14350, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "Morgan, who posed as an upright Protestant guardian of capitalism, who could trace his family roots to pre-Revolutionary times, acted for the Rothschilds and shielded their American profits from the poison of anti-Semitism.

[55] In turn, his gratitude was extended to another Rothschild favourite and leading figure in the secret elite, Alfred Milner. In 1901, Morgan offered Milner a then massive income of $100,000 per annum to become a partner in the London branch [56] but Milner was not to be distracted from the vital business of the Boer War. J. P. Morgan was an Empire loyalist at the heart of the American Establishment. A second powerful bank on Wall Street, Kuhn, Loeb & Co., also served as a Rothschild front. Jacob Schiff, a German who ran the bank, came from a family close to the Rothschilds. [57] He had been born in the house his parents shared with the Rothschilds in the Jewish quarter of Frankfurt. [58] Schiff was an experienced European banker whose career straddled both continents, with contacts in New York, London, Hamburg and Frankfurt. His long-standing friend, Edward Cassel of the secret elite, was appointed Kuhn, Loeb's agent in London. Schiff even dined with King Edward on the strength of Cassel's close friendship with the King. [59] Jacob Schiff had married Solomon Loeb's daughter and, backed by Rothschild gold, quickly gained overall control of the Kuhn, Loeb Bank. [60] Schiff in turn brought a young German banker, Paul Warburg, over to New York to help him run the bank. Paul and his brother Max had served part of their banking apprenticeships with Natty Rothschild in London. Like the Peabody-Morgan bank in London, the Warburg family bank in Hamburg had been saved by a very large injection of Rothschild money, and undoubtedly acted as a Rothschild front thereafter. **On the surface there were periods of blistering competition between the investment banking houses and international oil goliaths J. D. Rockefeller and the Rothschilds, but by the turn of the century they adopted a more subtle relationship that avoided real competition.** A decade earlier, Baron Alphonse de Rothschild had accepted Rockefeller's invitation to meet in New York behind the closed doors of Standard Oil's headquarters on Broadway. Standard's chief spokesman, John D Archbold [61] reported that they had quickly reached a tentative agreement, and thought it desirable on both sides that the matter was kept confidential. Clearly both understood the advantage of monopolistic collusion. It was a trend they eventually developed to their own advantage. By the early years of the twentieth century much of the assumed rivalry between major stakeholders in banking, industry and commerce was a convenient facade, though they would have the world believe otherwise.

Consider please this convenient facade. Official Rothschild biographers maintain that the dynasty's interests in America were limited, and that the American Civil War led to \"a permanent decline in the Rothschild's transatlantic influence\". [62] All our evidence points in the opposite direction. Their associates, agents and front companies permeated American finance and industry. Their influence was literally everywhere. J. P. Morgan, the acknowledged chieftain of the Anglo-American financial establishment was the main conduit for British capital [63] and a personal friend of the Rothschilds. Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb, another close friend of the Rothschild family, worked hand-in-glove with Rockefeller in oil, railroad and banking enterprises. Jacob Schiff the Pilgrim was both a Rothschild agent and a trusted associate of J. D. Rockefeller the Pilgrim. Morgan, Schiff and Rockefeller, the three leading players on Wall Street, had settled into a cosy cartel behind which the House of Rothschild remained hidden, but retained immense influence and power. Control of capital and credit was increasingly concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer men until the rival banking groups ceased to operate in genuine competition. [64] This trans-Atlantic financial collusion underpinned the Anglo-American bond on which the secret elite built their dream of world domination. Political control moved hand in glove with the Money-Power. One of the problems the secret elite had to contend with was democracy, even the very limited choice that British and American democracy had to offer. Professor Quigley observed that Alfred Milner, and apparently most members of the secret elite, believed that \"democracy was not an unmixed good, or even a good, and far inferior to the rule of the best...\" [65] They, of course, believed themselves \"the best\" and their morality did not exclude the use of warfare to carry out what they deemed to be their civilising mission; a new world order based on ruling class values in which they would be first amongst men. **In Britain, faced with an electorate that frequently changed allegiance from the Conservative party to the Liberal party and back again, the secret elite selected reliable and trusted men to hold high office in* both* parties.** Conservative Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, a member of the inner circle of the secret elite, [66] and Foreign Secretary Lord Lansdowne began the transformation of British Foreign policy towards war with Germany in the sure knowledge that senior Liberals would continue that policy if and when the people voted for change. Herbert", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt:12:cc98216c5c33", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14352, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "changed allegiance from the Conservative party to the Liberal party and back again, the secret elite selected reliable and trusted men to hold high office in* both* parties.** Conservative Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, a member of the inner circle of the secret elite, [66] and Foreign Secretary Lord Lansdowne began the transformation of British Foreign policy towards war with Germany in the sure knowledge that senior Liberals would continue that policy if and when the people voted for change. Herbert Henry Asquith, Richard Haldane and Sir Edward Grey were Milner's chosen senior men in the Liberal Party and \"objects of his special attention\". [67] Their remit was to ensure that an incoming Liberal government maintained a seamless foreign policy that served the grand plan. Their secret elite connections were impeccable. Together, with their good friend Arthur Balfour, they were intimately involved with the inner circles of the cabal. Their duty was to the King, the Empire, to Milner's dream, to Rhode's legacy. They confronted the same problems, analysed the same alternatives and agreed the same solution. Germany had to go. The senior Liberals, Asquith, Grey and Haldane, conspired to undermine the anti-war Liberal Party leader Campbell-Bannerman from within and were supported by both the Conservative party leaders and King Edward VII, himself a key figure inside the secret elite. **Every major step taken by the British Foreign Office from 1902 onwards was dictated by the overall objective to destroy Germany. **Treaties with Japan, the Entente Cordiale with France and all of its secret clauses, the secret conventions agreed between King Edward and the Russian Czar had that single purpose. Simply put, the large field armies of France and Russia were needed to crush Germany. In the United States, and indeed in France, political power was guaranteed by financial incentives and the appointment of suitable candidates, in other words through bribery and corruption. Senator Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island was chosen by the secret elite to be the voice of \"sound economics\" in the Senate. A wealthy businessman and father-in-law of J.D. Rockefeller Jr., Aldrich was known as \"Morgan's floor broker in the Senate.\" [68] Shameless in his excesses, he used public office to feather his own very large nest. Public service was to him little more than a cash cow through which he built a ninety-nine roomed chateau and sailed a two hundred foot yacht. [69] Over a two-year period the Money-Power worked steadily on their chosen Senator to turn him into an \"expert\" on banking systems. Congress appointed a National Monetary Commission in 1908 with Aldrich as Chairman to review U.S. banking. Its members toured Europe, supposedly collecting data on various banking systems. Aldrich's final report, however, was not the product of any European study tour, but of a collective conspiracy. **In November 1910, five bankers representing Morgan, Rockefeller and Kuhn Loeb interests, [met in total secrecy](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-Federal-Reserve-secret-history) with Senator", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt:13:e471fb5c195c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14353, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__secret-societies-founding-fathers", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "the Money-Power worked steadily on their chosen Senator to turn him into an \"expert\" on banking systems.

Of the seven conspirators, five, Senator Aldrich, Henry Davison, Benjamin Strong, Frank Vanderlip and Paul Warburg, were members of The Pilgrims.** [70] Their objective was to formulate a Central Banking Bill that would be presented to Congress as if it was the brainchild of Aldrich's Monetary Commission. **The proposed \"Federal Reserve System\" was to be owned entirely by private banks, though its name implied that it was a government institution. Individuals from the American banking dynasties, including Morgan, Warburg, Schiff and Rockefeller, would hold the shares.** It was to be a central bank of issue that would have a monopoly of all the money and credit of the people of the United States. It would control the interest rate and the volume of money in circulation. The Federal Reserve System constructed on Jekyll Island had powers that King Midas could never have contemplated. The objective was to establish a franchise to create money out of nothing for the purpose of lending, get the taxpayer to pick up any losses, and convince Congress that the aim was to protect the public. [71] The Aldrich proposals never went to a vote. President Taft refused to support the Bill on the grounds that it would not impose sufficient government control over the banks. The Money Power decided that Taft had to go. Their support in the 1912 Presidential election swung behind the little known Woodrow Wilson. The speed with which Wilson was bounced from his post at Princeton University in 1910, to Governor of New Jersey in 1911, then Democratic Party nominee for the Presidency in 1912 made him the Solomon Grundy of U S politics. Not only did the secret elite put their man in the White House, they also gave him a minder, Edward Mandell House. Woodrow Wilson was President of the United States but this shadowy figure stood by his side, controlling his every move. House, an Anglophile who had been part educated in England, was credited with swinging the 1912 Democratic Convention in Baltimore behind Wilson. [72] He became Woodrow Wilson's constant companion from that point onwards, with his own suite of rooms in the White House. He was also in direct, sometimes daily contact with J. P.

Morgan Jr, Jacob Schiff, Paul Warburg, and Democrat Senators who sponsored the Federal Reserve Bill. [73] Mandell House guided the President in every aspect of foreign and domestic policy, chose his Cabinet and formulated the first policies of his new Administration. [74] He was the prime intermediary between the President and his Wall Street backers. [75] The Anglo-centric Money Power had complete control of the White House and finally established its central bank in time for the secret elite's war. Ponder the significance of this coincidence. Provided with huge sums of secret elite money rerouted via St Petersburg, French politicians, newspapers and journalists were effectively corrupted to elect the *Revanchist*warmonger candidate Raymond Poincare to the Presidency of France. By February 1913, two major powers, the United States and France, had new Presidents who were elected to office through the machinations of the secret elite. They had positioned key players in the governments of Britain, France, and the United States and exerted immense influence over the foreign ministry in Russia. **Politics, money and power were the pillars on which the Anglo-Saxon elite would destroy Germany and take control of the world. All that was left to concoct was a reason for war.** The Kaiser's refusal to be drawn into direct confrontation with France and Britain over crises in Morocco in 1905 and 1911 demanded a rethink. Public hysteria in Britain about spies was developed into a cottage industry, with barely literate novels and wild articles in Northcliffe's papers portraying Germany as a dangerous warmongering nation of Huns preparing to pounce on an unsuspecting and ill-prepared Britain. Similarly in France, through blatant bribery and corruption, both the press and the *Revanchistes*in French politics fomented anti-German sentiment. But Germany remained stubbornly unwilling to become involved a European war. From 1912 onwards the secret elite looked to the Balkans to provide the excuse for war. Alexander Isvolsky, their top Russian agent, had been strategically moved to Paris, from which vantage point he directed the Balkan agitation. The mix of ethnic diversity, religious animosities, political intrigue and raw nationalism was deliberately provoked into two brutal Balkan wars which in themselves could have brought about a pan-European war, but the Kaiser refused to take the bait. Something more dramatic, more sensational, was needed. **The notion propagated by many historians that world war was 'inevitable' or that the world 'slid' into war is crass. Chance was not involved.

It required a complex set of manipulated events engineered by determined men to set the fuse. What remained was a spark to ignite that fuse. It came with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir-apparent to the Austrian Empire, in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914. Millions of words have been written to describe the events in Sarajevo that day, but none have ever revealed the trail of complicity that led from the gunmen back to the secret elite in London. Be certain of one thing. It was not the man who fired the bullet that caused a world war.** Thus war engulfed the known world to a degree that had no precedent. Histories have been written to explain away the reasons why, histories that favoured the victors and twisted the truth to blame Germany. How history has been manipulated, how evidence has been removed, burned, shredded or otherwise denied to genuine researchers remains a crime against truth, against humanity. The received history of the First World War is a deliberately concocted lie. Not the sacrifice, the heroism, the horrendous waste of life or the misery that followed. No, these were very real, but the truth of how it all began and how it was unnecessarily and deliberately prolonged beyond 1915 has been successfully covered up for a century. Professor Quigley stated, \"No country that values its safety should allow what the Milner group accomplished - that is, that a small number of men would be able to wield such power in administration and politics, should be given almost complete control over the publication of documents relating to their actions, should be able to exercise such influence over the avenues of information that create public opinion, and should be able to monopolize so completely the writing and the teaching of the history of their own period.\" [76] Never were truer words uttered in dire warning. These Founding Fathers, the secret elite, began with Rhodes' secret society and expanded across the Atlantic, always away from the public eye. They were deniers of democracy, men who always pursued their own malevolent agenda, who used this very process to advance their power. **What they achieved in causing the First World War was but the first step in their long term drive to a new world order.** **Note: **This article was originally published in 2013 on the [globalresearch.ca website](http://www.globalresearch.ca/new-world-order-the-founding-fathers/5445255).

Using the name Svali, this courageous woman has given in-depth descriptions of her involvement as a mind control trainer in this major cult. Brought up from childhood in the cult, Svali was unaware of how deeply she had been manipulated until she one day realized that the same lies she was feeding to the children she was charged with programming had been fed to her as a child. Please note that the powerful information provided by Svali can be quite disturbing. It also does not conform to the normal standards of reliability and verifiability used on our website. Yet it is of such great importance that I felt it necessary to share this information with all who might be interested. **I only recommend this material for those who really want to know the deepest levels of deception and manipulation going on in our world.** If you want to go straight to a summary of this material now, click on the link below. For those who want a little more background, read on. [**https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali) I have been investigating all that is being hidden from the public for over 10 years now using the most reliable, verifiable sources available. Yet** until 2001, I was a debunker of major conspiracy theories. **At the time, after 15 years with the U.S. Department of State, I had moved up the ranks to become the [top Indonesian language interpreter](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fredburksresigns) there. In [secret meetings](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050418fredburksinterpretingstories) at the White House and elsewhere where I served presidents and other top dignitaries, I had not seen or heard anything that supported the claims of my conspiracy-minded friends. Then in July 2001, a trusted friend sent me a [powerful video](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060602ufosvideosfootage) that caused me to have to completely re-formulate my beliefs about the way the world worked. This then led me on an intensive quest to discover all that was going on behind the scenes. Basing my research on the most reliable, verifiable sources available, I began to put together the pieces of this complex puzzle and share the best of my findings with any interested on the now-popular website [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info). **As I explored ever deeper down the rabbit hole, I found two areas of research to be the most profound to understanding the big picture: mind control and secret societies.** On the website and with the help of numerous friends and supporters, I developed powerful sections on both of these topics based in solid sources", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__secret_societies_mind_control.txt:0:7cdc58df9315", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14360, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__secret_societies_mind_control.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__secret_societies_mind_control", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "began to put together the pieces of this complex puzzle and share the best of my findings with any interested on the now-popular website [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info). **As I explored ever deeper down the rabbit hole, I found two areas of research to be the most profound to understanding the big picture: mind control and secret societies.** On the website and with the help of numerous friends and supporters, I developed powerful sections on both of these topics based in solid sources trusted by the public, including highly revealing major media reports and declassified government documents. You can explore the eye-opening section on mind control at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrolinformation), and the highly revealing section on powerful secret societies at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles). As the website became increasing popular (WantToKnow.info now averages over 5,000 visits per day), a number of key insiders impressed with this work contacted me and shared even deeper information. As it did not have the level of verifiability we require for most material on the website, I published very little of this inside information, yet I used it myself to attempt to better put the pieces of the big picture puzzle together. I am extremely grateful to all who have taken risks to reveal to me their own personal experiences in these major cover-ups. Yet even with this invaluable inside information, I still didn't understand how certain key pieces of the puzzle fit together - until I began to dive into Svali's information just a few months ago. Between 2000 and 2006, Svali published a wealth of rich material on secret societies, mind control programming, cult deprogramming, and more. **Then in 2006, after a key revealing [audio interview](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/audio/svali_interview) was posted and drew a lot of attention, Svali disappeared from the Internet.** Yet the abundance of excellent information she published still remains. I don't expect those unaware of the major cover-ups going on behind the scenes in our world to find Svali's information useful or even believable. Yet **for any who have explored into the dark realms of mind control and secret societies, this material is a gold mine.** Though we don't know Svali's real name, just reading the detailed, excellent information she has provided, I and many others have been thoroughly impressed with the depth and integrity of all she has shared. And her writings have helped thousands to heal from traumatic cult programming. If you are ready to dive into her writings, below is the best summary I've found of Svali's work. Links are also provided to explore the wealth of material she has made available. Let us all give thanks to this courageous woman and hope that she is safe and protected now, wherever she is. [**https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali) Though quite valuable, the Svali material gives only one key aspect of all that is going on. **For those who are interested in putting this material together with other key sources of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__secret_societies_mind_control.txt:1:476a34c6c33d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14361, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__secret_societies_mind_control.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__secret_societies_mind_control", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "her writings, below is the best summary I've found of Svali's work.

And that \"common sense\" is one which supports the interests of Bilderberg's main participants. For Bilderberg's critics the fact that there is almost no publicity about the annual meetings is proof that they are up to no good. **Bilderberg meetings often feature future political leaders shortly before they become household names. Bill Clinton went in 1991 while still governor of Arkansas, Tony Blair was there two years later while still an opposition MP.** All the recent presidents of the European Commission attended Bilderberg meetings before they were appointed. Informal and private networks like Bilderberg have helped to oil the wheels of global politics and globalisation for the past half a century. **Note:** Why is this meeting of top world leaders kept so secret? Why, until a few years ago, was there virtually no reporting on this influential group in the [major media](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediacorruption)?

Each year, 15 young undergraduate seniors are tapped for membership. Members of 'Skull and Bones' gather on High Street in the Yale campus at the tomb.

Every president has attended the breakfast since Eisenhower. Besides the presidents ... the one constant presence at the National Prayer Breakfast has been Douglas Coe. Although he's not an ordained minister, the 79-year-old Coe is the most important religious leader you've never seen or heard. **Scores of senators in both parties ... go to small weekly Senate prayer groups that Coe attends, [including] senators John McCain, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.** Observers who have investigated Coe's group, called The Fellowship Foundation, [describe] a secretive organization. **Coe repeatedly urges a personal commitment to Jesus Christ. It's a commitment Coe compares to the blind devotion that Adolph Hitler demanded. \"Hitler, Goebbels and Himmler.

Former president George H.W. Bush is a Carlyle adviser. Former British prime minister John Major heads its European arm. Former secretary of state James Baker is senior counselor, former White House budget chief Richard Darman is a partner, former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt is senior adviser -- the list goes on. Those associations have brought Carlyle enormous success. The Washington-based merchant bank controls nearly $14 billion in investments, making it the largest private equity manager in the world. It buys and sells whole companies the way some firms trade shares of stock. But the connections also have cost Carlyle. It has developed a reputation as the CIA of the business world -- omnipresent, powerful, a little sinister. Media outlets from the Village Voice to [BusinessWeek](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_07/b4021001.htm) have depicted Carlyle as manipulating the levers of government from shadowy back rooms. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) even suggested that Carlyle's and Bush's ties to the Middle East made them somehow complicitous in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. **It didn't help that as the World Trade Center burned on Sept. 11, 2001, the news interrupted a Carlyle business conference at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel here attended by a brother of Osama bin Laden.

Some 27 heads of state or government; 113 cabinet ministers; hundreds of chief executives, bankers, sovereign wealth fund managers, economists and the media: about 2,500 participants in all.** So who's coming and what will they be chattering about? The official co-chairs of the Forum are mostly well-known names: Tony Blair, of JP Morgan; James Dimon, chairman and CEO of JP Morgan; KV Kamath, MD and CEO of India's ICICI Bank; Henry Kissinger, chairman of Kissinger Associates; Indra K Noovi, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo; David J O'Reilly, chairman and CEO of Chevron Corporation; and Wang Jianzhou, CEO of China Mobile Communications Corporation. The prominent role allotted to Mr Wang, while not entirely novel, is nonetheless significant. In 2008, for the first time, China will contribute more to the growth of the world economy than the United States. Double-digit growth in China should still just be possible this year, and it alone seems to stand between the world and a full-blown recession. Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) from China and elsewhere have already been busy re-capitalising the West's stricken banks. The recycling of trillions of dollars of trade surpluses and petro dollars means that such deals will become more prevalent. **Note:** Yet these meetings are kept largely secret.

On Thursday the Bilderberg group marks its 50th anniversary with the start of its yearly meeting. For four days some of the West's chief political movers, business leaders, bankers, industrialists and strategic thinkers will hunker down in a five-star hotel in northern Italy to talk about global issues.

The rise of nation states produced national ruling classes. It would be odd if the current integration of the world economy did not produce new global elites - business people and financiers who run global companies and global politicians who steer supra-national organisations such as the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund. David Rothkopf, a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that **these elites constitute nothing less than a new global \"superclass\". They have all the clubby characteristics of the old national ruling classes, but with the vital difference that they operate on the global stage, far from mere national electorates.** They attend the same universities. They are groomed in a handful of world-spanning institutions such as Goldman Sachs. They belong to the same clubs - the Council on Foreign Relations in New York is a particular favourite - and sit on each other's boards of directors. Many of them shuttle between the public and private sectors.

Mr Rothkopf is anything but a crank, and he is right when he says that, these days, the most influential people around the world are also the most global people. He is also admirably ambivalent about his subject. He worries about surging inequality - the richest 1% of humans own 40% of the planet's wealth - and about the rumbling backlash against so much unaccountable power. **Note: ***Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making* by David Rothkopf is available [here](http://www.amazon.com/Superclass-Global-Power-Elite-Making/dp/0374272107/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1209310579&sr=1-1). **What Power Looks Like** **2008-04-14, *Newsweek* magazine** [http://www.newsweek.com/id/130637](http://www.newsweek.com/id/130637) [In] speaking [with New York Federal Reserve Bank president Timothy] Geithner while I was doing the research for my recently published book [*Superclass*](http://www.amazon.com/Superclass-Global-Power-Elite-Making/dp/0374272107/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1210002165&sr=1-1), he sketched in fascinating detail how the world's power elite rallies when the markets quake. Recalling an earlier crisis in global securities markets that he helped to manage, Geithner said the Fed brought together the leaders of the world's 14 major financial firms, from five countries, representing 95 percent of all the activity in global markets. The Swiss were there, the Germans were there, the British were there. **Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein \"jokingly called them 'the 14 families,' like in 'The Godfather',\"** says Geithner. \"And we said to them, 'You guys have got to fix this problem. Tell us how you are going to fix it and we will work out some basic regime.' You ... need a critical mass of the right players. It is a much more concentrated world.\" Geithner's description of the financial elite in crisis mode came many months before the recent meltdown of Bear Stearns, yet foreshadowed [it] in an uncanny way. **The people ... described by Geithner, plus a few thousand more like them, not only in business and finance, but also politics, the arts, the nonprofit world and other realms, are part of a new global elite that has emerged over the past several decades.

Based on DeCamp's riveting book, [*The Franklin Cover-up*](http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Cover-up-Satanism-Murder-Nebraska/dp/0963215809/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1319658131&sr=8-1), \"Conspiracy of Silence\" begins with the shut-down of Nebraska's Franklin Community Federal Credit Union after a raid by federal agencies in November 1988 revealed that $40 million was missing. When the Nebraska legislature launched a probe into the affair, what initially looked like a financial swindle soon exploded into a startling tale of drugs, money laundering, and a nationwide child abuse ring. Nineteen months later, the legislative committee's chief investigator died suddenly and violently, like more than a dozen other people linked to the Franklin case. **Jamie Johnson On ''The One Percent''** **2008-02-20, *Forbes* magazine** [http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/20/wealth-jamie-johnson-biz-cx_lr_0219johnson1....](http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/20/wealth-jamie-johnson-biz-cx_lr_0219johnson1.html) For most of the moneyed class, an inquiry into their wealth elicits silence and cringes. Not so with 28-year-old Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune. For the Emmy-nominated documentary filmmaker, wealth is the focus of his life's work. In Johnson's first documentary, [*Born Rich*](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22born+rich%22&search_type=), he exposed how 10 children from families like the Trumps and the Newhouses spent their time - and their fortunes. Now he turns the camera on his own family in *The One Percent*. **Johnson's documentary ... offers a rarefied view of the scandalously secretive world of \"the one percent,\" a small segment of the U.S. population that owns roughly 40% of the country's wealth.** Through a series of interviews with high-profile figures like Bill Gates Sr., U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and economist Milton Friedman, Johnson explores the disparity of wealth in America.

It's important to get wealthy people to think about this and think about solving this problem. They are the most influential people in our society and therefore, they should be working on treating this and coming up with a solution. **Note:** The films of Jamie Johnson give very rare views into the lives of the upper crust that are incredibly revealing.

An alert FDR shut it down but stopped short of retaliatory measures against the plotters. A key element of the plot involved [[Smedley Butler](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warisaracket)], a retired prominent general who was to have raised a private army of 500,000 men from unemployed veterans and who blew the whistle when he learned more of what the plot entailed. The plot was heavily funded and well developed and had strong links with fascist forces abroad. A story in the New York Times and several other newspapers reported on it, and a special Congressional committee was created to conduct an investigation. The records of this committee were scrubbed and sealed away in the National Archives, where they have only recently been made available. The Congressional committee kept the names of many of the participants under wraps and no criminal action was ever brought against them. But a few names have leaked out. And one is Prescott Bush, the grandfather of the incumbent president. **Prescott Bush was ... deep into the business of the Hamburg-America Lines, and had tight relations throughout this period with the new Government that had come to power in Germany a year earlier under Chancellor Adolph Hitler. **It appears that Bush was to have formed a key liaison for the group with the new German government.

And though the Svali story fits what many [serious researchers](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cults_ritual_abuse_mind_control) have found, it is difficult to verify. Thankfully, a few media have reported on \"the family,\" like the MSNBC articles [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-political-sex-scandals-linked-secret-sect-the-family) and [here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-Douglas-Coe-admires-Hitler). * *For solid information on mind control programs used by this group which can be verified with government documents, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse).

According to Svali, bloodline children are heavily conditioned to be obedient, self-controlled, and totally loyal to \"the family.\" In special activities carried out under extreme secrecy, they are subjected from a young age to sessions using drugs, hypnosis, and shock-reward conditioning which turn them into [Manchurian Candidates](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse) with alter personalities. **In their normal lives, they remember nothing of what is done to them in these sessions or of their being part of \"the family.\"** Some of these programmed children are groomed for the military or politics, while others are prepared to take on key business positions. Throughout their lives, most family members in these bloodlines have no conscious awareness of their dual lifestyle. To themselves, their neighbors, and others, they appear to be normal, upstanding citizens. Yet unknown to their own normal identity, their alter personalities are regularly accessed using code words and ordered to attend secret activities at designated times where they are programmed to forward the group's hidden agenda. **Svali alleges that higher level political positions in all Western countries are heavily occupied or controlled by bloodline members of \"the family,\" also known as [the Illuminati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati).** She also says it is quite rare that members ever leave the fold. The pressures against this are great, including the need to abandon spouse, children, house, money, and more. Svali was only able to escape after it dawned on her that, because in her role as a trainer she was telling lies to young Illuminati children, she must have been lied to herself from the time she was quite young. Svali has an abundance of intriguing information on the Illuminati and ritual abuse [available here](http://web.archive.org/web/20110519192605/http://www.suite101.com/articles.cfm/ritual_abuse).

For information on how you can make a difference, see the \"[What you can do](#what)\" box after this article. **Illuminati Bloodline Defector Svali Details Pervasive Conspiracy** By Henry Makow, Ph.D. A woman who goes by Svali claims she was raised in the Illuminati cult. She describes this powerful secret organization as comprising about 1% of the U.S. population, adding that it has infiltrated all major social institutions and is covertly preparing a takeover. Svali, age 45, was a mind programmer for the cult until 1995. She was a head trainer in the San Diego branch, where 30 trainers reported to her. She has risked her life to warn humanity of the Illuminati's covert power and agenda. Svali describes a Luciferian cult led by the richest and most powerful people in the world. It practises pedophilia, animal sacrifice and even ritual murder. It works \"hand in glove\" with elements of the CIA and Freemasonry. According to Svali, this cult is Aryan supremacist, but welcomes Jewish apostates. **It controls world traffic in drugs, guns, pornography and prostitution.** It may be the [hidden hand](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_bloodlines) behind most political assassination and terrorism, including 9/11 and the October 2002 Bali bomb blast. In March 2000, Svali began writing a monthly column for survivors of Illuminati ritual abuse at Suite101.com. In December 2000, H.J. Springer, the editor of CentrExNews.com contacted Svali and conducted an extended 18-part interview with her by email, which is summarized below. *[**Note:** centrexnews.com is no longer on the Internet, though the full 18-part interview with Svali is [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/illuminati_bloodlines_svali).

Her clear, courageous writings show in-depth knowledge of [mind control](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol) and [cult practices](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cults_ritual_abuse_mind_control). She has even written [a book](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali_book_svali_speaks) which gives excellent, detailed information on how to deprogram former cult members.]* I trust Svali's testimony because it confirms my intuition and intensive research. Everything fits: from the [hidden hand](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_bloodlines) that seems to suppress humanity to persistent reports of concentration camps in the US. I thank Svali for giving me a frightening but incredible key to understanding the world. Below are highlights of her interview with H.J. Springer. You can learn more about Svali at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali_about). **Svali Interview Excerpts** **Beliefs** Svali: The Illuminati is a group that practices a form of faith known as \"enlightenment\". It is Luciferian, and they teach their followers that their roots go back to the ancient mystery religions of Babylon, Egypt, and Celtic druidism. They have taken what they consider the \"best\" of each, the foundational practices, and joined them together into a strongly occult discipline.

It is Luciferian, and they teach their followers that their roots go back to the ancient mystery religions of Babylon, Egypt, and Celtic druidism. They have taken what they consider the \"best\" of each, the foundational practices, and joined them together into a strongly occult discipline. Many groups at the local level worship ancient deities such as \"El\", \"Baal\", and \"Ashtarte\", as well as \"Isis and Osiris\" and \"Set\". **Leadership** Svali: **The national council [consists of] influential bankers with old money such as: The Rockefellers, the Mellon family, the Carnegie family, the Rothschild family, etc.** I know I shouldn't name names, but I will. The \"Supreme World Council\" is already set up as a prototype of the one that will rule when the NWO (New World Order) comes into being. It meets on a regular basis to discuss finances, direction, policy, etc. and to problem-solve difficulties that come up. Once again, these leaders are heads in the financial world, old banking money. The Rothschild family in England and in France have ruling seats. A descendant of the Hapsburg dynasty has a generational seat. A descendant of the ruling families of England and France have a generational seat. The Rockefeller family in the US holds a seat. This is one reason that the Illuminati have been pretty \"untouchable\" over the years. The ruling members are very, very, very wealthy and powerful. How do I know this? I was on a local leadership council (a head trainer), but I talked to those on regional. Also, every Illuminati child is taught who their \"leaders\" are, and told to take an oath of allegiance to them and the \"New Order to come\". **Royalty** Svali: The Illuminati leadership state that they are descended from royal bloodlines, as well as unbroken occult heritage. There were two definitions of \"royalty\" used. Open royalty that is currently seen now, and \"hidden royalty\" of royal lineage and extreme occult power. Sometimes the two were concurrent, such as with the Prince of Wales. I never thought of which country/line held the most power, since I was just a peon busily doing my job. But my understanding was: The Hanoverian/Hapsburg descendants rule in Germany over the Bruderheist. They are considered one of the strongest lines for occult as well. The British line is just under them, with their royal family. They rule the UK branch under the Rothschilds in the occult realm, even though parliament rules the country openly. In France, again, descendants of the royal families are also in power in the occult realm, but the French Rothschilds hold the reigns over all of them. **Adam Weishaupt and the Illuminati** Svali: [Adam Weishaupt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt) did not create the Illuminati. They chose him as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali.txt:2:2e4af1a87c34", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14379, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "strongest lines for occult as well.

They chose him as a figurehead and told him what to write about. The financiers, dating back to the bankers during the times of the Templar Knights who financed the early kings in Europe, created the Illuminati. Weishaupt was their \"go fer\", who did their bidding. **Freemasonry** Svali: The Freemasons and the Illuminati are hand in glove. I don't care if this steps on any toes, it's a fact. The Masonic temple at Alexandria, Virginia (the city itself was named after Alexandria, Egypt, and is a hotbed of Illuminati activity) is a centre in the Washington, DC area for Illuminati scholarship and teaching. I was taken there at intervals for testing, to step up a level, for scholarship, and high ceremonies. The leaders in this Masonic group were also Illuminists. This has been true of every large city I have lived in. The top Freemasons were also top Illuminists. My maternal grandparents were both high ranking Masons in the city of Pittsburgh, Pa. (president of the Eastern Star and 33rd degree Mason), and they both were also leaders in the Illuminati in that area. **Are all Masons Illuminati? No, especially at the lower levels, I believe they know nothing of the practices that occur in the middle of the night in the larger temples.** Many are probably fine businessmen and Christians. But I have never known a 32 degree or above who wasn't Illuminati, and the group helped create Freemasonry as a \"front\" for their activities. **CIA, FBI are infiltrated. So are Mormons, others** Svali: Many of the administrators and directors at the FBI are also Illuminists. The [CIA helped bring over German scientists](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-project-paperclip-dark-side-the-moon) after WWII. Many of these were also Illuminati leaders in their own country, and they were welcomed with open arms by the U.S. group. They also funnelled all information they were learning to the Illuminati. The scientists that ran MK-Ultra and other [governmental mind control programs](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol) were Illuminists brought over from Nazi Germany. The Mormons affiliated years ago in a meeting with Illuminati leadership in the 1950s. The same with the Jehovah's Witnesses. **Split Personalities** Most of the people I knew in the Illuminati were fairly fragmented. In fact, I cannot think of anyone who was not dissociative to some degree. You developed split personalities who weren't aware of each other [i.e. [Manchurian Candidates](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse)].

Even the local and regional leaders all come in for regular \"programming tune ups\", as I used to call them. The largest split was between the front and back; i.e. daily life and night life. And many of my personalities had a wonderful life. **Good or Evil?** I want to address a misconception that the Illuminists know that they are evil. When I was in the group,** I and those around me were ideologically committed to the agenda as being good. I thought I was helping others reach their full potential when I was a trainer.** I believed that after years of sweat and hard work, my intelligence won out, and that I made an excellent leader. They honestly think they are doing a good thing. If you told them it was wrong, or evil, they would look confused. It took a lot of therapy, deprogramming myself, and doing reality checks with non-cult people to realize that it was all a lie. I was devastated. I had dedicated my life to helping others bring in the glorious new order, only to then find out it was evil and abusive. I went through a period of intense grieving/mourning over this. **Most Illuminists I knew weren't evil, they were deceived. Only the top leadership perhaps were consciously being hurtful.** **Pervasive Presence ** Svali: The Illuminati are present in every major metropolitan centre in the United States. The Illuminati believe in controlling an area through its banks and financial institutions (guess how many sit on banking boards), local government (guess how many get elected to local city councils), law (children are encouraged to go to law school), and media (others are encouraged to go to journalism school and members help fund local papers). They claim to have manipulated history for the past 2,000 years. **In the last 200 years, they have certainly had a profound influence at the international and governmental level,** based on what I saw and heard when in the group. But I also believe that people have free choice, and that no one person or group can truly take into account the unpredictable: human nature and how they will respond. **Military Takeover ** Svali: Briefly, each region of the United States has \"nerve centres\" or power bases for regional activity. The United States has been divided up into seven major geographical regions. Each region has localities within it that contain military compounds and bases that are hidden in remote, isolated areas or on large private estates.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali.txt:4:bdc42f55a99d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14381, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "have free choice, and that no one person or group can truly take into account the unpredictable: human nature and how they will respond. **Military Takeover ** Svali: Briefly, each region of the United States has \"nerve centres\" or power bases for regional activity.

Because the Illuminists believe that our government, as we know it, as well as the governments of most nations around the world, are destined to collapse. These will be planned collapses, and they will occur in the following ways: The Illuminati has planned first for a financial collapse that will make the great depression look like a picnic. This will occur through the manoeuvring of the great banks and financial institutions of the world, through stock manipulation, and interest rate changes. Most people will be indebted to the federal government through bank and credit card debt, etc. The governments will recall all debts immediately, but most people will be unable to pay and will be bankrupted. This will cause generalized financial panic, which will occur simultaneously worldwide, as the Illuminists firmly believe in controlling people through finances. Doesn't sound pleasant, does it? I don't know the exact time frame for all of this, and wouldn't want to even guess. The good news is that if a person is debt-free, owes nothing to the government or credit debt, and can live self sufficiently, they may do better than others. I would invest in gold, not stocks, if I had the income. Gold will once again be the world standard, and dollars will be pretty useless. Remember after the Civil War? Our money will be worth about what confederate money was after the collapse. Next there will be a military takeover, region by region, as the government declares a state of emergency and martial law. People will have panicked. There will be an anarchical state in most localities, and the government will justify its move as being necessary to control panicked citizens. The cult trained military leaders and people under their direction will use arms as well as crowd control techniques to implement this new state of affairs. Military bases will be set up in each locality (actually, they are already here, but are covert). In the next few years, they will go above ground and be revealed. Each locality will have regional bases and leaders to which they are accountable. The hierarchy will closely reflect the current covert hierarchy. **All this said, it could just be cult propaganda taught to me and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali.txt:5:4b17758bd094", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14382, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "use arms as well as crowd control techniques to implement this new state of affairs.

The hierarchy will closely reflect the current covert hierarchy. **All this said, it could just be cult propaganda taught to me and others to frighten us.** It may be that none of this will happen. I sincerely hope not. About five years ago, when I left the Illuminati, approximately 1% of the US population was either part of the Illuminati, sympathetic to it, or a victim of mind control (and therefore considered useable). While this may not sound like many, imagine 1% of the population highly trained in the use of armaments, crowd control, psychological and behavioral techniques, armed with weapons and linked to paramilitary groups. **Rank of the US** Svali: The U.S. is considered lower and younger than the European branches. Germany, France, and the UK form a triumvirate that rules in the European cult. The USSR is considered important and has the strongest military groups. The USSR has been promised fourth position in the New World Order, above the role the U.S. would have, because the USSR has been more helpful and cooperative over the years with furthering the agenda. The descendants of the former ruling families there are also involved in the occult leadership, along with the newer ones. There is no Marxism in the cult. China will be ranked after the USSR, then the U.S. But a lot of the current U.S. leadership will be in Europe when the change occurs, and many have homes there. They will be \"changing nationalities\" overnight, as it were. This is the little that I do remember. Wish I had been a better student of this stuff, but I was too busy trying to stay alive when I was in it. **Russia will be the military base and powerhouse of the group since their military commanders (Illuminist) are considered the best in the world and very, very disciplined.** China, because of its roots in oriental occultism and its large population, will also be considered a higher power than the U.S. But again, the real power will reside in Europe, according to what I was taught when part of the group. **The United Nations ** Svali: The UN was created early in this century in order to help overcome one of the biggest barriers to a one-world government. That barrier is the one of nationalism or pride in one's country. This is why it was not a popular concept when first introduced. It took years of country bashing in the media and the destruction of any sense of national pride by a (not", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali.txt:6:90682f6f37a9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14383, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "I was taught when part of the group. **The United Nations ** Svali: The UN was created early in this century in order to help overcome one of the biggest barriers to a one-world government. That barrier is the one of nationalism or pride in one's country. This is why it was not a popular concept when first introduced. It took years of country bashing in the media and the destruction of any sense of national pride by a (not so subtle) media campaign over the years. The UN is a preparation, but it is not the real power in the world, and will be relatively unimportant when the NWO comes into being. The real councils will then step forward. But as a means of getting the general public to accept the idea of a \"global community\" and the \"one world community\" the UN is a stepping stone in their working towards the NWO. **Israel** Svali: The conflict in the Middle East is only to the advantage of the Illuminists. They hate Israel and hope one day to see it destroyed, and are biding their time. One of the olive branches offered by the UN when it takes over is that they will prevent war in the Middle East, and this will be greeted with joy by many. **The Illuminati covertly supply guns and funds to both sides to keep the conflict fuelled.** They are very duplicitous people. They used to funnel guns through the USSR to Palestine, for example, in the name of promoting \"friendliness\" between the USSR and this state and other Arab nations. Then, the US Illuminists would help funnel guns to Israel, for the same reason. These people love the game of chess and see warfare between nations as creating an order out of chaos. The USSR is going to get stronger again. It has too strong a military both openly and covertly to sit quietly and quiescently to the side. In the NWO, they will be stronger than us. All Illuminati military trainers have visited Russia to learn from them. **Is the Illuminati a Jewish conspiracy? ** Svali: Absolutely not. In fact, Hitler and his people (especially Himmler and Goebbels) were top Illuminists. The Illuminati are racist in the extreme, and as a child, I was forced to play \"concentration camp\" both on my farm in Virginia, and also in Europe in isolated camps in Germany. The Jews historically fought against the occult. See Deuteronomy and the Old Testament for how God through the Jewish people tried to cleanse the land of the occult groups that were operating there, such as those who worshipped Baal, Ashtarte, and other Canaanite and Babylonian gods. [From an email to Henry Makow] Yes, there are some very powerful Jewish people in this group.

See Deuteronomy and the Old Testament for how God through the Jewish people tried to cleanse the land of the occult groups that were operating there, such as those who worshipped Baal, Ashtarte, and other Canaanite and Babylonian gods. [From an email to Henry Makow] Yes, there are some very powerful Jewish people in this group. For instance, the Rothschild family literally runs the financial empire in Europe (and indirectly the States), and are a well-known Jewish family. I have also known people whose parents were Jewish diamond merchants in the group, and at every level. But to rise to power in the Illuminati, a Jewish person at night would be forced to renounce their faith and to give their first allegiance to Lucifer and the beliefs of the Illuminati. In return for this betrayal, they believe that power (financial) and rewards come; and in one sense they do, but at too high a price. The nazi/concentration camp mentality is very strong. I was told that Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, and others were high-ranking German members of the group (Himmler was higher than the other two). **[Auschwitz medical experimenter] [Mengele](https://www.insightcourse.net/lessons/14b_mind_control#mengele) was their paid puppet as well. He later worked as a high trainer of the American branch between his periods of hiding in South America.** They honestly believed that they were acting as agents of their 'gods' to exterminate the Jewish race. I am so, so sorry that this group has enacted so many horrors on the earth (and so, so glad that I left it). I have always wondered, though, why some of the highest ranking financial families in the group (baron Rothschild of France is one of the 13 European lords or \"kings\" that run the group in Europe and sits on the World Council) are Jewish, yet the group espouses hatred of their race. **AreTheyRacist?** Svali: Lots of Illuminists have Fourth Reich programming inside. They are racist and have a very \"Aryan\" outlook. They believe strongly in the rule of the \"pure\" and \"intelligent\" by their definitions. In their ceremonies, there will occasionally be minorities killed in ceremonies. Not all Illuminist groups are as fanatically anti-racial as the German branch is, although many are. They are trying to breed a \"genetically superior\" race to rule with their children and descendants. They are also followers of Plato's *Republic*, and believe that they will be the ones to usher in this \"Utopian\" rule with the NWO. In their Utopia, the intelligentsia will rule, and the sheep like masses will follow their leaders. That is their view of the world; that the occult leaders are \"enlightened' and intelligent, while the average person is a \"sheep\" to be led by the nose. **The Cold War** Svali: Russia was never really a threat to us. **Marxism was funded by the Illuminati and espoused as a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali.txt:8:9db05936ba65", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14385, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "they will be the ones to usher in this \"Utopian\" rule with the NWO.

The Illuminati believe strongly in balancing opposing forces, in the pull between opposites. They see history as a complex chess game. They will fund one side, then another, while ultimately out of the chaos and division ..., they are laughing because they are ultimately beyond political parties.** A top western financier will secretly meet with an eastern or Russian \"adversary\" during those years, and have a good laugh at how the \"sheep\" were being deluded. I am sharing here what I was taught and also observed. They are truly an international group, and the group's agenda supersedes any nationalistic feelings. There is also a lot of trading back and forth of members in these groups. A Russian trainer might come to the U.S. for awhile, complete a job, then go back, or vice-versa. **Assassin Training ** Svali: Here is how it is done (and how it was done to me): [1] When the child is 2 years old, place them in a metal cage with electrodes attached. Shock the child severely. [2] Take the child out and place a kitten in its hands. Tell the child to wring the kitten's neck. The child will cry and refuse. [3] Put the child into the cage and shock them until they are dazed and cannot scream any more. [4] Take the child out and tell them again to wring the kitten's neck. This time the child will shake all over, cry, but do it, afraid of the torture. The child will then go into the corner and vomit afterwards, while the adult praises them for \"doing such a good job\". This is the first step. The animals get bigger over time as the child gets older. They will be forced to kill an infant at some point, either a set up or VR (virtual reality), or in reality. They will be taught by age nine to put together a gun, to aim, and fire on target and on command. They will then practice on realistic manikins. They will then practice on animals. They will then practice on \"expendables\" or in VR. They will be highly praised if they do well, and tortured if they don't comply. The older the child or teen, the more advanced the training. By age 15, most children will also be forced to do hand to hand combat in front of spectators (high people come", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali.txt:9:ba0a433cd52c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14386, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "gun, to aim, and fire on target and on command. They will then practice on realistic manikins. They will then practice on animals. They will then practice on \"expendables\" or in VR. They will be highly praised if they do well, and tortured if they don't comply. The older the child or teen, the more advanced the training. By age 15, most children will also be forced to do hand to hand combat in front of spectators (high people come to watch the \"games\" much as the ancient gladiators performed). These matches are rarely done to the death, usually until one child goes down. They use every type of weapon imaginable, and learn to fight for their lives. If a child loses a fight, they are heavily punished by their trainer, who loses \"face\". If they win, they are again praised for being \"strong\" and adept with weapons.** By the time they are 21, they are well trained combat/killing machines with command codes to kill, and they have been tested over and over to prove that they will obey on command.** This is how children in the German Illuminati are brought up, I went through it myself. **Trust in Family** Svali: They tell their children as they are torturing them, \"I am doing this because I love you.\" To them, the greatest love is to make a child strong and fit to lead or to move higher in the group by whatever means it takes. If a leader sees a child and wants it as a prostitute, the loving parents will give it away, happy that their child will rise in status. Also, again, they view betrayal as the greatest good. They will do set up after set up to teach their children to never openly trust others. I remember hundreds of agonizing set ups and betrayals, and hearing when I was betrayed or wounded, \"And such is the heart of man.\" Those doing this to me thought they were teaching me something of value that would help me. And because of the vicious and political nature of the group, in one sense they were right; the naive get stepped on and wounded. I have known parents who tried to spare their children some of this out of love, but often they were overruled by other family members, who viewed these parents as \"weak\" and \"unfit\" to teach their child. **Morale** Svali: **Most of them are wounded, abused victims who don't realize that it is possible to leave the group. There is a lot of discontent in the ranks, and there would be a mass exodus if the members believed it were really possible to get out (and live).** Many of the trainers I knew were not happy with what they did.

They would whisper quietly, or give a look to show that they disagreed with what they had to do. They would resignedly do their jobs in the hope of advancement. Know what one of the biggest carrots offered to those who advance up in the group is? That you don't have to hurt people anymore, and that you can't be abused. Only those higher than you in the group can abuse you, so everyone wants to move up, where the pool of candidates becomes smaller. Of course, people can choose to abuse anyone beneath them, and that motivates. The Illuminati are a very political and back stabbing group, a \"dog eat dog\" mentality. Everyone wants to move up. These are not nice people and they use and manipulate others viciously. They cut their eyeteeth on status, power, and money. They never openly disclose their agenda or their cult activities, as often they are amnesic to them. By day, these are well-respected, \"Christian\" appearing business leaders in the community. The image in the community is all important to an Illuminist. They will do anything to maintain a normal, respected facade, and despise exposure. ** None of the Illuminists that I have known had unkind or evil appearing persona in their daytime lives, although some were dysfunctional, such as being alcoholics. The dissociation that drives the Illuminists is their greatest cover. Many, if not most, of these people are completely unaware of the great evil that they are involved in during the night.** I spent a year intensely deprogramming myself. I was a head programmer, or trainer, so I used my knowledge to undo what was done to me. I also became enraged as I realized that the abuse I had endured (and done to others) was not normal, and was used to manipulate me. My greatest regret is that I was used by this group, after a lifetime of teaching, to be a perpetrator of the worst kind. I used to torture and abuse others, believing that I was \"helping\" them. Now, I realize that what I did was wrong. I have asked God's forgiveness. And I am committed to exposing this group through my writing. I want to add that **the Illuminati are only one of several occult groups that operate in the North American continent. There are many others. **They may do more recruitment and things that I haven't mentioned. The Illuminists tend to have a more scientific and military approach to their programming.

There are many others. **They may do more recruitment and things that I haven't mentioned. The Illuminists tend to have a more scientific and military approach to their programming. Some groups, such as the Templar Knights, do not believe in demonic worship, although they are Luciferian and practice mysteries. Each group has its own agenda. I can only speak for the Illuminati in the areas of the U.S. and Europe that I lived in. **TV** Svali: Remember those studies that stated that \"TV violence doesn't affect children's behaviour\" years ago? Guess who funded them? They are a bunch of bullcrud. What a person watches DOES influence them, and this is well known by the behaviourists in the group. In fact, they know that TV is a tool that they purposely use to influence \"the masses\". It cannot create a total personality change in the average citizen, but it can desensitize us increasingly to violence, pornography and the occult, and influence the perceptions of young children. **Pop Music ** Svali: I believe that Brittany Spears, Eminem, and others are being used by them to sing lyrics they like. Ever notice that Eminem wears a Neo-Nazi look and sings hate lyrics? This is not by chance. In fact, many of the top pop singers come from an internship with the \"Mickey Mouse club\" (yep, good old Walt and the Illuminist's Empire), and I believe they are offered stardom in exchange for allegiance or mind control. **Illuminati Weaknesses ** Svali: 1. **Their arrogance is their weakness.** These people think they are untouchable, and this could make them careless. 2. If by a miracle enough people took this seriously and started organizing in some way to stop the Illuminati take over, with prayer and God's guidance, perhaps they could be stopped. I hope so with all of my heart. 3. Stopping pornography and child prostitution and drug smuggling and gun running would take out a huge chunk of their profits. Maybe they would slow down. **Public's Denial Mechanism** Svali: The evidence is there, but in my opinion, the average person does not want to know, and even when confronted with it, will look the other way. The [Franklin case](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence) is a point. How much evidence has come out? Or the [MK-ULTRA documents](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse) that have been declassified, shown as real, and people ignore it.

In fact, how can a person face the fact of great evil in mankind, unless they have either a strong faith in God, or are faced with insurmountable evidence? We as human beings want to believe the best of our race, not the worst, IMHO. **The Illuminists don't care who prints this stuff or if they are \"exposed\", because they are counting on the majority not believing it, having done a pretty good job with a media blitz campaign. **Seen any articles in *Newsweek* or *Time* that addresses this other than as a laughable conspiracy theory? Guess who owns Time-Warner? I have heard them laughing about this very thing in leadership meetings five years ago, and I doubt their attitude has changed much since then. If people did believe this, if action could be taken, then I would be very surprised and quite happy. **Important Note:** Numerous serious researchers into these matters are convinced that there are many competing factions within \"the Family.\" It is suspected that Svali was involved in one of the most aggressive and sadistic factions. If this is true, then the above descriptions relate some of the worst behavior of this group. There are almost certainly other factions which are much less focused on torture and dominance.

Needless to say I had some questions of my own regarding details of the Illuminati and their agenda, and so I got in touch with 'Svali' (her pseudonym), an ex-Illuminati programmer/trainer, to find out more about her claims. HJ Springer ** Part 1: About Svali** Dear Mr. Springer, Thank you for contacting me. Actually, I just received a somewhat skeptical email today from someone who read the information at your site. I would be more than happy to answer questions about validity, etc. with the following provision. I write under a pen name to protect my two children and husband, whom I do not want to have receiving hostile or threatening phone calls, etc. My two children are still healing from the experiences of being raised in the group as well, and I don't want any experiences that could traumatize them. The topic I am addressing is somewhat volatile, to say the least. People have strong emotions pro and con as to whether the Illuminati are real. That said, I will give you a little background info, feel free to share this with readers. Also, [my column at Suite101.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20110519192605/http://www.suite101.com/articles.cfm/ritual_abuse) has numerous articles on this topic if people want to learn more. 1. I was born in 1957 in Alexandria, Virginia. I lived briefly in a small town about an hour away from Washington, DC, then moved to a 500 acre farm in northern Virginia when my mother married my stepfather. Both my mother and my stepfather were members of this group. It is a very generational group. My mother sat on the regional council over the Washington, DC area and was in the \"spiritual chair\" (**the Illuminati have 6 chairs on their ascended masters", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_about.txt:0:09ed52068ac8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14392, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_about.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_about", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "born in 1957 in Alexandria, Virginia.

My mother sat on the regional council over the Washington, DC area and was in the \"spiritual chair\" (**the Illuminati have 6 chairs on their ascended masters council: Sciences, Government, Leadership, Scholarship, Spiritual, and Military**). These also correlate to the areas that children are taught growing up in this group. They believe in \"well rounded\" children. The \"spiritual\" rituals, or occult rituals, were only one small part of the teaching of this group. The other five areas are also equally emphasized. I spent more time learning history, languages, and sciences than I did seeing rituals, although they were important to the group. 2. I went to school in Charlottesville, Va. 1975 to 1981, where I received a BSN in nursing, and a BA in Spanish (I got two degrees). This is also a place where a lot of intense abuse and occultic crimes occurred on an estate about 10 miles south west of Charlottesville going towards Crowley, Virginia. 3. After graduation, I went to San Diego in 1981. I was called there by the leadership there. They were strong in military training but weak in sciences, which was my forte. I came and sat on leadership council. **I was the sixth head trainer there (the lowest head trainer) and had 30 trainers in the local groups reporting to me.** Leadership council met in Ramona, Ca. on an estate there that belonged to a man named Jonathan Meiers. When I went to the police in 1996 (after I had left the group) sure enough, there was an estate there belonging to someone with that name. One of his cult names was \"Black Hand\" because he wore black gloves when he worked with people. He was the head trainer in the group, and one of the most sadistic and brutal people I ever knew. He burned out most of the trainers that worked with him, and I made it because I had a friend on leadership council who hated him and helped me undermine him (the Illuminati are a very political and back stabbing group, a \"dog eat dog\" mentality; everyone wants to move up). Her cult name was Athena. **After years (12) of working with Jonathan, I moved up to the second head trainer position in the county.** Jonathan was getting ready to move to regional, and he wanted me to take his place. But he and I also despised each other, and he set me up to take a fall.

That's a whole different story, and was one of the factors that made me leave the group. **I left the group in 1995, sick of the lying, deceiving, and politics, and fearful for my life.** I fled to Texas, and went through therapy with Dr. Jerry Mundgaze and his group. But unfortunately, they didn't know how to help \"deprogram me\", or as Dr. Mundgaze told me, \"you are higher than almost anyone we have seen, and more programmed.\" I remembered so much, and he had never heard of it and had no idea how to help (definitely no suggesting of memories there, most of mine occurred spontaneously, AT HOME. I have never been hypnotized or age regressed, all of my memories have occurred in the course of daily life). **I spent a year intensely deprogramming myself. I was a head programmer, or trainer, so I used my knowledge to undo what was done to me. I also became enraged as I realized that the abuse I had endured (and done to others) was NOT normal, was used to manipulate me, etc.** My book is based on my memories as an ADULT in this group. I was a perpetrator, and I now regret it considerably. It is my restitution before God as I expose what this group does and stands for. I also wrote it for therapists, to help them understand the group and its methodologies, since it was so difficult to hear from a nationally known ritual abuse center, \"we don't know what to do...\". I based it on what I did to heal. Two years ago, my children were on visitation with me and disclosed their abuse to me. I went to CPS, and the case was closed, because the worker said she didn't believe in ritual abuse! My ex came to get the children (he could have put me in federal prison for not giving the children back, since the San Diego court system blatantly states that they do not believe in ritual abuse, and in EVERY case of alleged RA, the children are given to the allegedly abusing parent). The children confronted him in person. He turned white as a sheet, said, \"you really don't want to go back to 'family'?\" They said \"no\". He then fled to California, quit his job, and moved out here and is in therapy for RA and DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder). My children are also in therapy, and healing rapidly.

My now 12 year old son is almost completely integrated, and happier than he has ever been before; my 16 year old daughter has some tough issues to face, such as the sexual abuse she endured. But God has been faithful in His healing work in all of our lives. **I wish that this was just \"made up\". That it weren't real. But it is. There is too much documentation of this occurring (I can send you an URL for documented convicted RA cases). My greatest regret is that I was used by this group, after a lifetime of teaching, to be a perpetrator of the worst kind. I used to torture and abuse others, believing that I was \"helping\" them.** Now, I realize that what I did was wrong, I have asked God's forgiveness. And I am committed to exposing this group through my writing. I am also a professional writer in the medical field, was a registered nurse for 18+ years, and currently work as an ESL teacher, health educator, and freelance author (on non-abuse topics!). I hope this is enough background info, it is the truth before God and men. If you need any other that won't compromise my anonymity or my children's protection, please let me know. PS. My younger sister remembers being tied up on a stone altar at the age of 3 with a gag in her mouth and being raped. She also remembers our paternal grandmother taking her to friends who used her sexually at the ages of 3 to 5. She became an alcoholic at age 13, after trying to commit suicide 7 times by age 12. My older brother has NO memories of ANYTHING AT ALL before age 20. His life is a complete blank. He does believe that our father was a perverse and strange man. This brother was cut down from our garage when he was 8 and tried to hang himself. My oldest brother is on the run, afraid to live anywhere for more than a few months, because he believes they want to \"get him.\" He also tried to commit suicide many times as a young child. This is somewhat corroborating evidence, as well as the fact that both of my children dream in German at night (that is the language they speak in the Illuminati) and have NEVER heard it in the daytime. **Note: **To learn more about Svali and Illuminati Bloodlines, see the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_about.txt:3:139a321111e4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14395, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_about.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_about", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "the run, afraid to live anywhere for more than a few months, because he believes they want to \"get him.\" He also tried to commit suicide many times as a young child.

Both I and my entire family were involved in a cult group until several years ago, when we broke free. I used to be a programmer in the cult. Now I want to share the knowledge that I have to help others. It is possible to break free of cult abuse for those involved. It is a long, heart-breaking process, but well worth it. In the chapters below, **I hope to help the survivor of cult abuse find tools to help in their journey towards freedom. ** **I have been a consultant to an on-line survivors group that helps people dealing with issues related to cult programming and becoming free for the past year and a half.** I myself have been in therapy for ritual abuse and DID [Dissociative Identity Disorder, also know as Multiple Personality Disorder or MPD] for nine years, with the last five being aware of the recent cult abuse.

I am also a writer and a registered nurse. I currently work as a diabetic educator in Texas 20 hours a week. I self-published this book on breaking free of cult programming, which several experts in the field have said has invaluable information for the survivor of ritual abuse. **Note:** For more about Svali, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali_about). **Appendix ** **Equipment Frequently Used by Trainers** It may help therapists to realize the equipment that trainers use. If their client describes these items, which may appear quite sophisticated, believe them. The cult has become quite technologically advanced. **Training room:** The average training room is a neutral colored room, with walls painted either a dull gray, white, or beige. Some may be painted in various colors, as part of color coding. They are often located in secret underground rooms, or basements of large private residences, and will be entered from the main building through a covered doorway. Impromptu training rooms may be set up during military exercises outdoors, in covered canvas tents. **Trainers:** The Illuminati have a rule - there must always be a minimum of two trainers working with a person. This prevents a trainer from being either too severe, or permissive, or developing too close a bond with the subject; the watchful eye of the other trainer prevents this. Younger trainers are paired with older, more experienced trainers. The older trainer will teach the younger, who does most of the actual work. If the younger is unable to finish a task, or loses heart, the older one will step in. **Head trainers:** Will teach, they will also work with the council leaders and hierarchy. All members are required to come in for a \"tune up\" (reinforcing programming), even top leaders, from time to time. **EEG machine:** Will often have abbreviated hookups for quick use. Used extensively with brain wave programming; also to verify that a certain alter is out when called up. May be used to verify deep trance state before initiating deep programming. Trainers are taught to read these readouts. **Trainer's table:** A large table, frequently steel covered with plastic, or easily cleaned material. On the sides at intervals are restraints for arms, legs, neck to prevent movement. **Trainer's chair:** Large chair with arm", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:1:372cf901cc9f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14398, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "machine:** Will often have abbreviated hookups for quick use.

On the sides at intervals are restraints for arms, legs, neck to prevent movement. **Trainer's chair:** Large chair with arm rests. Will have restraints as above at intervals to restrain movement while person sits in chair. **Shock equipment:** Models and types are quite varied, depending on age and company. Most have a set of rubber covered wires, with electrodes that may be connected with Velcro, rubber (steel tips imbedded under finger and toe nail beds), or gel pads (larger body areas such as chest, arms, legs). Some are tiny electrodes, which can be taped next to eyes, or placed within genitalia. These are connected to the \"shock box\", which has controls that can determine amount of electricity, and frequency, if interval shocks are desired. **Drugs:** Any number of opiates, barbiturates, hypnotics, sedatives, anesthetic agents. Resuscitative drugs and antidotes are also kept, clearly labeled and indexed. Many drugs, especially experimental ones, are only known by code names, such as \"alphin 1\". **CPR equipment:** In case a person has an adverse reaction to drugs or programming. At times, a child alter will come out inadvertently during a programming sequence, and will be overdosed with the drugs meant for adult alters. The trainers must give it the antidote, and resuscitate it, just as if a real child is out. They are well aware of this fact, and will severely punish child alters to teach them to come out only when called out. **Virtually reality headsets:** The keystone in recent years. Many programming sequences utilize holographic images and virtual reality set ups, including assassination programs, where the person realistically \"kills\" another human being. These virtual disks are far more advanced than those in video arcades. **Body building equipment:** Used in military training to increase fitness, lean body mass. **Steel instruments:** Used to insert into orifices, cause pain. **Stretch machine:** Used as punishment, \"stretches \" person without breaking bones. Extremely painful. **Trainer's grids and projectors:** Used to project grids on wall or ceiling. **Movie projector:** To show movies, although new VR disks are replacing these. **Computer:** Collect and analyze data; keep computer grid on person's system. Current military computer access codes will be used to download into governmental computers. **Trainers journals:** Contain indexed copies of subject's systems, including key alters, command codes, etc. **Comfort objects:** Used to comfort subject afterwards. May be toy or candy for child alters, or oils for massage. Warm towels or beverages may be given, as the trainer \"bonds with\" and comforts the person they worked with.

May be toy or candy for child alters, or oils for massage. Warm towels or beverages may be given, as the trainer \"bonds with\" and comforts the person they worked with. This is probably the most important part of the training process, as the trainer explains calmly and kindly how well the person did, and how proud they are of them. **Chapter 1** **An Overview of the Illuminati ** In order to understand Illuminati cult programming, it is first necessary to understand a bit about the structure and philosophy of the organization. The Illuminati are a group of people who follow a philosophy known as \"Illuminism\" or \"enlightenment\". **The Illuminati were named several hundred years ago, but trace their roots and history to the ancient mystery religions of Egypt, ancient Babylon, and even Mesopotamia. **Out of these ancient religions, which were practiced secretly over hundreds and hundreds of years, there arose esoteric groups which continued to practice the rites, traditions, and enculturation brought in from the original groups. Over the centuries, these groups practiced openly in some countries, and covertly in countries where Christianity or other religions opposed their practices. Some of the groups which came out of these ancient roots included the order of the Knights Templar, Rosicrucians, Baphometism, and Druidic cults. These groups were the forerunners, or roots, of modern day Illuminism. The original Illuministic leaders chose to take what they felt were the best practices of each root religion, combine them into principles, then organized these principles according to specific guidelines. **Modern day Illuminism is a philosophy funded by the wealthy, but practiced in all social strata. It is a philosophy whose tenets have spread across the world. It started with the German branch of Rosicrucians, spread to England, then came to the United States with the first settlers. ** **The Illuminati have three main branches: the Germanic branch, which oversees the others; the British branch, which handles finances; and the French/Russian branch.** All three branches are represented in both the United States and Canada, as well as every country in the world. **Hierarchy of the Illuminati ** The Illuminati have organized their society along extremely hierarchical or stratified levels. In fact, the top levels are known as: **Hierarchical level: **The Illuminati have divided the United States into 7 geographical regions. Each region has its own regional council composed of 13 members, with an advisory board of three elders to each one. These regions interact for purposes of finances, personnel, teaching, etc. Beneath each regional council is a local council. This is a council of 13 members, the head of whom sits", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:3:254783595a82", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14400, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "their society along extremely hierarchical or stratified levels.

These regions interact for purposes of finances, personnel, teaching, etc. Beneath each regional council is a local council. This is a council of 13 members, the head of whom sits on the regional council and gives it information about the local groups underneath his leadership. The local council will also have an advisory council made up of three members. A local leadership council in a large metropolitan area might look like this: Head of local council (reports to regional council) Two intermediaries (report all activities under leader to him) Four administrators (oversee finances, administer and set up group activities) Six head trainers (over trainers in local groups, teach other trainers) Underneath the above leadership council will be six people designated as informers or intermediaries who go to the local group meetings, interact with local group leaders, and report to the leadership council. **Anarchical level:** The levels below the leadership council are known as the anarchical levels. Underneath the intermediate level, is the local group level. It will look like this: Local \"sister groups\" (will vary in number, according to the size of the city, or cities in the area). A large metropolitan area may have anywhere from ten to twenty seven groups. Each sister group will be headed up by: A high priest and priestess: this job is rotated every three years to allow different people within the group to take on leadership roles. Each group will also have different members with specific roles/jobs within the group. These roles will be addressed in [Chapter 2.](#2) One thing that I would like to emphasize is the fact that the Illuminati today are generational. There members are born into the group, which is highly organized, as described above. The set up discussed above is representative, with minor variations, of most major metropolitan regions of the United States. Smaller population centers will be organized under similar guidelines, but will be umbrellaed together with several cities within the region to create the local leadership council. **How the Illuminati are organized in the United States** **The Illuminati have groups in every major city of the United States. They originally entered the U.S. through Pittsburgh, Pa., and from there spread across the US..** There are 18 cities in the U.S. which are considered major \"power centers\" for Illuminati power and/or influence. These include: Washington, DC and the surrounding areas; Pittsburgh, Pa.; Albany, NY; Minneapolis, Minn.; Ann Arbor, Mich.; Wichita, Kan.; the \"golden triangle\" of the Winston Salem, Raleigh, NC area; Atlanta, Ga.; New Orleans, La.; and Springfield, Miss.; Houston, Tex.; Phoenix, Az.; Flagstaff, Az.; Seattle, Wash.;", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:4:1a2acded5647", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14401, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "United States.

Other cities are important to the Illuminati, but the above cities funnel money for them, conduct research, and regional councils often sit within them. **How the Illuminati Make Money** The Illuminati are involved in many areas of making money as they need continued financing to survive. There are several illegal enterprises that they are involved in, as well as legal ones. **Drug running:** The Illuminati linked up with the Mafia and the Columbians years ago to help each other out with bringing drugs into the United States. They also provide couriers for taking drugs and money out of the States. The Illuminists are generally wealthy businessmen, who have four layers of people underneath them. The fourth layer down actually has contact with the people in the drug industry. They never identify themselves as Illuminists; only as people interested in investing with a guaranteed profit. They are highly secretive. In return, the local groups supply people willing to be couriers of money or drugs, or people willing to help cover for the local operations. **Pornography:** The Illuminati are linked in many cities with pornography, prostitution (adult and children, and white slavery sales. Again, several layers are present as a buffer between the true \"management\" and those either engaged in the activities, or in paying for/funding and eventually being paid for the activities. **Children:** Children are often supplied from the local cult groups and taught to be child prostitutes (and later adult prostitutes). They are photographed and filmed in every type of pornography available, including snuff films and violent films. **Gun running:** The Illuminati and other groups are also involved in international gun sales and shipments. The Illuminists have well trained couriers who will cross international and state lines. These couriers are highly secretive and will not reveal their sources on pain of suicide or assassination. These people are accountable to others above them, with two more \"buffer layers\" of people above these, before we get to the person in the Illuminati with money, who helps fund this. **Buying access codes for military computers:** The Illuminati will have people from all strata of civilian life trained to go and make pickups near or on military bases.

A typical person used might be the innocent looking wife of a military person, a local businessman, or even a college student. There is a contact inside the base, also a dissociative Illuminist, who brings the information to the outside contact. Occasionally, the contact person is paid with money, information, or goods. The military computer codes are changed on random schedules. The Illuminati have at least 5 or 6 contacts on each major base who alert them when the codes are getting ready to change. The Illuminists like having access to military computers, because that will gain them entrance to closed files the world over. **Hiring and selling assassinations:** This is done worldwide, though more in Europe than in the States. These people are paid big money to do either a private or political assassination. The money is paid either to the assassin or to the trainer. Usually they both divide the fee. The assassin is offered protection in another country for awhile, until the trail runs cold. If the kill is done in Europe, they may be sent to the far east or the U.S., and vice versa if the kill is done in the U.S. The Illuminati have a wide range of places and false identities to hide these people, unless for some reason they want the assassin disposed. Then, he/she is caught and immediately executed. **Mercenaries/military trainers:** Guess who gets paid money to come in and train paramilitary groups? Who has training camps all over the states of Montana, Nevada, and North Dakota? Who occasionally will offer their expertise in return for a large financial reward? They never advertise themselves as Illuminati, unless the group is known to be sympathetic to their cause. Instead, these are tough, cold, brutal military trainers, who offer to teach these groups in return for money, or even better, a promise to affiliate with their group in return (loyalty in return for knowledge). More and more paramilitary groups have been brought into the Illuminati this way, without their full knowledge of who and what the group really is. This gives the Illuminists a way to monitor these groups (their trainers report on them and their activities), and it can be useful to have trained military groups that they can call on someday. **Banking:** The original Illuminists were bankers. They have highly trained financiers to organize their money and funnel the above illicit funds into more \"respectable\" front groups/ organizations. They will also start benevolent charities, community organizations, etc., as fronts, and funnel the money from a broad base into", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:6:d087ae63bfc0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14403, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "gives the Illuminists a way to monitor these groups (their trainers report on them and their activities), and it can be useful to have trained military groups that they can call on someday. **Banking:** The original Illuminists were bankers.

They will also start benevolent charities, community organizations, etc., as fronts, and funnel the money from a broad base into these groups. The Illuminati particularly pride themselves on their money making and manipulation skills, and on their ability to cover their paper trails expertly through multiple layers. These are some of the major money making enterprises that the Illuminati are engaged in. **All trails in banking eventually will lead to Belgium, the Illuminati financial center for the world. **They have a wealth of financial resources backing their enterprises, which means that in reality they can engage the best lawyers, accountants, etc. to help cover their trail, as well. **Chapter Two** **Jobs in the Illuminati (or Why They Spend All That Time Training People) ** To understand generational programming, it helps to understand why the cult goes to the amount of trouble that it does to place programming into people. Training represents time and effort, and no one - especially a cult member - will spend that amount of energy unless there will be a return on the investment. This will be a simple overview of some of the more common jobs in the cult. It is not meant to be exhaustive or in any way considered to be complete. **The cult has a very organized hierarchy of jobs.** Like any large organization, it needs people who are well trained in their jobs in order to run smoothly - so well trained, that they can do their tasks without even thinking about them. To maintain secrecy, this group must also have people completely dedicated to not revealing their roles in the cult - under threat of punishment or even death. The cult wants members who are completely loyal to the group and its tenets, and who never question the orders they are given. These qualities in group members ensure the continuance of the cult and that its secrets are never revealed to the outside world. Here is a sampling of some jobs in the cult (not listed in order of priority) **Informers:** These people are trained to observe details and conversations with photographic recall. They are trained to report to their local cult leader or hierarchy, or trainer, and will download large amounts of information under hypnotic trance. Detailed knowledge of conversations or even documents can often be retrieved in this manner. They are often used as \"plants\" to gather information in both governmental settings, and within the cult meetings. **Breeders:** These people are often chosen from childhood to have and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:7:cc64166a9469", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14404, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "**Informers:** These people are trained to observe details and conversations with photographic recall.

They are often used as \"plants\" to gather information in both governmental settings, and within the cult meetings. **Breeders:** These people are often chosen from childhood to have and breed children. They may be chosen according to bloodlines, or given in arranged marriages or cult alliances to \"elevate\" the children. A parent will often sell the services of a child as a breeder to the local cult leader in return for favors or status. These children are rarely used as a sacrifice. Usually they are given to others in the cult to adopt or raise, but the breeder is told that any child born to her was \"sacrificed\" to prevent her looking for the child. In anarchical cults, a local leader or parent will occasionally have a child as the result of an incestuous liaison. Such a child is given away or killed, but the mother will be told the child was given away to a distant branch. **Prostitutes:** Prostitutes can be a male or female of any age. They are trained from earliest childhood to give sexual favors to one or more adults in return for payment to the child's parents or their local cult group. Occasionally, the prostitute may be given to a member of the cult on a temporary basis as a reward for a job well done. Child prostitution is a big business for the cult, and training very young children in this role is taken very seriously. Child prostitutes are also used to blackmail political figures or leadership outside the cult. **Pornography:** A child used in pornography (which may include bestiality) can also be of any age or sex. Child pornography is also big business in the cult and includes snuff films. Children are trained in this role from preschool on, often with the help or approval of the child's parents. The parents are paid or given favors by the cult in return for selling their child or allowing their child to be trained in this area. **Media personnel:** These are very bright, verbal people. They will be sent to journalism school and will work for local or regional media upon graduation. These individuals have many contacts within the organization as well as the outside world. They write books and articles sympathetic to the Illuministic viewpoint without ever revealing their true affiliation. They will tend to do biased research in their articles, favoring only one viewpoint, such as denying the existence of DID or ritual abuse. For instance, they will interview only psychiatrists/psychologists sympathetic to this viewpoint and will skew data to present a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:8:3721baba60b8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14405, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "work for local or regional media upon graduation.

For instance, they will interview only psychiatrists/psychologists sympathetic to this viewpoint and will skew data to present a convincing picture to the general public. If necessary, they will outright lie or make up data to support their viewpoint. There are members of groups whose people have been purposely trained to try and help formulate public opinion on the nonexistence of the cult (i.e., cults don't exist, no rational person would believe this \"mass hysteria\").** The Illuminists believe that to control the media is to control the thinking of the masses. **For this reason, they take training media personnel quite seriously. **Helpers at rituals:** Cleaners clean up meticulously after rituals. They will scour the site after a ceremony, rake the area, etc. They are taught this job from preschool years on. **Preparers:** Set up tables, cloths, candles, and paraphernalia quickly and efficiently. This job is learned from infancy on. **Readers:** Read from the book of Illumination or local group archives. They also keep copies of sacred literature in a safe vault and are trained in ancient languages. Readers are valued for their clear speaking voices and ability to dramatize important passages and bring them to life. **Cutters:** Are taught to dissect animal or human sacrifices (they are also known as the \"slicers and dicers\" of the cult). They can do a kill quickly, emotionlessly, and efficiently. They are trained from early childhood on. **Chanters:** Sing, sway, or lead choruses of sacred songs on high holy occasions. **High Priest/Priestess:** The person who holds this job is changed every few years in most groups, although it may be held longer in smaller, more rural groups. These people administrate and lead their local cult group as well as coordinate jobs within the cult, give assignments, and pass on meeting dates given from the local hierarchy or leadership council. They also will activate the local group's telephone tree, evaluate their local group members for job performance, and lead in all spiritual activities. They report to the local or regional leadership council over their group. **Trainers:** These people teach local group members their assigned jobs and monitor the performance of these jobs at local group meetings or after an assigned task. These people report to the high priest/priestess over their group, as well as to the local head trainer on leadership council. **Punishers:** These are the people who brutally punish/discipline members caught breaking rules or acting outside of or above their authority.

They are universally despised by other cult members, although they will be praised for a job well done by the local high priest or priestess. Usually physically strong, they will employ any method deemed necessary to prevent a recurrence of the undesired behavior. Punishment may be public or private, depending upon the severity of the infraction. Each local group has several punishers. **Trackers:** These people will track down and keep an eye on members who attempt to leave their local group. They are taught to use dogs, guns, tasers, and all necessary tracking techniques. They are also adept at using the internet to monitor a person's activities. They will track credit card use, checks written, and employ other methods to find a missing person. **Teachers:** These people teach group classes to children to indoctrinate cult philosophy, languages, and specialized areas of endeavor. **Child care:** These people care for very young children when the adults are at local group meeting. Usually care is for young infants only. After age two, children are routinely engaged in some form of group activity led by trainers of the youngest children. Infant child care workers are usually quiet and coldly efficient. **Couriers:** These members run guns, money, drugs, or illegal artifacts across state or national lines. Usually they are people who are young and single without outside accountability. They are trained in the use of firearms to get out of difficult situations. They must be reliable and able to get past any anticipated barriers. **Commanding officers: **These people oversee military training in the local groups and help ensure the smooth running of these exercises. They will delegate jobs to those ranking under them and are responsible to the local leadership council. The council will have at least one member on it representing the military branch of the Illuminati. In addition, there are many military-related jobs beneath the commanding officers. **Behavioral scientists:** These individuals often oversee the training in local and regional groups. These students of human behavior are intensely involved in data collection and human experimentation in the name of the pursuit of knowledge of human behavior in the scientific realm. They are almost universally cold, methodical, impersonal people, and will employ any methods to study trauma and its effects on the human personality.

The cult spends quite a bit of its time getting people to do these jobs for them for free, which is why they program people to believe they are doing their \"family\" and the world a service. The reality, of course, is that the individual is being abused and taken advantage of by the cult. **Chapter Three** **The Illuminati Plan to Rule the World (aka \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\") ** Prior to discussing actual programming techniques, it is important to understand the philosophy underlying Illuminist programming. All groups have goals, and the Illuminists are no exception. Money making is not their final goal - it is a means to an end. **This end point, or goal, is no less than to rule the world. **The Illuminati has a set plan similar to the former Soviet Union's 5-year and 10-year plans. This is what the Illuminists themselves believe and teach their followers as gospel truth. **Whether they will actually succeed is another matter altogether.** The following is the Illuminist agenda at all levels of the Illuminati. As with any goal, the Illuminati has specific steps which it plans to implement to reach its objectives. Briefly, each region of the United States has \"nerve centers\" or power bases for regional activity. The United States has been divided up into seven major geographical regions. Each region has localities within it that contain military compounds and bases that are hidden in remote, isolated areas or on large private estates. These bases are used intermittently to teach and train generational Illuminati in military techniques; hand-to-hand combat, crowd control, use of arms, and all aspects of military warfare. Why? Because **the Illuminists believe that our government, as we know it, as well as the governments of most nations around the world, are destined to collapse. These will be planned collapses**, and they will occur in the following ways: **The Illuminati has planned first for a financial collapse that will make the great depression look like a picnic.** This will occur through the maneuvering of the great banks and financial institutions of the world, and through stock manipulation and interest rate changes. Most people will be indebted to the federal government through bank and credit card debt, etc. The governments will recall all debts immediately, but most people will be unable to pay and will be bankrupted. This will cause generalized financial panic, which will occur simultaneously worldwide, as the Illuminists firmly believe in controlling people", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:11:c69821f12644", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14408, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "a picnic.** This will occur through the maneuvering of the great banks and financial institutions of the world, and through stock manipulation and interest rate changes. Most people will be indebted to the federal government through bank and credit card debt, etc. The governments will recall all debts immediately, but most people will be unable to pay and will be bankrupted. This will cause generalized financial panic, which will occur simultaneously worldwide, as the Illuminists firmly believe in controlling people through finances. **Next there will be a military takeover, region by region, as the government declares a state of emergency and martial law.** People will have panicked. There will be an anarchical state in most localities, and the government will justify its move as being necessary to control panicked citizens. The cult trained military leaders and people under their direction will use arms as well as crowd control techniques to implement this new state of affairs. This is why so many survivors under 36 years of age report having military programming. People who are not Illuminists or who are not sympathetic to their cause will resist. The Illuminists expect this and will be (and are being) trained in how to deal with this eventuality. They are training their people in hand-to-hand combat, crowd control, and if necessary, will kill to control crowds. The Illuminati is training their people to be prepared for every possible reaction to the takeover. **Many mind control victims will also be called into duty with preset command codes. **These codes are meant to call out a new, completely cult loyal presenting system. Shatter codes programmed under trauma will be used to destroy or bury non-cult loyal alters. Military bases will be set up in each locality. Actually they are already here, but are covert. In the next few years, they will go above ground and be revealed. Each locality will have regional bases and leaders to which they are accountable. The hierarchy will closely reflect the current covert hierarchy. **When I left the Illuminati about five years ago, approximately 1% of the U.S. population was either part of the Illuminati, sympathetic to it, or a victim of mind control** (and therefore considered useable). While this may not sound like many, imagine 1% of the population highly trained in the use of armaments, crowd control, psychological and behavioral techniques, armed with weapons and linked to paramilitary groups. These people will also be completely dedicated to their cause. The Illuminati firmly believes that it can easily overcome the other 99% of the population, most of whom are untrained, or poorly trained, such as \"weekend hunters.\" Even the local military will be overcome as the Illuminati will have regional cell groups with highly trained leaders.

They also count on the element of surprise helping them during their takeover. Many of the highest leaders in the militia branch of the Illuminati are or have been officers in the military, and so already have a good knowledge of which techniques will work best to overcome a region's or locality's defenses. **After the military takeover, the general population will be given a chance to either espouse the Illuminati's cause or reject it, with imprisonment, pain, even death being possible punishments for rejection. ** **These people very much believe that the intelligent, or \"enlightened\" or Illuminated, were born to rule.** They are arrogant and consider the general population as \"dumb sheep\" who will be easily led if offered strong leadership, financial help in an unstable world economy, and dire consequences if a person rebels. Their utter ruthlessness and ability to implement this agenda should not be minimized. **The Illuminati banking leaders, such as the Rothschilds, the Vanderbilts, the Rockefellers, the Carnegies, and the Mellons, will reveal themselves and offer to \"save\" the floundering world economy.** A new system of monetary exchange founded on an international monetary system, and based between Cairo, Egypt, and Brussels, Belgium, will be set up. A true \"one world economy\", creating the longed for \"one world order\", will become reality. There is more to the Illuminist agenda, but these are the basics of it. This agenda is what the Illuminati really, truly, believe, teach, and train for. They are willing to give their lives up in this cause, and even to teach the next generation, as they believe that their children are their legacy. I was told that my children's generation would see this takeover sometime in the 21st century. At present, the Illuminati have quietly and covertly fostered their takeover plan by their goals of the infiltration of: The media The banking system The educational system The government, both local and federal The sciences The churches They are currently and have been working the last several hundred years on taking over these six areas. They do *not* go to an institution and say \"Hi, I'm a local Illuminist, and I'd like to take over your bank. Instead,** they begin by having several people quietly invest funds over several years, gradually buying more and more shares in the bank (or other institution that they wish to control), until they have a financial controlling interest in it. **They never openly disclose their agenda or their cult activities, as often they are amnesic to them.

These are well respected, \"Christian\" appearing business leaders in the community. The image in the community is all important to an Illuminist. They will do anything to maintain a normal, respected facade, and *despise* exposure. On one leadership council in a major metropolitan city where I was a member, there sat: one head of the local small business administration; one CEO of a government defense firm; one principal of a Christian school; one vice mayor of the city; one journalist; one nurse; one doctor; one behavioral psychologist, one army colonel, and one navy commander. **All except one attended church weekly; all were well respected within the community. *None* of them appeared \"evil\" or \"marked\". ** If you met them in person, you would probably instantly like any of these intelligent, verbal, likeable, even charismatic people. This is their greatest cover, since we often expect great evil to \"appear\" evil, led by media portrayals of evil as causing changes in the face and demeanor of people, or marking them like the biblical Cain. **None of the Illuminists that I have known had unkind or evil appearing persona in their daytime lives, although some were dysfunctional, such as being alcoholics. The dissociation that drives the Illuminists is their greatest cover for being undetected at this time. Many, if not most, of these people are completely unaware of the great evil that they are involved in during the night.** There are other groups that are not actually part of the Illuminati of which they are aware. The Illuminati are not the only group that follows esoteric practices or worships ancient deities or demons. **They encourage divisiveness between different groups (divide and conquer is one of their ruling principles).** They will often welcome them into their umbrella, if possible. This has been happening more and more in recent years, as the Illuminati trade teaching their training principles, which are considered the best by most secretive groups, in exchange for loyalty to the Illuminati. They will send their trainers to these groups, and the trainers will report to the local regional council. In the political arena the Illuminists will fund both sides of a race, because their greatest maxim is that \"out of chaos comes order\".

I no longer agree with this philosophy, but at one time I did, with all my heart. Hopefully, as these people and their agenda are exposed, the common man will rise up against this intended rule to be foisted upon an unsuspecting mankind. **Chapter Four** **How the Illuminati Program People: An Overview of Some Basic Types of Programming** In the first few chapters, I defined Illuminism, its reach, and some of the philosophy, money making enterprises, and agendas that help explain why they program people. I believe that these are important to understand, as a preface to the next few chapters. Why? Using the programming techniques that I will describe, it takes an incredible amount of effort, time, dedication, and planning on the part of the cult to implant these programs in an individual. Only a very motivated group of people would spend the time it takes to do this. **These chapters are very hard for me to write, as my role in the cult was that of a programmer. So the very techniques you will be reading about were often those that I used to place programming in individuals that I worked with.** I no longer do these things, nor do I espouse doing them. The reason I am writing this book is that I believe that therapists who work with DID, as well as survivors, deserve to know what is done to people, how it is done, as well as be given some ideas on how to undo the programming that the cult places in people. **Unintentional Programming** First, I would like to address unintentional programming versus intentional programming. This is also known as the environmental milieu the child is raised in. The programming of a generational Illuminati infant often begins before its birth (this will be addressed later), but once it is born, **the very environment the infant is raised in becomes a form of programming. ** Often, the infant is raised in a family environment that combines daytime abandonment with dysfunction in the parental figures. **The infant soon learns that the nighttime and cult activities are the truly important ones.** The infant may be deprived of attention, or even abused, in the daytime; and is only treated as special, or \"seen\" by the parent, in the cult setting.

This can lead to very young alters around the core or core splits, who feel invisible, abandoned, rejected, unworthy of love or attention, or that they don't even exist, unless they are doing a job for their \"family\". Another milieu and conditioning process the infant must face is that the adults around him/her are inconsistent, since the adults in a generational cult family are almost always also multiple, or DID. This sets up a reality for the infant/toddler that the parents act one way at home; an entirely different way at cult gatherings; and yet a different way in normal society. Since these are the infant's earliest experiences of adults and adult behaviors, it has no choice but to accept this reality that human beings act in shockingly different ways in different settings. While unintentional, this sets the infant up for later dissociation, in mimicry of the adults around it. **Intentional Programming** Intentional programming of an infant in the Illuminati often begins before birth. **Prenatal splitting is well known in the cult, as the fetus is very capable of fragmenting in the womb due to trauma.** This is usually done between the seventh and ninth month of pregnancy. Techniques used include: placing headphones on the mother's abdomen and playing loud, discordant music (such as some modern classical pieces or even Wagner's operas). Loud, heavy rock has also been used. Other methods include having the mother ingest quantities of bitter substances to make the amniotic fluid bitter, or yelling at the fetus inside the womb. The mother's abdomen may be hit as well. Mild shock to the abdomen may be applied, especially when term is near, and may be used to cause premature labor, or ensure that the infant is born on a ceremonial holiday. Certain labor inducing drugs may be also given if a certain birth date is desired. Once the infant is born, testing is begun at a very early age, usually during the first few weeks of life. The trainers, who are taught to look for certain qualities in the infant, will place it on a velvet cloth on a table and check its reflexes to different stimuli. The infant's strength and how it reacts to heat, cold, and pain are all tested. Different infants react differently, and the trainers are looking for dissociative ability, quick reflexes, and reaction times. They are also encouraging early dissociation in the infant with these tests. **The infant will also be abused to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:16:e3e3445ad89d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14413, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "trainers, who are taught to look for certain qualities in the infant, will place it on a velvet cloth on a table and check its reflexes to different stimuli.

They are also encouraging early dissociation in the infant with these tests. **The infant will also be abused to create fragments.** Methods of abuse can include: rectal probes; digital anal rape; electric shocks at low levels to the fingers, toes, and genitalia; cutting the genitalia in ritual circumstances (in older infants). The intent is to begin fragmentation before a true ego state develops and customize the infant to pain and reflexive dissociation from pain. And yes, even tiny infants dissociate. I have seen it time and time again. they will glow blank and limp, or glassy, in the face of continued trauma. Rudimentary isolation and abandonment programming will sometimes begin as well. The infant is intentionally abandoned, or uncared for by adults, during the daytime, then picked up, soothed, cleaned up and paid attention to in the context of preparing for a ritual or group gathering. This is done in order to help the infant associate night gatherings with \"love\" and attention, and to help the bonding process to the cult, or \"family\". **The infant will be taught to associate maternal attention with going to rituals, and eventually will associate cult gatherings with feelings of security. ** As the infant grows older, i.e., at 15 to 18 months, more fragmenting is intentionally done by having the parents as well as cult members abuse the infant more methodically. This is done by intermittently soothing, bonding with the infant, then shocking it on its digits. The infant may be dropped from heights to a mat or mattress and laughed at as it lays there startled and terrified, crying. It may be placed in cages for periods of time or exposed to short periods of isolation. Deprivation of food, water, and basic needs may begin later in this stage. All of these methods are done in order to create intentional dissociation in the infant. The infant of this age may be taken to group meetings, but outside of special occasions or dedications, will have no active role yet in the cult setting. The small infants are usually left with a cult member or caretaker, who watches them during the group's activities. This caretaker role is usually rotated among lower level or teenage members. **The First Five Steps of Discipline** **Between the ages of 20 and 24 months, the toddler may begin the \"steps of discipline\" which the Illuminati use to teach their children.

These \"steps of discipline\" would be better called \"steps of torment and abuse\" as their purpose is to create a highly dissociative child, out of touch with their feelings, who is completely and unthinkingly loyal to the cult. **The order of the steps may be varied a little, depending on the whims of the trainer or parents. **I will first discuss the first five steps of discipline** (note that these steps may vary somewhat from region to region, but most follow this outline at least roughly, even if not in the same order). **First step: To not need ** The small toddler/child is placed in a room without any sensory stimulus, usually a training room with gray, white, or beige walls. **The adult leaves, so that the child is left alone for periods of time. These may vary from hours to an entire day as the child grows older. If the child begs the adult to stay or screams, the child is beaten and told that the periods of isolation will increase until they learn to stop being weak. The ostensible purpose of this discipline is to teach the child to rely on its own internal resources and not on outside people (\"strengthen it\").** What it actually does is create a huge terror of abandonment within the child. When the adult or trainer returns to the room, the child is often found rocking itself or hugging itself in a corner, occasionally almost catatonic from fear. The trainer will then \"rescue\" the child, feed and give it something to drink, and bond with the child as their \"savior\". The trainer will tell them the \"family\" told the trainer to rescue the child, because its family \"loves\" it. At this point, the trainer will instill cult teachings into the helpless, fearful, and almost insanely grateful child who has just been \"rescued\" from isolation. **The trainer will reinforce in the child over and over how much it \"needs \" its family, who just rescued it from death by starvation or abandonment.** **This will teach the very young toddler to associate comfort and security with bonding with its trainer, who may be one of its parents, and being with \"family\" members.

It will be done intermittently with the first step over the next few years of the child's life. Again, the child is left alone in a training room or isolated room without food or water for a long period of time. **An adult will enter the room with a large pitcher of ice water or food. If the child asks for either as the adult is eating or drinking in front of the child, he/she is severely punished for being weak and needy.** This step is reinforced, until the child learns not to ask for food or water unless it is offered first. The ostensible reason the cult gives for this step is that it creates a child who is strong and can go without food and water for longer and longer periods of time. The real reason this is done is that it creates a child who is completely dissociated from its own needs for food, water, or other comforts, and who becomes afraid to ask outside adults for help. This creates in the child a hyper-vigilance as she/he learns to look for outside adults for cues on when it is okay to fulfill needs, and not to trust her/his own body signals. **The child is already learning to look outside itself to others to learn how it should think or feel, instead of trusting its own feelings. The cult now becomes the locus of control for the child. ** **Third step: To not wish ** The child is placed in a room with favorite toys or objects. A kind adult comes into the room and engages the child in play. This adult my be a friend, aunt, parent, or trainer. The child and adult may engage in fantasy play about the child's secret wishes, dreams, or wants. This will occur on several occasions, and the child's trust is slowly gained. At some later point, the child is severely punished for any aspect of wishing or fantasy shared with the adult, including the destruction of favorite toys, going in and undoing or destroying secret safe places the child may have created, or even destroying non cult protectors. This step is repeated, with variations, many times over the ensuing years.

Occasionally, the child's siblings, parents, or friends will be used to bring out inside fantasies the child has revealed to them during the daytime or in unguarded moments. The ostensible reason the cult gives for this step is to create a child who doesn't fantasize, who is more outwardly directed, less inwardly directed. In other words, **the child is to look to adults for permission in all aspects of its life, including internal. ** The reality is that this step destroys all safe places the child has created internally, to retreat from the horrors it is experiencing. **This step creates in the child the feeling that there is no true safety, that the cult will find out everything it thinks. **Exercises like this are also used to create young alters in the child who will self report to the cult trainers any secret safe places or covert wishes against the cult that other alters have. This will then begin to set up intersystem hostility and divisiveness, which the cult will manipulate throughout the person's life span in order to control them. **Fourth step: The survival of the fittest ** This step is used in order to begin creating perpetrator alters in the young child. **All cult members will be expected to become perpetrators. This begins in early childhood.** The child is brought into a room where there is a trainer and another child of approximately the same age, or slightly younger than the child being taught. **The child is severely beaten for a long period of time by the trainer, then told to hit the other child in the room, or they will be beaten further. If the child refuses, it is punished severely. The other child is punished as well. Then the first child is told to punish the other child. If the child continues to refuse, or cries, or tries to hit the trainer instead, they will continue to be beaten severely and told to hit the other child, to direct its anger at the other child. This step is repeated until the child finally complies. ** **This step is begun around age 2 to 2 1/2, and is used to create aggressive perpetrator alters in the young child. As the child becomes older, the punishing tasks become more and more brutal.

They will also be mimicking these adults, who role model perpetration constantly as normal.** The child will be taught that this is the acceptable outlet for the aggressive impulses and rage that are created by the brutality the child is constantly being exposed to. ** **Fifth step: The code of silence** Many, many different stratagems are used to encode this step, starting at around the age of two years old, when a child starts becoming more verbal. **After a ritual or group gathering, the child is asked about what they saw or heard during the meeting. Like most obedient young children, they will comply. They are immediately severely beaten or tortured. A new alter is thus created, who is told to keep or guard the memories of what was seen, on pain of their life. The new part always agrees. The child and this new part are put through a ceremony of swearing to never ever tell, and alters are created whose job it is to kill the body, if the other parts ever remember.** The child is also put through severe psychological torture to ensure that it will never be tempted to tell, including: being buried alive; near drowning; watching \"traitor's deaths\" involving slow painful torture, such as being burned, or skinned alive; being buried with a partially rotted corpse and being told that they will become a corpse like it if they ever tell, etc. The scenarios go on and on, invented by people with endlessly cruel imaginations, in order to ensure the secrecy of the young child. **These methods have been perfected over hundreds of years of practice by the cult with its children. The reason these things are done is self evident: the cult is involved in criminal activities, as explained in the first few chapters of this book, and they want to ensure the continued silence of its children. This is one reason why the cult has survived so long, protected by an impenetrable shroud of secrecy. It is why survivors are afraid/unwilling to disclose their abuse. ** In order to reveal cult secrets, a child must go against some of the most tremendously horrendous psychological trauma and abuse imaginable. Even as an adult, the survivor has difficulty putting these things aside when discussing their abuse. **Children and adults alike are told that if they ever tell, they will be hunted down and shot (the assassin training lets the child know that this is no idle threat), and that they will be tortured slowly. **The child will be", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:21:494db24bede2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14418, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "In order to reveal cult secrets, a child must go against some of the most tremendously horrendous psychological trauma and abuse imaginable.

These are just meant as helpful hints and do not replace the advice of a good therapist. ** **1. Early milieu programming** This is difficult to undo, since it hits on core abandonment issues and rejection for the survivor. This will often have been the survivor's very first, earliest experiences as an infant, involving its relationship with its parents and primary family members. Working on this requires the whole hearted effort of all alter systems inside to join in nurturing the core splits who experienced severe parental rejection. It involves the cognitive recognition that the daytime was important, too; that the adults around the infant were the unhealthy ones. **The infant alters often feel unlovable, overly needy, and depressed, but nurturing alters inside can help comfort them, and share the reality that the infant really was loveable, no matter what the outside adults around it were like.** An outside supportive therapist and a strong, nurturing faith system can help tremendously in the healing process, as new messages are brought in to the abandoned, wounded parts. Sorting through what happened, grieving over the real issues of abandonment, and bringing reality to very young, deeply wounded parts will take time. **2. Early intentional fragmentation (ages 0 to 24 months) ** Usually there are cognitive parts of the survivor inside who have never ever forgotten the abuse, and can help share the cognitive reality of the abuse with the amnesic alters. This should be done extremely slowly, since this first abuse was done quite early in life. Creating an internal nursery with safe toys, objects, can help. **Older nurturing adult alters inside can help hold and care for the wounded infants inside the nursery, while acknowledging and grieving over the abuse which occurred.** It is important to believe and validate the young parts when they come forward to share.

Allowing them nonverbal ways of expressing themselves can help, as these are quite young parts who often cannot talk yet. Having older children inside who are close to the infants verbalize their wants, needs, and fears can also help, as often the youngest parts inside do not trust any adults, even internal ones. A strong, caring outside therapist is also important to healing. They can model healthy nurturing to a system that may have no concept of this, while balancing the need of the infant for outside nurture with the need for the internal system(s) to learn their own self nurture techniques. Internal helpers can reach the infants, ground them, share present reality, for instance that the body is older and the infants are safe. These helpers may be internal older children. The survivor may also want to find support adults when possible, who can help with modeling healthy caring with good boundaries. **A therapist or friend cannot re-parent the survivor.** The survivor will long for this, but realistically, the survivor has one set of parents, good or bad, or sadly, even terrible. No outside person can come in and redo the complete re-parenting of another. What the therapist and support person can offer will be caring, empathy, and listening while the survivor grieves over the loss of adequate nurture. They can offer friendship or empathy with good boundaries. They cannot become the survivor's parents, or therapy will not progress. Instead, enmeshment will begin. **3. Healing the first five steps of discipline **(There are 12 total; others will be addressed in later chapters) **Try to find the parts that experienced the abuse. This may mean doing system mapping** (drawing pictures of what things look like inside), and going to the cognitives (intellectuals) or controllers (head honchos inside) for information. An internal helper or recorder may also be extremely helpful in doing this. **Allow these parts to slowly acknowledge the agony that they experienced during their deprivation:** heat (being held over a fire, or stove); cold (such as being placed in freezers, or ice, for example), lack of food, etc. Encourage the sharing of the cognitive portion of the memories first, while allowing amnesic alters to grieve over \"hearing about\" these things.

Allow feeling alters later to step forward, and share their feelings, while more cognitive or helper parts are inside holding their hands, grounding them to the here and now throughout the process of remembering. Be prepared for floods of emotion at times, as well as body memories, as the abuse is recalled. **A group of inside people can be designated as a \"grounding team\" to help ground these parts as they step forward and share their memories. ** Remembering safely assumes that the person has a qualified therapist, and also has laid the groundwork for good intrasystem cooperation, as discussed above. **Memory work should not be done until there is good communication and cooperation inside, or the person will be overwhelmed by the memories as they come out. **They will be flooded and re-traumatized instead of helped, and may de-compensate. With good communication, memories can be brought out a little at a time, in manageable pieces, while cognitive alters continually help keep the survivor from going completely into the memory. They can also help ground the more wounded parts. The cult will put people through certain types of programming in order to achieve a specific goal: separating the intellect, or cognition, from the feelings in a person. Cognitive alters in these systems are always considered \"higher\" than the feeling alters; cognitive alters are taught to \"pass down\" their feelings to the \"lower\" feeling alters. While these labels are untrue, the cognitive alters will fear feeling the intense, overwhelming emotions that caused them to split further and further from the more limbic, or feeling alters internally. This will drive continued system divisiveness in the survivor.** It is important that cognitive parts realize that the feeling alters are part of them; that they can practice sharing their feelings in small steps without needing to be flooded, or overwhelmed. ** A reminder: **External safety is paramount to undoing inside programming.** You must be able to promise these parts external safety and deliver on this promise, or they will understandably balk at working inside on undoing programming. Why should they try and change only to go back and be punished again? No system will undo its own protective dissociation if the abuse is ongoing, or it will continue to destabilize and re-dissociate over and over. This is because dismantling the dissociation would mean dismantling its own survival and protection. **Stopping contact with perpetrators and having a safe therapist are the very first steps to take, before attempting to undo internal programming.**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:24:9e5b9a3dc812", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14421, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "at working inside on undoing programming.

A person can heal, and most survivors are still in cult contact when they enter therapy. But the progress will go much more quickly once cult contact is broken (see [chapter 12](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali_book_svali_speaks#12) on preventing accessing of the survivor). **Chapter Five** **Colors, Metals and Jewel Programming** **Color Coding** (To see more about color, [click here](http://web.archive.org/web/20020305121400/http://heart7.net/color.html)) One form of programming that is quite common in the Illuminati is color programming. Why is it done? The answer is that trainers are human, and also quite lazy. Color programming is a simple way to organize systems, and allows the trainer to call up alters easily within a system. With the thousands of fragments that many multiples in the cult have, colors is a way of organizing them into an easily accessible group. Also, young children recognize colors before they can read, so this training can occur quite early. It is begun at about age two in most children. **How it is done:** The child is taken into a room with either white, beige, or colored walls. If the room is a neutral color, the lights in the room will be changed, so they color the room with the light's color. If \"blue\" is the color being imprinted, or put in, the trainer will call up a young child alter, either a controller or core split for a system. They will tell the child that they will learn how to become blue, and what blue means. The room will be bathed in blue light, as mentioned, or has been painted blue for use in this kind of programming. The trainer will be dressed in blue clothing, and may even have a blue mask on. Blue objects will be placed around the room. The alter inside the child is called up, drugged, hypnotized, and traumatized on the table. As they are awakening from the trauma, still in trance, they are told that blue is good, and that they are blue. That blue is important. That blue will protect them from harm. That blue people don't get hurt. This will go on for awhile. **They then ask the child if they want to be \"blue\", like the trainers.

If the child says no, it will be re-traumatized until it says yes.** The child is often naked, and told it cannot wear clothing until it \"earns\" the right to wear beautiful blue clothing. Over and over the \"safety of being blue\" (i.e., freedom from harm) and danger of not having a color is emphasized. The children really wants to be blue after a while of going through this. They may be given blue candy as a reward for choosing to become the color. They may be given blue sunglasses or tinted lenses to wear. They are allowed to wear blue robes once they identify with the color chosen for them. Once the child completely identifies with the color (or rather, the main alter or template for the system accepts this color), then they are taught in progressive stages over many training sessions what the color blue means. They are placed in set ups or dramas with other blue children where they act out the role of a \"blue\". They are drugged, hypnotized, traumatized, while the meaning of blue is ground in over and over. They are forced to act in \"blue\" ways. **Different trainers and regions will assign different meanings to different colors. Many military systems are coded blue, or protective.** The military alters all are called up periodically to reinforce blue training. If the trainer at a later date wants to access a blue system, they may call them up by color or wear a piece of clothing or a scarf in the color they want to reach. This becomes an unconscious trigger for this color to come forward. **Color coding is one of the first methods that is inlayed over systems. An entire system may be color coded one color; or two or more colors** (most systems have three) may be coded in with each system controller being given a different color over its part of the system. **Metals Programming** Metals programming is a type of programming that many Illuminati children are given. Because it is so similar to jewels programming, I will discuss how it is done under jewels. Metals can be from bronze (lowest) to platinum (highest). **Jewels Programming** Many Illuminati children will go through either metals or jewels programming, and occasionally will go through both.

Metals can be from bronze (lowest) to platinum (highest). **Jewels Programming** Many Illuminati children will go through either metals or jewels programming, and occasionally will go through both. Jewels is considered higher than metals and more difficult to obtain. Which is put in and when is dependent on the child's status, its parents status, the region it is born in, the group it is born into, and the trainers that work with it. **Basically, either metals or jewels is a form of reward based programming. ** **Here is how it works:** The child is shown a piece of jewelry such as a ring or a large example of the jewel (or metal) being put in. They are asked: \"Isn't this amethyst, or ruby, emerald, diamond) beautiful?\" The child will be eager to look at it, touch it, and is encouraged to by a trainer with a soft kind voice. The trainer will ask the child, \"Wouldn't you like to be beautiful, like this jewel?\" (or metal jewelry). The child is usually eager to be. Here is a sparkling gemstone, placed in their small hands (the training often begins between age two and three). Of course they want to be beautiful, sparkly, valued. The trainer will extol the beauty of the gem (or metal), will tell the child how special, valued, wanted gems are, and basically build up the idea of becoming like a jewel. **The child is then told that in order to become a jewel, they must \"earn the right\". This involves: ** **a.) Passing through steps of discipline (see chapter three) b.) Passing special tests c.) Being rewarded for special achievement ** The possibility of becoming a jewel (or precious metal) is dangled before the small child like a carrot as the reward for doing well in training sessions. The earning of one is linked to going through the rungs of the long, arduous training process expected of Illuminati children. Having a jewel or metal involves stepping up in status and being praised. But the price is enduring hours of intensive \"training\", which in reality is organized, systemic abuse to make the child do what the trainer wants them to do. **Over time, with the help of drugs, hypnosis, shock, and other trauma, as the child goes through it's training process, it will begin earning its jewels and/or metals, one by one. These will become full alters inside. ** **Amethyst** is usually the first one earned. It is linked to keeping secrets, never telling, and passing the first step of discipline. Each step is linked to receiving either a jewel or precious metal. **Ruby** will often be next.
