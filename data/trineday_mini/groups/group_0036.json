and the law In August 1996 events were to provide dramatic new evi dence about this national program of illegal narcotics mar keting 319 CHAPTER 21 DRUGS AND THE MONARCH PROJECT On August 18 20 1996 a California newspaper the San Jose Mercury published a series of articles implicating elements of the U S government in running tons of cocaine into U S cities during the 1980s Based upon recently declassified government documents eyewitness reports and court records Mercury reporter Gary Webb provided a detailed account of how the Contras financed their war against the Sandinista regime of Nicaragua by flying tons of cocaine into the West Coast where it would be turned into the deadly instantly addictive crack and sold to such street gangs as the Cryps and the Bloods All of this began after the U S Congress in the early 1980s passed the Boland Amendment which stopped all official fi nancing for U S intelligence s covert war in Nicaragua The whole project was taken off line and financed by drug sales the subject of Webb s articles Indignation exploded when the Mercury series hit the streets Maxine Waters Congresswoman for South Central Los Angeles one of the areas hardest hit by crack and drug related violence sent a letter to Central Intelligence Agency chief John Deutsch demanding an investigation of the Agency in which she said As someone who has seen how the crack cocaine trade has devastated the South Central Los Angeles commu nity I cannot exaggerate my feelings of dismay that my own government may have played a part in the origins and history of this problem The impact and the implications of the Meneses BlandonlRoiss Contra CIA crack cocaine connection 320 DRUGS AND THE MONARCH PROJECT cannot be understated We all have an obligation to get to the very bottom of the origin development and implementation of this seedy enterprise While many were shocked at the news of apparent U S government drug pushing to me it was one more confirmation of a key aspect of the Franklin case As I had discovered early on as had Gary Caradori the sexual abuse of children was only one part of the Franklin story During the 1980s many of the children such as Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci said that they had been used as drug couriers to bring cocaine in from the West Coast for Alan Baer Larry King and others Then on September 11 1996 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania

federal state and local anti drug agencies especially along the south Florida coast Bush was responsible for the White House anti drug 321 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP effort while at the same time according to the recent newspaper reports tons of cocaine were allegedly supplied to street gangs by CIA related networks Concluded James There s something wrong with this pic ture In response to a question from one of the ten reporters in attendance about the role of Bush Philadelphia City Council President John Street replied If George Bush is involved in it someone should find it out This kind of

investigate Bush for possible involvement in the dope business Think back to what I reported in Chapter 13 The Washington Connection about how George Bush and Larry King were linked in multiple ways including eyewitness reports placing Bush at King s sex parties Think about the constant rumors that King was financing the Contras who have now been proved to have been running dope by the ton The first investigative reporter to ever look at Franklin the World Herald s James Flanery told associates that King was running guns and money into Nicaragua and that the CIA was heavily involved Flanery was soon taken off the story and shipped out of state for a year Records exist to show that Larry King was a top contributor to a Contra support committee the Citizens for America CFA King s own public relations firm was also used by the Contras I became convinced early on that King was deeply involved with the Contras I am reminded of the phone call State Senator Loran Schmit received on the Senate floor as the Franklin case was just beginning to break The caller warned him off the 322 DRUGS AND THE MONARCH PROJECT case because it would lead to the highest levels of the Republi can party I am reminded of when Larry King was finally arrested just as he was about to go to a breakfast party in Omaha for his buddy George Bush I am reminded of the reports I used to hear that certain people in Omaha were charg ing that Omaha Police Chief Bob Wadman was protecting the expansion of the Cryps and Bloods into Omaha far from their home turf of Los Angeles So was Larry King s buddy George Bush the country s drug kingpin in the 1980s I don t know But what I do know is that if Bush were running the Contra affair and drugs were a big part of it that would certainly jibe 100 with everything

Agency or military intelligence agencies The story told by Monarch victims one of whom is Paul Bonacci is that they were tortured for the purpose ofcreating multiple personalities within them These multiple personali ties could then be programmed as desired as spies drug mules prostitutes or assassins Because of legal cases still pending I am severely limited in what I can say about the Monarch Project Suffice it to say at this point Major intelligence programs in this country did and do exist for the purpose of protection of this country and to learn what other countries particularly our Cold War enemies were doing in this area of mind control 323 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP I asked Bill Colby to tell me what he could or would about this He said Of course the CIA in particular was involved in investigat ing learning and on occasion using everything we could learn about mind control and with extremely good reason Following the Korean War this country s military and intelli gence communities went through a period of absolute paranoia about just how far our enemies were ahead of us in mind control and related activities There was no particular program called Monarch contrary to what you want to think Monarch was merely a name that some participants in the program who knew very little about it other than from their own limited participation were given to identify themselves But as far as the CIA was concerned there was no such program named Monarch But with respect to mind control I will tell you that this country spent millions upon millions supposedly catching up to our Cold War adversaries because we believed they had developed mind control technology which exceeded anything we had In fact we at the Company CIA truly believed for a substantial period of time that technology and techniques and drugs had been developed by Russia which would enable them to have agents who in fact really were able to have and use ESP extra sensory perception Can you imagine

period I will tell you one other thing Bill said somewhat omi nously we are not behind in knowledge of mind control In fact we never were but we only found that out much later after we had poured incredible resources into this area And yes I am sure there were some problems and abuses that occurred and we will talk about them at another time 324 DRUGS AND THE MONARCH PROJECT We did have that other talk And I intend when I am freed from court restrictions to tell that entire story in an upcoming book I have deposited extensive documentation on the Mon arch Project with people who have the

Biography This 659 page book is a devastating expose of Bush and it played a notable role in helping to shape the 1992 presidential campaign which Bush happily lost Perhaps it was because the name Bush was all over the Franklin scandal that Chaitkin showed up one day in my Lin coln law office I told him Look I know you have been in some tough spots before but are you really sure you want to poke around in this This question of mind control the Monarch Project is the most scary and dangerous thing I have ever encountered As I came to know Anton probably all that little lecture did was to

merely a comparison rather it is an actual continua tion as we shall see From sexual degradation from witnessing and forced participation in Satanic cult murders Bonacci suf fered the cracking of his mind into what is called multiple personality disorder MPD Tens of thousands of American children have been diagnosed MPDs virtually all of them are thought to have resulted from sexual abuse of which perhaps 85 percent were cases of Satanic ritual abuse Psychiatric professionals specified in Paul Bonacci s legal proceedings that through it all Paul s different personalities have emerged incapable of lying with an ultra sharp memory In one instance detailed in The Franklin Cover Up Paul was taken by Larry King and others to a wooded area in California identified after publication as the Bohemian Grove There Paul and another boy were forced to do sex acts with and to consume parts of a child whom they had watched being 326 DRUGS AND THE MONARCH PROJECT murdered by the cultists The

Offutt to be sexually victimized by a babysitter s boyfriend when he was about three years old around 1970 Offutt is the headquarters for the Strategic Air Command and has had a cadre of thousands of

his expertise and personal practices in brainwashing Satanism Nazism homo sexual pedophilia and murder A former director of the CIA was asked directly what about Monarch He replied angrily and

about late Feb 1995 for very serious spousal abuse John Doe had become obsessed with a jealous rage and anger because he believed that a certain individual one of the Montana Seven and a so called Freeman had a Relationship with his wife that he did not sanction while he John Doe was previously incarcerated John Doe also knew that the charges he was facing were very grave More important John Doe knew that the MusselShell Sheriff s office particularly Deputy Buzz Jones was himself obsessed with concerns and fears and hatreds of the Freeman and or the Montana Militia John Doe solved his incarceration problem by spinning a tale for Deputy Jones and later others to the effect that the Freemen were on the verge of kidnapping and hanging public officials particularly a Judge as well as robbing banks and doing any sort of other dastardly deed that John Doe could spin a tale about and which MusselShell officials were ready to lap up without proper investigation or analysis Naturally John Doe identified his former friend one of the Montana Seven and a Freeman as one who was to be involved in this tale of terror and described well his truck items in it etc including a pile of money gold and guns to watch out for And thus with one fantastic though fantasy tale John Doe solved his incarceration problem and his jealousy problem we believe the evidence will clearly show and which we believe the state is now aware of And with fears being driven by the Con Job of John Doe on certain public officials on Feb 27 1995 warnings were issued from Federal and Other officials that

their vehicle Deputy Jones found just what his con informant had told him he might find gold hordes ofcash guns radio equipment and two individuals who belonged to the militant groups he Deputy Jones hated Deputy Jones apparently believed he was on the verge of stopping an invasion kidnapping murder and worse And under those circumstances why not rough up the individuals you have arrested Why not

short dis tance was one of the other Freemen who then contacted the other individuals named here and said they should check on what was going on Besides as Lopez said They got my radio and I need it for my business and I can t afford another one They cost 500 00 and I am going to go to the Sheriff and see if they will give it back to me COMEDY TURNS TO SERIOUS TRAGEDY So in two separate vehicles the other individuals named drive over to the Sheriff s office to check on their friends and to ask for the return of Mr Lopez s radio 337 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP The tale gets controversial and tragic

The officials lie to the relatives and friends calling in to the sheriff s office and repeatedly deny that the Montana Seven are even at the jail or have been arrested And these things recited here are the nicest things the local officials do THEN SA NITY STARTS TO RETURN Believing they have captured the seven most dangerous men in America the local sheriff and his cohorts bring in the Feds The Feds figure out we believe that they are in the midst of a comedy of errors and misunderstandings and after question ing the Montana Seven quickly get out of any further involve ment in the matters pending and return everything to local officials We believe they the Feds are the ones who alerted the Attorney General of Montana of the need for some proper law enforcement involvement but we do not know Next the Attorney General of Montana gets involved a man named John Connor and over the next few days sanity and proper law enforcement procedures begin to replace keystone 338 FROM MONTANA TO

of such terrorists the media hypes the story without benefit of accurate facts or any responsible investigative reporting and the families and businesses of the Montana Seven are horribly damaged And

in the best interest of getting some accurate information to all Montanans my clients would like to make the following offer Each of my clients would undergo a polygraph test on any material question relating to these charges against them or the events and incidents surrounding this They would want you to bring in the best polygraph expert s in the country They would agree in advance that any results ofthe testingfor any and all ofthem no matter whether it showed positive or negative for them would be admissible in court civil or criminal 119 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP There would be only one condition That is they insist the two Deputies and local officials in Musselshell County also be subject to the same terms and conditions That is polygraph examination on the materialfacts surrounding the arrest incar ceration filing of charges police brutality etc Finally for the benefit of all Montanans they agree in ad vance that any representatives of the press would be allowed to be present at the polygraph examination and submit any questions they might have about the events Why all this So much injury and damage has been done and so much disinformation has been put out that it is in the best interest of everybody including particularly the Montana Seven that the truth get out And it is in the best interests of everybody that Law Enforcement be held to the same standards of truth and

The official response of the Attorney General of Montana to my ultimatum was to say that the state of Montana was proceeding with the trial on charges of criminal syndicalism sedition The Deputy Attorney General John Connor a fine individual who had to do whatever the Governor and Attorney General told him to informed the press that my ultimatum would be ignored 340 FROM MONTANA TO OKLAHOMA CITY The Governor also stoked the rumor mills by first creating a strawman called the Militia He put forward the bogus story that the MOM had planned to assault the Sheriff s office and the courthouse in Roundup and hang the judges When the press told me what the Governor and the Attorney General were purporting I replied This story is pure fantasy an attempt by public officials to excuse their mistakes I dare Montana and its officials to go to trial on these bogus charges because Montana will lose and its criminal syndicalism laws will be declared unconstitutional Then in March 1995 at the last minute before my deadline for dismissal of the charges the Attorney General s office swept into Roundup dismissed all the charges and informed the press that Montana officials were not responding to my demands but were dismissing the charges because the Attorney General needed more evidence to prove his case My goal to free these men had been accomplished For that 1 felt proud and satisfied The case received much national attention especially with law enforcement at both the state and the federal level and I became somewhat of a legend among the patriot and militia movement At the height of the Montana Seven case as it came to be known I had been dealing directly with the Montana Governor s office the Attorney General s office and officials in Washington as well as with the national press trying to prevent an outbreak of violence spawned by either the militias or by the government During February and particularly in March and early April of 1995 rumors were flying through the entire Militia and Patriot community on almost an hourly basis warning of immi nent raids by federal officials against militia compounds Na tionwide militias were circulating reports in all their fax press and phone networks that these raids were coming and that the militia members had better be prepared The militias specified in their written and oral communica tions the date of April 19",

Team composed of ATF and FBI CIA and U S military was about to launch airborne and ground strikes against various militia headquarters particularly against the Militia of Montana at Noxon Montana Militias across the country prepared to defend themselves against these attacks All this intense activ ity unknown by most Americans then or now was occur ring in the first half of April 1995 During that same period I and others such as former presi dential candidate Bo Gritz for example spent hours each day trying to determine whether any such strikes were actually planned or were just wild rumors Federal officials advised us that no attacks were planned information we relayed to militia leaders both in person and through talk shows on the patriot networks working nonstop to defuse the extremely volatile sit uation This was the environment in the militia world on the eve of April 19 Given my role in the midst of this it was inevitable that the Feds showed up on my doorstep right after the Oklahoma bombing 342 CHAPTER 23 THE OKLAHOMA BOMBING THE REAL STORY Since the bomb or bombs ripped through the Oklahoma City Federal Building on April 19 1995 I have received through fluke or fate a huge amount of information about the bombing Based on this I will give here my best assessment of what actually happened what Americans in future years will understand about the events in Oklahoma City As noted my first involvement came when the F E I sought my assistance because of my successful representation of vari ous militia groups across the United States Then certain bombing victims asked me to file civil litigation against whomever caused their injuries Some of these victims were in hospitals at the time severely injured and able to speak only through writing notes to others to deliver to me I immediately put together an investigative team to look at the event and to try to determine what had actually occurred The head of that team was Ted Gunderson the former Special Agent in Charge SAC of the FBI s Los Angeles field office who had had 800 agents working under him and with whom I had collaborated in the Franklin case Ted and his team arrived in",

arrived in Oklahoma before the dust had even settled from the explosion Much later after this initial work was completed I became the attorney for a man named Hoppi Heidelberg who was one of the federal grand jurors who had helped to indict Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the Oklahoma City bombing Hoppi came to me because he believed the government planned to indict him for his work on the grand jury It seems that 343 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP Heidelberg had read his instructions on his responsibility and authority as a member of a federal grand jury and was deter mined to do his job Hoppi Heidelberg is a true patriot Hoppi had come to the conclusion that the government was covering up facts was refusing to deal properly with the grand jury and was trying to narrow the case to Mr McVeigh and Mr Nichols Hoppi has said on talk shows nationwide that he believes that there is a John Doe 2 and probably 3 and 4 and that the government is refusing to share that information with the American people Hoppi was in fact removed from the grand jury after the indictments of MeVeigh and Nichols I emphasize at this point that nothing 1 say here violates in my opinion any information I learned from grand juror Hoppi Heidelberg either from the standpoint of violating federal grand jury laws or violating attorney client relationships All informa tion disclosed here was obtained by me from my own separate investigations With respect to my own investigation of the bombing on behalf of injured victims the following events raised serious questions in my mind in regards to the case 1 Our investigation revealed that the so called fertilizer bomb could not by itself have caused the destruction of the Federal Building and in the manner described Today there are many theories including the Hydro Dynamic theory of a hydrodynamic super bomb which is highly classified and which would have been used in conjunction with the basic fertilizer bomb There are also the theories of General Partin a well known retired army general of bombs of different types including the possibility that bombs were placed inside at key points in the building to destroy its supports Our

constructed shape charge all of whose force would have to be directed at the building s supports and at precisely the right angle 2 In the investigation I retained the most respected and expensive bomb experts in the world John A Kennedy and Associates Inc out of Hoffman Estates Illinois They had investigated the World Trade Center bombing and are recog nized as one of the world s best if not the best in the field 3 I prepared documents to go to court to force the govern ment to keep the Federal Building standing long enough for experts to examine the building the soil and environs to establish what caused the destruction in particular what type of explosive was used 4 Only hours before I was to file the legal papers for a civil action to keep the building standing I was contacted by Timothy McVeigh s attorneys who presented me with two major requests First they asked that I allow them to file the motions to keep the building standing so that the investigation could be conducted They had cogent legal arguments for this request because McVeigh was is under federal criminal charges he had the definite legal right to keep the building standing under federal rules of evidence which grant criminal defendants the right to preserve evidence that would significantly impact their defense It was clear that if McVeigh s attorneys believed or even suspected government cover up they would definitely want the building examined Their second request was that I release from retainer the bomb investigation team I had assembled John A Kennedy and Associates which they claimed they wanted to hire I granted these requests to Mcveigh s attorneys A few hours later I watched in horror as CNN and all the national news channels reported that McVeigh s attorneys had no

that the Kennedy and Associates firm wanted he answered Shocked by this feeble explanation I asked Well just how much do they want Mcveigh s attorney floored me 30 000 he said And we have no resources to pay it because we are a court appointed attorney and there are no funds for this purpose For God s sake I screamed at him I will raise the money I will pay the fee There is too much at stake for America How I demanded can McVeigh go along with wanting that building destroyed when that building is the one thing that can tell America the story of what really happened I will get you the money somehow but don t refuse to keep the building up for that reason My protests were futile Within hours of my call by mutual agreement between McVeigh s attorneys and the government prosecutors the building was destroyed and any evidence was destroyed with it What really did happen in Oklahoma City Without violating any federal laws the following is my best estimate on what transpired and how based upon countless meetings with wit nesses victims experts and information gathered by my own investigative team led by Ted Gunderson The why of all of this is what I do not know in detail at least not yet The United States government probably as it should have was investigating a group of individuals in particular Timothy McVeigh who were inclined to want to get even with the government for what they perceived to be its excesses and violations of the Constitution The government infiltrated the McVeigh group a standard operating procedure in such investigations THE OKLAHOMA BOMBING THE

the bomb the personalities involved and the resources available There was a John Doe I and a John Doe 2 and probably several other John Does but they were the government infil trators the government dare not admit existed lest the American public find out just how deeply involved the government was There is still the open question of terrorism against the United States by a foreign power but this would involve complicity with at least certain U S agencies or personnel It is certain that the government knew from the beginning that there were no organized militias or militia conspiracy involved in the bombing as such Yet government spokesmen in a coordinated fashion fostered the idea that the militias were involved and that the militias were the most dangerous animal facing all Americans For months after the Oklahoma bombing witch hunts against the militias were carried out under the government cover of national security the same cover used and abused far too often in the last two decades of American history including in the Iran Contra trial The government s legitimate concern with national security has been turned into a banner under which government officials and judges and agencies and politicians can and do get away with almost anything and everything They cover their mistakes They cover their expenditures They cover their sins And they are covering up the true story of the Oklahoma bombing not necessarily because they intend to be evil I hope but most likely because they cannot admit how their own negligence contributed to it At least that is what I believe at this point 347 CHAPTER 24 THE U S JUS TIC E DEPARTMENT MURDER OF GORDON KAHL Because I had successfully represented various clients in or around the militias I was contacted in mid 1995 by Yorie Kahl the

Yorie Kahl was gravely wounded and which set into motion the train of events that led to Gordon Kahl s own murder four months later Gordon Kahl prepared the affi davit with the conviction that federal law enforcement would kill him rather than capture him alive if they ever found him which is exactly what happened Yorie Kahl released the following affidavit to me in prepara tion for his trial I believe it is the most complete account ever of this chilling story 348 JUSTICE DEPT MURDER OF GORDON KAHL UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NORTH DAKOTA UNITED STATES OF STATEMENT OF

States Marshals and two local Law Enforcement Officers attempted to serve an arrest warrant on Gordon Kahl for an alleged violation of misdemeanor probation A gun battle erupted and two U S Marshals

decorated veteran of World War II Gordon Kahl held strong religious and political convictions Gordon Kahl came to the conclusion in the 1970 s that America was headed politically and morally in the wrong direction This distressed Gordon Kahl Despite his personal lack of resources he felt he had an obligation to share his beliefs and views with anyone who would listen Towards this end Gordon Kahl regularly spoke out publicly criticizing the Government and particularly the federal income tax system Often Gordon Kahl used the media and public gatherings to spread his message A POLITICAL ACTIVISM Gordon Kahl was particularly outspoken and a strong critic of what he perceived to be the perversion of politics law and Justice that Kahl believed was occurring in America So prolific were Gordon Kahl s written and verbal attacks on what he sincerely believed to be unconstitutional applications of laws Income Tax Federal Reserve System that he eventually be came a well known political dissident among those who gener ally shared his concerns Among what today is known as the Patriot Community Gordon Kahl might properly be termed an American Refusenik In the mid 1970 s Gordon Kahl along with other Refuse niks appeared on local television in Texas to share their beliefs with other Americans The primary target of their criticism was the foundational basis of the American Income Tax system and its application Gordon Kahl publicly advocated and en couraged non compliance with the claim that the non compli ance could be done with impunity Such public disdain for the Tax System

tax rebellion To do this the Government initiated a very public Prosecution of Gordon Kah1 under IRS rules and laws which penalize NON COMPLIANCE OR FAILURE TO FILE AN INCOME TAX RETURN A co leader in the tax rebellion with Gordon Kah1 Mr W M Rinehart was also prosecuted convicted and subsequently died in prison Both Kahl and Rinehart were prosecuted for and convicted of misde meanors for failure to file a tax return Yorie Von Kahl was a teenager living at home at the time of his father s prosecution Gordon Kahl was tried and convicted in 1978 in the United States District Court for the Western Division of Texas on two misdemeanor counts of willful failure to file federal income tax returns Specifically Gordon Kah1 was prosecuted under 26 U S c 7203 a misdemeanor carrying a maximum sentence of up to one year imprisonment and or maximum fine of 10 000 dollars IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO NOTE however that at the time of sentencing Gordon Kahl was sentenced to one year imprisonment on Count I under the felony provision of 18 U S c 4205 a Additionally Gordon Kahl s sentence on the second misdemeanor conviction was also a felony sentence Specifically Gordon Kahl was sentenced to probation for five years on Count II This felony sentence itself violated 18 U S c 3651 Section 3651 provides that the probation period can not exceed the maximum incarceration penalty al lowable In this case the maximum incarceration sentence al lowed was one year Statutorily the maximum probation that 351 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP the court should or could have imposed even under the felony provisions of 18 U S C 365l was one year The judicial abuse of Gordon Kahl whether through accident or artifice did not end with the sentencing errors The special conditions of Kahl s parole were

was immedi ately sent to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Spring field Missouri for psychiatric evaluation There Gordon Kahl was found competent to engage in further proceedings He was then released on bond pending appeal C PRISON In January of 1979 having exhausted his appeal rights Gordon Kahl entered the Leavenworth Prison camp in Leaven worth Kansas Mr Kahl was credited for time served at Spring field although he was given no credit towards probation for his exemplary behavior while awaiting appeal No attempt by IRS was ever made to collect any alleged back taxes from Mr Kahl until 1982 some four years later When Gordon Kahl arrived at Leavenworth prison his Fed erally Appointed Case Worker advised Mr Kahl that his sen tence was illegal and that he was improperly sent to prison by the Sentencing Court When the same case worker reported this fact to her supervisors the Case Worker was instructed that if she wanted to keep her job to keep her mouth shut Shortly after that Gordon Kahl was offered release in exchange for extremely onerous terms of probation Gordon Kahl refused preferring to serve his time and be free when released 352 JUSTICE DEPT MURDER OF GORDON KAHL D PROBAnON In August 1979 Gordon Kahl was released from Leaven worth Prison Camp While being processed out of the camp he refused to sign the probation papers After going home to the farm in North Dakota Kahl s probation officer went out to the farm to see Kahl Gordon Kahl told the probation officer that if it would make the probation officer happy Kahl would sign the papers That was the only visit the Probation Officer made to Gordon Kahl s house Subsequently for a few months the Probation Officer left the Probation Report papers in the Kahl mailbox Then the Probation Officer even quit doing that For a substantial time following Gordon Kahl s release from prison Gordon Kahl maintained a low profile and specifically declined invitations to attend and speak at public meetings

State and Federal judiciary in North Dakota and their links to Masonic organizations Specifically Kahl targeted Federal District Judges Paul Benson and Bruce VanSickle for his strongest criticism They consequently took Kahl s vitriolic criticism as a personal affront but even more important an affront to their judicial authority and the prestige of the position of federal judicial officers E SUMMONS On June 27 1980 the U S District Court for the Western Division of Texas issued a summons for Gordon Kahl to appear before the Court to show cause why his probation should not be revoked August 6 1980 twelve months after Kahl s release from Leavenworth Prison Camp Gordon Kahl was allegedly served the summons It was further alleged that Gordon Kahl had advised the Deputy U S Marshal who had served the summons that Kahl did not believe he was on probation and 353 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP that consequently he had no intention of appearing at any show cause hearing According to uncontroverted testimony at trial by Joan Kahl the widow of Gordon Kahl the signature on the summons was not that of Gordon Kahl The sole reason given on the motion for revocation of probation was On or about May 20 1980 the probationer has not abided by his Special Conditions of Probation that he be required to furnish the probation office with a copy of his income tax return each year at the appropriate time for filing a return On September 23 1980 a month after any legal probation period would have expired the U S Attorney was given leave of the U S District Court of Texas to withdraw the motion to revoke the Defendant s probation This was granted by order of the Court It is believed that the reason for the withdrawal of the motion was that the condition of probation was illegal It is also believed that fact was known to the Federal JUdiciary as well as the consequential fact that the order could not lawfully be enforced F THE WARRANT Six months later on March 30 1981 the U S

issued the warrant wanted Gordon Kahl returned to Texas The report also stated the JUDGE HAS SET THE BOND ON KAHL AT 1 000 000 CASH OR 75 000 10 CORPORATE SURETY Emphasis in original All this for an alleged misdemeanor probation violation A probation which was itself null and void and violative of Federal Law Remember no new motion had ever been entered to revoke Gordon Kahl s probation And of course the original JU STICE DEPT MURDER OF GORDON KAHL probation imposed upon Gordon Kahl was illegal and therefore void Any legal probation would have necessarily expired at the latest on August 19 1980 Therefore for anyone of at least three reasons the action by Federal Marshals led by United States Marshal for North Dakota Ken Muir on Feb 13 1983 resulting in the Shoot out was knowingly initiated under a faulty warrant at best The three reasons summarized again are 1 Illegal 5 year FELONY probation sentence given for a Misdemeanor thereby rendering the probation itself illegal 2 Any legal maximum probation period allowed would necessarily have expired on Sept 23 1980 more than 2 years before the Shoot out at Medina 3 The supporting grounds for issuing the Alleged warrant under which U S Marshal Muir was operating on 13 Feb 1983 were themselves defective legal grounds Why Because the Probation conditions imposed ordered Gordon Kahl to perform acts which the courts are constitutionally for bidden to order namely I First Amendment violation by prohibiting Gordon Kahl from Associating with groups ad vocating willful disobedience 2 Requiring Gordon Kahl to furnish copies of Kahl s future tax returns to the probation office in violation of Federal Revenue Laws G UNITED STATES MARSHAL HAROLD BUD WARREN Harold Bud Warren was the United States Marshal for North

Kahl to clear up the misdemeanor Warrant Warren himself was removed from office Warren s removal from office was itself a highly charged political maneuver Deputy U S Marshal Ken Muir was quickly installed as United States Marshal for North Dakota Marshal Warren himself had incurred the wrath and animos ity of the political king makers in North Dakota politics by 1981 His decision to accommodate Gordon Kah1 and attempt to amicably resolve the issue of the Arrest Warrant was not well received Gordon Kahl s very presence in North Dakota had become a significant embarrassment and irritant to the political system and economic power structure Gordon Kahl was loud and outspoken in his criticism of the political power structure He blamed the same political and economic power structure for an almost total collapse of the agricultural econ omy in North Dakota which was occurring in the early 1980 s as part of the so called Farm Crisis H A NEW U S MARSHAL FOR NORTH DAKOTA In 1981 Ronald Reagan replaced Jimmy Carter in the White House The change in presidential administrations afforded the North Dakota power brokers and politicians the opportunity to appoint a U S Marshal

meetings and personally publicly and openly addressed these gatherings giving his strong opinions on constitutional issues such as gun control income taxes abortion land use planning and Kahl s belief about excessive Masonic influence Contrary to claims made by the Federal Government Gordon Kahl went about his business in the light of day In the summer of 1982 Gordon Kahl s wife Joan and a neighbor

later be killed at the shoot out February 13 1983 at Medina North Dakota Deputy Marshal Cheshire advised Judge Van Sickle in the fall of 1982 many months before the 1983 shoot out that Gordon Kahl was a fugitive and the Marshal apparently suggested therefore that the Clerk should not file the motion One thing is for sure That is Gordon Kahl sure did not know he was a fugitive in 1982 For whatever reasons apparently based on instructions from U S District Judge Van Sickle Gordon Kahl s complaint and petition for temporary restraining order were never filed This was never known to Gordon Kahl nor was he ever informed of this refusal action In November of 1982 the IRS attempted to sell Gordon Kahl s farm That effort failed when no one would bid on the farm so the IRS bought the farm itself Of particular interest during the early 1980 s was the prob lem farmers had remaining solvent So did the banks that were financing them Record numbers of farms and farmers were in foreclosure In such an environment of despair and economic upheaval many farmers saw themselves as victims of a political and economic system gone berserk Seeing themselves as twentieth century patriots many farm ers

an other man as carrying machine guns and driving to Fessenden North Dakota to kill the Sheriff The car Kahl was allegedly driving was in the possession of some one else that day Need less to say Kahl and his friend did not show up to shoot the sheriff It now appears that the real purpose of the APB was not informational but was designed to provoke or create a violent confrontation between Gordon Kahl and Law Enforcement By eliminating Gordon Kahl it was hoped to quash the emerging tax rebellion This picture only emerges looking backwards with new factual data and documentation available now and not available in the heat of the 1983 Medina shoot out and the emotionally and politically charged trials that followed III EVENTS AT MEDINA NORTH DAKOTA FEBRUARY 13 1983 On Sunday morning February 13 1983 Gordon Kahl his wife Joan and son Yorie traveled from their farm near Heaton North Dakota to Medina to attend a meeting of dissidents tax protesters and financially troubled farmers

ten day period C Was denied effective assistance of counsel D Was prejudiced by a partial and biased judge E Was prejudiced by material non disclosure and conceal ment by a juror F Petitioner was tried by a jury that was Presumably Bi ased and Actually Biased G Was prejudiced by prosecutorial misconduct H Potential defense witnesses were hindered or prevented from testifying as a result of

the push was on to rush the trial and prejudice the Defendants Prior to trial there was a tremendous amount of negative pretrial publicity and a deliberate disinformation campaign carried out by the

jury and it was proven after trial there was actual bias One juror willfully gave deceitful answers to specific ques tions during voir dire relative to the juror s personal relationship with the prosecutor Mr Crooks Incredibly the impaneled jury was guarded and even enter tained by U S Marshals service who were the victims and clearly viewed themselves as a whole as the victims of the shoot out with the Defendants Marshal Wigglesworth himself a participant in the Medina Shoot out and one of the assault victims of the shoot out engaged with the other Marshals guarding the Jury in recreational activities with the jury members When such conduct was reported to Presiding Judge Benson the Judge responded by simply brushing aside the incidents refusing to hold a hearing on the matter and insuring that the event was not recorded when Judge Benson met in chambers to discuss Wigglesworth s jury contact incidents with a select portion of the attorneys defending in the case The

Lanengas were audited again within a few months it was no coincidence Another witness called by the defense was U S Deputy Marshal Bud Warren Deputy Warren was also dunned by IRS after testifying too

majority opinion did not address some of the issues appealed After saying 28 U S c 144 and 455 are similar and that it would consider them together the Court ignored 455 The Court was also disingenuous in the way it dealt with the issue of biased prospective jurors The Court misconstrued the fact that fifty percent of the prospective jurors that were actually questioned were removed for

completely burned off or cut off Part of a foot was later found suggesting that the hand and feet had been cut off Whichever the case the fire was hot it was deliberately set and it destroyed a lot of evidence CONCLUSION As stated in the foreword of this paper this case is one of an unfortunate chain of events complicated by compounding errors The negligent manner in which the original sentencing of Gordon Kahl was mishandled served to prove beyond any reasonable doubt in Gordon Kahl s mind the duplicity of the Federal Government and its court system in which he was selectively prosecuted To Gordon Kahl the Man whom the Media and Government described as paranoid fanatic this treat ment confirmed Gordon Kahl s belief that the courts were corrupt and validated his deeply held conviction that the U S Government was acting as an outlaw government Whether it was mere negligence or by design the illegal warrant used to give color of law to the actions of the U S Marshals at Medina North Dakota was nothing less than a JUSTICE DEPT MURDER OF GORDON KAHL license to kill The illegality of the outrageous actions of the Government in provoking the incident at Medina is unconscion able and inexcusable The resultant proceeding was mischaracterized as resem bling a trial Whether it was the defective voir dire improper contact and influence with the jury by the Marshal s service and a victim witness prosecutorial misconduct intimidation of witnesses and legal counsel ineffective assistance of counsel or an assassination plot by certain government officials any one of these issues

this kind of government misconduct and persecution of political dissidents that constitu tional protections were memorialized in the Bill of Rights The fiery Arkansas chapter of this saga is bizarre to say the least Gordon Kahl was never given a chance to surrender and the officers involved did not make any attempt to subdue Kahl when they had the chance to The cloud of suspicion that hangs over the true identity of the burned corpse found in the Ginter house may never dissipate The Arkansas chapter of this saga would be the last were it not for the continued unconstitutional and unjust incarceration of Yorie Kahl and Scott Faul For thirteen years the Petitioner and Scott Faul have been model prisoners demonstrating every day they are not typical criminals but political prisoners The whole Kahl affair and the injustice of it can be identified as the defining moment in American history that spawned the constitutionalist patriot militia movement The events leading up to Medina and following were an injustice resembling and predating the events at Ruby Ridge Idaho in August 1992 The conduct and atmosphere of the trial of the Medina defendants is typified by the answers received

than if 375 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP it s a civilian Henry Hudson former director of the Marshals Service angrily replied Because that is the height of defiance of the government The Petitioner asks of

resulting in his falling into the river and drowning Bill s sudden and tragic death prompts me to recount some features of our 25 year relationship which bear directly on the events under discussion in this book They will hopefully shed further light on his amazing life and perhaps also on the circumstances surround ing his most untimely death Bill Colby was one of the pivotal figures in unearthing the Franklin scandal Without his persis tent support and guidance this book would have never been written More than once I was determined to put Franklin behind me and write it off as a horrible experience that I could do nothing about Often I would ask myself Why should I have any responsibility to do something when others in positions of power and government responsibility would do nothing I know that Senator Loran Schmit the head of the Nebraska State Senate s Franklin investigating committee felt the same way I told Bill one time I have done all I can do and have been burned badly financially and credibility wise and I am sure politically I think it s time to just let it drop It was at those times that Bill Colby kept encouraging me and Senator Schmit kept pushing us almost forcing us to 377 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP keep going and to keep the press apprised To quote his exact words This case is so much bigger than you think It goes to the very highest levels we have to keep pulling the strings His idea was not to investigate further which he repeatedly warned me could be very dangerous as to shine the sharp glare of publicity onto what had already been discovered to create the possibility of a real investigation Bill always promised that he would help me as much as possible behind the scenes and if necessary publicly And Bill always delivered When the Discovery Channel program Conspiracy of Si lence was being prepared the British investigative team in sisted that they would not go forward on the program unless they had the on camera personal

Colby went on camera and thoroughly shocked the Yorkshire T V team in how strongly he came out risking himself to support me and my work on Franklin Bill also wrote a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno in which he strongly recommended that the Justice Department investigate this case from the standpoint I outlined in my book a copy of which he enclosed with his letter He got a formal response back from a Justice Department official promising that the Department would indeed look into the case But then Bill had always backed me up right from the earliest days beginning in Vietnam I vividly remember my first encounter with Colby in the late 1960s He discovered me by examining files of new young officers being shipped to Vietnam who might have special talents At that time my ability to speak half a dozen lan guages my training in Airborne Jungle and Ranger Schools well as Vietnamese Language School and the fact I was a was called into service and voiunteered for Vietnam graduated

the CIA station chief He ordered that when I showed up in Vietnam I was to be sent directly to him I was Immediately Bill immersed me in the planning of his own creation a secret program which would later be one of the most controversial operations of the Vietnam War the so called Phoenix Program Yes it was controversial brutal and at times horribly handled But by the admission of the North Vietnamese leadership after the war it was also the single most effective and most feared program the Americans carried out during the Vietnam war It was Bill Colby with his power and position as ambassador in Vietnam in 1970 that made it possible for me to accomplish something never before done or after to run for the position of state senator from abroad I fought my entire election campaign from Vietnam and won it without ever setting foot on Ameri can soil I ran and won despite the fact that the top brass from the Postmaster General to the heads of the Army and Joint Chiefs of Staff had

conducting a charade where we simply kill American boys to support a corrupt regime while the truth is hidden from the American people Back in the States years later as I marched through my political life and began practice as a private attorney I maintained the contact with Bill and often sought his advice He dared when it was truly unpopular to do so to come back to Nebraska and testify for me on controversial issues such as the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in May 1986 Bill Colby had one characteristic rarely if ever found in politicians in this day and age He told it like it is the straight unvarnished truth in simple understandable terms Colby proved that when as head of the Central Intelligence Agency CIA he took the CIA before the U S Congress to reveal the Agency s family jewels and start the process of 379 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP correcting the sins of the CIA For this President Gerald Ford fired Colby and replaced him with a man named George Bush Colby told the truth again in

government was planning an imminent attack on them As I sought guidance from him on how to best handle the militia situation Bill smiled and said John it sounds to me like you have the makings of another book Believe me he continued I know this MilitialPatriot movement is more sig nificant than most Americans and particularly the press and politicians could ever realize I fear that our government does not understand the nature of this movement nor its potential significance to this country Bill said As he continued talking Bill became very intense I watched the Anti War Movement render it impossible for this 380 IN MEMORIAM BILL COLBY country to conduct or win the Vietnam War I tell you dear friend that this Militia and Patriot movement in which as an attorney you have become one of the centerpieces is far more significant and far more dangerous for America than the Anti War Movement ever was if it is not intelligently dealt with And I really mean this Colby concluded What are you saying I asked Bill Aren t you being a little melodramatic I asked him more than a little upset at what I thought he was saying Dangerous I continued Hell one Saturday night gang fight in Los Angeles is more dangerous than all the militias combined together from what I can see I said In fact I told Colby I m willing to wager that you can t find any incidents of real danger or destruction across these United States that were in fact initiated by the militias Every case I have ever heard about is a situation in which one of these characters was being attacked by some government agency over some rinky dink crime in the first place I argued And so far as I can see most of the patriot and militia people I have dealt with are the salt of the earth Americans who truly believe they are trying to save America The typical militia member is usually someone who has a lifetime of activity establishing that role first in the military then as a family man or woman and also as a businessman or hard working lifetime employee somewhere Most often they are mature adults with twenty or more years of life s experiences and learning behind them including paying taxes being property owners

burned a flag or been arrested or served time or done drugs or been a gang member or done drive by shootings I almost shouted at Colby as I discussed this most important issue with him Just what is it that makes the patriot movement and these people so dangerous I demanded of him Bill was now very intense He spoke very slowly and very clearly intending that there be no misunderstanding on my part of what he was saying THE FRANKLIN COVER UP It is not because these people are armed that America need be concerned Bill explained to my surprise It is not that these people stockpile weapons and have para military training sessions that they are dangerous Colby continued What concerns me is something far more serious that I fear our politicians do not see cannot see and and refuse to deal with Colby said They are dangerous precisely because of everything you just said They are dangerous because these people are in most cases mature citizens who have done everything you just described and who tragically and in many cases veryjustifiably have lost faith in the integrity and honesty of their own govern ment Yes they are dangerous because to use your words John they are true patriots who are disenchanted with the government and the system they have grown up loving support ing and giving their lives and talents for from the moment they were born For many of them it is as if they learned their mother was a prostitute and that they are bastards It really is that traumatic I listened to Bill I looked at him and said almost playing the devil s advocate by defending the politicians So what Bill There have always been unhappy people who think the politicians are crooked that the government is bad that the end of the world is coming or whatever We call them nuts or

because there are so many of them It is one thing to have a few nuts or dissidents They can be dealt with justly or otherwise so that they do not pose a danger to the system It is quite another situation when you have a true movement millions of citizens believ ing something particularly when the movement is made up of society s average successful citizens 382 IN MEMORIAM BILL COLBY The handwriting is on the wall in several places Colby continued We know from CNN and USA Today polls that about three out of every four Americans no longer trust their own government And the distance between the government and the citizens is increasing instead of decreasing And that means quite simply John that there is a base of support for the patriot and militia community which is not visible and may not be seen or understood by our government Our government and political leaders are still in the mode of viewing the outspo ken and visible members of the so called patriot movement as simply a few nuts who need to be shut up This is a very dangerous trend It is time for government and the media to begin closing the gap between the government the media and the patriot movement rather than exacerbating it The first step in that process is communication Colby continued Then Colby stunned me with his next declaration John he said looking me in the eyes someone needs to step into the forefront and tell the story of the militias and the patriot movement what it is why it has developed what it means to America if not properly addressed by government who is involved and just how broad based this movement or attitude is where it is strongest and how this movement can be positively directed rather than negatively directed perhaps by foreign powers That is what your next book

do that because you are really in the perfect position and have the capability to do it In fact right now maybe you are the only one in that position I was shocked by Bill Colby s near command to write a new book True as the attorney for some of the Montana Militia I had been put in a unique position to see the inner workings of the militias but from a position of objectivity as 383 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP a lawyer I had first been drawn into the militia scene as a result of the wide circulation of this book By the militias themselves I was seen not as an attorney but as a combatant against the worst forms of obscene corruption by our govern ment and by our nation s so called elites The fact that I was a practicing attorney and a former elected official was of secondary consequence I think you are serious I said to Colby with a gentle snicker trying to break the tension of the moment You really are going to help me do this militia book as you call it and I know when you say you will help that means I have access to a world of intelligence and knowledge that cannot be matched anywhere else on this planet earth I will do it I promised Bill Start on it right away in fact OK Should be a best seller Bill Colby said Next time I see you here in D C in the middle of May you should have the first chapter of your new book Militia Bill said A few days later on April 19 1995 a bomb blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City Within a year my dear friend and longtime adviser was found dead in the Chesapeake Bay I have very serious doubts about the description of

idiosyncracies Colby had a sailboat and his little get away cottage where he went as often as he could I visited him there on several occasions as Bill invited me sailing whenever I was in town Inevitably however the weather forecast would warn of a possibility of rain or a drop of rain would fall or he d notice that the moon was not in the right position or the sun too hot 384 IN MEMORIAM BILL COLBY or whatever And Bill would decide not to take the risk and go out sailing My point is simple Bill Colby was the single most meticu lously careful programmed organized individual I have ever encountered especially when it came to matters of safety security and personal activities Therefore the description given in the media surrounding his death does not cohere with Bill Colby s personality his character his modus operandi and my personal experiences with him over many years Bill Colby was not the kind of person who would take off on an evening boating expedition leaving his computer still turned on at his desk his half finished dinner still sitting on the table and most of the lights on in the cottage That was not Bill Furthermore Bill had been the victim of a robbery in Washington D C not too long before his death in which he had been badly beaten and easily could have died This robbery and his actual death were both mysterious incidents in a relatively short span of time I have a hard time believing in coincidences when it comes to people like Bill Colby His mysterious death has also brought to my mind his own explanations of how people end up dead in the course of our discussing the death of Franklin case investigator Gary Caradori a death Colby himself had investigated His exact statement on this was If it s done right you ll never know how it was done or

simply quit trying to assassinate him Incontrast Colby always used the example of Chilean Presi 385 FRANKLIN COVER UP dent Salvador Allende s death as the perfect assassination We didn t do that one Colby informed me Everybody thinks we did But we truly did not Someone else got to him before we did because we sure were planning it But whoever did that one really did it right We CIA are taking the

perfect assassination no trails somebody else takes the blame mission accomplished I rather suspect in my own mind that that is the situation with Colby s own death In the aftermath of Bill s death a line began to emerge that Bill was either deeply depressed or suffering from some fatal ailment and perhaps took his own life I think a recounting of my last face to face discussion with Bill Colby should dispel this gossip for good I had this meeting with Bill shortly before his death We had a very lengthy discussion about life and I asked him among other things Bill if you were going to pick any period of your life that you would say was the most satisfying and enjoyable what two or three or five year period would it be World War II Vietnam your days as head of CIA When would it be and

dreamed of seeing I am doing and I m going to keep doing it and enjoying it for at least the next five years I hope Colby concluded So John don t be discouraged Bill assured me You are young yet and your best and happiest years really are ahead of you At the time of his death Bill was working with Britain s Lord William Rees Mogg and his American sidekick James Dale Davidson publishing a series of newsletters on interna tional events financial opportunities and politics In fact he was working on an article for one of those newsletters when he died Rees Mogg and Davidson are strange birds Lord William was for over a decade the editor in chief of the staid Times ofLondon and its Sunday Times ofLondon He fits the stereo type of the classic English Colonel Blimp the blunt imperial ist who periodically uncorks with a nasty mouthful of invec tives against the commoner or the darker skinned races After all he used to write that in the coming age of society an elite of 5 of the total population would rule over the other 95 as virtual slaves But Rees Mogg is not justy nasty he represents great power In England it has long been said that The Times the flagship paper of the Establishment regularly announces Britain s foreign policy before the Foreign Office even knows what that policy will be Rees Mogg still writes a weekly column for The Times and 387 THE FRANKLIN COVER

Rees Mogg still writes a weekly column for The Times and 387 THE FRANKLIN COVER UP is one of the major contributors to the newsletter Strategic Investment At the time of his death Bill had emerged as Strategic Investment s leading gee strategist writing a lengthy front page article in almost every edition Since Bill s death another former CIA Director Robert Gates has been coopted into writing a number of articles occupying the space formerly reserved for Bill s words of wisdom But on several occasions when I saw Bill or spoke with him during the last year of his life I d ask him whether I should subscribe to his newsletter or whether he d just give me a few copies to look over He always told me not to waste my money Ask me about any situation you re interested in and I ll give you as thorough a briefing as I possibly can But don t believe a word you read in that newsletter I m writing for Strange But then again Bill Colby spent his entire adult life in the shadow world of spies and counter spies Maybe his involvement with Rees Mogg was more complicated than I ever speculated On at least one point I know there was a savage difference between Bill and Lord Rees Mogg and his crowd Rees Mogg is one of the most vocal detractors of President Clinton and the First Lady and often devotes his Times ofLondon columns exclusively to tirades against the American President Strategic Investment which goes out to a predominantly American read ership contains non stop assaults against the Clintons Not only was Bill s wife Sally Shelton Colby in a senior position in the Clinton Administration but Colby himself had empha sized to me repeatedly that Clinton was a great President and that it was urgent that he be re elected And then I recall another incident which I barely noticed at the time but which now stands out in retrospect Together with Rees Mogg the most savage press hound attacking Clin ton was one Ambrose Evans Pritchard a Briton who has spent hundreds of hours in Arkansas investigating the President and writing streams of articles in The American Spectator the British Daily Telegraph and other papers attacking Clinton Evans Pritchard once called me urgently demanding a meeting 388 IN MEMORIAM BILL COLBY I had never heard of him before and so asked Bill if he had ever heard of this fellow Evans Prickard or something as I put it barely recalling

which Bill spoke so enthusi astically about his work and his travels he was dead under the most unusual circumstances his death officially labeled an accident I did not believe it then and I do not believe it now But I do believe what Bill said If it s done right you will never know how it was done or who did it And so my dear friend I wish you a last good bye I will do my best to carry out the final tasks you assigned me as I always did so many years ago as a Combat Infantry Captain under your command in the rice paddies and hamlets of Vietnam 389 EPILOGUE I finally understood the true meaning of the Franklin case one night in early 1996 Watching television and skipping through the channels I came upon the movie Billy Budd Instantly I zeroed in on this movie and my heart rather than the channels started skipping By the time the movie ended the Franklin cover up made sense Alisha Owen s imprisonment for telling the truth made sense The protection of the perpetrators by our highest public officials finally made sense I understood also why it was necessary to discredit me John DeCamp and to kill Gary Caradori with his eight year old son Any nagging doubts I may have had about any aspects of Paul Bonacci s charges were laid to rest And it was clear to me at last that public officials at all levels knew Paul was telling the truth as they set out to destroy him Where did the blinding revelation come from Let me go back a few months to my last attempt to get a new trial for Alisha Owen At that hearing Troy Boner who had originally told Gary Caradori the truth and who had been forced to recant was preparing to testify to tell the truth as you read it in his affidavit in Chapter 21 Troy Boner was going to provide the information in open court under oath that would blow the lid off the Franklin case and force a new trial for Alisha Owen As Troy came into the courthouse he was immediately ushered into a private room by county judicial authorities He was advised that",

advised that a Special Attorney had been appointed to protect him For approximately one hour while the hearing was delayed Troy was cornered in a room with this Special Attorney and with other officials from the prosecutor s office 390 EPILOGUE the very same prosecutorial team Troy was about to testify against When Troy came out of the meeting I knew he was broken his morale smashed His head hung down He could not or would not look at anyone As I approached Troy his new court appointed attorney tried to step between us With probably the last ounce of courage he could muster Troy leaned over and whispered to me Oh God forgive me They guaranteed if I talk here today they will put me away for twenty years Guaranteed I would never see the light of day again Told me that I would be charged with perjury for my original testimony if I opened my mouth today in court Don t call me up there I can t survive in prison I know they can put me there Look what they did to Alisha Look what they did to my brother I ve got no choice They told me I had to take the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify Otherwise they promised I would be taken directly from court to jail We all proceeded into the court room where I called Troy to the stand I showed Troy his affidavit He hung his head and when I asked my first question Would you please state your name Troy responded I take the Fifth Amendment an answer he repeated in a barely audible voice to all my other questions It was hopeless I ceased my questioning and shortly thereaf ter the hearing ended I walked back to the judge s chambers to clear up any final details Judge Enbody had been specially appointed by the Nebraska State Supreme Court to this hearing which I had won from the Supreme Court based on Troy s new information The next day I learned that he had been appointed to the Court of Appeals a very substantial advancement in his career Sitting in Judge Enbody s chambers with my head hung so low it was

is a judge or other person involved in this case who does not know that horrible THE FRANKLIN COVER UP injustice has been done Everybody knows that Alisha Owen is telling the truth and that she is being punished for it And Your Honor a person has to be deaf dumb blind and totally dishonest not to know that some of this state s and nation s top businessmen and public officials have engaged in the worst crimes possible which are now being covered up And these kids instead of being honored and protected for exposing these things are being sent to prison Why Why Why Judge Enbody looked at me Slowly his voice shaking he began to talk I am just a man I am not a god I wish I were I have no choice in what I have done I am just a man just a man not a god I am doing what I must do with the evidence before me Judge Enbody concluded He appeared even more shaken and upset than I was I shook my head I don t understand I just don t under stand I kept repeating Everybody knows what is happening but nobody is willing to do anything about it Why Why Judge Enbody looked at me and said very slowly If you want to understand the entire Franklin case I can help you Go read Billy Budd Read Billy Budd If you will do that John and if you understand the book then you will understand the what and why of Franklin and why it can be no other way I do not say you will like it I do not say you will agree with it But at least you will understand it That I promise you Go read Billy Budd Those were the last words I spoke with the Judge on the case I left his chambers burnt out but angry And I forgot all about Billy Budd until the night I happened upon the movie The story of Billy Budd is set in the British Navy near the end of the eighteenth century Billy was a young sailor who although impressed into the British Navy bore no ill will to the authorities for having dragooned him indeed he was the very picture of innocence and good will and was almost", "chunk_id":

although impressed into the British Navy bore no ill will to the authorities for having dragooned him indeed he was the very picture of innocence and good will and was almost univer sally loved aboard his war ship One officer however devel oped an insane jealousy of Billy and set out to frame him up for allegedly inciting mutiny Since there had been several notorious mutinies in the British fleet at the time the mere 392 EPILOGUE whisper of mutiny was enough to spread panic among the ship s officers To make a long story short because of certain incriminating appearances in the case the captain and his senior officers although they knew Billy was innocent of all charges nonethe less sentenced him to hang a necessity as they viewed it to save the system not just on their own ship but in the British fleet as a whole Now I think I do understand the Franklin case I know now that all the public officials involved in Franklin whether they ever heard of Billy Budd or not fully understood what they were doing And what they all have done and will continue to do in this case Franklin and no doubt many others like it is this Protect the system at all costs The system is the only ultimate sacred cow not any particular law or constitution but only the system Because ultimately it is the system which makes certain that the individuals functioning within it from judges to lawyers to prosecutors to politicians to businessmen have their places and positions and opportunities and pecking order and future And though it is unfortunate that on occasion the protection of the system requires the deliberate sacrifice of perfectly innocent people that is hoped overall to be the exception rather than the rule But without the system So Judge Enbody now I understand And as you said I may not agree but I do understand But then I have one final nagging question How do I know when or if the system itself has become so corrupted that evil is the rule rather than the exception And when that occurs what do I do about it But I think I know the answer to that one myoId command ing officer in Vietnam told me what I had to do I made some promises to Bill and I intend to keep them 393

Nebraska Senate election run from Vietnam without setting foot on U S soil From 1974 through 1986 Senator DeCamp was hailed by the Omaha World Herald as the most powerful and effective senator in Nebraska But since writing this book The Franklin Cover Up the Omaha World Herald has attacked Senator DeCamp on front pages and editorially as the World Herald s worst enemy DeCamp was born in Nebraska but his unusual experiences early in life helped make him a man of uncommon indepen dence and determination On his own from the age of thirteen DeCamp traveled lived and worked in Europe and

American government secrets It is about how dark truths can be hidden from the public by U S officials in the name of national security and it is about the unpredictable often fortuitous circumstances through which truth gets revealed Operation Paperclip was a postwar U S intelligence program that brought German scientists to America under secret military contracts The program had a benign public face and a classified body of secrets and lies I m mad on technology Adolf Hitler told his inner circle at a dinner party in 1942 and in the aftermath of the German surrender more than sixteen hundred of Hitler s technologists would become America s own What follows puts a spotlight on twenty one of these men Under Operation Paperclip which began in May of 1945 the scientists who helped the Third Reich wage war continued their weapons related work for the U S government developing rockets chemical and biological weapons aviation and space medicine for enhancing military pilot and astronaut performance and many other armaments at a feverish and paranoid pace that came to define the Cold War The age of weapons of mass destruction had begun and with it came the treacherous concept of brinkmanship the art of pursuing dangerous policy to the limits of safety before stopping Hiring dedicated Nazis was without precedent entirely unprincipled and inherently dangerous not just because as Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson stated when debating if he should approve Paperclip These men are enemies but because it was counter to democratic ideals The men profiled in this book were not nominal Nazis Eight of the twenty one Otto Ambros Theodor Benzinger Kurt Blome Walter Dornberger Siegfried Knemeyer Walter Schreiber Walter Schieber and Wernher von Braun each at some point worked side by side with Adolf Hitler Heinrich Himmler or Hermann Göring during the war Fifteen of the twenty one were dedicated members of the Nazi Party ten of them also joined the ultra violent ultra nationalistic Nazi Party paramilitary squads the SA Sturmabteilung or Storm Troopers and the SS Schutzstaffel or Protection Squadron two wore the Golden Party Badge indicating favor bestowed by the

clemency and then was hired by the U S Department of Energy They came to America at the behest of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Some officials believed that by endorsing the Paperclip program they were accepting the lesser of two evils that if America didn t recruit these scientists the Soviet Communists surely would Other generals and colonels respected and admired these men and said so To comprehend the impact of Operation Paperclip on American national security during the early days of the Cold War and the legacy of war fighting technology it has left behind it is important first to understand that the program was governed out of an office in the elite E ring of the Pentagon The Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency JIOA was created solely and specifically to recruit and hire Nazi scientists and put them on weapons projects and in scientific intelligence programs within the army the navy the air force the CIA starting in 1947 and other organizations In some cases when individual scientists had been too close to Hitler the JIOA hired them to work at U S military facilities in occupied Germany The JIOA was a subcommittee of the Joint Intelligence Committee JIC which provided national security information for the Joint Chiefs of Staff The JIC remains the least known and least studied U S intelligence agency of the twentieth century To understand the mind set of the Joint Intelligence Committee consider this Within one year of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the JIC warned the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the United States needed to prepare for total war with the Soviets to include atomic chemical and biological warfare and they even set an estimated start date of 1952 This book focuses on that uneasy period from 1945 to 1952 in which the JIOA s recruitment of Nazi scientists was forever on the rise culminating in Accelerated Paperclip which allowed individuals previously deemed undesirable to be brought to the United States including

a general s desk diaries and a Nuremberg war crimes investigator s journal Coupled with exclusive interviews and correspondence with children and grandchildren of these Nazi scientists five of whom shared with me the personal papers and unpublished writings of their family members what follows is the unsettling story of Operation Paperclip All of the men profiled in this book are now dead Enterprising achievers as they were just as the majority of them won top military and science awards when they served the Third Reich so it went that many of them won top U S military and civilian awards serving the United States One had a U S government building named after him and as of 2013 two continue to have prestigious national science prizes given annually in their names One invented the ear thermometer Others helped man get to the moon How did this happen and what does this mean now Does accomplishment cancel out past crimes These are among the central questions in this dark and complicated tale It is a story populated with Machiavellian connivers and men who dedicate their lives to designing weapons for the coming war It is also a story about victory and what victory can often entail It is rife with Nazis many of whom were guilty of accessory to murder but were never charged and lived out their lives in prosperity in the United States In the instances where a kind of justice is delivered it rings of halfmeasure Or perhaps there is a hero in the record of fact which continues to be filled in PART I Only the dead have seen the end of war Unknown CHAPTER ONE The War

German mortar rounds bombarded the streets Air battles raged overhead and in the center of town inside a fancy apartment on Quai Klébar armed U S soldiers guarded the Dutch American particle physicist Samuel Goudsmit as he sat in an armchair scouring files The apartment belonged to a German virus expert named Dr Eugen Haagen believed to be a key developer in the covert Nazi biological weapons program Haagen had apparently fled his apartment in a hurry just a few days prior leaving behind a framed photograph of Hitler on the mantel and a cache of important documents in the cabinets Goudsmit and two colleagues bacteriological warfare experts Bill Cromartie and Fred Wardenberg had been reading over Dr Haagen s documents for hours Based on what was in front of them they planned to be here all night Most of Strasbourg was without electricity so Goudsmit and his colleagues were reading by candlelight Samuel Goudsmit led a unit engaged in a different kind of battle than the one being fought by the combat soldiers and airmen outside Goudsmit and his team were on the hunt for Nazi science German weaponry more advanced than what the Allies possessed Goudsmit was scientific director of this Top Secret mission code named Operation Alsos an esoteric and dangerous endeavor that was an offshoot of the Manhattan Project Goudsmit and his colleagues were far more accustomed to working inside a laboratory than on a battlefield and yet here they were in the thick of the fight It was up to these men of science to determine just how close the Third Reich was to waging atomic biological or chemical warfare against Allied troops This was called A B C warfare by Alsos An untold number of lives depended on the success of the operation Samuel Goudsmit had qualities that made him the mission s ideal science director Born in Holland he spoke Dutch and German fluently At age twenty three he had become famous among fellow physicists for identifying the concept of electron spin Two years later he earned his PhD at the University of Leiden and moved to America to teach During the war Goudsmit worked on weapons development through a government sponsored lab at MIT This gave him

candlelight Just days before Goudsmit s team had captured four of Hitler s top nuclear scientists and had learned from them that the Nazis atomic bomb project had been a failure This was an unexpected intelligence coup for Alsos and a huge relief The focus now turned to the Reich s biological weapons program rumored to be well advanced Goudsmit and his team of Alsos agents knew that the University of Strasbourg had been doubling as a biological warfare research base for the Third Reich Once a bastion of French academic prowess this four hundred year old university had been taken over by the Reich Research Council Hermann Göring s science organization in 1941 Since then the university had been transformed into a model outpost of Nazi science Most of the university s professors had been replaced with men who were members of the Nazi Party and of Heinrich Himmler s SS On this November night Goudsmit made the decision to have his team set up camp in Professor Haagen s apartment and read all the documents in a straight shot Alsos security team members set their guns aside organized a meal of K rations on the dining room table and settled in to a long night of cards Goudsmit and the biological weapons experts Cromartie and Wardenberg sat back in Professor Haagen s easy chairs and worked on getting through all the files Night fell and it began to snow adding confusion to the scene outside Hours passed Then Goudsmit and Wardenberg let out a yell at the same moment remembered Goudsmit for we had both found papers that suddenly raised the curtain of secrecy for us There in Professor Haagen s apartment in apparently harmless communication lay hidden a wealth of secret information available to anyone who understood it Goudsmit was not deciphering code The papers were not stamped Top Secret They were just the usual gossip between colleagues ordinary memos Goudsmit recalled But they were memos that were never meant to be found by American scientists The plan was for the Third Reich to rule for a thousand years Of the 100 prisoners you sent me Haagen wrote to a colleague at the university an anatomist named Dr August Hirt 18 died in transport Only 12 are in a

Hitler Prof Dr E Haagen The document was dated November 15 1943 For Samuel Goudsmit the moment was a stunning reveal Here casually tucked away in a group of Haagen s personal papers he had discovered one of the most diabolical secrets of the Third Reich Nazi doctors were conducting medical experiments on healthy humans This was new information to the scientific community But there was equally troubling information in the subtext of the letter as far as biological weapons were concerned Haagen was a virus expert who specialized in creating vaccines The fact that he was involved in human medical experiments made a kind of twisted sense to Goudsmit in a way that few others could interpret In order to successfully unleash a biological weapon against an enemy force the attacking army had to have already created its own vaccine against the deadly pathogen it intended to spread This vaccine would act as the shield for its own soldiers and civilians the biological weapon would act as the sword The document Goudsmit was looking at was a little more than a year old How much vaccine progress had the Nazis made since As Goudsmit stared at the documents in front of him he was faced with a troubling reality Once Eugen Haagen had been a temperate man a physician dedicated to helping people In 1932 Dr Haagen had been awarded a prestigious fellowship by the Rockefeller Foundation in New York City where he had helped to develop the world s first yellow fever vaccine In 1937 he had been a contender for the Nobel Prize Haagen had been one of Germany s leading men of medicine Now here he was testing deadly vaccines on once healthy prisoners from concentration camps supplied to him by Himmler s SS If a leading doctor like Haagen had been able to conduct these kinds of research experiments with impunity what else might be going on Goudsmit and his colleagues scoured Dr Haagen s papers paying particular attention to the names of the doctors with whom Haagen corresponded about his prisoner shipments his vaccine tests and his future laboratory plans Goudsmit started putting together a list of Nazi scientists who were now top priorities for Alsos to locate capture and

Soviet zone of occupation in Germany and work for the Russians But among the names discovered in his apartment were two physicians important to Operation Paperclip They were Dr Kurt Blome deputy surgeon general of the Third Reich and Surgeon General Walter Schreiber Dr Blome was in charge of the Reich s biological weapons programs Dr Schreiber was in charge of its vaccines The sword and the shield Before Hitler rose to power Blome and Schreiber had been internationally renowned physicians Had Nazi science also made monsters of these men Almost two weeks after the Alsos mission s discovery at Strasbourg three hundred miles to the north in Germany a party was under way There deep in the dark pine forests of Coesfeld a magnificent moated eight hundred year old stone castle called Varlar was being readied for a celebration The castle was a medieval showpiece of the Münster region resplendent with turrets balustrades and lookout towers On this night December 9 1944 the banquet hall had been decorated in full Nazi Party regalia Trellises of ivy graced the podium Flags featuring Germany s national eagle andswastika emblem hung from walls a motif repeated in each china place setting where the guests of the Third Reich celebrated and dined Outside on Castle Varlar s grounds the snow covered fields were also being readied For centuries the castle had been a monastery its broad lawns used as sacred spaces for Benedictine monks to stroll about and consider God Now in the frigid December cold army technicians made last minute adjustments to the metal platforms of portable rocket launch pads On each sat a missile called the V 2 The giant V 2 rocket was the most advanced flying weapon ever created It was 46 feet long carried a warhead filled with up to 2 000 pounds of explosives in its nose cone and could travel a distance of 190 miles at speeds up to five times the speed of sound Its earlier version the V 1 flying bomb had been raining terror down on cities across northern Europe since the first one hit London on June 13 1944 The V 2 rocket was faster and more fearsome No Allied fighter aircraft could shoot down the V 2 from the sky both because

there was terrifying The reverberations from each V 2 rocket explosion spread up to 20 miles the Christian Science Monitor reported The V weapons bred fear Since the start of the war Hitler had boasted about fearsome hitherto unknown unique weapons that would render his enemies defenseless Over time and with the aid of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels references to these mysterious weapons had been consolidated in a singular terrifying catchphrase Nazi wonder weapons or Wunderwaffe Now throughout the summer and fall of 1944 the Vweapons made the threat a reality That the Nazis had unfurled a wonder weapon of such power and potential this late in the war made many across Europe terrified about what else Hitler might have Plans to evacuate one million civilians from London s city center were put in place as British intelligence officers predicted that a next generation of V weapons might carry deadly chemical or biological weapons in the nose cone England issued 4 3 million gas masks to its city dwellers and told people to pray Major General Walter Dornberger was the man in charge of the rocket programs for the German army s weapons department Dornberger was small bald on top and when he appeared in photographs alongside Himmler he often wore a long shin length leather coat to match the Reichsführer SS He was a career soldier this was his second world war He was also a talented engineer Dornberger held four patents in rocket development and a degree in engineering from the Institute of Technology in Berlin He was one of four honored guests at the Castle Varlar party Later he recalled the scene Around the castle in the dark forest were the launching positions of V 2 troops in our operation against Antwerp It had been Dornberger s idea to set up mobile launch pads as opposed to firing V 2s from fortified bases in the Reich controlled part of France a wise idea considering Allied forces had been pushing across the continent toward Germany since the Normandy landings in June Antwerp was Belgium s bustling northernmost port city located just 137 miles away from the V 2 launch pads at Castle Varlar For a thousand years it had been a

losses under four long years of brutal Nazi rule Three months prior on September 4 1944 the Allies liberated Antwerp There was joy in the streets when the British Eleventh Armored Division rolled into town Since then American and British forces had been relying heavily on the Port of Antwerp to bring in men and matériel to support fighting on the western front and also to prepare for the surge into Germany Now in the second week of December 1944 Hitler intended to reclaim Antwerp The Führer and his inner circle were preparing to launch their last still secret counteroffensive in the Ardennes Forest and for this the German army needed Antwerp shut down The job fell to the V 2 The party at Castle Varlar was to be a night of warfare and celebration with one 42 000 pound liquid fueled rocket being fired off at the enemy after the next while the guests honored four of the men who had been instrumental in building the wonder weapon for the Reich The man at the scientific center of the V 2 rocket program was a thirty two year old aristocrat and wunderkind physicist named Wernher von Braun Von Braun was at Castle Varlar to receive alongside Dornberger one of Hitler s highest and most coveted noncombat decorations the Knight s Cross of the War Service Cross Also receiving the honor were Walther Riedel the top scientist in the rocket design bureau and Heinz Kunze a representative from the Reich s armaments ministry These four medals were to be presented by Albert Speer Hitler s minister of armaments and war production Armaments are the aggregate of a nation s military strength and as minister of weapons Speer was in charge of scientific armaments programs for the Third Reich He joined the Nazi Party in 1931 at the age of twenty six and rose to power in the party as Hitler s architect In that role he created buildings that symbolized the Reich and represented its ideas and quickly became a favorite joining Hitler s inner circle In February 1942 Hitler made Speer his

Speer claimed after the war At the age of thirty seven Albert Speer was now responsible for all science and technology programs necessary for waging war Of the hundreds of weapons projects he was involved in it was the V 2 that he favored most Like von Braun Speer was from a wealthy well respected German family not quite a baron but someone who wished he was Speer liked to exchange ideas with youthful ambitious rocket scientists like Wernher von Braun He admired young men able to work unhampered by bureaucratic obstacles and pursue ideas which at times sounded thoroughly utopian As for General Dornberger the Castle Varlar celebration was a crowning moment of his career The pomp and power thrilled him he later recalled It was a scene Dornberger said after the war the excitement of the evening t he blackness of the night At one point during the meal in between courses the lights inside the castle were turned off and the grand banquet hall was plunged into darkness After a moment of anticipatory silence a tall curtain at the end of the long hall swung open allowing guests to gaze out across the dark wintry lawns The room suddenly lit up with the flickering light of the rocket s exhaust and was shaken by the reverberations of its engines remembered Dornberger Outside perched atop a mobile rocket launch pad the spectacle began An inferno of burning rocket fuel blasted out the bottom of the V 2 powering the massive rocket into flight headed toward Belgium For Dornberger rocket launches instilled unbelievable feelings of pride Once during an earlier launch the general wept with joy On this night the excitement focus alternated from a rocket launch to award decoration then back to a rocket launch again After each launch Speer decorated one of the medal recipients The crowd clapped and cheered and sipped champagne until the banquet hall was again filled with darkness and the next rocket fired off the castle lawn This particular party would end but the

toll from a single rocket attack during the war 567 casualties The Allies were obsessed with the Nazis V weapons If they had been ready earlier the course of war would have been different explained General Dwight D Eisenhower Supreme Allied Commander in Europe It seemed likely that if the German had succeeded in perfecting and using these new weapons six months earlier than he did our invasion of Europe would have proved exceedingly difficult perhaps impossible Eisenhower said Instead circumstance worked in the Allies favor and by the fall of 1944 Allied forces had a firm foothold on the European continent But back in Washington D C inside the Pentagon a secret U S only rocket related scientific intelligence mission was in the works Colonel Gervais William Trichel was the first chief of the newly created Rocket Branch inside U S Army Ordnance Now Trichel was putting together a group of army scientists to send to Europe as part of Special Mission V 2 The United States was twenty years behind Germany in rocket development but Trichel saw an opportunity to close that gap and save the U S Army millions of dollars in research and development costs Trichel s team would capture these rockets and everything related to them for shipment back to the United States The mission would begin as soon as the U S Army arrived in the town of Nordhausen Germany The British had the lead on intelligence regarding V weapons Their photo interpreters had determined exactly where the rockets were being assembled at a factory in central Germany in the naturally fortified Harz Mountains

place was also called Nordhausen after the town and Dora the code name for its concentration camp To average Germans the Harz was a land of fairy tales of dark forests and stormy mountains To those who read Goethe here was the place where the witches and the devil collided at Brocken Mountain Even in America in Disney s popular film Fantasia these mountains had meaning They were where forces of evil gathered to do their handiwork But at the end of the Second World War the Reich s secret subterranean penal colony at Nordhausen was fact not fiction The Mittelwerk was a place where ordinary citizens of France Holland Belgium Italy Czechoslovakia Hungary Yugoslavia Russia Poland and Germany had been transformed into the Third Reich s slaves The underground factory at Nordhausen had been in operation since late August 1943 after a Royal Air Force attack on the Peenemünde facility up north forced armaments production to move elsewhere The day after that attack Heinrich Himmler Reichsführer SS paid a visit to Hitler and proposed they move rocket production underground Hitler agreed and the SS was put in charge of supplying slaves and overseeing facilities construction The individual in charge of expanding Nordhausen from a mine to a tunnel complex was Brigadier General Hans Kammler a civil engineer and architect who earlier in his career built the gas chambers at Auschwitz Birkenau The first group of 107 slave laborers arrived at the Mittelwerk in late August 1943 They came from the Buchenwald concentration camp located fifty miles to the southeast The wrought

now for railcars There were also smaller cross tunnels every few meters that needed to be lengthened to create more workspace In September 1943 machinery and personnel arrived from Peenemünde Notable among the staff and important to Operation Paperclip was the man in charge of production a high school graduate named Arthur Rudolph Rudolph s specialty was rocket engine assembly He had worked under von Braun in this capacity since 1934 Rudolph was a Nazi ideologue he joined the party before there was any national pressure to do so in 1931 What he lacked in academic pedigree he made up for as a slave driver As the Mittelwerk operations director Rudolph worked with the SS construction staff to build the underground factory Then he oversaw production on the assembly lines for V weapons scientific director Wernher von Braun The prisoners worked twelve hour shifts seven days a week putting together V weapons By the end of the first two months there were eight thousand men living and working in this cramped underground space There was no fresh air in the tunnels no ventilation system no water and very little light Blasting went on day and night and the dust after every blast was so thick that it was impossible to see five steps ahead read one report Laborers slept inside the tunnels on wood bunk beds There were no washing facilities and no sanitation Latrines were barrels cut in half The workers suffered and died from starvation dysentery pleurisy pneumonia tuberculosis and phlegmasia from beatings The men were walking skeletons skin stretched over bones Some perished from ammonia burns to the lungs Others died by being crushed from the weight of the rocket parts they were forced to carry The dead were replaceable Humans and machine parts went into the tunnels Rockets and corpses came out Workers who were slow on the production lines were beaten to death Insubordinates were garroted or hanged After the war war crimes investigators determined that approximately half of the sixty thousand men eventually brought to Nordhausen were worked to death The Mittelwerk wasn t the first slave labor camp created and run by the Third Reich The SS recognized the value of slave

work in quarries and factories By 1939 the SS had masterminded a vast network of state sponsored slavery across Nazi occupied Europe through an innocuous sounding division called the SS Business Administration Main Office This office was overseen by Heinrich Himmler but required partnerships These included many companies from the private sector including IG Farben Volkswagen Heinkel and Steyr Daimler Puch The most significant partner was Albert Speer s Ministry of Armaments and War Production When Speer took over as armaments minister in February 1942 his first challenge he said was to figure out how to galvanize war production and make it more efficient Speer s solution was to get rid of bureaucracy and use more slave laborers He himself had been connected to the slave labor programs with the SS for years including when he was an architect Speer s buildings required vast amounts of stone which was quarried by concentration camp laborers from Mauthausen and Flossenbürg The SS Business Administration Main Office specialized in engineering dangerous and fast construction projects as was the case with the V 2 facility at Nordhausen Pay no attention to the human victims Brigadier General Hans Kammler told his staff overseeing construction in the tunnels The work must proceed and be finished in the shortest possible time In the first six months of tunnel work 2 882 laborers died Albert Speer praised Kammler for what he considered to be a great achievement in engineering setting things up so efficiently and so fast Your work far exceeds anything ever done in Europe and is unsurpassed even by American standards wrote Speer There were other reasons why the use of slave labor was so important to wonder weapons production namely the secrecy it ensured The V 2 was a classified weapons project the less Allied intelligence knew about it the better for the Reich When Albert Speer and Heinrich Himmler met with Hitler in August of 1943 to brief him on the benefits of using slave labor Himmler reminded the Führer that if the Reich s entire workforce were to be concentration camp prisoners all contact with the outside world would be eliminated Prisoners don t even receive mail In the spring of 1944 V 2 production had accelerated to the point where the SS provided Mittelwerk managers with their own concentration camp Dora which in turn grew to include

underground massproduction facilities director of entire concern As general manager of the sprawling subterranean enterprise Rickhey was in charge of renting slaves from the SS As a former Demag Armor Works executive he had already overseen the creation of more than 1 5 million square feet of underground tunnels around Berlin all dug by slaves With this experience Rickhey had become a veteran negotiator between private industry and the SS Business Administration Main Office in the procurement of slaves The SS began in effect a rent a slave service to firms and government enterprises at a typical rate of four marks a day for unskilled workers and six marks for skilled ones writes V weapon historian Michael J Neufeld The slaves were disposable When they died they were replaced At Nordhausen the SS gave Rickhey a discount charging the Mittelwerk between two and three reichsmarks per man per day On May 6 1944 days after becoming general manager of the Mittelwerk Rickhey called a meeting to discuss how best to acquire more prisoners for slave labor Wernher von Braun Walter Dornberger and Arthur Rudolph were all present It was decided that the SS should enslave another eighteen hundred skilled French workers to fill the shoes of those who had already been worked to death The record indicates that von Braun Dornberger and Rudolph showed no objection to Rickhey s plan In August the same problem was again at issue This time Wernher von Braun initiated the action himself On August 15 1944 von Braun wrote a letter to a Mittelwerk engineer Albin Sawatzki describing a new laboratory he wanted to set up inside the tunnels Von Braun told Sawatzki that to expedite the process he had taken it upon himself to procure the slave laborers from the Buchenwald concentration camp

secretly be heading to America to work In the last days of World War II few would ever have believed such a thing But the war s last days were coming Just three weeks after the celebration at Castle Varlar Albert Speer found himself with a lot less to celebrate Visiting the Belgian border town of Houffalize accompanied by an SS armored force commander named Josef Sepp Dietrich Speer had what he would describe in his 1969 memoir as a realization Gazing upon the bodies of hundreds of dead German soldiers killed in a recent Allied bomber attack Speer decided the war was over for the Reich The German war machine could no longer compete against the force and will of the Allied offensive Howling and exploding bombs clouds illuminated in red and yellow hues droning motors and no defense anywhere I was stunned by this scene of military impotence which Hitler s military miscalculations had given such a grotesque setting Speer wrote Standing there in Houffalize Speer Hitler s minister of armaments and war production decided to flee from the danger zone At 4 00 a m on the morning of December 31 under cover of darkness Speer and an aide climbed into a private car and hurried east headed for the comforts of a sprawling mountaintop castle outside Frankfurt called Schloss Kransberg or Castle Kransberg Built on a steep rocky cliff in the Taunus Mountains the castle was one of Hermann Göring s Luftwaffe German air force headquarters Just as many of Hitler s scientists would soon become American scientists so would many of the Reich s headquarters and command posts become

off for over two thousand years Castle Kransberg was grand and splendid built piecemeal over the centuries to include watchtowers half timbered meeting halls and stone walls It had 150 odd rooms including a wing that had been redesigned and renovated by Albert Speer in 1939 when Speer was still Hitler s architect At Hitler s behest Speer added several state of the art defense features to Kransberg Castle including a twelve hundred square foot underground bunker complex complete with poison gas air locks designed to protect inhabitants from a chemical warfare attack Now here was Speer having fled from the front lines to hide out in this citadel The next time he would live here it would be as a prisoner of the Americans Hitler had his own headquarters just a few miles away Adlerhorst or the Eagle s Nest had also been designed by Speer It was a series of small cement bunkers at the edge of a long stretch of valley near the spa town of Bad Nauheim Few knew it was there From Adlerhorst Hitler had been directing the Ardennes campaign the Battle of the Bulge Arriving at Kransberg Castle late at night after fleeing Houffalize Speer and his aide were shown to their quarters where they freshened up before driving over to Adlerhorst to celebrate the coming year 1945 with Hitler When Speer arrived at the Eagle s Nest at 2 30 a m on January 1 Hitler who never drank appeared drunk He was in the grip of a permanent euphoria remembered Speer Hitler made a toast and promised that the present low point in the war would soon be overcome His Hitler s magnetic gifts were still operative Speer later recalled In the end Germany would be victorious Hitler said This was enough for Speer to change his mind about losing the war Two weeks later on January 15 with the war allegedly still winnable Adolf Hitler boarded his armored train and began the nineteen hour trip to Berlin where he would spend the rest of his life living underground in the Führerbunker

submarine said one of Hitler s SS honor guards Captain Beermann Beermann described a batlike routine of part time prisoners kept in a cave Miserable rats in a musty cement tomb in Berlin Not everyone shared the sentiment Months later when Mittelwerk general manager Georg Rickhey was angling to get a job from the Americans he would boast to army officers that he d overseen construction of the grand Führerbunker in Berlin Now in mid January 1945 with Hitler moving back to Berlin it was decided that Speer should head east to Silesia in Poland There he was to survey what was going on Important chemical weapons factories had been built in Poland armaments ventures jointly pursued with IG Farben a chemical industry conglomerate The location of these facilities was significant Poland was for the most part out of reach of Allied bombing campaigns But a new threat was bearing down The Soviets had just launched their great offensive in Poland a final military campaign that would take the Red Army all the way to Berlin Germany was being invaded from both sides east and west squeezed as in a vise The same day that Hitler left the Eagle s Nest Speer was driven to Poland There he witnessed firsthand what little was left of the Reich s war machine On January 21 he went to the village of Oppeln to check in with Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner newly appointed commander of the army group and learned that very little of the Wehrmacht s fighting forces remained intact Nearly every soldier and every war machine had been captured or destroyed Burnt out tank hulls littered the snow covered roads Thousands of dead German soldiers lay in ditches along the roadsides but many more dead soldiers swung eerily from trees Those who dared desert the German army had been killed by Field Marshal Schörner a ferocious and fanatical Nazi Party loyalist who had earned his moniker Schörner the Bloody The dead German soldiers had placards hanging around their necks I am a deserter they read I have

had any idea exactly how far the Red Army was from overtaking the very spot where they were standing only that the onslaught was inevitable Speer checked into an otherwise empty hotel and tried to sleep For decades this night remained vivid in Albert Speer s mind In my room hung an etching by Käthe Kollwitz La Carmagnole remembered Speer as an old man It showed a yowling mob dancing with hate contorted faces around a guillotine Off to one side a weeping woman cowered on the ground The weird figures of the etching haunted my fitful sleep wrote Speer There in his Oppeln hotel room Albert Speer was overcome by a thought that had to have been preoccupying many Nazis minds After Germany what will become of me The guillotine Will I be torn apart by a yowling mob Jedem das Seine Could it be true Does everyone get what he deserves The following week on January 30 1945 Speer wrote a memorandum to Hitler outlining the huge losses in Silesia The war is lost is how Speer s report began Widespread destruction of evidence would now begin CHAPTER TWO Destruction Ninety miles southeast of Speer s Oppeln hotel room chaos was unfolding at the Auschwitz Birkenau death camp Speer s chairman of the ultra secret Committee C for chemical weapons a chemist named Dr Otto Ambros had documents to destroy It was January 17 1945 and every German in a position of power at Auschwitz from the army officers to the IG Farben officials was trying to flee Not Ambros He would not leave the labor extermination camp for another six days Otto Ambros was a fastidious man His calculations were exact his words carefully chosen his fingernails always manicured He wore his hair neatly oiled and parted In addition to being Hitler s favorite chemist Ambros was the manager of IG Farben s synthetic rubber and fuel factory at Auschwitz With the Red Army bearing down the Farben board members had ordered the destruction and removal of all classified paperwork Ambros and colleague Walther Dürrfeld were at Auschwitz to do the job In addition to being the plant manager of this hellish place Ambros was the youngest member on Farben s board of directors All over the camp SS guards were destroying evidence

concentration camp it consisted of three separate but symbiotic camps Auschwitz I the main camp Auschwitz II the Birkenau gas chambers and crematoria and Auschwitz III a labor concentration camp run by the chemical giant IG Farben Since April 7 1942 IG Farben had been building the Reich s largest chemical plant at Auschwitz using a workforce of slave laborers selected from the Auschwitz train car platforms Farben called their facility IG Auschwitz IG Auschwitz was the first corporate concentration camp in the Third Reich The barracks in which the slave laborers lived and died was officially called Monowitz Those of us who lived there called it Buna recalls Gerhard Maschkowski a survivor of the camp Maschkowski was a nineteen year old Jewish boy spared the gas chamber because he was of use to IG Auschwitz as an electrician That he was still alive in the second week of January 1945 was something of a miracle He had arrived at Auschwitz on April 20 1943 which meant that he had been there for a year and nine months At Buna the average lifespan of a slave laborer was three months Many of Gerhard Maschkowski s friends had long since been worked to death or had been murdered for minor infractions like hiding a piece of food Gerhard Maschkowski remembers January 18 1945 with clarity because it was his last day at Auschwitz It was still dark outside when the SS burst into the barracks They shouted Get up March They had large guns thick jackets and dogs Maschkowski recalls He put on his shoes and hurried outside There nine thousand emaciated starving inmates from Buna were

guns Dogs on leather leashes barked and snarled Gerhard Maschkowski recalls Wearing thin pajamas the prisoners at Buna Monowitz began a death march toward the German interior Within forty eight hours 60 percent of them would be dead Primo Levi was not part of the death march A week before he had contracted scarlet fever and had been sent to the infectious diseases ward He had a high temperature and a strawberry tongue remembered Aldo Moscati the Italian doctor prisoner who tended to him With a 104 degree fever I was extremely feeble and could not even walk Primo Levi explained after the war Lying supine in the infectious diseases ward he listened to the sounds of the emptying camp On January 21 a memorandum from Berlin ordered all Farben employees to leave The last train for Germans leaving Auschwitz transporting mostly IG Farben s female staff from the camp left that same afternoon Yet Otto Ambros stayed behind Ambros s official title was plant manager of Buna Werk IV and managing director of the fuel production facility at IG Auschwitz He had been involved in the facility since January 1941 back when Farben s original plans were being drawn Ambros had chosen the site location and sketched out the original blueprints for the plant He was also the man who invented synthetic rubber for the Reich Tanks trucks and airplanes all require rubber for tires and treads and during wartime this feat was considered so important to the Reich s ability to wage war that Ambros had been awarded 1 million reichsmarks by the Führer Finally on January 23 1945 Ambros left the concentration camp Only random prisoners remained Inmates like Primo Levi who were too weak to march and had not been killed by the SS lay in the infectious diseases ward When Levi s fever finally

got closer he could see that at the center of the soldiers caps there was a bright red star The Red Army had arrived Auschwitz was liberated Otto Ambros was already on the way to Falkenhagen Germany to destroy evidence in another Farben factory there Speer headed back to Berlin Neither man dared travel north inside Poland where a second armaments factory the two men were jointly involved in was also in jeopardy of being captured by the Soviets At this facility called Dyhernfurth after the small riverside village in which it was located IG Farben produced chemical weapons deadly nerve agents on an industrial scale On January 24 1945 the day after Ambros fled Auschwitz Farben had given the word to evacuate Dyhernfurth and destroy whatever evidence remained there All munitions were loaded onto railcars and trucks and sent to depots in the west The destruction of evidence was now becoming standard operating procedure at laboratories research facilities and armaments factories across the Reich And while Nazi Germany faced imminent collapse its scientists engineers and businessmen had their futures to think about All across Nazi occupied Poland German forces were retreating en masse as the Red Army continued to shred the eastern front On February 5 1945 one hundred and seventy miles northwest of Auschwitz the Soviets captured the village of Dyhernfurth Soviet soldiers took over the town s castle built during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and drank up its wine cellar The castle with its fairy tale like conical spires quickly transformed into a scene of wild debauchery with inebriated Russian soldiers singing rowdy victory songs The situation got so out of control that Russian commanders suspended fighting until order could be restored This made for a perfect opportunity for a team of Nazi commandos hiding in the forest to launch a daring and unprecedented raid Less than half a mile away one of the Reich s most prized wonder weapons facilities lay hidden

individual in minutes or sometimes seconds Exposure meant the glands and muscles would hyperstimulate and the respiratory system would fail Paralysis would set in and breathing would cease At Dyhernfurth where accidents had happened a human s death by tabun gas resembled the frenetic last moments of an ant sprayed with insecticide Like the synthetic rubber and fuel factory at Auschwitz the nerve agent production facility at Dyhernfurth was owned and operated by IG Farben and here the Speer ministry worked with Farben to fill aerial bombs with tabun that could eventually be deployed from Luftwaffe planes No one in the inner circle knew for sure when or if Hitler would finally concede to many of his ministers wishes and allow for a chemical weapons attack against the Allies But as evidenced at Dyhernfurth the opportunity was real Enough poison gas had been produced here to decimate the population of London or Paris on any given day Despite the overwhelming onslaught of Red Army troops to this region in February of 1945 Hitler remained determined to keep the secrets of tabun out of enemy hands On the morning of February 5 1945 Major General Max Sachsenheimer of the Reich s Seventeenth Field Replacement Battalion and his troops were hiding in the forest along the banks of the Oder River Sachsenheimer s commando force was made up of several hundred soldiers but he also had a unique secondary contingent of men namely eighty two scientists and technicians Some were army scientists but most were IG Farben employees and chemical weapons experts Sachsenheimer s mission was to protect the scientists while they scrubbed Farben s facility of any and all traces of tabun The Dyhernfurth complex was a sprawling state of the art production plant Speer s Armaments and War

chemical concern was the largest corporation in Europe and the fourth largest corporation in the world IG Farben owned the patent on Zyklon B And perhaps no single person at Farben was as central a

economy leader Wehrwirtschaftsführer He was awarded the War Merit Cross 1st and 2nd Class and the Knight s Cross of the War Merit Cross which was similar to the award bestowed on Dornberger and von Braun There was a second scientist who played an important role in chemical weapons a man who like Otto Ambros would be targeted for Operation Paperclip This was SS Brigadeführer Dr Walter Schieber a chemist by training Speer s deputy and director of the Armaments Supply Office Schieber was a hard core Nazi ideologue and a member of Reichsführer SS Himmler s personal staff Unusually corpulent for an SS officer his official car and airplane required retrofitting to accommodate his 275 pound frame With Hitler s physician Karl Brandt Schieber was in charge of gas mask production a requisite for troop defense if chemical warfare was to be waged As with biological weapons the sword needs a shield and by January of 1945 Schieber had overseen the production of 46 1 million gas masks Their reliability had been tested at Dyhernfurth on concentration camp prisoners The stories that would emerge during the Nuremberg trials about such tests were ghoulish including locking prisoners in glass rooms and spraying them with nerve agent War crimes investigators would later debate whether or not these actions were pilot programs for the gas chambers The full story of how and to what extent Dr Walter Schieber worked for the U S military after the war and also for the CIA has never been fully explained until this book Only weeks before the Red Army took Dyhernfurth overran its castle and

three green rings of paint The prisoners suits worked similar to deep sea diving suits Attached to the back of each helmet was a tube delivering breathable air But the air tube was short and gave workers very little room to move If a man accidentally detached from the air source he would be exposed to the lethal vapors through the breathing tube and die But on the morning of February 5 1945 the facility was empty Not a chemist or a slave laborer remained The munitions had been moved documentary evidence destroyed and all the IG Farben employees had fled The prisoners had been evacuated

troops The battle a footnote in the annals of the war lasted just long enough for IG Farben s technical team to get in get out and disappear Not for several days did the Red Army finally stumble upon Farben s chemical weapons facility at Dyhernfurth By then it was void of people and tabun but otherwise entirely intact As the Russians examined the facility scrubbed immaculately clean it became clear to the commanders that whatever this facility had produced must have been considered of great value to the Reich The laboratory layout bore signs of chemical weapons production and the Soviet army called in their own chemical weapons experts from the Sixteenth and Eighteenth Chemical Brigades The factory was dismantled crated and shipped back to the Soviet Union for future use What had been produced here in the forest remained a mystery to its new owners the Russians for a little over a year By 1946 the entire chemical weapons factory at Dyhernfurth would be reassembled in a little town outside Stalingrad called Beketovka and the plant given the Russian code name Chemical Works No 91 The Soviets themselves then began producing tabun nerve agent on an industrial scale By 1948 the Soviet Military Chemical Text Book would list tabun as part of the Red Army s stockpile But 1948 was so far away So much would happen with America and Hitler s chemists between 1945 and 1948 most of it predicated on the emerging Soviet threat Back in Berlin Hitler read the first page of Speer s report and ordered it filed away Then Hitler became enraged His furor was likely exacerbated by a conference taking place on the Crimea Peninsula at Yalta beginning February 4 1945 It was to last for eight days There Roosevelt Churchill and Stalin were confirming their commitment to demand Germany

executions without trial President Franklin D Roosevelt wanted a war crimes trial What all parties agreed on was that after the surrender Germany would be broken up into three zones of occupation Soon France s involvement would make it four When Hitler learned of the Allies plan to divvy up the spoils of Germany he became furious Then he called on Albert Speer If the war is lost Hitler famously told Speer the nation will also perish This fate is inevitable If Germany loses the war Hitler said the people deserved existential punishment for being weak What will remain after this struggle will be in any case only the inferior ones since the good ones have fallen Hitler said Following this logic Hitler decreed that Speer s ministry need not provide German citizens with even the most basic necessities including shelter and food He told Speer that if Speer were ever to give him another memorandum saying the war was unwinnable and that negotiations with the enemy should be considered Hitler would consider this an act of treason punishable by death Hitler then issued a nationwide scorched earth policy Speer was to help organize the complete destruction of all German infrastructure military and civilian from its transportation and communication systems to its bridges and dams Officially entitled Demolitions on Reich Territory this order became known as the Nero Decree or Nerobefehl invoking the Roman emperor Nero who allegedly engineered the Great Fire of 64 AD and then watched Rome burn In central Germany in the naturally fortified Harz Mountains production of V

from the Peenemünde facility to the Harz Mountains von Braun had been given a promotion Now he was head of what was called the Mittelbau Dora Planning Office a division within Himmler s SS Von Braun lived just a few miles from the Nordhausen complex in a villa that had been confiscated from a Jewish factory owner years before Each day he drove to his office in Bleicherode eleven miles from the tunnel complex where he drafted designs for new and better test stands and launch ramps for the V 2 Despite the reality that the war was lost the area was abuzz with new armaments factories being built dug by workers from some of the forty odd subcamps now tied to Mittelbau Dora Michael J Neufeld explains Von Braun s vision was to escalate rocket production from two or three rockets a day to two hundred rockets a day To prepare for this ambitious expansion he commandeered factories schools and mines throughout the region But rocket assembly was dependent on workers and the slave laborers in Nordhausen were now dying at an ever increasing rate Von Braun had to have known this he visited the underground tunnels in an official capacity ten times during the winter of 1945 For the emaciated slave laborers who had managed to stay alive trying to assemble missiles in filthy unfinished tunnels without food water or sanitation in the bitter cold of winter had become more and more difficult and it showed in their work In skies across Europe these hastily constructed rockets began breaking apart in flight And in the pine forests of northern Germany including those around the Castle Varlar quickly assembled rockets were exploding on their mobile launch pads The managers at Mittelwerk suspected sabotage To send a message public hangings were held Prisoners were hanged up to 57 in one day read one war crimes report They were hanged in the tunnels with the help of an electrically controlled crane a dozen at a time their hands bound behind their back a piece of wood was put

these men were hanged their bodies were left dangling for a day Only after Arthur Rudolph the Mittelwerk operations director received a memo from one of his German engineers asking when they were going to get their crane back were the bodies taken down In addition to von Braun s recent promotion to head of the Mittelbau Dora Planning Office he was also promoted to SS Sturmbannführer or SS major One of the benefits that came with this position was a chauffeur driven car to shuttle von Braun back and forth between Nordhausen and Berlin It was in the backseat of this car on the night of March 12 1945 that von Braun was nearly killed As his car was speeding down the autobahn headed for Berlin his driver nodded off at the wheel The car veered off the road and hurtled down a forty foot embankment until it crashed on its side near a railroad track The driver was knocked unconscious Von Braun broke his arm Both men lay bleeding in the cold dark night when two of von Braun s colleagues from Nordhausen facilities designer Bernhard Tessmann and architect Hannes Lührsen happened to drive by and spot the smashed up car They called for a military ambulance which came to the scene and transported von Braun and his driver to a hospital While recuperating von Braun received a visit from his personal aide Dieter Huzel and Bernhard Tessmann one of the two men who had saved von Braun s

next scientific intelligence mission It had been four months since the team hit intelligence gold inside the Strasbourg apartment of the Reich s virologist Dr Eugen Haagen Now in the last week of March 1945 Goudsmit and his military commander Colonel Boris Pash were finally getting ready to seize their next targets IG Farben factories over the border in Germany believed to be the locus of the Nazis chemical weapons program Since November Haagen s apartment in Strasbourg had been serving as Alsos headquarters There had been long delays In December Hitler s counteroffensive in the Ardennes

serendipity would have it the entire first floor below Haagen s Strasbourg apartment belonged to IG Farben the primary chemical weapons supplier of the Third Reich and Alsos seized a considerable cache of documents Farben kept there Alsos knew Farben was involved in weapons related vaccine research and suspected they were involved in medical experiments on prisoners The two Farben factories they had in their sights were located only about eighty miles away in the German cities of Ludwigshafen and Mannheim For this Operation Alsos had put together their largest task force to date ten civilian scientists six military scientists and eighteen security operators But venturing into German held territory on their own was considered too dangerous for the American scientists They had been waiting for Allied forces to cross over the Rhine River into Germany at which point they too would be allowed in Now in the third week of March 1945 this long awaited crossing appeared imminent On March 23 1945 British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery began a colossal troop offensive across the Rhine River code named Operation Plunder Adding to the namesake s subtext of seizure and pillage were Montgomery s famous words Over the Rhine then let us go And good hunting to you all on the other side Sacking a vanquished country at the end of a war was as old as war itself but the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 prohibited looting beyond token items claimed as trophies of war What exactly did Montgomery mean On a tactical level the Rhine River crossing meant that the Allies would smash open more than five hundred miles along the western front From an intelligence collection standpoint it truly meant plunder As soldiers pushed forward into Germany accompanying them were more than three thousand scientific and technical experts with the Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee or CIOS the joint British American program that had been established in London the summer

teams were relayed to SHAEF from the combat zone An appropriate CIOS team would be dispatched into the field Assisting CIOS teams were security forces called T Forces identifiable by helmets with a bright red T painted on the front These small squadrons of elite soldiers operated at the army group level but worked independently of traditional combat units Their job was to recognize potentially valuable scientific targets and then secure them until personnel from CIOS arrived The goal of Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee was to investigate all things related to German science Target types ran the gamut radar missiles aircraft medicine bombs and fuses chemical and biological weapons labs And while CIOS remained an official joint venture there were other groups in the mix with competing interests at hand Running parallel to CIOS operations were dozens of secret intelligence gathering operations mostly American The Pentagon s Special Mission V 2 was but one example By late March 1945 Colonel Trichel chief of U S Army Ordnance Rocket Branch had dispatched his team to Europe Likewise U S Naval Technical Intelligence had officers in Paris preparing for its own highly classified hunt for any intelligence regarding the Henschel Hs 293 a guided missile developed by the Nazis and designed to sink or damage enemy ships The U S Army Air Forces AAF were still heavily engaged in strategic bombing campaigns but a small group from Wright Field near Dayton Ohio was laying plans to locate and capture Luftwaffe equipment and engineers Spearheading Top Secret missions for British intelligence was a group of commandos called 30 Assault Unit led by Ian Fleming the personal assistant to the director of British naval intelligence and future author of the James Bond novels Sometimes the members of these parallel missions worked in consort with CIOS officers in the field Certainly they took full advantage of all the information CIOS made available including its

history of war Once the Rhine River was crossed the hunt for Nazi science became a free for all On its search for chemical weapons Alsos scientists crossed the Rhine on the heels of the Third Army They traveled in a small convoy of army jeeps The area was not in good shape Colonel Pash recalled after the war Buildings of the town shook from the shock waves generated by the gun explosions and stalled or broken down vehicles added to the confusion created by the wrecked armor and trucks of the retreating Nazis Entering Ludwigshafen one of the Alsos jeeps became separated from its convoy and ran smack into the line of fire of a German antitank gun Hardly expecting a single jeep to appear on the road without a tank accompanying it the Germans were apparently caught off guard A single salvo and the few machine gun bursts went wide Pash recalled after the war The Alsos scientists had heard that T Forces units were close behind them and were making arrangements for a large team of technical experts to arrive under the CIOS banner The Alsos scientists were determined to get to the IG Farben factory first But what they ended up finding in Ludwigshafen was disappointing to them Not only had the factory been heavily damaged by Allied bombing raids but filing cabinets were empty Paperwork had been destroyed or removed There were no chemical weapons found The following morning March 24 1945 while at breakfast the Alsos team met up with the T Forces and the CIOS team Both had come to inspect the Farben factory It was interesting to watch the effect of bombshells casually dropped by our scientists Pash recalled sounding something like Oh sure You ll be able to go to the Farben plant tomorrow after the T Forces secures it You ll find it interesting We know because we were there yesterday The rivalry between the teams was evident The two men leading the CIOS chemical weapons team were an American officer named Lieutenant Colonel Philip R Tarr and a British officer

together as a CIOS team With American forces now on German soil the fear that Hitler might unleash a devastating chemical weapons attack in a last ditch attempt to make good on his wonder weapons promise was real but Tarr and Tilley had very few leads as to where the chemical weapons might be stashed German counterintelligence agents had done a brilliant job concealing the Reich s nerve agent programs from foreign intelligence agencies during the war Tabun had been given various code names including Trilon 83 Substance 83 and Gelan 1 Even its raw materials were coded Ethanol was A4 and sodium was A 17 making identification all but impossible In 1942 a U S intelligence report entitled New German Poison Gas concluded that the possibility that Germany had new chemical weapons was no longer seriously regarded Only in May of 1943 after capturing a German chemist in North Africa did British agents learn of a colorless nerve agent of astounding properties being developed by IG Farben chemists in Berlin The British interrogation officers found the German chemist s information to be credible and wrote up a ten page secret report for the Chemical Defense Experimental Establishment which operated out of Porton Down But the captured scientist knew only the substance s code name Trilon 83 Without further information no action was taken by the British Now in March 1945 Tarr and

intelligence remained out of reach Then as circumstance would have it Alsos agents caught a huge break farther north in the city of Bonn Alsos had been trailing the Third Armored Division since it first rolled into Ludwigshafen on March 23 Several days later the soldiers liberated the city of Cologne and then set their sights on Bonn some fifteen miles to the north Scouting soldiers reported seeing men who might be professors burning caseloads of documents in Bonn University courtyards What they couldn t see was that inside university bathrooms professors were also desperately flushing documents down the toilet hoping to destroy evidence that might implicate them in war crimes When the Allies finally secured the university a Polish lab technician approached a British soldier to say that he had salvaged a large pile of documents that did not properly flush down a toilet bowl as had apparently been intended These papers looked important the lab technician said And indeed they were The man had turned over to British intelligence a classified list of the Reich s top scientists The officer handed the list over to Samuel Goudsmit of Operation Alsos This group of documents would lead to what would become known as the Osenberg List Dr Werner Osenberg a mechanical engineer was a dedicated Nazi and member of the SS he was also a high ranking member of the Gestapo the secret police In June 1943 Osenberg was assigned by Göring to run the so called Planning Office of the Reich Research Council which was dedicated to warfare Per a Führer decree of June 9 1942 the Research

research facilities All across Germany scientists engineers and technicians were recalled from the front lines an act Hitler called the Osenberg Action This led to the release of five thousand scientists from the German Armed Forces After being screened for skill level the men of science were set up in appropriated universities and institutions across Reich territory where they could work on weapons related research programs in service of the war effort The mystery of how the Osenberg List ended up in a Bonn University toilet was never solved but for Alsos it was an intelligence gold mine Not only was this list a record of who had been working on what scientific project for the Reich but it contained addresses including one for Werner Osenberg himself Goudsmit dispatched a team to a little town near Hannover There Alsos agents captured Osenberg and his complete outfit The papers found in the toilet were valuable but it was an index of cards in Osenberg s office that was priceless The primary index consists of a four drawer cabinet containing approximately two thousand large printed cards 10 x 7 adapted for multiple entry on both sides of the card reported Alsos Secondary indexes included three additional sets of approximately one thousand cards each 6 x 4 containing the same information but classified from a different standpoint and facilitating searches along different lines This was an overwhelming trove of information too much for any one organization to handle Alsos shared the Osenberg List with CIOS there were thousands of leads that needed following up on Osenberg s card catalogue would allow the various teams to begin piecing together how science programs worked under the Reich and who had been in charge The Alsos officers packed up

No I did not burn those papers he told Goudsmit I buried them and moreover I was not the chief of the scientific section of the Gestapo I was merely the second in command After that it was easy for Goudsmit to find out from Osenberg where those papers were buried and where the missing Berlin papers were stored But no one from the Allied forces was going into Berlin just yet In these last days of March 1945 Berlin continued to be the heart of the Reich and it was being fiercely defended It would remain German held territory for another month until the last day of April 1945 It was a city in ruins and Berliners morale was sinking with each passing day With nearly 85 percent of the city destroyed Berlin had been reduced to rubble piles The majority of buildings still standing had broken windows Everyone was cold The underground shelters were vastly overcrowded Heating fuel was scarce During early April explains historian Anthony Beevor as Berlin awaited the final onslaught of the Red Army the atmosphere in the city became a mixture of febrile exhaustion terrible foreboding and despair Nazi radio broadcasts reminded Berliners that they were required to fight to the end According to

thousand windows and corridors that totaled four miles in length At the height of the air war the place bustled with four thousand Nazi bureaucrats and their secretaries This was no longer the case The Luftwaffe was in ruins Since 1943 Siegfried Knemeyer had served as chief of all air force technical developments for the Luftwaffe His title was technical adviser to Reichsmarschall Göring who adored Knemeyer calling him my boy From aircraft engines to instruments if a new component was being developed for the Luftwaffe Göring wanted to know what Knemeyer had to say about it before he gave the project the go ahead But now in the second week of April 1945 most orders that arrived at the Air Ministry were impossible for Knemeyer to fulfill In the second half of 1944 the German Air Force had lost more than twenty thousand airplanes The Speer ministry had since managed to produce approximately three thousand new aircraft but they were of little use now Across the Reich German aircraft sat stranded on tarmacs The Allies had bombed Luftwaffe runways and there was barely any aviation fuel left The plan for IG Farben to make synthetic fuel at its Buna factory had ended when the Red Army liberated Auschwitz on January 27 1945 Germany s fuel sources in Hungary and Romania were tapped out The German jet was superior to conventional Allied fighter planes in the air but that didn t mean much anymore with most Luftwaffe aircraft stuck on the ground Soon Knemeyer would flee Berlin but not before he completed a final task assigned to him by Speer According to Nuremberg trial testimony Speer instructed Knemeyer to hide Luftwaffe technical information in the forest outside Berlin Stashing official documents was a treasonable offense but according to Knemeyer s personal papers Speer and Knemeyer had agreed that Germany s seminal scientific progress in aeronautics could not under any circumstances fall into Russian hands There was also a second unofficial job that

wanted to escape to Greenland should Germany lose the war In Greenland Speer could set up camp and write his memoirs he later explained Of course he d need a pilot which is where Knemeyer fit in Knemeyer was an aeronautical engineer but he was also one of the Luftwaffe s most revered pilots ranked among the top ten aviators in all of Germany His specialty back when he flew missions in the earlier stages of the war had been espionage From 1938 to 1942 Knemeyer flew a number of the most dangerous Abwehr military intelligence missions on record including ones over England and Norway And it was Knemeyer who made the first high altitude sortie over North Africa flying at forty four thousand feet But Knemeyer was also a pragmatist He knew apparently more so than Speer that attempting to fly out of Germany and into Greenland transporting one of the most wanted war criminals of the Third Reich during the final days of the war would be a near toimpossible feat There was brutal weather in Greenland and fierce terrain The mission would require a very specific aircraft that could handle the harsh conditions and difficult landing namely the Bv 222 designed by Blohm Voss Only thirteen had ever been built There was only one man who had access to that kind of airplane and that was Knemeyer s friend Werner Baumbach a twentyeight year old dive bomber pilot whom Hitler had made general of the bombers Knemeyer knew that bringing Baumbach on board was imperative for a successful Greenland escape During the war Baumbach had flown missions between Norway and a German weather station located in Greenland Speer agreed and Baumbach was brought into the plan In secret Baumbach and Knemeyer began gathering food medicine rifles skis tents fishing equipment and hand grenades at Speer s

marched east headed toward Munich and Berlin Alongside these liberations soldiers also discovered Reich laboratories and research facilities one after the next After each discovery a team of CIOS scientists was called in to investigate During the second week of April in 1945 four key facilities were seized at Nordhausen Geraberg Völkenrode and Raubkammer each of which would lead to the capture of key scientists who would in turn become part of Operation Paperclip On the morning of April 11 1945 a unit of American soldiers with the 104th Infantry Division also known as the Timberwolves entered the slave tunnels at Nordhausen Among the liberating soldiers was an infantry sharpshooter a private first class named John Risen Jones Jr In his bag he carried a camera a gift given to him by his family before he shipped off to war Expensive and sleeklooking Jones s Leica III was one of the first portable 35 mm cameras ever made It had been seven months since John Risen Jones landed in France back in September 1944 He had spent 195 days on the continent thus far many of them engaged in fierce combat all the while pushing though snow sleet and mud much of it on foot Jones had walked across France Belgium and Holland and now here he was in the deep mountains of central Germany the Harz He had lost friends in battle and taken many photographs of the war When his unit arrived in this little mountain town he imagined the day would pass like the one before Just one step closer to the end of this brutal war No amount of fighting prepared John Risen Jones for what he saw through the lens of his Leica when his unit entered Nordhausen The photographs he took documented the tragedy that had befallen thousands of V 2 rocket laborers condemned to die as slaves in the tunnels here

Aalmans Like John Risen Jones Aalmans was deeply affected by what he saw and smelled Stench the tuberculosis and the starved inmates he told journalist Tom Bower after the war Four people were dying every hour It was unbelievable Aalmans and his team began taking witness statements from prisoners who sipped watered down milk for strength The job facing the war crimes investigators was overwhelming and their schedule was intense After five days in Nordhausen they were ordered to move on Most of the official paperwork regarding rocket production had been hidden or destroyed but Aalmans and his team found a single sheet of paper inadvertently left behind tacked to the wall It was the Mittelwerk telephone list a directory of who was in charge At the very top were two names Georg Rickhey director of production and Arthur Rudolph deputy production manager Aalmans found the document interesting enough to staple it to the report Although it would take years to come to light this single sheet of paper would eventually lead to the downfall of Rudolph and Rickhey and threaten to expose the dark secrets of Operation Paperclip Seventy five miles south of Nordhausen in the Thuringian Forest at the edge of the Harz Allied soldiers liberated the town of Geraberg Here they came upon a curious looking research facility concealed in a thick grove of trees Clearly the place had recently been abandoned It comprised a laboratory an isolation block animal houses and living quarters for fourteen men Part of the facility was still under construction Word was sent to SHAEF headquarters in Versailles that a team of bacteriologists was needed in Geraberg Alsos scientists were dispatched to investigate One of the first biological warfare experts to arrive was Bill Cromartie who had been hunting for evidence of Hitler s biological weapons program since the mission began back in Strasbourg France Back in November Cromartie had been one of the men scouring files

small valley and constructed under tall trees read Cromartie s classified report On one side there was a building that was to have been the experimental laboratory he surmised suggesting that this facility was designed to produce experimental vaccines to protect German soldiers against a biological weapons offensive A local villager provided Cromartie and a colleague J M Barnes with two key pieces of information in the biological weapons puzzle The villager explained that an SS man named Dr Karl Gross had been overseeing work at this facility Gross kept dozens of trunks and boxes locked in the upper floors of a local schoolhouse and while he had recently disappeared he had left the trunks behind The villager took the American scientists to the schoolhouse to investigate An inventory was taken of Dr Gross s possessions mostly laboratory equipment There were crates of test tubes and small flasks and large numbers of test tube racks There were two incubators and an autoclave There were two boxes of gas mask filters and some rubber hoods and gowns read the report Everything was military grade protective gear marked as having been obtained from the Hygiene Institute of the Waffen SS There was also a large collection of books several boxes of periodicals all dealing with infectious diseases The ones that really caught the scientists attention were Russian contributions on plague Next the villager took the Alsos agents to the nearby boardinghouse where Dr Gross had been renting a room The place was cleared out and void of personal possessions His landlady said she believed he had burnt a lot of papers the night before he left the Alsos scientists noted in their report But Dr Gross was only the intermediary the landlady said There was another man who came to the facility and appeared to be in charge He was an older man about fifty five foot nine with a mustache and black hair On his upper lip he had a pronounced dueling scar He had to have been of high rank

Infantry moved cautiously through the forest on the western edge of a small city called Braunschweig It was April 13 1945 when they came upon a compound of about seventy buildings Great care had gone into camouflaging this place the soldiers noted Thousands of trees had been planted closely so that the area would appear from the air to be dense forest The buildings in the compound had been designed to look like simple farmhouses Traditional gardens had been planted and tended to Stork nests covered the rooftops Inside the buildings soldiers discovered state of the art aircraft laboratories including entire warehouses filled with airplane parts and rocket fuel There were wind and weapons tunnels that were radically more advanced than anything the Army Air Forces had at Wright Field The oldest division in the United States Army had unexpectedly happened upon the most scientifically advanced aeronautics laboratory in the world It was called the Hermann Göring Aeronautical Research Center at Völkenrode The Allies had never heard of it before It didn t appear on any CIOS Black List It was an incredible find At first it seemed as if the place had been abandoned But after an hour of looking around the soldiers came upon the institute s scientific director a man named Adolf Busemann Busemann told the soldiers that this facility was called Völkenrode for short and that it had been up and running for ten years A team of Army Air Forces technical intelligence experts working as part of a mission called Operation Lusty and stationed in Saint Germain

that would be of material assistance in the prosecution of the war against Japan The man Spaatz chose to lead the hunt for Luftwaffe scientists and engineers was Colonel Donald L Putt When Putt arrived at Völkenrode on April 22 1945 he was thrilled by what he saw All he could think about was how quickly he could get all this equipment back to the United States Putt was a legendary test pilot who had been at Wright Field since 1933 assigned to various branches including the Flying Branch He had walked away from a deadly air crash that killed his colleagues and left him with second degree burn scars on his face and neck Putt was a hard charging Type A personality a tiger among men He displayed the ability to withstand great emotional shock to absorb it and take in stride explained a colleague from Wright Field Putt was also intellectually gifted with a degree in electrical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology and a master s in aeronautical engineering from the California Institute of Technology As an older man Donald Putt recalled the prewar mind set regarding pilots who were also engineers Then the philosophy was Don t put an engineering pilot in the cockpit because he tries to figure out why things happen But when the air wars in Europe and Japan escalated the Army Air Forces found itself in need of fast out of the box thinking from American pilot engineers like Putt The Army Air Forces put the old philosophy to the side and Putt s expertise to use In 1944 Putt s career milestone arrived when he was put in charge of modifying a B 29 bomber so that it could deliver an extraordinarily heavy Top Secret payload on Japan This payload was eventually revealed to be the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki After Putt finished his B 29 bomber retrofitting jobs in January 1945 he was sent overseas as director of technical services for the Air Service Command Now here he was in the last week of April 1945 at Völkenrode With

s seven wind tunnels that had allowed the Luftwaffe to study how a swept back wing would behave at the speed at which an aircraft broke the sound barrier This transition place between Mach 0 8 and Mach 1 2 was still unknown to American fliers in 1945 When Putt learned from Völkenrode s director Adolf Busemann that the sound barrier had already been breached by German scientists in these wind tunnels he was amazed Putt knew immediately that the facility had the most superb instruments and test equipment in the world Putt was taking orders from the U S Army European Theater of Operations Directorate of Intelligence Exploitation Division which meant that he had access to stripped down B 17s and B 24s if he needed them a means to transport much of this equipment to the United States which Putt very much wanted to do He wrote to his boss Major General Hugh Knerr deputy commander of U S Strategic Air Force in Europe outlining his proposition and suggesting a second idea Why not also fly scientists like Adolf Busemann out of Germany along with the captured Luftwaffe equipment If we are not too proud to make use of this German born information much benefit can be derived from it and we can advance where Germany left off Putt wrote The German scientists would be of immense value in our jet engine and airplane development program Putt and Knerr both knew that the War Department General Staff was filled with individuals who were wary of Germans in general and totally opposed to making deals of any kind with the very Nazi scientists who had helped to prolong the war But if anyone could get the War Department to bend Knerr and Putt believed they could Major General Knerr sent a memo to the War Department in Washington D C explaining that using Luftwaffe technology

Department that their point of view was best for the United States Around this time the single largest cache of chemical weapons discovered to date was found seventy five miles west of Hannover On April 16 1945 British soldiers from Montgomery s Twenty first Army Group pulled up to the entrance of an abandoned German army proving ground called the Robbers Lair or Raubkammer The place appeared to be abandoned but Waffen SS snipers still were known to be hiding in the woods The soldiers exercised caution as they drove their armored personnel cars through a pair of entrance pillars adorned with Reich eagles and swastikas At first glance the facility looked like a standard military proving ground a place where bombs were exploded and blast measurements recorded Raubkammer was located in a rural forested area called Münster Nord and it extended more than seventy six square miles Large craters in open fields suggested that Luftwaffe airplanes had practiced dropping bombs here There was fancy housing for hundreds of officers There were large administrative buildings and an officers mess hall Then the soldiers came upon the zoo It was a large zoo capable of housing a vast array of animals of all sizes There were cages for mice cats and dogs as well as large pens and stables for farm animals like horses cows and pigs There were also monkey cages But it was the discovery of a massive round wooden cylinder most likely an aerosol chamber that triggered alarm The structure was sixty five feet tall and a hundred feet wide and it was ringed", "chunk_id":

scaffolding pipes and ventilator fans Between the zoo and the large chamber the soldiers were now relatively certain that Raubkammer was no ordinary military proving ground The Robbers Lair bore the hallmarks of a field testing facility that likely involved poison gas An urgent memo was sent to SHAEF asking for a team of chemical warfare experts to be dispatched to Raubkammer Two teams descended one from the British Chemical Defense Experimental Establishment at Porton Down and another from CIOS including Major Tilley and Colonel Tarr At the same time a second unit of British troops working just a few miles to the southwest of the Robbers Lair came upon two bunker clusters totaling almost two hundred structures The area had been artfully concealed from overhead view by dense forest cover The first cluster consisted of several dozen small wooden buildings intermittently spaced between similarly sized concrete blockhouses The soldiers inventoried the contents with caution Inside one set of bunkers they found thousands of bombs stacked in neat piles Each bomb was marked with a single yellow ring painted around the sides of the munition This was the standard marking to denote mustard gas the chemical weapon used by both sides in World War I The British soldiers took inventory and counted one hundred thousand mustard gas shells The second munitions depot was marked as belonging to the Luftwaffe Here 175 bunkers were filled with bombs that were unidentifiable to the Allies Each bomb had been marked with three green rings painted around its sides Montgomery s soldiers sent an urgent memo to SHAEF asking for a team of chemical weapons experts to come investigate the munitions in the forest The scientists from CIOS and Porton Down were nervous about what might be inside the mysteriously marked bombs They decided that it was best to try to locate German scientists in the area who might be familiar with the contents of the bombs before they opened the casings themselves so they began knocking on the doors of the nicer houses in the vicinity of Robbers Lair As they had suspected they would CIOS officers located a number of individuals who confessed to being German army

facility CIOS officers were able to persuade several of the German scientists to assist them in extracting the liquid substance from the center of the bombs By this time chemists with the U S Army s Forty fifth Chemical Laboratory Company had arrived bringing with them a mobile laboratory unit and cages filled with rabbits The original thought was that the substance marked by three green rings was some kind of new Nazi blister agent similar to but perhaps more powerful than mustard gas The chemists were wrong Extractions were made and when tested on the rabbits in the mobile laboratory whatever this liquid substance was killed a warm blooded rabbit five times faster than anything that British or American scientists had ever seen or even heard about before Even more alarming the liquid substance did not have to be inhaled to kill A single drop on the rabbit s skin killed the animal in just a few minutes The millions of gas masks England had distributed to city dwellers during the war would have offered no defense against a chemical weapon as potent as whatever this killing agent was CIOS field agents wrote up a Top Secret report for their superiors at SHAEF A menacing new breed of chemical weapons had been discovered Aerial bombs found to contain a markedly potent and hitherto unknown organophosphorus nerve agent had been developed by the Nazis during the war and stashed in two hundred bunkers in the forest nearby No chemical this lethal to man had ever been developed before CIOS agents did not know it yet but this nerve agent was tabun The three green rings had been painted on the Luftwaffe bombs at Farben s Dyhernfurth facility in Poland Allied chemical weapons experts were suddenly in possession of one of the most dangerous wonder weapons and one of

broadcast calling on all Germans to trust Hitler and to follow him faithfully to the bitter end While Major General Dr Schreiber performed surgeries in his makeshift underground hospital a group of his Nazi Party colleagues had gathered for a party almost directly above where he was located in the halfdestroyed Reich Chancellery building Around noon Hitler s inner circle made its way into a

von Ribbentrop Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz of the navy Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel military commander Alfred Jodl and SS Brigadeführer Hans Krebs The men gathered around an enormous table covered with bottles of champagne and a spread of food Hitler said a few words and promised that the Russians would soon suffer their most crushing defeat yet That morning the Red Army had in fact begun its final assault on Berlin Before dawn German soldiers had retreated from the Seelow Heights fifty five miles from the center of Berlin leaving no front line The Soviet operation to capture Berlin was colossal involving 2 500 000 Red Army soldiers 41 600 guns and mortars 7 500 aircraft and more than 6 000 tanks Rumor panic and chaos enveloped the city at an unstoppable pace The majority of Berliners were now living underground in cellars and air raid shelters appearing aboveground only to scavenge for food Every road out of Berlin leading west was overwhelmed with refugees Casualties

the city Hitler s birthday was also the day Knemeyer and Baumbach would flee Berlin for good In the morning Baumbach had received a cryptic message from Göring who instructed him to go meet with SS Brigadeführer Walter Friedrich Schellenberg the notorious chief of military intelligence and Himmler s number two man The end was near and everyone seemed to know it so what did Schellenberg want from Baumbach now Schellenberg told Baumbach that a warrant had been issued for his arrest and that he was scheduled to be taken into custody during the Führer s birthday party Baumbach should leave the city immediately Schellenberg said Anyone close to Hitler who was arrested this late in the war usually suspected of treason faced a quick execution This was happening all across Berlin Had Hitler found out about the Greenland escape plan Schellenberg whom I had known for years Baumbach later explained was a clever man Baumbach interpreted the tip off to mean only one thing Schellenberg needed Baumbach alive to help facilitate an escape It was known among a core group of SS officers that Himmler had been trying to use concentration camp inmates as bargaining chips for clemency through an intermediary the Swedish Red Cross Baumbach explained Of course Himmler would never be granted clemency Baumbach figured that Schellenberg and Himmler wanted him alive so he could help them escape somewhere overseas Baumbach located Knemeyer and the two pilots agreed to flee Berlin immediately They got in Baumbach s BMW and headed north to the Travemünde airfield two hundred miles north of Berlin on the Baltic Sea The long range aircraft they planned to use for their escape with Speer sat stocked and fueled on the tarmac We were supplied with everything we needed for six months Baumbach

swamped with refugees This part of Germany was one of the only regions still in German control SS guards herded concentration camp prisoners along the roads like cattle in a last ditch effort to keep them out of the liberators hands The roads were almost impassable and it took five hours for Baumbach and Knemeyer to drive a hundred miles When they finally arrived at a large country home referred to as the manor of Dobbin Himmler s SS guards escorted them inside The Reichsführer will receive you now a guard said Knemeyer was told to wait outside Himmler s office while Baumbach was led down a long narrow corridor up a winding staircase and into Himmler s study Behind the desk Himmler sat alone He wore a gray field uniform covered with SS insignia the death s head Totenkopf The sleeves on Himmler s uniform were too long and Baumbach noted a cheap ring on the pinkie finger of his left hand Himmler sized up the general of the bombers from behind his signature pince nez and got to the point I ve sent for you to clear up some Luftwaffe problems Himmler said as recalled by Baumbach after the war The war has entered the final stage and there are some very important decisions I shall have to take Baumbach listened In the very near future I expect to be negotiating with our enemies probably through some neutral country Himmler said I ve heard that all aircraft suitable for this purpose are under your command Baumbach looked out the windows and across the carefully pruned gardens outside considering his response Yes Baumbach told Himmler he had aircraft at his disposal ready at any time Himmler assumed an even friendlier tone Baumbach recalled and asked where he could get hold of Baumbach in the coming days At the Travemünde airfield Baumbach said An aide interrupted to announce the arrival of Field Marshal Keitel Baumbach was dismissed Baumbach made his way back to the sitting room where Knemeyer waited By now Knemeyer had figured out whose fancy manor Himmler was

coffee and sandwiches for them to enjoy before they headed back to Travemünde The reason that the Greenland escape plan was still on hold was because Speer decided to visit Hitler one last time at the Führerbunker compelled by an overwhelming desire to see him once more Driving alone in his private car from Hamburg back into Berlin Speer was fifty five miles outside the city when the road became impassable clogged with what Speer later recalled to be a ten thousand vehicle traffic jam No one was driving into Berlin anymore everyone was getting out All lanes in both directions were being used for travel west Jalopies and limousines trucks and delivery vans motorcycles and even Berlin fire trucks blocked the road Unable to advance Speer turned off the road and drove to a divisional staff headquarters in Kyritz where he learned Soviet forces had encircled Berlin He also learned that there was only one landing strip inside Berlin that remained under German control Gatow airport on the bank of the Havel River Speer decided that he would now fly into Berlin But the nearest aircraft with fuel were parked on the tarmac at the Luftwaffe s Rechlin test site near Mecklenburg Jet fuel was now as rare as hen s teeth and the aircraft was undoubtedly needed for other things Speer insisted that the commandant at Rechlin locate a pilot capable of flying him into Berlin The commandant at Rechlin explained that from Gatow Speer would never be able to get to the Führerbunker if he traveled by car or by foot the Russians controlled the way there In order to get to the Führerbunker under the New Reich Chancellery Speer would need a second smaller aircraft to fly him from Gatow to the Brandenburg Gate He would need a short takeoff and landing aircraft or STOL like the Fieseler Fi 156

perfect All that could be seen were brief inconspicuous flashes from artillery or exploding shells The airfield at Gatow was deserted when they landed with the exception of one of Hitler s generals who was fleeing Berlin Speer and his pilot climbed into a waiting Stork and flew the short distance over Berlin landing amid rubble piles directly in front of the Brandenburg Gate Speer commandeered an army vehicle and had himself driven to the Chancellery or what was left of it American bombers had reduced the building to ruins Speer climbed over a pile of rubble that had once been a ceiling and walked into what used to be a sitting room There Hitler s adjunct Julius Schaub stood drinking brandy with friends Speer called out Schaub appeared stunned by the sight of Speer The companions dispersed Schaub hurried off to inform Hitler that Speer had come to see him Speer waited next to a rubble pile Finally he heard the words he had come to hear The Führer is ready to see you now Speer walked down into the bunker where he was met by Martin Bormann Hitler s Mephistopheles holding court Bormann wanted to know if Speer had come to try to get Hitler to fly with him out of Berlin Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda were also in the bunker plotting the murder suicide of their six children and themselves Hitler s girlfriend Eva Braun invited Speer into her quarters to eat cake and drink Moët Chandon until Hitler was ready to see him At 3 00 a m Speer was told he could come in I was both moved and confused Speer later recalled For his part he Hitler showed no emotion when we confronted one another His words were as cold as his hand So you re leaving Hitler asked Speer Then he said Good Auf Wiedersehen Good bye Speer felt scorned No regards to my family no wishes no thanks no farewell For a moment Speer lost his composure and mumbled something about coming back But Hitler dismissed his minister of war and weapons and Speer left Six days after

tanks from the Seventh Army Third Battalion of the 157th Infantry Regiment pulled up to what at first seemed like an ordinary military post located adjacent to an SS training camp The weather was cold and there was a dusting of snow The post was surrounded by high brick walls an electrified barbedwire fence and a deep ditch Seven fortified guard towers loomed overhead The large iron front gates were closed and locked A few American soldiers scaled the fence cut the locks and opened the gates The soldiers rushed inside A brief exchange of rifle fire ensued Turkish newspaper correspondent Nerin E Gun imprisoned in Dachau for his reports on the Warsaw Ghetto bore witness as some of the SS guards in the watchtowers began shooting at prisoners But the American soldiers Gun said put a quick end to that The SS guards promptly came down the ladders their hands raised high in surrender Other accounts describe brutal acts of vengeance inflicted by prisoners against their former SS guards More gunfire ensued as a second unit the Forty fifth Thunderbird Division approached Dachau from the southwest They discovered fifty open freight cars abandoned just outside the garrison Each train car was filled with emaciated bodies There were several thousand corpses in all Dachau the first Nazi concentration camp had been established by Himmler on March 20 1933 It was originally a place where Communists and other political enemies of National Socialism the ideology of the Nazi Party were sent The name came from the fact that prisoners could be concentrated in a group and held under protective custody following Nazi law Quickly this changed Himmler made concentration camps legally independent administrative units outside the penal code and the ordinary law Dachau had served as a training center for SS concentration camp guards and became a model for how hundreds of other concentration camps were to be set up and run It was also a model for Nazi medical research programs involving doctors who would later become part of Operation Paperclip A young U S Army lieutenant and physician Dr Marcus J Smith arrived at Dachau early on the morning of April 30 1945 and in his

bullet into his head The Russians were just five hundred meters from the Führerbunker s emergency exit door Around the corner under the Reich Chancellery Red Army soldiers took over the underground subway tunnels including the one Major General Dr Walter Schreiber had been using as a hospital Soviet film footage alleged by Schreiber to have been filmed days later as a reenactment shows Schreiber coming out of a cellar with his hands over his head Up north Siegfried Knemeyer was captured by the British Baumbach Knemeyer and Speer never escaped to Greenland after all Shortly after Hitler killed himself Baumbach was ordered by Grand Admiral Dönitz to go to the small town of Eutin forty miles north of the city of Hamburg Hitler had named Dönitz his successor Dönitz set up his new government in the naval barracks at Eutin because it was one of the few places not yet controlled by the Allied forces Siegfried Knemeyer hadn t been invited to join the new inner circle Baumbach let him keep the BMW and Knemeyer fled west On a country road outside Hamburg Knemeyer spotted a vehicle filled with British soldiers on approach He knew that the BMW he was driving would be recognized as belonging to a senior military officer so he pulled off the highway ditched the car and fled on foot British soldiers found him hiding under a bridge and arrested him Knemeyer was taken to a newly liberated concentration camp outside Hamburg where hundreds of other German officers and Nazi Party officials were held He was a prisoner of war now and was accordingly stripped of his valuables and military

3 850 feet along a windy mountain road then called the Adolf Hitler Pass known before and after the war as the Oberjoch Pass Thanks to the resources of the SS the scientists had plenty of fine food and drink There was a sun terrace and as von Braun reflected after the war little for any of them to do but eat drink sunbathe and admire the snow capped Allgäu Alps There I was living royally in a ski hotel on a mountain plateau von Braun later recalled the French below us to the west and the Americans to the south But no one of course suspected we were there On the night of May 1 1945 the scientists were listening to the national radio as it played Bruckner s Symphony No 7 when at 10 26 the music was interrupted by a long military drumroll Our Führer Adolf Hitler fighting to the last breath against Bolshevism fell for Germany this afternoon in his operational headquarters in the Reich Chancellery the radio announcer declared The fight was a fabrication But Hitler s death spurred Wernher von Braun to action Von Braun approached General Dornberger suggesting that they move quickly to make a deal with the Americans I agree with you Wernher Dornberger was overheard saying late that night It s our obligation to put our baby into the right hands At Haus Ingeburg the rocket scientists had been using a network of German and Austrian intelligence sources to keep track of U S Army developments in the area Von Braun and Dornberger knew that a unit of U S soldiers had set up a base at the bottom of the mountain on the Austrian side The two men agreed it was best to send von

best English speaker in the group On the morning of May 2 Magnus von Braun climbed onto a bicycle and began pedaling down the steep mountain pass through the bright alpine sunshine Shortly before lunchtime he came upon an American soldier manning a post along the road It was Private First Class Fred Schneikert the son of a Wisconsin farmer now a soldier with the Forty fourth Infantry Division of the U S Army When Private Schneikert spotted a lone German on a bicycle he ordered the man to drop the bike and raise both hands Magnus von Braun complied In broken English he tried explaining to the American soldier that his brother wanted to make a deal with regard to the V 2 rocket It sounded like he wanted to sell his brother to the Americans Private Schneikert recalled Private Schneikert escorted Magnus von Braun farther down the mountain so he could speak with a superior at the Forty fourth Division s U S Counter Intelligence Corps CIC headquarters located in Reutte just over the border in Austria There CIC contacted SHAEF headquarters in Versailles which contacted a CIOS team The CIOS Black List for rocket research included one thousand names of scientists and engineers slated for interrogation Wernher von Braun was at the top of that list It was May 2 1945 and although Hitler was dead the German Reich had not yet surrendered Allies feared members of a fanatical resistance group the Werewolves were lurking in Bavaria planning a final attack Thinking that the von Braun brother could be part of a trap the Counter Intelligence Corps told Magnus to go tell his brother Wernher to come down and surrender himself Magnus headed back up the mountain with the news At the Haus Ingeburg ski resort Wernher von Braun and General Dornberger had selected a small group to join their deal making team They were Magnus von Braun General Dornberger s chief of staff Herbert Axster the engine specialist Hans Lindenberg and the two engineers who had hidden the V 2 documents inside the Dörnten mine Dieter Huzel and Bernhard Tessmann The men stuffed their personal belongings into three gray passenger vans and headed down the Adolf Hitler Pass Heavy snow gave way

Their welcome was by many accounts warm I did not expect to be kicked in the teeth von Braun told an American reporter years later The V 2 was something we had and you didn t have Naturally you wanted to know all about it The rocket scientists were served fresh eggs coffee and bread with real butter Fancy but not quite as good as what was being provided at Haus Ingeburg The scientists were given private rooms to sleep in with pillows and clean sheets In the morning the press had arrived The capture of the scientists and engineers behind the deadly V 2 was a big story for the international press The group posed for photographs and in the pictures they are all smiles Von Braun boasted about having invented the V 2 He was its founder and guiding spirit von Braun insisted Everyone else was

Farben In addition to being wanted for war crimes the IG Farben board of directors was being investigated for international money laundering schemes A number of high ranking Farben executives were known to have houses in Heidelberg but to date no one had been able to find Hermann Schmitz the company s powerful and secretive CEO Schmitz was also a director of the Deutsche Reichsbank the German central bank and director of the Bank for International Settlements in Geneva He was believed to be the wealthiest banker in all of Germany The reason no one had been able to locate Hermann Schmitz was not because he was hiding out or had fled but because officers were going around Heidelberg looking for Schmitz Castle Despite the vast wealth he had accumulated during the war Hermann Schmitz was actually a miser He lived in a modest if not ugly little house No one would associate the legend of Schmitz with the house he lived in Nuremberg prosecutor Josiah DuBois recalled after the war Working on a tip and as part of a door to door search for suspected war criminals a group of enlisted soldiers knocked on the door of a stucco pillbox of a house overlooking the city where a short man with a red face and a thick neck answered the door Behind him on a placard nailed to the wall it was written that God was the head of this house Schmitz had dark eyes and a goatee and was accompanied by his wife described by soldiers as a dumpy Frau in a crisp gingham dress Frau Schmitz offered the soldiers coffee but Schmitz intervened and told her no Schmitz said he had no interest in answering the questions of the enlisted men whom he considered beneath him If an officer came to speak with him Schmitz said he might have something to say The men conducted a cursory search of the house Schmitz s office was plainly furnished and contained nothing expensive or of any obvious value Searching though his desk however the soldiers learned that Schmitz had friends in high places They found a collection of birthday telegrams sent from Hitler and Göring both of whom addressed Schmitz as Justizrat Doctor of Laws Doctor of Laws Schmitz the soldiers asked mocking him How much money do you have

shelter behind the house where Schmitz had hidden a trunk filled with IG Farben documents There was still not enough evidence to justify arresting Schmitz It would be a few more days until an incredible discovery was made When CIOS team leader Major Tilley learned that Hermann Schmitz had been located he rushed to Heidelberg Tilley and Tarr had been leading the CIOS chemical weapons mission across Germany Ever since they had discovered the tabun nerve agent cache hidden in the forest outside the Robbers Lair they had been looking for Farben executives Now they had the man at the top If anyone could skillfully interrogate Hermann Schmitz Major Tilley could Not only did he speak fluent German but he was deeply conversant on the subject of chemical warfare In Heidelberg Tilley went directly to Schmitz s house He suggested that the two men discuss a few things in Herr Schmitz s private study Schmitz said that would be fine Tilley asked the Farben CEO a series of banal questions all the while tapping on the walls of Schmitz s study Slowly Tilley made his way around the room this way listening for any inconsistencies in the way the walls were built Schmitz grew increasingly uncomfortable Finally he began to cry Tilley had found what he was looking for a secret safe buried in Schmitz s office wall Hermann Schmitz was one of the wealthiest bankers in Germany and one of the most important players in the economics of the Third Reich What secret was contained in his safe Major Tilley instructed Schmitz to open it Inside lying flat was a photo album The

there portrayed in a manner that was not flattering to them Tilley explained The caption underneath the cartoon read The Old Auschwitz As it Was Auschwitz in 1940 At this point Tilley wrote in his CIOS report he was surprised at how highly emotional Schmitz became What Tilley did not yet know was that he was looking at Schmitz s secret photo album that chronicled the building history of Farben s labor concentration camp IG Auschwitz from the very start In May of 1945 almost no one including Major Tilley had any idea what really had happened at Auschwitz that at least 1 1 million people had been exterminated there The facts about the camp had not yet come to light On January 27 1945 Soviet troops liberated Auschwitz and Red Army photographers took film footage and photographs of the atrocities they discovered there But that information had not yet been shared openly with the rest of the world A short report about the extermination camp had appeared in Stalinskoe Znamya the Red Army s newspaper on January 28 1945 Stalin was waiting to release the bulk of information until after Germany surrendered What was clear to Major Tilley was that this photo album was important to Schmitz and that he wanted it to remain hidden Why exactly Major Tilley had no idea As CIOS team leader Major Tilley was on a hunt for Farben chemists who had developed nerve gas Hermann Schmitz while important to Farben in the bigger picture was not a chemist He claimed to have no idea where the Farben chemists had gone The scrapbook was taken into evidence and Tilley moved on in his search Meanwhile in southern Germany in an Austrian border town called Gendorf the man Major Tilley was really looking for Dr Otto Ambros had just been located by U S Army soldiers The soldiers had no idea who Ambros really was When American soldiers rolled into the town of Gendorf about sixty miles southeast of Munich they noticed one man in particular because he stood out like a sore thumb This first

man but a plain chemist Was he German the soldiers asked Yes I am German Ambros replied and made a joke He said that he had so many French friends he could almost be considered a Frenchman In fact his true home was in Ludwigshafen on the border with France He told the soldiers that the reason he was here in southern Bavaria was because he was the director of a large business concern called IG Farben The company had a detergent factory here in Gendorf Ambros explained As a Farben board member he d been asked to oversee production German society might be experiencing a collapse he told the soldiers but everyone needed to stay clean The soldiers asked to be taken to the detergent factory Inside they inspected huge vats of soap and other cleaning products Work at the factory appeared to have been uninterrupted by the war Ambros took the soldiers to his office where someone had taped a rainbow of color spectrum cards to the wall In addition to cleaning products the facility made lacquers Ambros explained The soldiers looked around thanked Ambros for the tour and asked him not to leave town I have no reason to flee said Ambros The soldiers noted how much he smiled Over the next few days more soldiers arrived in Gendorf These filthy grime covered American GIs were delighted when the so called plain chemist offered them free bars of soap Some of the soldiers hadn t washed in more than a month The chemist s generosity did not stop there Otto Ambros gave the soldiers powerful cleaning solvents so that they could wash their mud covered armored tanks Soldiers interviewed Otto Ambros a second time This time Ambros voluntarily offered up character witnesses Working at the Farben factory in Gendorf were skinny men with shaved heads Ambros said they were war refugees and that they could vouch for his kindness as a boss They were from Poland just across the border to the east Ambros told the soldiers that he had personally brought these poor workers here to Gendorf He

refugees were quiet and said nothing to dispute the plain chemist s claims Some of them even helped the American soldiers wash their tanks Otto Ambros was a talkative man He regaled the Americans with stories about the joys of chemistry For example did the soldiers realize what a miracle it was that man could make one hundred wonders from a single chemical compound like ethylene oxide Or how amazing rubber was Ambros told the soldiers that he had been to Ceylon where the rubber plant grows Rubber had so much in common with man Ambros said He was a rubber expert so he knew this to be fact Rubber was civilized Neat and perfect if kept clean Ambros told the soldiers that a rubber factory and a man must always be very clean A single flake of dust or dirt in a vat of liquid rubber could mean a blowout on the autobahn one day IG Farben had synthetic rubber factories and like natural rubber the laboratories and factories must always be kept perfectly clean Ambros talked a lot but he did not mention anything about the rubber factory he had built and managed at Auschwitz The soldiers thanked him for his generosity with the soap and the cleaning agents Before they left they reminded Ambros again that it was important he not leave town He was technically under house arrest When American officials of higher rank finally arrived in Gendorf a few days later they had more specific questions for Ambros Why was part of the Farben detergent factory built underground It would take months for CIOS investigators to learn that the factory here in Gendorf produced chemical weapons during the war and that after Ambros had fled Auschwitz in late January 1945 he and his deputy Jürgen von Klenck had come to Gendorf to destroy evidence hide documents and disguise the factory so that

sent to the Twelfth Army Group Interrogation Center for questioning Several days later a document arrived via teletype from the Office of Strategic Services OSS America s wartime espionage agency and the precursor to the CIA They too had been searching for Dr Blome The War Crimes Office had considerable information about Dr Kurt Blome He was deputy surgeon general of the Third Reich and vice president of the Reich s Physicians League Reichsärztekammer He was believed to have reported directly to Göring and maybe even to Himmler or to both Blome had been named head of Reich cancer research in 1942 Alsos and OSS presumed that this was a cover name for biological weapons work Blome was a dedicated and proud Nazi His book Arzt im Kampf Doctor in Battle compared a doctor s struggle with the struggle of the Third Reich Soldiers officers and doctors weren t all that different each constantly in battle against invading forces and disease Investigators were trying to piece together the labyrinthine medical hierarchy of the Third Reich so as to understand who was in charge of what organization Particularly interesting to the interrogators was the fact that Dr Kurt Blome had been part of a top tier group of Nazi doctors who focused on hygiene This word connoted disease control but was also believed to have been used by the Reich as a euphemism for ethnic cleansing and extermination of Jews Alsos was in possession of correspondence between Blome and Himmler that discussed giving certain groups of sick individuals in this case tubercular Poles special treatment Sonderbehandlung

the way new advances in medical science have been used for atrocities declared Dr Blome What kind of atrocities Blome s investigator wanted to know Blome stated that in his capacity as deputy surgeon general of the Reich he had observe d new scientific studies and experiments which led to later atrocities e g mass sterilization gassing of Jews It was an astonishing admission Until Dr Blome gave up this information so freely no physician in the inner circle had admitted to having known about such wide scale atrocities as mass murder and sterilization programs That Blome was willing to talk was extremely promising news Blome was cooperative and intelligent noted his interrogator Most important he was willing to supply information But the U S investigators excitement did not last long By his next interrogation Dr Kurt Blome had shut down entirely He told his interrogating officer Major E W B Gill that he had only ever been an administrator for the Reich that he did nothing hands on Major

for a doctorate Major Gill felt for certain that Dr Blome was lying But there was nothing he could do except present Blome with information and evidence that Alsos had compiled about him since they had seized Dr Eugen Haagen s apartment six months before Gill told Blome that in a series of interrogations with sixteen Reich doctors also involved in bioweapons related research Alsos officers had learned about many horrific medical crimes Gill explained that Alsos had documents that tied Blome to the crimes For example Alsos had found letters inside the apartment of Dr Eugen Haagen that linked Dr Blome to Dr Haagen and also to an SS colleague named Dr August Hirt These letters made clear that someone was providing Reich doctors with human guinea pigs Who exactly was in charge of this program Gill asked Blome Gill needed a name Blome denied having any idea what Gill was referring to Major Gill told Blome he had a letter that implicated Blome In another letter Gill said Dr Blome had instructed Dr Hirt to conduct research on the effect of mustard gas on living organisms The phrase living organisms was a code name for people wasn t it Gill asked Blome Dr Blome kept stonewalling On

the Mittelwerk tried to blend in Rickhey had taken a job ninety miles from Nordhausen running operations in a salt mine For several weeks no one was looking for him Then Colonel Peter Beasley of the U S Strategic Bombing Survey USSBS arrived in the area on a mission from the War Department Beasley s job was to locate the engineers who had built the fortified underground weapons facilities in the Harz These bombproof bunkers were extraordinary engineering feats and the USSBS was impressed with how so many of them had withstood relentless Allied air bombing campaigns The rocket facility at Nordhausen was of particular importance to USSBS officers and Colonel Beasley set up shop in an abandoned barracks just north of the former Mittelwerk factory in a town called Ilfeld to investigate As circumstance would have it the barracks he chose to occupy was the building in which the former office of Georg Rickhey was located From documents and equipment left behind Colonel Beasley learned that Rickhey possessed extremely valuable information about how the tunnel factory had been built Beasley asked around but none of the locals claimed to know where Rickhey had gone I made daily visits to the jails in the small towns to see if I could locate anyone who might interest me Beasley wrote in a report Eventually he found a man who gave him a tip Georg Rickhey was running operations at a salt mine in the Black Forest the man said Colonel Beasley sent two officers into the field to track Rickhey down Meanwhile Beasley and his team followed another lead In Blankenburg Beasley wrote we found a school building with some miscellaneous papers bearing the Speer Ministry insignia From these documents Beasley learned that Georg Rickhey was the liaison between the Mittelwerk and the

people you have lost the war and so as far as I am concerned you are a man who knows a lot about rockets As an American officer I want my country to have full possession of all your knowledge To my superiors I shall recommend that you be taken to the United States Rickhey embraced this news with open arms He told Beasley that he was a scientist and only wanted to work in pleasant surroundings like the United States He agreed to tell Beasley where some important records had been hidden Rickhey took Colonel Beasley to a cave several miles away There forty two boxes of worksheets engineering tables and blueprints relating to Nordhausen and the V 2 had been stashed This was certainly not Wernher von Braun s documents stash but for the USSBS it was more than they possessed up to this point

been making the daily six mile drive from Schloss Glücksburg to the new government s headquarters The way Speer told the story of his capture he had been shaving when he heard the sounds of heavy footsteps and loud orders being delivered in English Sensing that the end of his freedom had arrived Speer opened the bathroom door a little his face half covered in shaving cream and saw the British soldiers standing there Are you Albert Speer sir a British sergeant asked Yes I am Speer he answered in English Sir you are my prisoner the sergeant said Speer got dressed and packed a bag Outside on the castle lawn a unit of British soldiers with antitank guns had surrounded Schloss Glücksburg Speer was arrested and taken away By the time the British arrested Speer American officials had known for nearly two weeks where he had been hiding out Speer s previous eleven days in the castle had been spent in discussions with American officials with the U S Strategic Bombing Survey USSBS The head of that organization Paul Nitze had managed to be the first person in an international manhunt to track down Albert Speer Nitze considered Speer his most desired intelligence target and on May 12 1945 he boarded his DC 3 from where he was stationed in London and headed to Castle Glücksburg before you could say knife Nitze recalled after the war Because Flensburg was in the British zone of control it was the British who needed to arrest Albert Speer Until then Nitze an American felt at liberty to get as much information from Speer as he could We were looking for absolutely vital information and knowledge and he was literally the only person in Germany who was in a position to provide it Nitze recalled years later Specifically Nitze s organization wanted to know which Allied bombing campaigns had proved the most devastating against Germany during the war America was still at war with the Japanese and the USSBS believed Speer could provide them with information that might help America defeat them Nitze was joined at the castle by two of his colleagues George Ball and John Kenneth Galbraith For the next eleven days the three men questioned Speer From inside an elegant sitting room wallpapered in red and gold brocade the men discussed which Allied bombing campaigns had done the most damage to Nazi Germany and which had had the least effect Of particular interest to Nitze Ball and Galbraith was how the Reich s armaments industry had been able to hold out for so long Speer explained that at his initiative the majority of the Reich s weapons facilities had been moved",

s weapons facilities had been moved underground These weapons complexes had proved to be impervious to even the heaviest bombing campaigns They were engineering triumphs their construction spearheaded largely by Franz Dorsch and Speer s deputy Walter Schieber Speer said Speer s secretary Annemarie Kempf took notes The only interruption was when the cook for the castle summoned everyone for lunch Speer did not mention that his deputy SS Brigadeführer Schieber a chemist also worked with Speer in chemical weapons production that would be opening up a can of war crimes related worms The Americans were not interested in pressing Speer about his involvement in war crimes and Speer was certainly not offering up any incriminating evidence against himself Mostly he boasted about his ministry s feats George Ball recalled that only once maybe twice during the USSBS questioning was Speer asked about the concentration camps I asked him what he knew about the extermination of the Jews He said he couldn t comment because he hadn t known about it but he added that it was a mistake not to have found out Ball told Speer s biographer Gitta Sereny after the war John Kenneth Galbraith was the only one of the three men from the U S Strategic Bombing Survey who had toured a liberated concentration camp before interviewing Speer Galbraith had seen the atrocities at Dachau and Buchenwald He explained One was just beginning to hear rumors about Auschwitz Did Galbraith believe that Speer did not know about the extermination of the Jews No I don t believe he didn t know Galbraith told Sereny Certainly he knew about all the slave laborers I remember him saying to us You should hang Saukel Speer s deputy in charge of slave labor and then a few weeks later Saukel said to us You should hang Speer Nice people weren t they After eleven days of discussions with the Americans the British located and arrested Speer They drove him the six miles to Flensburg where the remaining members of

Flensburg at the Thirty first Civilian Interrogation Camp near Lüneburg a former Wehrmacht sergeant was making a lot of noise The officer in charge of Camp 31 Captain Thomas Selvester found the man s behavior odd Wehrmacht soldiers who were prisoners rarely did anything to draw attention to themselves Captain Selvester sent for the agitated man whom he described as a short ill looking person in civilian clothing with a black eye patch over his left eye Face to face with Captain Selvester the small ugly man ceremoniously pulled off the eye patch revealing a pale unshaven face The man then produced a pair of hornrimmed glasses from his pocket and put them on his face Heinrich Himmler the prisoner announced in a quiet voice With the glasses on Captain Selvester recognized Heinrich Himmler at once Before him stood a man many considered the most powerful man in the Third Reich after Hitler Himmler was Reichsführer SS and chief of the German police commander of the Reserve Army of the Wehrmacht and Reich minister of the interior That face The cleft chin and the sinister smiling eyes Ever since a drawing of Himmler had appeared on the cover of Time magazine on October 11 1943 portraying the Police Chief of Nazi Europe in front of a mountain of corpses he had become synonymous with evil Now that the little round glasses were on Selvester was certain this person was indeed Heinrich Himmler Still Captain Selvester followed protocol and asked for signature verification When Himmler had been captured days before he d presented forged military papers that identified him as a Wehrmacht sergeant named Heinrich Hitzinger The signature matched and Captain Selvester sent for the most senior interrogator in Camp 31 a Captain named Smith Once Smith arrived Selvester ordered Himmler searched again This time British soldiers found two vials of poison hidden in Himmler s clothes It was medicine to treat stomach cramps Himmler said Captain Smith ordered a second physical exam of the prisoner and the camp s doctor Captain Clement Wells spotted a blue tipped object hidden in the back of Himmler s mouth When Dr Wells tried to remove it Himmler jerked his head back and

translating documents for the U S Strategic Bombing Survey The future of war and weapons hung in the balance What would happen to the Nazi scientists Who would be hired and who would be hanged In May 1945 there was no official policy regarding what to do with any of them The question who is a Nazi is often a dark riddle an officer with the Third Army G 5 wrote in a report sent to SHAEF headquarters in May The question what is a Nazi is also not easy to answer Over the next few months critical decisions about what to do with Hitler s former scientists and engineers would be made almost always based on an individual military organization s needs and justified by perceived threats Official policy would follow one version for the public and another for the Joint Chiefs of Staff

German science must be curbed noted Army Air Forces Lieutenant Colonel John O Mara in the CIOS report he authored on the rise of the Luftwaffe But how World War I had ended with a peace treaty that among other restrictions sought to prevent the rise of German Air Power by forbidding powered flight The result explained O Mara was as ludicrous as it was tragic By the time Germany started World War II its air force was the most powerful in the world The mistake could not be repeated and the U S procedural guidelines for an occupied Germany contained in a directive known as JCS Joint Chiefs of Staff 1076 promised to nullify Germany s appetite for war All military research was to cease Scientists were rounded up and taken to detention centers for extensive questioning Across the former Reich SHAEF had set up internment centers where more than fifteen hundred scientists were now being held separate from other German prisoners of war The U S Army had approximately 500 scientists in custody in Garmisch Partenkirchen in the Bavarian Alps including the von Braun and Dornberger group there were 444 persons of interest detained in Heidenheim north of Munich 200 were in Zell am See in Austria 30 kept at Château du Grande Chesnay in France The U S Navy had 200 scientists and engineers at a holding facility in Kochel Germany including many wind tunnel experts The Army Air Forces had 150 Luftwaffe engineers and technicians in Bad Kissingen Germany a majority of whom had been rounded up by Colonel Donald Putt CIOS had 50 scientists including Werner Osenberg in Versailles But there was no clear policy regarding what lay ahead for the scientists engineers and technicians in Allied custody and General Eisenhower sought clarification on the issue From Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in France he sent a cable to the War Department General Staff in Washington D C asking for specific direction about longer term goals Restraint and control of future German

s cable by letting him know his query was considered a matter of urgency Tentative responsibility was assigned to the Captured Personnel and Materiel Branch of the Military Intelligence Service Europe Now that group was in charge of overseeing the scientists basic needs including living quarters food and in some cases pay But it would be another two weeks before the War Department would get back to General Eisenhower with any kind of a statement regarding policy In the meantime a number of events were unfolding in America and in Germany that would affect the decision making of the War Department General Staff In the absence of policy ideas were floated at the Pentagon Some like Major General Kenneth B Wolfe of the Army Air Forces took matters into their own hands General Wolfe was chief of engineering and procurement for Air Technical Service Command at Wright Field and he supported Major General Knerr and Colonel Putt in their quest for capturing Luftwaffe spoils discovered at Völkenrode But General Wolfe envisioned an even bigger science exploitation program and felt strongly that policy needed to be set now Wolfe flew to SHAEF headquarters in France to meet with Eisenhower s deputy General Lucius D Clay to promote his idea General Clay told General Wolfe that he was not opposed to such a program but that now was hardly a good time to broach it Besieged by the countless demands and the chaotic conditions relevant to ending the war and the burdensome complexities of planning for the peace Clay considered such efforts six months premature explains historian Clarence Lasby General Clay told General Wolfe to come back and talk to him in six months Instead Wolfe set out for Nordhausen Germany where his colleague at the Pentagon Colonel Gervais William Trichel was running Special Mission V 2 the Top Secret scientific intelligence operation for the U S Army Ordnance Rocket Branch Inside the abandoned rocket production facility in the underground tunnel complex at Nordhausen Special Mission V 2 was just getting under way When General Wolfe saw the vast numbers of Vweapons left behind he became even more convinced that a U S program to exploit

taken the double purpose of preventing Germany s resurgence as a war power and advancing our own industrial future may be served Clay did not respond he had already told General Wolfe to back off for six months Meanwhile the work that was going on at Nordhausen under the auspices of Special Mission V 2 would greatly influence the future of all the Nazi science programs that would follow The man in charge of Special Mission V 2 twenty eight year old Major Robert B Staver was no stranger to the military significance of the Nazis rockets While preparing for Special Mission V 2 in London the winter before Staver was nearly killed by one He and a British colleague had been working inside an office at 27 Grosvenor Square one afternoon in February when a loud blast knocked both of them to the floor Staver went to the window and saw a big round cloud of smoke where a V 2 had exploded overhead Watching pieces of burning metal rain down from the sky Staver did a few calculations in his head and determined that the V 2 had likely been heading very directly at the building in which he was working when it blew up prematurely A few weeks later Major Staver was asleep in a hotel room near the Marble Arch when he was thrown out of bed by an enormous blast A V 2 had landed in nearby Hyde Park and killed sixty two people The near death experiences made him ever more committed to Special Mission V 2 For six weeks Staver worked twelve hours a day seven days a week studying aerial photographs of Nordhausen supplied to him by the British and otherwise learning everything he could about the Vweapons As soon as the Allied forces liberated the tunnel complex Major Staver would be one of the first intelligence officers inside Now finally here he was at Nordhausen It was May 12 1945 and

would most likely arrive in eighteen days from Berlin U S Army Ordnance believed that the V 2 rocket could help win the Pacific war and for nearly two weeks Staver had been hard at work He had overseen the collection of four hundred tons of rocket parts which had been loaded onto railcars for delivery to the port at Antwerp from where they would be shipped to the United States But with his degree in mechanical engineering from Stanford University Staver knew that the V 2 rocket was a lot more than the sum of its parts Without blueprints or technical drawings it was highly unlikely that American engineers could simply cobble the rocket components together and make the V 2 fly The drawings and blueprints had to have been stashed somewhere near Nordhausen If only Major Staver could find a German scientist to bribe he might be able to find out where the crucial documents were hidden For two weeks now Staver had been traveling through the Harz Mountains touring underground weapons factories searching for a clue or a lead as to who might know more about the V 2 document stash Locals told a wide variety of stories Some spoke of paperwork going up in flames Others talked about truckloads of metal trunks being hidden away in abandoned buildings in beer gardens and in castle walls But this was all hearsay No one could produce a concrete lead and it was not exactly difficult to understand why War crimes investigators were also in Nordhausen asking locals lots of questions And as Staver trolled for rocket scientists American GIs continued to dig mass graves for the thousands of corpses found at Nordhausen Dora slave labor camp The entire town of Nordhausen still smelled of death While driving around on his hunt Staver kept boxes stashed in the back of his army jeep filled with cigarettes alcohol and cans of Spam These valuable black market goods worked well in exchange for information and finally Staver got the lead he was looking for A source told him that there was a V 2 rocket scientist by the name of Karl Otto Fleischer who lived nearby Fleischer had been an engineer inside the Nordhausen tunnels as well as the Wehrmacht s business manager and he

allegiance was to his colleagues so he lied to Staver and said he had no idea what Staver was talking about He pointed the finger at another colleague an engineer and von Braun deputy named Dr Eberhard Rees Ask Rees Fleischer said He was the former chief in charge of the Peenemünde assembly line When interviewed by Staver Dr Eberhard Rees played his own disinformation card using Major Staver s influence to help spring a third colleague from jail Walther Riedel chief of V 2 rocket motor and structural design had been one of the four men honored at the Castle Varlar event the previous December Now Riedel was receiving rough treatment in a jail eighty miles away in Saalfeld He had been mistaken by military intelligence as having been Hitler s biological weapons chief Agents

Nazi Party in 1937 and was a member of five Nazi organizations In a series of interviews with Riedel Major Staver found him to be a strange bird Riedel was obsessed with outer space vehicles which he called passenger rockets In one interview Riedel insisted he d designed these passenger rockets for short trips around the moon and that he d been pursuing space mirrors which would be used for good and possibly evil Riedel said he knew of at least forty rocket scientists besides himself who should be brought to America to complete this groundbreaking work If the Americans didn t act Riedel said

airplane arrived carrying a physicist and ordnance expert named Dr Howard Percy H P Robertson Robertson had been a team leader for Operation Alsos and now he served President Eisenhower as chief of the Scientific Intelligence Advisory Section under SHAEF Dr H P Robertson told Major Staver that he intended to take rocket engineers Fleischer Riedel and Rees to Garmisch Partenkirchen for interrogation where they would be held alongside General Dornberger and Wernher von Braun until the War Department General Staff decided on a policy regarding Nazi scientists Major Staver refused to give up Fleischer Riedel and Rees They were his charges he told Robertson As far as exploiting Nazi science for American use Staver and Robertson saw eye to eye But as far as giving Nazi scientists special privileges the two men were on opposite sides of the aisle The idea outraged Robertson who saw Nazi scientists as amoral opportunists who were hostile to the Allied cause Dr Robertson was a mathematical physicist who had taken a leave of absence from a professorship at Princeton University to help in the war effort He was a jovial gentle man who liked crossword puzzles Ivy League football matches and scotch Robertson spoke German fluently and was respected by Germany s academic elite not just for his scientific accomplishments but because he had studied in 1925 in Göttingen and Munich Before the war Dr Robertson counted many leading German scientists as his friends World War II changed his perspective notably regarding any German scientist who stayed and worked for

Einstein s core view It had been the duty of German scientists to protest Hitler s racist policies beginning in 1933 Anyone who had served the Reich s war machine was not going to be given a free pass by H P Robertson now Determined to keep the Nazi scientists in his custody Staver played the Russian card Robertson may have been anti Nazi but he was also deeply patriotic With access to secret Alsos intelligence information Robertson was well aware that Russian rocket development was a legitimate and growing threat Both men knew that in as little as twelve days the Russians would arrive in Nordhausen If Staver was not able to locate the V 2 documents by then the Russians would eventually find them Major Staver appealed to Dr Robertson arguing that his keeping Fleischer Riedel and Rees was the army s last and best shot at locating the hidden V 2 documents Ultimately Dr Robertson agreed In a final appeal Staver asked Robertson if there was anything Robertson could offer up that might help him in his search for the V 2 stash Some clue or detail that Staver might be overlooking Indeed there was Dr Robertson s fluency in science and his familiarity with German scientific intelligence had thus far made him an extremely effective interrogator of the Nazi scientific and military elite Wehrmacht generals SS officers and scientists were notoriously eager to speak with him Listening to Staver Dr Robertson had an idea He pulled a small writing pad out of his shirt pocket and looked over his notes During an earlier interrogation of a rocket scientist named von Ploetz Robertson had gotten an interesting lead He decided to share it with Major Staver Von Ploetz said that General Dornberger told General Rossman the German army s Weapons Office department chief that documents of V weapon production were hidden in Kaliwerke salt mine at Bleicherode walled into one of the mine shafts read Robertson from his notes Robertson suggested that Staver use that information to his advantage He agreed to leave Fleischer Riedel and Rees with Major Staver while he headed to Garmisch Partenkirchen to interview General Dornberger and Wernher von Braun At Garmisch Partenkirchen

Dornberger and their group had been here since being transferred from CIC headquarters in Reutte Isolated in the Alps the two scientists had been frustrating their interrogators stonewalling and withholding information Dr Robertson came to see if he could get any better information out of the scientists Most of the rocket team was here including the two men who had stashed the V 2 documents that Staver was now searching for Dieter Huzel and Bernhard Tessmann Neither Huzel nor Tessmann had shared with von Braun or Dornberger the fact that they d told Karl Otto Fleischer the location of the stash in the Dörnten mine Dornberger and von Braun were under the assumption that they held all the bargaining chips The intelligence officer Walter Jessel had sensed something was amiss with Dornberger and von Braun that the two rocket scientists were playing games Control was exercised by Dornberger in the course of the CIOS investigations Jessel noted in one report Dornberger s first instructions to other scientists probably under the impression of immediate transfer of the whole group to the United States were to cooperate fully with the investigators Jessel explained But as the days wore on and no deal was offered by the Allies Jessel watched Dornberger become intractable Sometime later he Dornberger gave the word to the others to hold back on information and say as little

intellect Rudolph demanded more of himself than a suntan he later said There were already rumors that the Americans would take us to the U S A So I decided I needed to learn English Arthur Rudolph s interrogator saw Rudolph differently than he saw himself In military intelligence documents Rudolph was described as 100 Nazi a dangerous type There was a decision to be made whether to use Rudolph as an intelligence source or to intern him for denazification and investigation into possible war crimes Denazification was an Allied strategy to democratize and demilitarize postwar Germany and Austria through tribunals in local civilian courts Spruchkammern that were set up to determine individual defendants standings Each German who was tried was judged to belong in one of five categories or classes 1 major offenders 2 party activists militarists and profiteers 3 individuals who were less incriminated 4 Nazi Party followers 5 those who were exonerated Rudolph s interrogator did not believe a committed Nazi like Arthur Rudolph would make a viable intelligence source and he wrote suggest internment Rudolph hoped he would be hired by the Americans He located a murder mystery in the

tip from Dr Robertson Staver drove to meet with his new source Karl Otto Fleischer in a parking lot This time Staver had Walther Riedel with him In the parking lot Staver demonstratively pulled a notebook from his breast pocket just as Dr Robertson had done with him Staver read aloud a narrative he d composed part truth and part fiction Von Braun Ernst Steinhoff and all the others who fled to

Staver would meet the two men the following morning in the same parking lot at exactly 11 00 When Staver arrived at the rendezvous point the next day he was disheartened to find Riedel waiting for him but not Fleischer Even odder Riedel said he had a message from Fleischer to pass along Fleischer was waiting for Major Staver in Haynrode a nearby village with some very important news Staver needed to travel to Haynrode find a boardinghouse called the Inn of the Three Lime Trees and ask for the concierge Was this some kind of a trap or just another wild goose chase Staver and Walther Riedel drove together to the Inn of the Three Lime Trees There they met up with the innkeeper who produced a message from Fleischer Staver and Riedel were to walk through town pass down a long alleyway and head to the edge of the village where they were to go to the home of a local priest Staver and Riedel followed the trail finally arriving at the priest s house There in flawless English the priest told Major Staver that Fleischer would see him soon Fleischer emerged at the top of the stairs came down and asked Staver to follow him outside so the two men could talk privately under an apple tree There in almost inaudible somewhat apologetic tones Fleischer admitted he had not been completely frank about the whereabouts of the V 2 document stash Staver explained In fact he knew where they were hidden and believed he was the only one in Nordhausen who did But there was a problem Fleischer said He described to Staver how the caretaker at the mine had dynamited a wall of rubble over the entrance so no one could find them This man was an ardent Nazi and would never turn over the documents to an American officer like Major Staver Fleischer said he d take Dr Rees with him to do the job

retrieve the documents hidden in the mine The stash was enormous the crates weighing more than fourteen tons Only now there was a new hurdle to overcome British soldiers were set to arrive in Nordhausen on May 27 to oversee the transition to Red Army rule This meant that Major Staver had to get the documents out fast The original agreement between the British and the Americans was that the two Allies would share with one another everything they learned about the V weapons If the British found out Staver was planning to secretly ship one hundred V 2 rockets back to the United States they would likely consider it a double cross Major Staver needed to get to Paris It was the only way he could obtain access to the ten ton trucks necessary for moving such a large cache in such a short period of time Staver assigned a colleague to oversee the Dörnten mine operation while he attempted to hitch a ride to Paris in a P 47 Thunderbolt The pilot said it was impossible that the Thunderbolt was a single seat fighter Staver said that his mission was urgent and offered to ride in the tiny space behind the pilot s seat The pilot finally agreed Avoiding terrible weather higher up the men flew all the way to Paris at tree top level and arrived safely at Orly Field Staver found a ride down the Champs Élysées in a U S Army jeep At Ordnance Headquarters he found the exact man he was

Their superior knowledge could be used to help win the war in Japan You write the cable and I ll sign it Staver remembered Colonel Holmes having said In Paris Staver sat down and wrote a cable that would have a huge impact on the future of the Nazi scientist program Have in custody over 400 top research development personnel of Peenemünde Developed V 2 Staver wrote The thinking of the scientific directors of this group is 25 years ahead of U S Later version of this rocket should permit launching from Europe to U S Given the enormity of this idea in 1945 that a rocket could one day actually fly from one continent to another Staver pushed Immediate action recommended to prevent loss of whole or part of this group to other interested parties Urgently request reply as early as possible The cable was sent to Colonel Trichel s office at the Pentagon and Major Staver returned to Nordhausen The documents were loaded up and driven to Paris under armed guard From there they were shipped to the Foreign Documents Evaluation Center at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland Special Mission V 2 was declared a success The U S Army Ordnance Rocket Branch now had one hundred rockets and fourteen tons of technical documents in its possession But Staver did not view Special Mission V 2 as entirely complete He still had his sights set on the rocket scientists themselves With the arrival of the Soviets into Nordhausen less than forty eight hours away Staver got the approval he d been waiting for from SHAEF headquarters He went to Garmisch Partenkirchen picked up von Braun and returned

and their families were given an offer They could be transported out of what would soon become the Russian zone or they could stay Arthur Rudolph s wife was in Stepferhausen eighty five miles south of Nordhausen when a U S soldier arrived A black GI drove into town in a truck looking for me remembered Martha Rudolph He had a list of names and mine was on it He told me that if I wanted to leave to get ready He would be back in 30 minutes to pick me up My friends all said Go go the Russians are coming Why would you want to stay here So I packed up what I could and left on the truck when the GI came back The Rudolphs daughter Marianne accompanied her to the train station The scene at the station was surreal recalling the horrific transport of prisoners during the war but with the roles reversed fate and outcome turned upside down Over one thousand Germans scientists and their families stood on the platforms waiting to fit themselves into boxcars and passenger cars The train s engine had yet to be attached and there was no announcement explaining the delay Tension escalated but the crowd remained calm until a mob of displaced persons flooded the station Word had leaked out that German scientists were being evacuated out of Nordhausen in advance of the Red Army s arrival Suddenly many other locals wanted out of the Harz too The Red Army had a terrible reputation There were stories of entire units arriving in towns drunk and seeking revenge At the railroad station U S soldiers were called to the scene Using the threat of weapons they prevented any displaced person who was not a scientist or an engineer from boarding the boxcars and passenger cars At the eleventh hour Major Staver and Dr Porter learned of one last potential disaster that needed to be dealt with

contained critical information about the V 2 rocket that would compromise the U S Army if it fell into Russian hands In a last ditch effort to find Dornberger s secret stash Staver and Porter set out on a final mission The men drove sixty miles to the headquarters of the 332nd Engineering Regiment at Kassel where they borrowed shovels pickaxes three men and a mine detector Back in a large field in Bad Sachsa they searched the ground as if looking for a buried mine Finally they located Dornberger s metal lined cases which contained 250 pounds of drawings and documents The stash was loaded onto a truck and driven to an army facility in the American zone On their way out of the Harz Staver and Porter passed by Nordhausen to have one last look I wanted to blow up the whole factory at Nordhausen before we pulled out but I couldn t swing it legally I was afraid at the time to do the job unofficially and have regretted it ever since Porter recalled He was referring to the European Advisory

Witzenhausen forty miles from Nordhausen in the American zone There they were set up in a two story schoolhouse and paid to get to work on future rocket plans while Army Ordnance worked on a plan to bring them to the United States to the Fort Bliss Army Base in Texas The Americans had been obsessed with the V weapons during the war Now they had the science and the scientists In Washington D C officials with the War Department General Staff remained undecided on a policy regarding what to do with Nazi scientists General Eisenhower s questions about long term plans had not yet been answered and Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson was asked to weigh in Major Staver s cable from Paris regarding the four hundred rocket scientists in custody drew attention to the issue In America five Nazi scientists had already been secreted into the United States for classified weapons work Just a few days after the German surrender the director of naval intelligence successfully lobbied the War Department General Staff to circumvent State Department regulations so that a Nazi guided missile expert named Dr Herbert Wagner and four of his assistants could begin working on technology meant to help end the war with Japan The War Department gave approval and in mid May Dr Wagner and his team were flown from Germany to a small airstrip outside Washington D C inside a military aircraft with the windows blackened to keep anyone from seeing who was inside During the war Dr Herbert Wagner had been chief missile design engineer at Henschel Aircraft He was the man behind the first guided missile used in combat by the Reich the Hs 293 This remotecontrol bomb was the nemesis of the U S Navy and the British Royal Navy and had sunk several Allied ships during the war Not only did the U S

importance of having Wagner s expertise in the fight against Japan was illuminated by a dramatic event unfolding in Portsmouth New Hampshire just as he and his team arrived On May 15 1945 a Nazi submarine identified in a New York Times headline as the Japan bound U 234 surrendered itself to the USS Sutton in the waters five hundred miles off Cape Race Newfoundland Inside the submarine which was en route to Japan was a cache of Nazi wonder weapons said to contain what few aviation secrets may be left as well as other war weapon plans and pieces of equipment One of the wonder weapons on board was Dr Wagner s Hs 293 glider bomb meant for use against the U S Navy in the Pacific Additionally there were drawings and plans for the V 1 flying bomb and the V 2 rocket experimental equipment for stealth technology on submarines an entire Me 262 fighter aircraft and ten lead lined canisters containing 1 200 pounds of uranium oxide a basic material used in making an atomic bomb The specifics of the weapons cache were not made public but the notion that the Nazis had sold the secrets of some of their most prized wonder weapons to their Axis partner Japan was alarming The scenario was made even more forbidding by the fact that also on board the U 234 was a top Reich scientist whose job it was to teach Japanese scientists how to copy and manufacture these Nazi wonder weapons for themselves The scientist in the submarine was Dr Heinz Schlicke director of Naval Test Fields at Kiel To the public he was only identified as a German technician In fact Dr Schlicke was one of the most qualified Nazi scientists in the field of electronic warfare His areas of expertise included radiolocation techniques camouflage jamming and counterjamming remote control and infrared The navy took Dr Schlicke prisoner of war and brought him to the Army Intelligence Center at Fort Meade in Maryland As for Dr Wagner the navy felt it needed to keep him happy so that his work would continue to

navy found what it was looking for in Hempstead House a great stone castle on Sands Point on the North Shore of Long Island that was formerly the home of Daniel and Florence Guggenheim The 160 acre estate had been donated by the Guggenheims to the navy for use as a training center With its three stories forty rooms and sweeping view of the sea the navy decided it was an ideal location Hempstead House was given the code name the Special Devices Center and Dr Wagner and his assistants got to work There were more problems afloat in Washington this time coming from the FBI If Nazi scientists were going to work for the U S military the Department of Justice said it needed to perform background checks J Edgar Hoover s FBI looked into Dr Wagner s past based on information collected by army intelligence in Europe and learned that Dr Wagner had once belonged to the German SS the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party run by Himmler This meant that Wagner was an ardent Nazi If he had stayed in Germany as a former SS member and per the laws of the occupying forces he would have been arrested and subject to a denazification trial But the FBI was made aware of how badly the navy needed Wagner and they labeled him an opportunist who is interested only in science The FBI s bigger concern read an intelligence report was how much Dr Wagner had been drinking lately The FBI did not consider Wagner to be a drunkard but blamed his nearnightly intoxication on the recent death of his wife The scientist in the submarine Dr Heinz Schlicke became a prisoner at Fort Meade where it did not take long for the U S Navy to learn how eminently qualified he was Soon Schlicke was giving classified lectures on technology he had developed during the war The first was called A General Review

given a contract to work in the United States according to the State Department The saga of the U 234 and its passenger made one thing clear If the War Department was going to start hiring German scientists on a regular basis it needed to create a committee to deal with the intricacies of each specific case Finally on May 28 1945 Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson weighed in on the classified subject of hiring Nazi scientists for U S military research Patterson wrote to the chief of staff to the president Admiral William D Leahy I strongly favor doing everything possible to utilize fully in the prosecution of the war against Japan all information that can be obtained from Germany or any other source Patterson wrote He also expressed concern These men are enemies and it must be assumed they are capable of sabotaging our war effort Bringing them to this country raises delicate questions including the strong resentment of the American public who might misunderstand the purpose of bringing them here and the treatment accorded them Patterson believed that the way to avoid foreseeable problems with the State Department which handled visa approvals was to involve the State Department in decision making now Until a new committee was formed to deal specifically with Nazi scientists Patterson suggested that the State War Navy Coordinating Committee SWNCC be in charge Patterson s letter to the president s chief of staff which was not shared with President Truman prompted a meeting at the Pentagon by the War Department General Staff The group agreed on a temporary policy Contracts would be given to a limited number of German scientists provided they were not known or alleged war criminals The scientists were to be placed in protective military custody in the United States and they were to be returned to Germany as quickly as possible after their classified weapons work was complete A cable was sent to General Eisenhower at SHAEF headquarters in Versailles

heard rumors about cutting edge research being developed by the Reich s aviation doctors The Luftwaffe was highly secretive about this research and its aviation doctors did not regularly publish their work in medical journals When they did usually in a Nazi Party sponsored journal like Aviation Medicine Luftfahrtmedizin the U S Army Air Forces would circumvent copyright law translate the work into English and republish it for their own flight surgeons to study Areas in which the Nazis were known to be breaking new ground were air sea rescue programs high altitude studies and decompression sickness studies In other words Nazi doctors were supposedly leading the world s research in how pilots performed in extreme cold extreme altitude and at extreme speeds At war s end there were two American military officers who were particularly interested in capturing the secrets of Nazi sponsored aviation research They were Major General Malcolm Grow surgeon general of the U S Strategic Air Forces in Europe and Lieutenant Colonel Harry Armstrong chief surgeon of the Eighth Air Force Both men were physicians flight surgeons and aviation medicine pioneers Before the war Grow and Armstrong had cofounded the aviation medicine laboratory at Wright Field where together they initiated many of the major medical advances that had kept U S airmen alive during the air war At Wright Field Armstrong perfected a pilot friendly oxygen mask and conducted groundbreaking studies in pilot physiology associated with high altitude flight Grow developed the original flier s flak vest a twenty two pound armored jacket that could protect airmen against antiaircraft fire Now with the war over Grow and Armstrong saw unprecedented opportunity in seizing everything the Nazis had been working on in aviation research so as to incorporate that knowledge into U S Army Air Force s understanding According to an interview with Armstrong decades later a plan was hatched during a meeting between himself and General Grow at the U S Strategic Air Forces in Europe headquarters in Saint Germain France The two men knew that many of the Luftwaffe s medical research institutions had been located in Berlin and the plan was for Colonel Armstrong to go there and track down as many Luftwaffe doctors as he could find with the goal of enticing them to come to work for the U S Army Air Forces As

to a city divided into U S and Russian zones General Grow would return to Army Air Forces headquarters in Washington D C where he would lobby superiors to authorize and pay for a new research laboratory exploiting what the Nazi doctors had been working on during the war With the plan set in motion Armstrong set out for Berlin The search proved difficult at first It appeared as if every Luftwaffe doctor had fled Berlin Armstrong had a list of 115 individuals he hoped to find At the top of that list was one of the Reich s most important aviation doctors a German physiologist named Dr Hubertus Strughold Armstrong had a past personal connection with Dr Strughold The roots of that story go back to about 1934 Armstrong explained in a U S Air Force oral history interview after the war when both men were attending the annual convention of the Aero Medical Association in Washington D C The two men had much in common and became quite good friends Both were pioneers in pilot physiology and had conducted groundbreaking highaltitude experiments on themselves We had some common bonds in the sense that he and I were almost exactly the same age he and I were both publishing a book on aviation medicine that particular year and he held exactly the same assignment in Germany that I held in the United States Armstrong explained The two physicians met a second time in 1937 at an international medical conference at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City This was before the outbreak of war Nazi Germany was not yet seen as an international pariah and Dr Strughold represented

Strughold did In Berlin Harry Armstrong became determined to find him One of the first places Armstrong visited was Strughold s former office at the Aviation Medical Research Institute located in the fancy Berlin suburb of Charlottenburg He was looking for leads But the once grand German military medical academy with its formerly manicured lawns and groomed parks had been bombed and was abandoned Strughold s office was empty Armstrong continued his journey across Berlin visiting universities that Strughold was known to be affiliated with Every doctor or professor he interviewed gave a similar answer They claimed to have no idea where Dr Strughold and his large staff of Luftwaffe doctors had gone At the University of Berlin Armstrong finally caught a break when he came across a respiratory specialist named Ulrich Luft teaching a physiology class to a small group of students inside a wrecked classroom Luft was unusual looking with a shock of red hair He was tall polite and spoke perfect English which he had learned from his Scottish mother Ulrich Luft told Harry Armstrong that the Russians had taken everything from his university laboratory including the faucets and sinks and that he Luft was earning money in a local clinic treating war refugees suffering from typhoid fever Armstrong saw opportunity in Luft s predicament and confided in him explaining that he was trying to locate German aviation doctors in order to hire them for U S Army sponsored research Armstrong said that in particular he was trying to find one man Dr Hubertus Strughold Anyone who could help him would be paid Dr Luft told Armstrong that Strughold had been his former boss According to Luft Strughold had dismissed his entire staff at the Aviation Medical Research Institute in the last month of the war Luft told Armstrong that Strughold and several of his closest colleagues had gone to the University of Göttingen They were still there now working inside a research lab under British control Armstrong thanked Luft and headed to Göttingen to find Strughold Whatever the British were paying him Armstrong figured he would be able to lure Strughold away because of their strong personal connection There was also a great deal of money to be made pending the authorization of the new research laboratory Armstrong and Grow s plan meant hiring more than fifty Luftwaffe doctors There was a lot of work to

plan meant hiring more than fifty Luftwaffe doctors There was a lot of work to be had not just for Strughold but for many of his colleagues as well A great drama was now set in motion owing to the fact that there was a second army officer also looking for Dr Hubertus Strughold a medical war crimes investigator and physician named Major Leopold Alexander Dr Strughold s name had been placed on an army intelligence list of suspected war criminals with the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects or CROWCASS Major Alexander was on a mission to locate him It is not known if Armstrong was aware of the allegations against Strughold and chose to ignore them or if he was in the dark as to Strughold s having been placed on the CROWCASS list But as Armstrong forged ahead with plans to hire Dr Strughold and to make him a partner in the U S Army Air Forces laboratory he did so in direct violation of the policy that had just been set by the War Department German scientists could be hired for U S military contract work provided they were not known or alleged war criminals The CROWCASS allegations against Dr Strughold were serious They included capital war crimes The CROWCASS list came out of the immediate aftermath of the German surrender when public pressure to prosecute Nazis accused of war crimes had reached fever pitch On May 7 1945 Life magazine published a story on the liberation of Buchenwald Bergen Belsen and other death camps complete with graphic photographs This was some of the first documentary evidence presented to the public When confronted by these ghastly images people all over the world expressed their outrage at the scale of atrocity that had been committed by the Nazis Death camps slave labor camps the systematic extermination of entire groups of people this defied the rules of war The idea of having a war crimes trial appealed to the general public as a means of holding individual Nazis accountable for the wickedness of their crimes The group responsible for investigating war crimes was the United Nations War Crimes Commission UNWCC located in London and founded by the Allies in 1942 it was originally called the United Nations Commission for the Investigation of War Crimes The War Crimes Commission was not responsible for hunting down the criminals that job was delegated to SHAEF The War Crimes Commission had three

gave advice on legal points The commission and its committees worked in concert with CROWCASS also located in Paris which was responsible for gathering and maintaining information about suspected war criminals After the fighting stopped SHAEF sent war crimes investigators into the field to locate German doctors with the purpose of interrogating them One of these investigators was Major Leopold Alexander a Boston based psychiatrist and neurologist and a physician with the U S Army Dr Alexander had been tending to wounded war veterans at a military hospital in England when he learned about his new assignment just two weeks after the end of the war With this undertaking his whole life would change as would his understanding of what it meant to be a doctor and what it meant to be an American Dr Alexander would unwittingly become one of the most important figures in the Nuremberg doctors trial And he would inadvertently become a central player in one of the most dramatic events in the history of Operation Paperclip That would take another seven years For now at war s end Dr Alexander accepted his orders from SHAEF boarded a military transport airplane in England and headed for Germany to begin war crimes investigative work His first stop was the Dachau concentration camp Dr Alexander did not yet know that it was inside Dachau in the secret barracks called Experimental Cell Block Five that Luftwaffe doctors had conducted some of the most barbaric and criminal medical experiments of the war On May 23 1945 Dr Alexander 39 was seated inside an American military transport airplane flying into Munich when approximately fifteen miles north of the airport his plane circled low and he saw the liberated Dachau concentration camp for the first time Surviving inmates were waving and cheering at the plane and you could see that two American field hospitals were set up on the camp grounds Alexander wrote in his journal late at night American aircraft brought fresh corned beef potato salad and real coffee by the ton to the newly liberated prisoners many of whom were still too weak to leave the camp The airplanes also brought doctors and nurses with the American Red

place With him Dr Alexander carried SHAEF instructions that granted him full powers to investigate everything of interest and also gave him the authority to remove documents equipment or personnel as deemed necessary Fate and circumstance had prepared him for the job Like Samuel Goudsmit the scientific director of Operation Alsos Dr Alexander had a unique background that qualified him to investigate German doctors and had also made things personal A Jew he had once been a rising star among Germany s medical elite In 1933 Germany s race laws forbade the twenty eight year old physician from practicing medicine any longer Devastated he left the country and wound up in America Now thirteen years later he was back on German soil His former existence here seemed like a lifetime ago From as far back as he could remember Leopold Alexander longed to be a doctor like his father Gustav One of the strongest unconscious motives for becoming a physician was the strong bond of identification with my father he once said explaining the pull toward medicine Gustav Alexander was an ear nose and throat doctor in turn of the century Vienna a distinguished scholar who published more than eighty scientific papers before Leopold was born His mother Gisela was the first woman awarded a PhD in philosophy from the University of Vienna the oldest university in the German speaking world From a young age Leopold led a charmed life The Alexanders were sophisticated wealthy professionals who lived in intellectual bohemian splendor in a huge house with live peacocks on the lawns Sigmund Freud was a frequent guest as was the composer Gustav Mahler By the time Leopold was fifteen he was allowed to accompany his father on weekend hospital rounds The father son bond grew deep On weekends they would walk through Vienna s parks or museums always engaged in lively conversation about history anthropology and medicine as Dr Alexander later recalled In 1929 Leopold Alexander graduated from the University of Vienna Medical School and became a doctor specializing in the evolution and pathology of the brain For almost every aspiring physician in Europe at the time the goal was to study

For almost every aspiring physician in Europe at the time the goal was to study medicine in Germany and in 1932 Dr Alexander was invited to enroll at the prestigious Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research in Berlin There he first rubbed elbows with Germany s leading medical doctors including Karl Kleist the distinguished professor of brain pathology who would become his mentor Alexander focused his studies on brain disorders and began fieldwork on patients with schizophrenia Life was full of promise Tragedy struck in two cruel blows In 1932 Gustav Alexander was killed by a former mental patient murdered in cold blood on the streets of Vienna by a man who ten years earlier had been hospitalized and declared insane The second tragedy occurred in January of 1933 when Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany National Socialism was on the rise For every Jew in Germany life was about to change inexorably Fortune blessed Dr Alexander On January 20 1933 just days before Hitler took power the ambitious physician prepared to decamp to rural China to study mental illness I have accepted an invitation to go for half a year to Beijing Union Medical College in Beijing China as an honorary lecturer in neurology and psychiatry Dr Alexander wrote to his professors at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute promising to return to Germany by October 1 1933 It was a promise he was never to fulfill Within two months of Hitler s taking power the Nazis initiated a nationwide boycott of Jewish doctors lawyers and business professionals This was followed in April 1933 by the Reich s Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service It was now illegal for non Aryans to work as civil servants a ban that included every university teaching position throughout Germany In Frankfurt where Dr Alexander had lived sixty nine Jewish professors were fired The news of Germany s radical transformation reached Dr Alexander in China The Alexander family lawyer Maximilian Friedmann wrote him a letter warning against return The prospects in Germany are most unfavorable Friedmann said An uncle Robert Alexander was even more candid about what was happening in Nazi Germany when he wrote to Dr Alexander to say that the nation had succumbed to the swastika A Jewish colleague and friend a neurologist named Arnold Merzbach also penned a letter to Dr Alexander in despair telling him that

ended In China Dr Alexander was in charge of the neurological departments of several field hospitals where he tended to soldiers with head injuries received on the battlefield Ignoring the Nazi mandate that now barred Jews from working as doctors or professors he wrote a letter to Professor Kleist his mentor in Germany saying how much he looked forward to returning home Kleist wrote back to say that his return to Germany was totally impossible You as a Jew since you have not served as a soldier in the First World War can not be state employed In closing Kleist wrote Have no false hopes The letter may have saved Dr Alexander s life Untethered in China Alexander was now a nomad a man without a home to return to With remarkable ambition and fortitude he pressed on As his father had done before him he wrote and published scientific papers his were on mental illness which made him a viable candidate for a fellowship in America Fortune again favored him when in the fall of 1933 he learned that he had been awarded a position at a state mental hospital in Worcester Massachusetts fifty miles outside Boston Dr Alexander boarded an American steamship called President Jackson and set sail for America by way of Japan Out at sea a strange event occurred It happened in the middle of the long journey when his ship was more than a thousand miles from land A series of violent storms struck sending passengers inside for days until finally the weather cleared On the first clear day Dr Alexander ventured outside to play shuffleboard Gazing out across the wide sea he spotted an enormous single wave traveling with great speed and force bearing down on his tiny steamship There was no escape from what he quickly recognized as a tidal wave Before Dr Alexander could run back

behind it nothing but a steep descent The ship began to free fall its nose plunged deep into the water The impact was harsh water splashed to all sides and things fell to this side and that in the kitchen and common rooms The ship regained its balance almost effortlessly and steamed on The whole thing happened so unbelievably fast Alexander wrote When it was over I said to myself now I understand the meaning of the saying the ocean opens up before you and swallows you whole It did not take long for Dr Alexander to thrive in America He was a supremely hard worker On average he slept five hours a night Working as a doctor at a New England mental institution was endlessly fascinating to him He once told a reporter that what interested him most was determining what made men tick Only a few months after his arrival in New England he was promoted to a fulltime position in the neuropsychiatric ward at Boston State Hospital While performing hospital rounds in 1934 he met a social worker named Phyllis Harrington They fell in love and married By 1938 they had two children a boy and a girl A prolific writer Dr Alexander published fifty scientific papers By the end of the decade he d been hired to teach at Harvard Medical School He was a U S citizen now Journalists wrote newspaper articles about the doctor from Vienna citing his outstanding accomplishments in the field of mental illness He had a new home he had been accepted as one of Boston s medical elite In December 1941 America went to war Dr Alexander joined the fight and was sent to the Sixtyfifth General Hospital in Fort Bragg North Carolina and then to an army hospital in England For the duration of the war Dr Alexander helped wounded soldiers recover from shell shock He also collected data on flight fatigue After the Germans surrendered he expected to be sent home Instead he received his unprecedented order from SHAEF He was to go to Germany and investigate allegations of Nazi medical crimes In

to Dachau did not produce any significant leads despite rumors that barbaric medical experiments had gone on there On June 5 1945 he traveled the twelve miles to Munich to visit the Luftwaffe s Institute for Aviation Medicine This research facility was headed by a radiologist named Georg August Weltz still working despite Germany s collapse On paper Weltz was a man of repute He was gentle looking fifty six years old with a shock of white hair and a wrinkled sun tanned face In their first interview Weltz told Alexander he had worked as a military doctor his entire life beginning as a Balloon Corps physician in World War I Dr Alexander had a SHAEF dossier on Weltz that revealed Weltz had joined the Nazi Party in 1937 after which he had moved quickly up the Reich s medical chain of command By 1941 he reported directly to the air marshal of the Luftwaffe Erhard Milch who reported to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring By war s end there were only a few men with more medical authority on Luftwaffe issues than Georg August Weltz one of them being Dr Hubertus Strughold In their first interview Weltz told Dr Alexander that it had been his job to conduct a variety of research on methods of saving Luftwaffe pilots lives Weltz cited what happened to Luftwaffe pilots in 1940 during the Battle of Britain Many had been shot down over the English Channel by the British Royal Air Force and had bailed out of their crashing airplanes and initially survived The fatalities Weltz explained often occurred hours later usually from hypothermia The bodies of many Luftwaffe pilots had been rescued from the icy waters of the channel just minutes after they had frozen to death The Luftwaffe wanted to know if through medical research doctors could learn how to unfreeze a man to bring him back to life Dr Weltz told Dr Alexander that he and his team of researchers had performed groundbreaking research in this area Weltz declared that they had in fact made a startling and useful discovery The results said Weltz were simply astounding Dr Alexander asked What kind of results Weltz hesitated to provide details but promised that the U S Army would be very interested in the

Foundation Dr Alexander explained that he had no authority with any private sector foundation and that before anything else he needed Weltz to tell him about this so called astounding discovery Weltz said he and his team had solved an age old riddle Can a man who has frozen to death be brought back to life The answer Weltz confided was yes He had proof He and his team had solved this medical conundrum through a radical rewarming technique they d invented Alexander asked Weltz to be more specific Weltz said success was dependent upon precise body temperature and duration of rewarming in direct proportion to a man s weight He was not at liberty to provide data just yet but the method his team had developed was so effective that the Luftwaffe air sea rescue service had employed this very technique during the war The experiments said Weltz had been conducted on large animals Cows horses and adult pigs Dr Alexander was in Germany to investigate Nazi medical war crimes He got straight to the point and asked Weltz whether human beings had ever been used in these Luftwaffe experiments Weltz explicitly stated that no such human experiments had been done by him and that he did not know of any such work having been done Dr Alexander wrote in his classified report But the way in which Weltz responded made Dr Alexander deeply suspicious of him Dr Alexander was in a conundrum Should he have Weltz arrested Or was it best to try to learn more I still felt it wiser for the purposes of this investigation not to resort to coercive measures such as an arrest Alexander explained He asked Weltz to take him to the laboratory where these experiments on large animals were performed Weltz claimed that because of heavy bomb damage in Munich the Luftwaffe s test facility for its rewarming techniques had been moved out to a dairy farm in the rural village of Weihenstephan Alexander and Weltz drove there together in an army jeep An inspection of the farm revealed a stateof the

agricultural station Dr Alexander insisted on seeing the Freising facility and the two men got back into the army jeep and drove on In Freising Alexander was shown yet another impressive medical research facility also hidden in a barn complete with a library and X ray facilities all meticulously preserved But the laboratory was clearly designed to handle experiments on small animals mice and guinea pigs not larger animals like cows horses and adult pigs There were records drawings and charts of the freezing experiments all carefully preserved But again they chronicled experiments on small animals mostly mice Where had the large animal experiments taken place Weltz took Alexander to the rear of the barn behind a stable and into a separate shed located far in the back of the property There Weltz pointed to two dirty wooden tubs both cracked It was an extraordinary moment Dr Alexander would later testify horrifying in its clarity Neither of the tubs could possibly fit a submerged cow horse or large pig What these tubs could fit was a human being Dr Alexander said The grim reality of Dr Weltz s Luftwaffe research became painfully clear I came away from all these interviews with the distinct conviction that experimental studies on human beings either by members of this group themselves or by other workers well known to and affiliated with the members of this group had been performed but were being concealed Dr Alexander wrote Without an admission of guilt he had only suspicion To make an arrest he needed evidence He thanked Dr Weltz for his assistance and told him that he would be returning sometime in the future for a follow up visit Dr Alexander had been on German soil for two weeks and the deviance of Nazi science overwhelmed him In a letter to his wife Phyllis

doctors were not practicing science Alexander said but really depraved pseudoscientific criminality In addition to investigating crimes committed in the name of aviation medical research Dr Alexander was the lead investigator looking at crimes committed in the name of neuropsychiatry and neuropathology In this capacity he came face to face with the odious and core Nazi belief that had informed the practice of medicine under Hitler s rule Not only were all people not created equal in the eyes of the Third Reich but some people were actually not humans at all According to Nazi ideology Untermenschen subhumans as they were called a designation that included Jews Gypsies homosexuals Poles Slavs Russian prisoners of war the handicapped the mentally ill and others were no different from white mice or lab rabbits whose bodies could thereby be experimented on to advance the Reich s medical goals The sub human is a biological creature crafted by nature according to Heinrich Himmler which has hands legs eyes and mouth even the semblance of a brain Nevertheless this terrible creature is only a partial human being Not all of those who appear human are in fact so German citizens were asked to believe this pseudo science millions did not protest German scientists and physicians used this racial policy to justify torturous medical experiments resulting in maiming and death In the case of the handicapped and the mentally ill the Untermenschen theory was used by German doctors and technicians to justify genocide As a war crimes investigator Dr Alexander was one of the first American servicemen to learn that the Reich had first sterilized and then euthanized nearly its entire population of mentally ill persons including tens of thousands of children under the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring All across southern Germany one German physician after the next admitted to Dr Alexander his knowledge of the child euthanasia program This included Dr Alexander s own mentor and former professor the neurologist Karl Kleist During an interview in Frankfurt Kleist confessed to Dr Alexander that he had known of the policy of euthanasia and he handed

sometimes seems as if the Nazis had taken special pains in making practically every nightmare come true Dr Alexander later told his wife comparing Reich medicine to something out of a dark German fairy tale Whereas doctors who knew about the euthanasia program tended to be forthcoming with information the program was justified by a German law kept secret from the general public it struck Dr Alexander that criminal human experiments by Luftwaffe doctors like the freezing experiments Weltz was involved in appeared to have been more skillfully concealed If Dr Alexander wanted to learn the facts about what Luftwaffe doctors had been up to during the war he knew that he had to understand the bigger picture And he also had to determine where else the crimes might have taken place The best way to do this was to interview the man nearest the top Dr Hubertus Strughold Strughold had directed the Aviation Medical Research Institute for the Luftwaffe for ten of the twelve years of Nazi Party rule When Dr Alexander learned that Dr Strughold was in Göttingen in the British zone he headed there En route to Göttingen Dr Alexander had a fortuitous break A curious coincidence played into my hands he wrote On my way to Göttingen while having dinner in the Officers mess of the 433rd A A Bn Army Battalion in camp Rennerod Westerwald I happened to meet another casual guest an army chaplain Lieutenant Bigelow In the course of our conversation Lt Bigelow told me he was quite eager to get my ideas about rather cruel experiments on human beings which had been performed at Dachau

camps But nothing compared to what he had heard in that radio report Doctors at Dachau had frozen people to death in tubs of ice cold water to see if they could be unfrozen and brought back to life These experiments were apparently meant to simulate conditions that Luftwaffe pilots went through after they d been shot down over the English Channel Bigelow said Dr Alexander now had a solid new lead To his mind the experiments Bigelow was referring to sounded strikingly similar to the animal experiments performed by Dr Weltz and his group at the Freising farm Was the Luftwaffe involved in medical research at the concentration camps Dr Alexander asked the chaplain if he had caught any of the names of the doctors involved in the Dachau medical crimes Bigelow said that he couldn t recall but that he was certain he had heard that the Luftwaffe was involved More determined than ever to investigate Dr Alexander continued on to Göttingen to interview Dr Hubertus Strughold At the Institute for Physiology in Göttingen Dr Alexander located Strughold and arranged to interview him getting straight to the point Dr Alexander told Dr Strughold about the radio report claiming that freezing experiments had been conducted by the Luftwaffe at Dachau Did Strughold as the physician in charge of aviation medical research for the Luftwaffe know about these criminal experiments at Dachau Dr Strughold said that he had learned of the experiments at a medical symposium he attended in Nuremberg in October 1942 The conference called Medical Problems of Sea Distress and Winter Distress took place at the Hotel Deutscher Hof and involved ninety Luftwaffe doctors During that conference Strughold said a man named Dr Sigmund Rascher presented findings that had been obtained from experiments performed on prisoners at the Dachau concentration camp This was the same man who had been mentioned over the allied radio the other day Strughold said He called Rascher a fringe doctor whose only assistant at Dachau was his wife Nini Both Raschers were now dead Did Strughold approve of these experiments Strughold told Dr Alexander that even though Dr Rascher used criminals in his experiments he Strughold still disapproved of such experiments in non consenting volunteers on principle Dr Strughold promised Dr Alexander that within his institute in Berlin he had always forbidden even the

on principle Dr Strughold promised Dr Alexander that within his institute in Berlin he had always forbidden even the thought of such experiments firstly on moral grounds and secondly on grounds of medical ethics Alexander asked Strughold if he knew of any other Luftwaffe doctors who had been involved in human experiments at Dachau Strughold said Any experiments on humans that we have carried out were performed only on our own staff and on students interested in our subject on a strictly volunteer basis He did not reveal that a number of doctors on his staff had visited Dachau regularly and worked on research experiments there Also in Göttingen Dr Alexander interviewed several other doctors who had worked for Strughold asking each of them specific questions about human experiments Each doctor told a strikingly similar story Dr Sigmund Rascher was to blame for everything that went on at Dachau and now Rascher was dead But one man a physiologist named Dr Friedrich Hermann Rein let an important clue slip Dr Rascher had been an SS man Rein said This information gave Dr Alexander a significant new piece of the puzzle he did not have before namely that the SS was also involved in the concentration camp freezing experiments This was a revelation The day after this disclosure Dr Alexander received further extraordinary related news I learned that the entire contents of Himmler s secret cave in Hallein Germany sic containing a vast amount of miscellaneous specially secret S S records had recently been discovered and taken to the Seventh Army Document Center in Heidelberg This huge trove of papers had been discovered by soldiers hidden away in yet another cave The papers had been stamped with the unmistakable logo of the SS and they bore Himmler s personal annotations drawn in the margins in the green pencil he liked to use Dr Alexander set out for the Document Center to see what he could glean from the files These papers would turn out to be among the war s most incriminating discoveries in a single document find In Heidelberg Himmler s documents were being inventoried and sorted out when Dr Alexander first arrived One of the men tasked to the job

with the officer Someone had learned that Hugh Iltis was a fluent German speaker and perhaps that his father was a leading geneticist and anti Nazi Iltis was needed in Paris to translate captured Nazi documents and the work kept on coming Now six months later here he was in Heidelberg documenting atrocities for the War Crimes Commission His discovery of the Himmler papers it was Iltis who identified how important they were would also become the most important collection of documents on Nazi human experimentation to be presented at the doctors trial Alexander told Iltis what it was that he was looking for documents written by Dr Sigmund Rascher that involved experiments on humans Together the two men broke the original seals on the innocuously named Case No 707 Medical Experiments papers that turned out to include years of correspondence between Rascher and Himmler The idea to start the experiments with human beings in Dachau was obviously Dr Rascher s Alexander explained in his classified scientific intelligence report But as Alexander learned from the papers Rascher was far from the only Luftwaffe doctor involved Nor were the human experiments limited to freezing experiments Even more damning Dr Alexander learned that one of Dr Strughold s closest colleagues and his coauthor a physiologist named Dr Siegfried Ruff was in charge of overseeing Rascher s human experiments at Dachau This was stunning news Dr Ruff and his assistant Dr Romberg joined forces with Rascher and arrived in Dachau with a low pressure chamber which they supplied Alexander wrote in his report This low pressure chamber was used for a second set of deadly experiments involving high altitude studies Sitting inside the Seventh Army Documentation Center reading the Himmler papers Dr Alexander realized that Dr Strughold had lied to him when he had said that the only Luftwaffe doctor involved in the Dachau experiments had been the fringe doctor Rascher In fact Strughold s friend

Himmler papers documented the freezing experiments as they were being conducted at Dachau Rascher s experiments were by no means the solo act of one depraved man There were photographs of yet another of Dr Strughold s Luftwaffe colleagues Dr Ernst Holzlöhner holding prisoners down in tubs of icy water while their body temperatures were recorded as they died It is believed that Rascher s wife Nini took the photographs In a classified CIOS report Dr Alexander expressed doubts about the veracity of Dr Strughold s earlier testimony from their first interview in Göttingen The Dachau experiments were joint endeavors by the Luftwaffe and the SS and despite Strughold s denials several aviation doctors on his staff including individuals who reported to directly to him were named in the Himmler papers Strughold at least must have been familiar with the parts played by his friend and co worker Ruff Dr Alexander wrote In his report he advised SHAEF that while he could not yet say if Dr Strughold was directly involved in the death experiments clearly Reich medical crimes were still being covered up by him On June 20 Alexander headed back to Munich to confront Dr Weltz Instead he found a colleague of Weltz s a Dr Lutz who broke down and confessed that he d been aware of the human experiments but that they d been conducted by his team members not him Lutz claimed to have been offered the human job by Weltz but declined to accept on grounds that he was too soft Before confronting Strughold Dr Alexander first returned to Dachau to locate eyewitnesses There he found three former prisoners who offered testimony John Bauduin Oscar Häusermann and Dr Paul Hussarek had managed to stay alive at the concentration camp by working as orderlies for the SS After Dachau was liberated the three men chose to stay behind so as to help investigators piece together medical crimes They formed a group calling it the Committee for the Investigation of SS Medical Crimes From them

Hussarek a Czech scholar sent to Dachau for committing literary crimes told Dr Alexander that only a few experimental subjects survived the low pressure experiments Most were killed All three men agreed that only one individual was known to have survived the experiments a Polish priest named Leo Michalowski Father Michalowski s testimony provided a critical missing link in the medical murder experiments and how they were so skillfully concealed Luftwaffe reports used the words guinea pigs large pigs and adult pigs as code words for their human subjects In one of Weltz s papers confiscated by Dr Alexander entitled Alcohol and Rewarming Weltz wrote that shipwreck experiments had been simulated in large pigs The pigs were placed in tubs of water with blocks of ice and given alcohol to see if a rewarming effect occurred The results wrote Weltz showed that alcohol in pigs does not increase or accelerate the loss of warmth In sworn testimony Father Michalowski described what had been done to him at Dachau I was taken to room No 4 on Block 5 I was dropped in the water in which ice blocks were floating I was conscious for one hour then given some rum In Weltz s paper the word large pig really meant Catholic priest On June 22 Dr Alexander returned to the Heidelberg Document Center to locate more information with the help of Hugh Iltis Armed with new details and key words culled from survivor testimony Dr Alexander found what Dr Rascher had called his experiment reports These charts Alexander noted were a scientific chronicle of medical murder Rascher had also had bigger plans He was working with the SS to have the aviation medicine experiments relocated from Dachau to Auschwitz Auschwitz is in every way more suitable for such a large serial experiment than Dachau because it is colder there and the greater extent of open country within the camp would make the experiments less conspicuous Rascher wrote Dr Alexander also learned about a grotesque motion picture of the

the name in his report He then returned to Göttingen to interview Strughold a second time to see if he could confirm that Strughold had been lying to him In Göttingen things had changed Investigators working on scientific intelligence projects for the U S Army Air Forces AAF and the Royal Air Force RAF had interviewed many of the Luftwaffe doctors including Dr Strughold Their conclusions were remarkably different from Dr Alexander s None of the RAF or AAF officers had traveled to the Document Center in Heidelberg to read the Himmler files Instead their reports were meant to serve and support Armstrong and Grow s secret new research lab RAF Wing Commander R H Winfield wrote in his report Strughold was the mainspring of German Aviation Medical Research and had a large staff of colleagues including Dr Siegfried Ruff who all appeared to have suffered tremendously from their isolation during the war years Winfield having no idea that Dr Ruff had been the person in charge of overseeing Rascher s work at Dachau stated that his interrogations of Ruff revealed very little information not already known to the Allies Winfield saw Dr Strughold as a patrician figure considerably disturbed about the welfare of his staff who unable to evacuate Berlin were now threatened by the Russians Representing the U S Army Air Forces was Colonel W R Lovelace an expert in high altitude escape and parachute studies The following decade Lovelace would become famous as the physician for NASA s Cold War era Project Mercury astronauts For his confidential CIOS report entitled Research in Aviation Medicine for the German Air Force Lovelace interviewed Dr Strughold and many of his colleagues including the freezing expert Georg Weltz Like Winfield Lovelace was in the dark about the medical murder experiments going on inside the concentration camps He saw Weltz s research as benign and dedicated five pages of his CIOS report to praising his studies on rapid rewarming of the cooled animal Lovelace was particularly impressed by the fact that Weltz had frozen a guinea pig to death and was still able to record a heartbeat after death T he heartbeat may continue for some time

colleague Dr Theodor Benzinger the high altitude specialist who ran the Reich s Experimental Station of the Air Force Research Center Rechlin located north of Berlin This was the same Dr Benzinger who had overseen for Himmler the film screening at the Reich Air Ministry in Berlin of Dachau prisoners being murdered in medical experiments And while Dr Alexander had this information Colonel Lovelace had no idea Lovelace was particularly interested in Benzinger s work involving high altitude parachute escapes for which Benzinger had gathered much data and produced studies in reversible and irreversible deaths Benzinger told Lovelace that he performed his studies on rabbits Finally Lovelace interviewed Dr Konrad Schäfer a chemist and physiologist whose wartime efforts to render salt water drinkable made him famous in Luftwaffe circles With high praise from RAF and AAF officers Doctors Ruff Benzinger and Schäfer were now each being considered for leading positions at the new research lab It was the end of June 1945 and Dr Alexander s allotted time in the field as a war crimes investigator had drawn to a close He was ordered back to London where he would type up seven classified CIOS reports totaling more than fifteen hundred pages Two weeks after Alexander left Germany the chief of the Division of Aviation Medicine for the Army Air Forces Detlev Bronk and an AAF expert on the psychological and physiological stresses of flying named Howard Burchell arrived in Germany to evaluate progress on the new research laboratory envisioned by Armstrong and Grow Bronk and Burchell interviewed many of the same doctors and determined that they were all good candidates for the AAF center Unlike Wing Commander Winfield and Colonel Lovelace Bronk and Burchell had been made aware of some of the controversy surrounding Strughold and his Luftwaffe colleagues In a joint report they explained N o effort was made to assess the doctors political and ethical viewpoints or their responsibility for war crimes They also concluded Strughold was not always quite honest in presenting the true significance of the work which he supported But Bronk and Burchell stated that it was

with Armstrong as cochairman of a Top Secret research center that the AAF was quietly setting up at the former Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Heidelberg and to be called the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center No one outside a small group could know about this controversial project because per JCS 1076 no foreign power was permitted to carry out military research of any kind in Germany including in medicine Dr Strughold handpicked fifty eight Luftwaffe doctors for the research program including Dr Siegfried Ruff Dr Theodor Benzinger and Dr Konrad Schäfer the first Nazi doctors to be hired by the U S Army Air Forces In Munich Dr Georg Weltz was arrested and sent to an internment facility for processing From there he would be sent to the prison complex in Nuremberg to await trial In less than two years many of the Nazi doctors chosen by Dr Strughold would quietly begin their secret journeys to the United States CHAPTER EIGHT Black White and Gray In Washington with policy now informally set the debate over the Nazi scientist program became intense inside the State War Navy Coordinating Committee SWNCC Like its successor organization the National Security Council SWNCC acted as the president s principal forum for dealing with issues related to foreign policy and national security The State Department was vocal in its opposition to the program Exacerbating the situation for the State Department was a parallel issue it had recently become embroiled in South American countries Argentina and Uruguay in particular were known to be giving safe haven to Nazi war criminals who had escaped from Germany at the end of the war The State Department had been putting pressure on these countries to repatriate Nazis back to Europe to face war crimes charges If it came out that the State Department was providing not only safe haven but employment opportunities for Nazi scientists in the United States that would be cause for an international scandal And while some generals and colonels

Powers a nickname for a Pentagon official is opposed the whole War Department is opposed he said To open our arms and bring in German technicians and treat them as honored guests was a very bad idea The Department of Justice was not happy about the voluminous workload that background checks on former enemy aliens would require The Department of Labor was concerned about laws governing alien labor and the Department of Commerce was concerned about patent rights In an attempt to ease the contention Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson sent a memorandum to the War Department General Staff stating that the person to mediate these issues was John J McCloy the assistant secretary of war and chairman of SWNCC John J McCloy would become an especially significant player in Operation Paperclip starting in 1949 But now in the summer of 1945 he wore two hats related to the issue of Nazi scientists On the one hand Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson had put McCloy in charge of coordinating policy regarding Nazi scientists coming to the United States to work On the other hand Patterson s boss Secretary of War Henry Stimson had given McCloy the job of helping to develop the war crimes program McCloy s position regarding the exploitation of Nazi science and scientists was clear He believed that the program would help foster American military superiority while engendering economic prosperity To McCloy those ends justified any means It was not that McCloy believed that the Nazis should go unpunished at least not in the summer of 1945 For that McCloy was a strong supporter of the International Military Tribunal IMT and the idea of a war crimes trial But he was someone who saw these two categories as black and white There were scientists and there were war

significant portion of the last eight months of the war watching and rewatching Triumph of the Will the three hour long Nazi propaganda film by Hitler s favorite filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl Every Thursday night inside a screening room at Camp Ritchie America s Military Intelligence Training Center located eighty miles north of Washington in the Catoctin Mountains the twenty sixyear old Dolibois used the film to teach German order of battle and Nazi Party hierarchy to colonels generals and intelligence officers preparing to go off to war The Triumph of the Will documentary was an ideal teaching tool and enabled Dolibois to point out to his students how individuals within the Nazi Party hierarchy spoke and gestured what insignia they wore who was subordinate to whom Between the hateful speeches and the endless parades the fawning inner circle and the Nuremberg rallies John Dolibois had become so familiar with Hitler s inner circle that he could almost recite their speeches himself He enjoyed teaching but like so many dedicated Americans of his generation Dolibois wished to see action overseas There was a tinge of envy as well He stayed in touch with his former colleagues from Officer Candidates School most of whom had been sent to Europe months ago Many had already been promoted to captains and majors As the war in Europe drew to a close John Dolibois had accepted that he was in all likelihood not going to be sent overseas as part of an interrogation team called an IPW team to interview newly captured prisoners of war Then on Easter Sunday April 1 1945

disguise remembers Dolibois We had reports that many of them were passing themselves off as ordinary German soldiers thus hoping to be overlooked in the confusion and to disappear His job was to intuit the meaning of certain manners of walk greeting and speech Dolibois was on the lookout for anyone who might be useful to the Allies for a more detailed interrogation at a facility elsewhere At Dachau John Dolibois scoured faces in the crowd for telltale marks things that could not be hidden The most obvious among them were the dueling scars of the Nazi elite But at Camp Ritchie Dolibois had also become an expert in signs of concealment Recently shaved facial hair or patches pulled off uniforms were indicators that a man had something to hide True expertise Dolibois knew lay in

could row a boat lots of old trees and acres of flowers Mondorf was built a few miles from the Moselle River in antiquity developed by the Romans as a health resort It was known for its restorative qualities its mineral baths and fresh air How different it all looked now another small city devastated by war Most homes and shops had been plundered or destroyed Driving along the main boulevard Dolibois observed how the façades of many houses had been blown off He could see people carrying on with their lives inside of what was left of their homes Only when his jeep pulled up to its destination did Dolibois realize that he d arrived at the Palace Hotel It was unrecognizable to him A fifteen foot high fence ran around the main building on top of which was a double stringed curl of barbed wire There was a second fence that appeared to be electrified Camouflage netting hung from panels of fencing Wide canvas sheets had been strung from tree to tree Huge klieg lights illuminated the place There were four guard towers each manned by American soldiers holding powerful machine guns Not even in photographs had John Dolibois seen an Allied prison facility in the European war theater as heavily fortified as this place was At the front gate there was a jeep parked and with its engine turned off A stern faced sergeant sat inside His name tag read Sergeant of the Guard Robert Block Block addressed Dolibois with a nod Good afternoon sergeant Dolibois said I m reporting for duty here Block just stared at him Dolibois recalled asking what kind of place this was What was going

Hotel remained surprisingly unscathed by war The boomerang shaped building was five stories tall The fountain at the front entrance lacked water its stone carved nymph rising up from an empty pool Inside the hotel foyer Dolibois was greeted by two guards A third soldier handed him a key and pointed up a flight of stairs He told Dolibois to leave his things in room 30 on the second floor I climbed up the stairs located room 30 and let myself in with the key he had given me It was an ordinary hotel room remembers Dolibois with rather noisy wallpaper Inside the fancy light fixtures and plush furniture of a grand hotel had been replaced by a folding table two chairs and an army cot Dolibois unpacked his duffel bag There was a knock on the door Ashcan may have been heavily fortified on the exterior but inside the facility the prisoners were free to roam around Dolibois opened the door and stood face to face with a large man dressed in a ratty pearl gray uniform with gold braids on the collars and gold insignia on the shoulder pads He held a pair of trousers draped over one arm Clicking his heels he nodded and introduced himself as if he were at a party not in a prison The man opened his mouth and barked Göring Reichsmarschall So this was Hermann Göring Dolibois recognized him immediately from so many screenings of Triumph of the Will Here was the man in flesh and blood Göring was arguably the most notorious of Hitler s inner circle still alive Former commander in chief of the Luftwaffe Director of the Four Year Plan Hitler s long acknowledged successor until the perceived betrayal at the very end It was Hermann Göring who ordered security police chief Reinhard Heydrich to organize and coordinate plans for a solution to the Jewish question At once I understood

film The individuals who had so populated his mind and his teaching at Camp Ritchie for the past eight months were right here And they were all prisoners now Göring stood before Dolibois panting Göring said he had been unfairly tricked by his captors He had been told he was going to a palatial spa Dolibois explained When Göring arrived at Ashcan with his valet Robert Kropp he was expecting a vacation He brought along eleven suitcases and twenty thousand Paracodin pills and had made sure his toenails and fingernails had been varnished to a bright red shine for his stay That the spa at Mondorf had lost its chandeliers and been turned into a maximum security prison complex was not what Göring had in mind His mattress was made of straw Göring barked at Dolibois He didn t have a pillow A man of his rank deserved more Dolibois looked at Göring Made a mental note Are you by chance a welfare officer who will see to it that we are treated correctly according to Articles of War Göring asked Dolibois In this question Dolibois saw opportunity as an interrogator Yes he said He would be working along those lines Göring was pleased He made a great show again of heel clicking bowing and taking his 280 pounds out of my room Göring returned to his fellow prisoners He told the other Nazis about the new officer s arrival and his responsibilities to see better treatment for all of them Suddenly everyone wanted to speak with First Lieutenant John Dolibois CCPWE No 32 was filled with Nazi Bonzen the big wheels as Dolibois and the other interrogators called them Hans Frank the Jew Butcher of Cracow arrived at Ashcan on a stretcher in silk pajamas drenched in blood He had tried to kill himself by slashing his own throat Frank was captured with his thirty eight volume diary written during the war a damning confession of many crimes he was guilty of Dark eyed and balding noted Ashcan s commandant Colonel Burton Andrus Frank had pale hairy hands Other prisoners included

These were the men who personally helped Hitler plan and execute World War II and the Holocaust those who hadn t escaped perished or committed suicide In a second circle or clique there were the real Nazi gangsters Dolibois explained the old fighters who had been with Hitler at the beginning of his rise to power Among this group were Robert Ley Labor Front leader Julius Streicher editor of the anti Semitic newspaper and propaganda tool Der Stürmer Alfred Rosenberg Nazi philosopher Arthur Seyss Inquart the man who betrayed Austria and became Reichskommissar of Holland and Wilhelm Frick former minister of the interior and Reichsprotektor of Bohemia Moravia Stripped of their power small details spoke volumes to Dolibois Göring was terrified of thunderstorms Keitel was obsessed with sunbathing and staring at his reflection in Ashcan s only mirror in its entrance hall Robert Ley was repeatedly reprimanded for masturbating in the bathtub Joachim von Ribbentrop named by the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda as the best dressed man in Germany for nine consecutive years was a lazy slob Day in and day out John Dolibois interviewed them Almost all the men at Ashcan were eager to talk Dolibois recalls They felt neglected if they hadn t been interrogated by someone for several days Their favorite pastime was casting blame The greatest challenge for Dolibois and his fellow interrogators was determining or trying to determine who was lying and who was telling the truth Cross examination Playing one prisoner off the other according to Dolibois was a tactic that worked best Often I was taken into their confidence when they needed a shoulder to cry on Dolibois explains At Mondorf they still couldn t believe they would be tried for their crimes CHAPTER NINE Hitler s Chemists At war s end the staff of the U S Chemical Warfare Service had their sights set on bringing Hitler s chemists to the United States The service saw unbridled potential in making the Nazis nerve agent program its own and was willing to go to great lengths to obtain its secrets Less than one month after British tanks rolled into the Robbers Lair and found the enormous cache of tabun

its Development Laboratory in the United States Work began on May 15 1945 and took two weeks to complete The analysis revealed that tabun was a revolutionary killer that could decimate enemy armies General William N Porter chief of the Chemical Warfare Service requested that five 260 kg tabun filled bombs be shipped from the Robbers Lair to the United States by air under highest priority for field tests Separately General Porter asked the U S Army Air Forces and U S Army Ordnance to conduct their own feasibility studies to determine if tabun bombs could be used in combat by U S troops Most people looked upon chemical warfare as abhorrent In a June 1943 speech President Roosevelt himself had said that using chemicals to kill people was immoral and inhumane The president had denied Chemical Warfare Service officials their request to change the service s name to the Chemical Corps because of the permanence the name change suggested And yet here was the interesting news for the Chemical Service When German nerve gas entered into the world of chemical warfare it brought with it the assurance of a U S chemical warfare program in peacetime According to chemical weapons expert Jonathan B Tucker In 1945 in the aftermath of World War II the U S Army Chemical Warfare Service decided to focus its research and development efforts on the German nerve agents the technological challenges of which promised to ensure the organization s survival through the period of postwar demobilization and declining military budgets Within several months of the German surrender 530 tons of tabun nerve agent were shipped to the United States and used in Top Secret field tests Requests to bring German chemists to the United States for weapons work quickly followed But as had been the case with the V 2 rocket scientists the notion of issuing visas to Hitler s chemists was met with hostility inside the State Department When the chief of the State Department s Passport Division Howard K Travers learned about this idea he sent his colleagues an internal memo stating We should do everything we consistently can to prevent German chemists and others from entering this country In Germany

Likewise the CIOS chemical weapons team led by Lieutenant Colonel Philip R Tarr of the U S Chemical Warfare Service and his British counterpart Major Edmund Tilley were continuing their relentless pursuit When Alsos located the chemist Richard Kuhn at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg they paid him a visit Kuhn had once been an internationally revered organic chemist but rumor had it that he had become an ardent Nazi during the war Kuhn won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1938 but turned down accepting the award at the request of Hitler who called it a Jewish prize Here now to interview Richard Kuhn Samuel Goudsmit had with him two American chemists Louis Fieser of Harvard and Carl Baumann of the University of Wisconsin Both men had actually worked with Kuhn in his laboratory before the war After a cordial exchange of greetings the interrogation began Alsos sought information regarding the Third Reich s nerve agent program What did Herr Kuhn know Kuhn with his mop of straight reddish brown hair cunning smile and schoolboy looks swore that he had no connection whatsoever with Reich military research He told his former colleagues that he was a pure scientist an academic who spent the war working on the chemistry of modern drugs Samuel Goudsmit had his doubts Richard Kuhn s record did not seem too clean to me Goudsmit recalled after the war As president of the German Chemical Society he had followed the Nazi cult and rites quite faithfully He never failed to give the Hitler salute when starting his classes and to shout Siegheil like a true Nazi leader Goudsmit recalled But the Alsos leader did not have enough evidence to have Kuhn arrested so he put him under surveillance instead Elsewhere in Germany CIOS chemical weapons investigators Colonel Tarr and Major Tilley had been rounding up German chemists and sending them to prisoner of war facilities near where the individual arrests had taken place Starting on June 1 1945 these chemists would now be sent to a single location a Top Secret interrogation facility outside Frankfurt SHAEF was moving its headquarters from Versailles to Frankfurt and was to be dissolved

Hermann Göring s former Luftwaffe headquarters and the place where Albert Speer and his aide spent the night the last New Year s Eve of the war The Allies gave it the codename Dustbin This medieval structure built high in the Taunus Mountains had grand rooms hardwood floors beautiful stone fireplaces and shiny chandeliers These were hardly gulag type quarters In terms of security classification Dustbin was top tier The facility was the second most classified interrogation center after Ashcan Dustbin was self contained inside its centuries old stone walls and as it went at Ashcan the prisoners here were free to roam the grounds and chat among themselves Karl Brandt Hitler s doctor organized morning gymnastics classes in the garden Others played chess Industrialists held lectures in the large banquet hall that Göring had once used as a casino Speer took walks in the castle s apple orchard almost always alone by choice Whereas Ashcan housed the Nazi high command Dustbin had many Nazi scientists doctors and industrialists under guard This included more than twenty chemists with IG Farben and at least six members of its board Throughout the early summer of 1945 several key players in Farben s tabun gas program were still at large For Major Tilley the chronology regarding how Farben first began producing nerve gas and how it transformed into wide scale production remained a mystery until a Farben chemist named Dr Gerhard Schrader was captured and brought to Dustbin Schrader was the man who created the nerve agent that had been found at Raubkammer the Robbers Lair The information Schrader had was among the most sought after classified military intelligence in the world Tilley prepared for intense stonewalling from the Farben chemist Instead Dr Schrader spoke freely offering up everything he knew beginning with tabun s startling discovery in the fall of 1936 Dr Schrader had been working at an insecticide lab for IG Farben in Leverkusen north of

Schrader was tasked with creating a synthetic pesticide that could eradicate these tiny pests The government had been spending thirty million reichsmarks a year on pesticides made by Farben as well as other companies IG Farben wanted to develop an insect killer that could save money for the Reich and earn the company a monopoly on pesticides Synthesizing organic carbon based compounds was trial and error work Dr Schrader told Major Tilley It was labor intensive and dangerous Schrader a family man took excellent precautions against exposure always working under a fume hood Even trace amounts of the chemicals he was using had cumulative potentially lethal effects Schrader suffered from frequent headaches and sometimes felt short of breath One night while driving home after working on a new product Schrader could barely see the road in front of him When he pulled over to examine his eyes in the mirror he saw that his pupils had constricted to the size of a pinhead Over the next several days his vision grew worse He developed a throbbing pressure in his larynx Finally Schrader checked himself into a hospital where he was monitored for two weeks before being sent home and told to rest Eight days after the respite Schrader returned to work He had been developing a cyanidecontaining fumigant which he had given the code name Preparation 9 91 Picking up where he d left off with his work he prepared a small amount of his new substance diluting it to 1 in 200 000 units to see if it would kill lice clinging to leaves He was stunned when his new creation killed 100 percent of the lice Schrader repeated the experiment for his colleagues They all agreed that Preparation 9 91 was a hundred times more lethal than anything anyone at the Leverkusen lab had ever worked with before Dr Schrader sent a sample of this lethal new fumigant to Farben s director of industrial hygiene a man named Professor Eberhard Gross not to be confused with Dr Karl Gross the Waffen SS bacteriologist

sixteen minutes Professor Gross told Dr Schrader that his Preparation 9 91 was being sent to Berlin and that he should wait for further instruction on what action to take next At Dustbin Schrader told Major Tilley that when he learned his compound could kill a healthy ape through airborne contact in minutes he became upset His discovery was never going to be used as an insecticide Schrader lamented It was simply too dangerous for any warm blooded animal or human to come into contact with Schrader said his goal was to save money for the Reich With the news of how powerful Preparation 9 91 was Schrader felt he d failed at his job He got back to work searching for a fumigant better suited for the task of killing weevils and leaf lice Meanwhile Professor Gross brought the substance to his superiors Starting in 1935 a Reich ordinance required all new discoveries with potential military application to be reported to the War Office The Reich s Chemical Weapons Department began to evaluate Schrader s Preparation 9 91 for its potential use in chemical warfare In May 1937 Schrader was invited to Berlin to demonstrate how he d synthesized Preparation 9 91 Everyone was astounded Schrader told Tilley This was the most promising chemical killer since the Germans invented mustard gas Preparation 9 91 was classified Top Secret and given a code name tabun gas It came from the English word taboo something prohibited or forbidden Dr Schrader was told to produce one kilogram for the German army which would take over tabun production on a massive scale Schrader got a bonus of 50 000 reichsmarks the average German worker during this time period earned 3 100 reichsmarks a year and was told to get back to work Farben still needed him to develop a lice killing insecticide With their

enemy s hinterland Göring agreed adding that what he liked most about chemical weapons was that they terrified people He responded to Krauch in writing noting that the deadly effects of nerve agents like tabun gas could wreak psychological havoc on civilian populations driving them crazy with fear On August 22 1938 Göring named Karl Krauch his Plenipotentiary for Special Questions of Chemical Production Farben was now positioned to build the Reich s chemical weapons industry from the ground up The Treaty of Versailles had forced Germany to destroy all its chemical weapons factories after World War I which meant factories had to be secretly built This was an enormous undertaking now an official part of the Nazis secret Four Year Plan and through Krauch IG Farben was made privy to the Reich s war plan before war was declared At the Dustbin interrogation center Major Tilley asked Schrader about full scale production Based on the Allies discovery of thousands of tons of tabun bombs in the forests outside Raubkammer Farben must have had an enormous secret production facility somewhere Dr Schrader said that he was not involved in full scale production That was the job of his colleague Dr Otto Ambros Major Tilley asked Schrader to tell him more about Ambros Schrader said that most of what Ambros did was classified but that if Major Tilley wanted to know more about what he actually did for Farben Tilley should talk to individuals who sat on Farben s board of directors with Ambros either Dr Karl Krauch or Baron Georg von Schnitzler Both men were interned here at Dustbin Who is Mr Ambros Major Tilley asked Baron Georg von Schnitzler in an interview that would later be presented as evidence in a Nuremberg war crimes trial He is one of our first younger technicians von Schnitzler said He was in charge of Dyhernfurt sic as well as Auschwitz and Gendorg sic Where was Ambros now Tilley asked von Schnitzler The baron told Major Tilley to talk to Karl Krauch From Krauch

from the German army two officers named Rüdiger and Linde Krauch told Major Tilley that the Dyhernfurth plant had fallen into Russian hands Karl Krauch said something else that caught Major Tilley by surprise Before coming to Dustbin Krauch said he had been in the hospital where he d been paid a visit by two American officers one of whom was Lieutenant Colonel Tarr Judging from conversations I had a few months ago in the hospital with members of the USSBS Colonel Snow and Chemical Warfare Colonel Tarr Krauch explained the gentlemen seemed mostly interested in sarin and tabun they asked me for construction plans and details of fabrication As far as I understood they intended to erect similar plants in the U S A I told them to apply to Dr Ambros and his staff at Gendorf Major Tilley was shocked Lieutenant Colonel Tarr was his CIOS partner and yet Tarr had neglected to share with him the story about visiting Krauch in the hospital This was Tilley s first indication that Tarr was running a separate mission for the U S Chemical Warfare Service one that apparently had a different objective than the CIOS mission The full dramatic story was about to unfold By June 1945 Otto Ambros had been questioned by soldiers with the Third Army numerous times For reasons that remain obscure no one from that division had been informed of the fact that Ambros was wanted for war crimes or that he had served as Farben s chief of chemical weapons production throughout Hitler s rule To the Third Army he was simply the plain chemist in the Bavarian village of Gendorf the smiling well dressed businessman who supplied American soldiers with free bars of soap At Dustbin Major Tilley relayed this critical new information about Dr Otto Ambros to his FIAT superiors who in turn sent an urgent message to the Sixth Army Group also in Gendorf ordering the immediate arrest of Dr Ambros The Sixth Army was to transport Ambros directly to Dustbin so that Major Tilley could interrogate him A note

have been involved in use of concentration camp personnel for testing effectiveness of new poison gases developed at Gendorf CROWCASS notified SHAEF insisting that Dr Ambros be arrested As the plant manager at Farben s Buna factory at Auschwitz Otto Ambros had been linked to atrocities including mass murder and slavery The Sixth Army Group swung into action But when they arrived at Ambros s home in Gendorf arrest orders in hand Ambros was gone The first assumption was that Ambros had fled on his own This proved incorrect He had been taken away by Lieutenant Colonel Philip Tarr Initially the commanding officer at Dustbin found this impossible to comprehend It was one thing for Tarr to try to interview Ambros before any other chemical warfare experts did That kind of rivalry had been going on ever since the various scientific intelligence teams had crossed the Rhine But why would Tarr defy orders from SHAEF to have Ambros arrested While soldiers with the Sixth Army stood scratching their heads in Gendorf Tarr and Ambros were actually headed to Heidelberg in a U S Army jeep Their destination was an American interrogation center that was run by army intelligence officers with the Chemical Warfare Service For days no one at Dustbin had any idea where Tarr and Ambros had gone Otto Ambros had a razor sharp mind He was cunning and congenial sly like a fox He almost always wore a grin The American war crimes prosecutor Josiah DuBois described him as having a devilish friendliness about him He also had a distracting rabbitlike habit of sniffing at the air Ambros was short and heavyset with white hair and flat feet He was a brilliant scientist who studied chemistry and agronomy under Nobel Prize winner Richard Willstätter a Jew As a chemist Ambros had a mind that was

been IG Farben first began producing synthetic rubber in 1935 naming it Buna after its primary component butadiene In 1937 Farben presented commercial Buna on the world stage and won the gold medal at the International Expo in Paris When Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 the Reich s ability to import natural rubber diminished Demand for a synthetic alternative skyrocketed a fact Farben was well aware of in advance of Germany s attack Tanks needed treads aircraft needed tires and Farben needed to produce rubber Hitler directed Farben to increase its Buna production further Dr Ambros was put in charge and saw to it that Farben opened a second and then a third Buna plant so that supply could meet demand As the invasion of the Soviet Union was secretly conceived by the German high command Hitler again called upon Farben s board of directors to increase its synthetic rubber production Farben needed to construct a massive new Buna factory Otto Ambros was put in charge of masterminding this undertaking as well The place chosen was Auschwitz Once Auschwitz was a regular town Ordinary people lived there and tourists visited to see the castle the churches the large medieval market square and the synagogue write historians Debórah Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt In the 1930s visitors sent postcards from the area that read Greetings from Auschwitz When in the fall of 1940 Otto Ambros pored over maps of this region called Upper Silesia in search of a Buna factory site he found what he was looking for The production of synthetic rubber required four things water flat land good railway connections and an abundance of laborers Auschwitz had all four Three rivers met in Auschwitz the Sola the Vistula and the Przemsza with a water flow of 525 000 cubic feet per hour The land was flat and sixty five feet above the waterline making it safe from floodwaters The railway connections were sound But most important was the labor issue The concentration camp next door could provide an endless labor supply because the men were cheap and could be worked to death For Farben the use of slave labor could take the company to levels of economic prowess previously unexplored First a financial deal had to be made with the SS Ambros was instrumental in this act For months before the building of the Buna factory got the go ahead the SS and Farben haggled over deal

question regarding the site Otto Ambros lobbied hard for Auschwitz and in December IG Farben sent a busload of its rubber experts and construction workers to survey the work site A Farben employee named Erich Santo was assigned to serve as Otto Ambros s construction foreman The concentration camp already existing with approximately 7000 prisoners is to be expanded Santo noted in his official company report For Ambros Farben s arrangement with the SS regarding slave laborers remained vague Ambros sought clarity It is therefore necessary to open negotiations with the Reich Leader SS Himmler as soon as possible in order to discuss necessary measures with him Ambros wrote in his official company report The two men had a decades old relationship Heinrich Himmler and Otto Ambros had known one another since grade school Ambros could make Himmler see eye to eye with him on the benefits that Auschwitz offered to both Farben and the SS In fact the SS and IG Farben needed one another Himmler wanted Farben s resources at Auschwitz and was eager to make the deal to supply the slaves so SS officers hosted a dinner party for Farben s rubber and construction experts at the Auschwitz concentration camp inside an SS banquet hall there During the festivities the remaining issues were finally agreed upon Farben would pay the SS three reichsmarks a day for each laborer they supplied which would go into the SS treasury not to the slaves On the occasion of a dinner party given for us by the management of the concentration camp we furthermore determined all the arrangements relating to the involvement of the really excellent concentration camp operation in support of the Buna plants Ambros wrote to his boss Fritz Ter Meer on April 12 1941 Our new friendship with the SS is proving very profitable Ambros explained The SS agreed to provide Farben with one thousand slave workers immediately That number promised Himmler could quickly rise to thirty thousand with demand The relationship between Farben and the SS at Auschwitz was now cemented Otto Ambros was the key to making the Buna factory a success With his knowledge of synthetic rubber and his managerial experience

Gendorf and Dyhernfurth and he was the manager of the Buna factory at Auschwitz From interviewing various Farben chemists held at Dustbin Tilley had also learned that the gas used to murder millions of people at Auschwitz and other concentration camps Zyklon B was a Farben product Farben owned the patent on Zyklon B and it was sold to the Reich by an IG Farben company In one of these interviews Tilley asked IG Farben board member Baron Georg von Schnitzler if Otto Ambros knew that Farben chemicals were being used to murder people You said yesterday that a Farben employee alluded to you that the poisonous gasses sic and the chemicals manufactured by IG Farben were being used for the murder of human beings held in concentration camps Major Tilley reminded von Schnitzler in their interview So I understood him von Schnitzler replied Didn t you question those employees of yours further in regard to the use of these gases They said they knew it was being used for this purpose von Schnitzler said What did you do when he told you that IG chemicals were being used to kill to murder people held in concentration camps Major Tilley asked I was horrified said von Schnitzler Did you do anything about it I kept it for sic me because it was too terrible von Schnitzler confessed I asked the Farben employee is it known to you and Ambros and other directors in Auschwitz that the gases and chemicals are being used to murder people What did he say asked Major Tilley Yes it is known to all the IG directors in Auschwitz von Schnitzler said For Lieutenant Colonel Philip R Tarr there was

they were to locate 30 or 40 drawings of silver lined equipment The Chemical Warfare Service trusted Ambros to such a degree that they sent him and Stumpfi on this mission without an escort Manufacturing tabun gas was a precise and clandestine process The United States desperately wanted to reproduce it but attempting to do so without Farben s proprietary formula and its secret equipment was a potential death sentence for any chemists involved Farben had spent millions of reichsmarks on research and development Hundreds of concentration camp workers had died in this trial and error process When the U S Chemical Warfare Service learned that the silver lined equipment used to manufacture tabun gas on a large scale had been outsourced from a special metals firm called Heraus they

Ambros Major Tilley went looking for Ambros himself and found Hitler s chemist residing at Villa Kohlhof Ambros told Major Tilley that he would agree to continue cooperating with the U S Chemical Warfare Service and the various Allied agencies that sought information from him but only on one condition that Tilley secure the release of all chemical warfare personnel already detained at Dustbin This was a preposterous request Tilley s superior Major P M Wilson of FIAT s Enemy Personnel Exploitation Section attempted to take control of the situation ordering Ambros brought to Dustbin immediately This was not a matter of cooperation Wilson said There were orders to arrest the man Lieutenant Colonel Tarr intervened on Ambros s behalf He lobbied the British Ministry of Supply the

for his crimes But the British also flatly refused to help Tarr The matter stalled Lieutenant Colonel Tarr flew to Paris That night a telegram arrived at Dustbin sent from Paris and purporting to be from the British Ministry of Supply The telegram ordered the release of all Farben chemical warfare scientists at Dustbin and was signed by a British Ministry of Supply colonel named J T M Childs Officers at Dustbin suspected that something was amiss and contacted Colonel Childs about his outrageous request Colonel Childs swore he had neither written the memo nor signed it and accused

words Ambros was now a free man living and working in the French zone The relationship among Tarr Ambros and the U S Chemical Warfare Service was far from over It was only a matter of time before an American chemical company would learn of the army s interest in a whole new field of chemical weapons An American chemist Dr Wilhelm Hirschkind was in Germany at this same time Dr Hirschkind was conducting a survey of the German chemical industry for the U S Chemical Warfare Service while on temporary leave from the Dow Chemical Company Dr Hirschkind had spent several months inspecting IG Farben plants in the U S and British zones and now he was in Heidelberg hoping to meet Ambros Lieutenant Colonel Tarr reached out to Colonel Weiss the French commander in charge of IG Farben s chemical plant in Ludwigshafen and a meeting was arranged On July 28 1945 Dr Hirschkind met with Dr Ambros and Lieutenant Colonel Tarr in Heidelberg Ambros brought his wartime deputy with him to the meeting the Farben chemist Jürgen von Klenck It was von Klenck who in the final months of the war had helped Ambros destroy evidence hide documents and disguise the Farben factory in Gendorf so that it appeared to produce soap not chemical weapons Jürgen von Klenck was initially detained at Dustbin but later released The Heidelberg meetings lasted several days When Dr Wilhelm Hirschkind left he

Wilson confirmed this dark and disturbing truth in a classified military intelligence report on the Ambros affair It is believed that the conflict between FIAT and Lt Col Tarr was due to the latter s wish to use Ambros for industrial chemical purposes back in the United States All documents regarding the Ambros affair would remain classified for the next forty years until August of 1985 That an officer of the U S Chemical Warfare Service Lieutenant Colonel Tarr had sheltered a wanted war criminal from capture in the aftermath of the German surrender was damning That this officer was also participating in meetings with the fugitive and a representative from the Dow Chemical Company was scandalous In 1945 the Chemical Warfare Service was also in charge of the U S biological weapons program the existence of which remained secret from the American public The program was robust if the atomic bomb failed to end the war in Japan there were plans in motion to wage biological warfare against Japanese crops After the fall of the Reich the staff of the Chemical Warfare Service began interrogating Hitler s biological weapons makers many of whom were interned at Dustbin The Chemical Warfare Service saw enormous potential in making the Nazis biological weapons program its own and sought any scientific intelligence it could get The man most wanted in this effort was Hitler s top biological weapons expert Dr Kurt Blome On June 29 1945 Blome was sent to Dustbin The officers assigned to interrogate him were Bill Cromartie and J M Barnes of Operation Alsos Each man was uniquely familiar with Blome s background Cromartie had been in Dr Eugen Haagen s apartment in Strasbourg in November 1944 when he and Alsos scientific director Samuel Goudsmit made the awful discovery that the Reich had been experimenting on people during the war Blome was named in the Haagen files And it was Cromartie and Barnes who led the investigation of the Geraberg facility the abandoned curiouslooking research outpost hidden in the Thuringian Forest Both Cromartie and Barnes had concluded that Geraberg had been a laboratory for Reich biological weapons research and that Dr Blome was in charge During his initial interview at Dustbin Blome refused to cooperate When he was first interrogated he was very evasive Cromartie and Barnes wrote But a few days later when interrogated in

eating hall conversing at length with Dr Heinrich Kliewe the Reich s counterintelligence agent for bacterial warfare concerns Perhaps the two men were concocting a misinformation scheme During the war Dr Kliewe s job had been to monitor bioweapons progress being made by Germany s enemies most notably Russia Kliewe claims that he himself did all the evaluating of the reports received and determined what course of action his department should thenceforth follow investigators wrote in Kliewe s Dustbin dossier Kliewe told Blome that he would likely be taken to Heidelberg for a lengthy interrogation

verified It is quite impossible to check many of his statements and what follows is an account of what he related read a note in Blome s Dustbin dossier What Blome recounted was a dark tale of plans for biological warfare spearheaded by Heinrich Himmler Himmler had a layman s fascination with biological warfare A former chicken farmer the Reichsführer SS had studied agriculture in school According to Blome it was Himmler who was the primary motivator behind the Reich s bioweapons program Hitler Blome said did not approve of biological warfare and was kept in the dark as to specific plans Himmler s area of greatest fascination said Blome was bubonic plague On April 30 1943 Göring had created the cancer research post that was to be held by Blome Over the next nineteen months Blome explained he met with Himmler five times At their first meeting which occurred in the summer of 1943 Blome recalled it as being July or August Himmler ordered Blome to study various dissemination methods of plague bacteria for offensive warfare According to Blome he shared with Himmler his fears regarding the dangerous boomerang effect a plague bomb would most likely have on Germany Himmler

Blome said Himmler ordered him to use human beings Himmler offered Blome a medical block at a concentration camp like Dachau where he could complete this work Blome said he told Himmler he was aware of strong objections in certain circles to using humans in experimental vaccine trials Himmler told Blome that experimenting on humans was necessary in the war effort To refuse was the equivalent of treason Very well said Blome He considered himself a loyal Nazi and it was his intention to help Germany win the war History gives us examples of human disease affecting the outcome of wars Blome told his Alsos interrogators taking a moment to lecture them on history We know that from antiquity up till the time of the Napoleonic wars victories and defeats were often determined by epidemics and starvation Blome said Spreading an infectious disease could bring about the demise of a marauding army and Blome said that the failure of Napoleon s Russian campaign was due in great part to the infection of his horses with Glanders a highly contagious bacterial disease History aside Blome said he counseled Himmler on the fact that a concentration camp was a terrible place to experiment with bubonic plague because the population was too dense Blome then told Himmler that if he were to experiment with plague bacterium he would need his own institute an isolated facility far removed from population centers Himmler and Blome agreed that Poland would be a good place and they settled on Nesselstedt a small town outside the former Poznań University by then operated by the Reich Blome s research institute was to be called the Bacteriological Institute at Nesselstedt In the interim in Berlin Blome oversaw a field test using rats history s traditional carrier of bubonic plague A debate had been taking place inside the Hygiene Institute of the Waffen SS as to whether or not rats were the best plague carriers Himmler s idea was to take infected rats on to U boats and release them near the enemy shores so they could swim to land Blome doubted that rats could swim great distances He believed they could swim only for as long as the air in their fur kept them afloat To prove his point

the rats were dumber than he thought that when placed in the water they had no idea where the shore was and swam around in different directions A few of them drowned in ten minutes The longest any of the rats swam for was thirty minutes Of those released a little over a half mile from shore only a third reached land As far as Blome was concerned Himmler s U boat dispersal idea was not practical Meeting Number Two took place a month or two later in September or October 1943 and was largely a repetition of the first at least according to Blome There was one significant development however Himmler asked Blome if he needed an assistant Blome agreed that a bacteriologist would be helpful Himmler assigned Dr Karl Gross formerly a staff member at the Waffen SS Hygiene Institute The two doctors did not get along Blome became convinced that Dr Gross had been sent by Himmler to spy on him He told his interrogators that he was under great pressure to work faster Himmler repeatedly reiterated that the methods of waging BW biological warfare must be studied in order to understand the defense against it What this meant was that Himmler wanted Blome to infect human test subjects with plague to see what would happen to them The third meeting took place four or five months later in February 1944 By this time Blome said the facility at Nesselstedt had been built There was ample staff housing a well equipped laboratory and an animal farm The block for experimental work included a climate room a cold room disinfectant facilities and rooms for clean and dirty experiments There was an isolation hospital for sixteen people in the event that workers on Blome s staff contracted the disease Work progressed slowly Blome said and Himmler became enraged Rumors of an Allied invasion of the European continent had become a constant thorn in the side of the Reichsführer SS Why wasn t the Reich s bioweapons program more advanced Himmler demanded to know He asked Blome if it was

fever which affected man in a manner similar to plague Blome told Himmler that these were dangerous ideas as any outbreak would surely affect Germany s troops The Reich needed a massive stockpile of vaccinations before it could feasibly launch a biological attack Himmler stretched his thinking to target the Allies on their own soil How about spreading cattle plague also called rinderpest in America or England Himmler told Blome that infecting the enemy s food supply would have a sinister effect on enemy troops Blome agreed and said he would investigate what it would take to start a plague epidemic among the enemies cows There was however a problem Blome explained An international agreement prohibited stocks of the rinderpest virus to be stored anywhere in Europe Strains of cattle plague were available only in the third world Himmler said that he would get the cattle plague himself He sent Dr Erich Traub a veterinarian from the Reich s State Research Institute located on the island of Riems to Turkey There Dr Traub acquired a strain of the lethal rinderpest virus Under Blome s direction trials to infect healthy cows with rinderpest began Riems in northern Germany in the Bay of Greifswald was totally isolated and self contained It was the perfect place for these dangerous tests The veterinary section used airplanes to spray the cattle plague virus on the island s grassy fields where cows grazed Blome said he didn t know much more about the program or its results only that Dr Traub second in command at the research facility was taken by the Russians when the

Himmler he had a pressing issue of his own Given the progress of the Red Army he thought it was wise to move his plague research institute at Posen Poznań somewhere inside Germany The place Blome suggested was Geraberg in the Thuringian forest at the edge of the Harz Mountains Himmler said that the Russians would never reach Posen By early fall he had changed his mind In October a new biological weapons research facility was being built concealed inside a pine forest in the village of Geraberg In the meantime Blome told his interrogators work on vaccines was moving forward not at either of his research institutes but inside the army instead Göring had moved epidemic control into the jurisdiction of a major general named Dr Walter Schreiber surgeon general of the Reich Blome held the position of deputy surgeon general of the Reich but the two men had equal positions under Göring Blome explained He Blome was in charge of creating the biological weapons Dr Schreiber was in

extensive biological weapons program in the world a program more advanced even than that of the Japanese Further the Russians had managed to capture everything from Dr Traub s laboratory on Riems including Dr Traub s Turkish strain of cattle plague Then in the winter of 1945 the Russians had captured Blome s bacteriological institute at Nesselstedt outside Posen This meant the Russians now had

future of the scientists at Dustbin was obscure Would they be hired by the U S government for future work or would they be prosecuted by the Allies for war crimes At Ashcan the future facing the Nazi high command was almost certainly grim although there was much work to do War crimes prosecutors faced a monumental task They had to build criminal cases from scratch a conundrum described by Nuremberg trials prosecutor General Telford Taylor after the war Our task was to prepare to prosecute the leading Nazis on specific criminal charges The first question a prosecuting attorney asks in such a situation is Where s the evidence The blunt fact was that despite what everybody knew about the Nazi leaders virtually no judicially admissible evidence was at hand For evidence prosecutors like Telford Taylor were relying on interrogators like John Dolibois to glean facts from the Nazis interned at Ashcan Frustration was mounting at Ashcan Prisoners were conspiring to withhold information They were whispering rather important secrets to each other Ashcan s commander Colonel Burton Andrus recalled determined not to help on the question of hidden loot the whereabouts of people like Martin Bormann and the guilt for war atrocities Colonel Andrus racked his brain for ideas How to make guilty men talk To jog the prisoners memories back to the reality of their grave situation we decided to show them atrocity films taken at Buchenwald Colonel Andrus assembled his fifty two Nazi prisoners in one room Before the film began he addressed them with the following words You know about these things and I have no doubt many of you participated actively in them We are showing them to you not to inform you of what you already know but to impress on you the fact that we know of it too The lights went down and the first frames of the documentary footage flickered across the screen Colonel Andrus watched his prisoners Hans Frank governor general of occupied Poland the

suffering from venereal disease this once supremely powerful Nazi Party official twisted his fingers anxiously while telling Colonel Andrus he had a confession to make Walter Funk looked incapable of running a filling station let alone a bank Andrus recalled Funk fidgeted nervously I have something to tell you sir Andrus recalled Funk saying I have been a bad man Colonel and I want to tell about it Funk started to cry Then he told Colonel Andrus that it was he who gave the order that all gold in every prisoner s mouth in every concentration camp across the Reich be removed and collected for the Reichsbank s reserves Funk confessed that at first he d had the gold knocked out of their mouths while they were alive but realized if they were dead there was far less bother Andrus was appalled I had never believed before that such a horrific order as the one Funk was confessing to had ever been given Andrus said Colonel Andrus told Funk to leave In his memoir Andrus wondered what Walter Funk had hoped to gain from his confession he never got his answer Whatever motivated Funk that day at Ashcan eventually disappeared Months later at Nuremberg Funk denied that the conversation with Colonel Andrus had ever taken place Instead he swore under oath that he had never been connected with orders involving acquiring gold from Jews If it was done declared Funk it has been kept from me up

on the other prisoners The men who gagged and left the room had nothing more to say and the rest of the Nazi high command remained tight lipped about their crimes Colonel Andrus grew increasingly frustrated The prisoners were allowed to sit outside in the Palace Hotel garden in small groups out of earshot of prison guards There Andrus watched Hitler s closest confidants prattle on among themselves They could sit out in the garden in the spring sunshine and chatter to their hearts content recalled Andrus Undoubtedly they compared notes on the interrogation s which went on in sixteen booths every day If only G 2 had wired the Ashcan garden for sound Colonel Andrus got an idea He made a list of the four men who he believed were the biggest backstabbers and gossips in the group Those with outspoken views about their fellow Nazis men ready to blame each other for their own crimes Göring verbose von Papen malicious Kesselring vain and Admiral Horthy the Prince of Austria who believed he was better than everyone else were chosen With permission from headquarters Andrus devised an elaborate ruse intended to extract information from the Nazi prisoners The four men were told that they were being handed over to the British for interrogation that soon they would be traveling to a villa in Germany to be questioned there In reality Army Intelligence G 2 had rented a house located three and a half miles from Ashcan It was a traditional German style half timber house with a high wall running around its perimeter U S Army signal intelligence engineers spent several days running hundreds of yards of wires through the house under floorboards behind walls inside furniture cushions and lighting fixtures In a final touch they wired the garden for sound The engineers burrowed through the backyard garden and attached tiny microphones to a single tree above the sitting area All wires connected back to a recording machine capable of laying audio tracks down onto gramophone records This was high technology in the summer of 1945 At the Ashcan detention center Göring von Papen Kesselring and Admiral Horthy were loaded into an ambulance a common means of

Germaniclooking house and unloaded the Nazis Göring was thrilled We are at a house I know boasted Göring assuring his colleagues they had arrived in beautiful Heidelberg I recognize the decor on the walls Göring said once inside The bedrooms in the new quarters had fresh sheets plush mattresses and soft pillows Strolling through the house Göring pointed to a chandelier and warned his fellow Nazis to be wary of listening devices When one of the prisoners asked if they could sit outside in the garden a guard checked with a superior and said yes Göring made note of a single patch of shade under a weeping willow tree and suggested it as a good spot The men dragged four garden chairs into the shade sat down and began to gossip Heavy guttural voices could be heard loud and clear Andrus recalled They were being recorded onto the black gramophone disks It was a brilliant start But only a start Soon it began to rain The men moved inside There they sat around barely saying a word The following day it rained again That evening Colonel Andrus received an order from SHAEF The eavesdropping project was being shut down Andrus had twenty four hours to pack up his prisoners and leave This time the ambulance took the direct route back to Mondorf just three and a half miles away Göring was furious Andrus recalled How could they have gotten back to the prison so quickly They realized they d been had Back at Ashcan things moved in a whirlwind John Dolibois received a Letter of Authority on August 10 1945 stating that CCPWE No 32 was going to be closed down Dolibois was to be part of the transport team now taking prisoners to new locations For reasons Dolibois was not privy to thirty three of the fifty two Ashcan internees were going to a new prisoner of war interrogation facility

Walter Warlimont cabinet minister Schwerin von Krosigk OKW Foreign Office head Admiral Leopold Bürkner and Admiral Gerhard Wagner The trip from Mondorf to Oberursel was a journey through ruined countryside Crossing from Luxembourg into Germany Dolibois watched the chatter among the Nazis in his backseat come to a halting end as they saw the destruction and despair everywhere This was their first look at the condition of their country since the war Dolibois explained From churches to administrative buildings to shops entire villages had been reduced to rubble In three months of peace there were no resources to clean anything up People were starving and trying to survive The destruction that was the aftermath of Hitler s determination to fight to the last man said Dolibois The convoy arrived in Oberursel Like many other army interrogation facilities across the American zone in postwar Germany the one in Oberursel had been an important Third Reich military post during the war Oberursel had a particularly storied past This Dulag Luft or Durchgangslager terms for air force prisoner of war camp or transit camp had functioned as the sole interrogation and evaluation center for the Luftwaffe It was here that Nazi interrogators had questioned every Allied pilot who had been shot down during the war The Luftwaffe s lead interrogator Hanns Scharff kept a diary Every enemy aviator who is captured will be brought to this place for questioning It makes no difference whether he is taken prisoner at the front lines or whether he comes dangling down from the sky in the most remote location he comes to Oberursel wrote Scharff Physically things had not changed much since Oberursel had changed hands The interrogation facility centered around a large half timber mountain house that served as an officers club Nearby there were fourteen buildings for officer housing The prisoners barracks a large U shaped building contained 150 solitary jail cells This building had been

Setting out for Ashcan he rode in the lead jeep with an enlisted man A little less than an hour south of Frankfurt Dolibois came upon a row of U S Army trucks stopped along the side of the road One of the soldiers stepped into the road and signaled for Dolibois s convoy to stop John Dolibois climbed out of his jeep He became overwhelmed by a horrific stench sickeningly sweet nauseating he later recalled He heard retching Several of the men in his convoy had gotten out of their vehicles and were now throwing up along the side of the road What is that horrible smell Dolibois asked a soldier behind the wheel of one of the stalled vehicles What in God s name are you hauling The captain climbed out of his jeep He did not say a word but motioned for Dolibois to follow him behind one of the two and a half ton trucks In silence the captain untied a rope and flipped back a sheet of canvas that had obscured the cargo from view until now Dolibois stared into the body of the truck It took him a moment for him to realize what he was looking at rotting corpses Putrefied he recalled Most were naked Some still wore the pajama like striped pants the concentration camp uniforms now just rotting rags It was the most horrible sight I had ever seen The army captain spoke in a flat emotionless tone There are thousands of them five truck loads he told Dolibois We re hauling them from one mass grave to another Don t ask me why These were bodies from Dachau Corpses found upon liberation The army captain s convoy had come to a standstill after one of the vehicles had broken down They d been waiting at the roadside for an escort when Dolibois s convoy from Oberursel had arrived The captain asked Dolibois if his group could escort them to the next military station down the road Dolibois

States OMGUS Back at Ashcan the world appeared different to him now There the rest of Hitler s inner circle remained men directly responsible for that ghastly transport said Dolibois If John Dolibois ever had a shred of doubt about the degree of barbarism and the collective guilt of the men he had spent three months interrogating at Ashcan in that moment there was no hesitation anymore At age ninetythree John Dolibois says I still smell that foul odor of death But in August 1945 there was barely any time for the young interrogator to process what he had witnessed Back at Ashcan he fell into bed and slept hard Come morning John Dolibois received new orders from Colonel Andrus There was still a group of Nazi Bonzen at Ashcan Dolibois was to be on the team that would move them to the Nuremberg prison Colonel Andrus had selected John Dolibois to fly with the remaining members of the Nazi high command on a transport plane Dawn August 12 1945 The sun had not yet risen in the sky Ashcan s last group of Nazis were escorted out of the classified interrogation facility and driven in ambulances a short distance to the airport at Luxembourg City A C 47 transport plane idled on the tarmac stripped down to its bare bones Inside the aircraft a single row of seats ran down each side There was a honey bucket toilet and a urinal attached to a door at the back of the airplane To Dolibois it seemed as if Colonel Andrus was nervous Something was cooking Dolibois recalled Security was always on the colonel s mind Aha Dolibois realized what it was Kaltenbrunner Ernst Kaltenbrunner was considered the most dangerous Nazi among the high command At 6 4 he was a giant man with a massive frame a pockmarked face and a huge head with seven or eight deep dueling scars running across both sides of his forehead cheeks and chin He drank and smoked heavily and was missing teeth Kaltenbrunner was described by the British journalist Rebecca West as looking like a

police and the security services He was as actively involved in concentration camp crimes as any Nazi had been According to the OSS even Heinrich Himmler was frightened of him If anyone was going to cause trouble on the flight to Nuremberg Dolibois explains Colonel Andrus was worried that Ernst Kaltenbrunner might Special precautions needed to be taken Kaltenbrunner would be handcuffed to Dolibois s left wrist If he starts to run or goes for the door Colonel Andrus told Dolibois shoot Colonel Andrus wished John Dolibois good luck during the flight and said that he would see him once they landed in Nuremberg Colonel Andrus would be traveling in a different airplane During the flight Kaltenbrunner did not run for the door Instead he wanted to talk He told Dolibois that he desired for the young interrogator to understand that he Kaltenbrunner was not responsible for war crimes He felt the need to explain about the Jews Dolibois recalled with Kaltenbrunner saying admittedly he hated them but he said that he had not been involved in their treatment in concentration camps In fact he claimed to have remonstrated with Hitler on the treatment of the Jews As the airplane prepared to land in Nuremberg Kaltenbrunner said what so many Nazis repeated after the war I am a soldier and I only obeyed orders he told Dolibois I didn t argue with him I just listened Dolibois said Kaltenbrunner was a ruthless killer determined to save his own skin His soft talk did not change my mind about him but it helped pass the time When the aircraft finally touched the ground Dolibois felt a huge wave of relief The prisoners were unloaded and Colonel Andrus assumed control of them once again Without looking back Dolibois hurried on to the transport plane The plane taxied down the runway and took flight Dolibois sat alone in the empty airplane The weeks of interrogating the Nazi high command were over The Nazis he had just flown with would now be tried for war crimes at the

pockets and a beret on his head The man just stood there shouting out in the direction of the Palace Hotel Dolibois took a moment to pause and listen so he could make out what the man was saying Hallo Meier Hallo Meier the man shouted again and again Wie gehts in Berlin It took a moment for the significance of what the man was doing to register with Dolibois The phrase translated into English as Hello Meier Hello Meier So how s it going in Berlin The beauty of the moment dawned on him In the early days of the war Hermann Göring was so confident the Third Reich would win the war that he d famously bragged to the German people If the British and the Americans ever bomb Berlin my name is Meier The image of the middle aged Luxembourger taunting Göring was a perfect end to this chapter in John Dolibois s life The man was enjoying himself so much Dolibois felt no need to tell him that Göring was gone Besides Hermann Göring was never coming back In Washington on July 6 1945 in a classified memorandum with the subject heading Exploitation of German Specialists in Science and Technology in the United States the Joint Chiefs of Staff finally approved on paper a Nazi scientist program President Truman was not made aware of the initiative The governing body that had been assigned to exercise general supervision over the program and to formulate general policies for procurement utilization and control of specialists was the Military Intelligence Division of the War Department G 2 A five page memo was sent out to eight agencies within the War Department outlining principles and procedures governing the classified program The three most important points were that certain German specialists could be utilized to increase our war making capacity against Japan and aid our postwar military research that no known or alleged war criminals should be brought to the United States and that the purpose of this plan should be understood to be temporary military

G 2 Only the most compelling argument should bring a German specialist to this country the initiative stated and only the chosen rare minds whose continuing intellectual productivity we wish to use would be approved The British would be made aware of the program in general terms At some point after the first large group of scientists had arrived in the United States a suitable press release would be generated by the War Department so as to avoid possible resentment on the part of the American public A list of desired German scientists List I accompanied the memo It included 115 rocket specialists When the British learned about the U S Army s intentions to hire the German rocket scientists they asked to first be allowed to conduct two rocket exploitation projects of their own The Americans agreed and released into British custody a group of scientists engineers and technicians including Wernher von Braun Walter Dornberger and Arthur Rudolph The first British project was called Operation Backfire a V 2 field test that took place on Germany s north coast at a former Krupp naval gun range in Cuxhaven Operation Backfire was designed to analyze technical data about the V 2 by having the Nazi rocket engineers fire four rockets also taken piecemeal from Nordhausen at a target in the North Sea This would allow the British to evaluate various technical elements from how the rocket was launched to its flight controls and fuels Arthur Rudolph the former Mittelwerk operations director was considered an expert in launch techniques and to his biographer he later recalled a scene from Operation Backfire The V 2 ran on alcohol of the same chemistry as that appearing in say Jack Daniels and Old Grandad sic The people at the test site apparently knew that One night

away from the test firing and always under a watchful eye The British had alternative plans for Walter Dornberger They were not interested in the knowledge Dornberger possessed They wanted to try him for war crimes After the test he would not be returned to the Americans as the British had originally promised The British pulled a sneaky on us explained Major Staver who attended Operation Backfire The Americans were not permitted to take Dornberger back after the Operation instead Dornberger was declared on loan and was taken to England There he and von Braun were interrogated for a week by the British and then kept behind barbed wire in Wimbledon for four and one half weeks while waiting to be picked up by the Americans Eventually von Braun was returned but General Dornberger was not Instead he was issued a brown jumpsuit with the letters PW for Prisoner of War stenciled on the back Under armed guard he was taken to the London District Cage near the Windermere Bridge for interrogation From there General Dornberger was transferred first to a castle in Wales and then to Special Camp XI in Island Farm South Wales where he was an extremely unpopular prisoner Walter Dornberger was definitely the most hated man in the camp Sergeant Ron Williams a prison guard recalled Even his own people hated him He never went out to the local farms to work like other prisoners Wherever General Dornberger went while he was at Special Camp XI he required an escort The British feared that other prisoners might kill him On the morning of September 12 1945 Wernher von Braun Dr

arriving in Paris the Germans were taken to the officers club at Orly Airport for dinner Accompanying von Braun Rees and the five other V 2 engineers were four scientists from the Hermann Göring Research Institute handpicked by Colonel Putt and headed for Wright Field They were Theodor Zobel Rudolph Edse Wolfgang Noggerath and Gerhard Braun Luftwaffe test pilot Karl Baur was also with the group he had served as aircraft manufacturer Messerschmitt s chief Me 262 test pilot Accompanying him he had his mechanic Andreas Sebald A little before 10 00 p m the Germans boarded a C 54 military transport plane waiting on the tarmac in the pouring rain Quickly the plane moved through the clouds and a beautiful clear sky with a moonlight night greeted us Karl Baur wrote in his diary For the first time I cannot recall the number of years I enjoyed a flight as a passenger After a stop to refuel on the island of Santa Maria in the Azores the aircraft crossed the Atlantic refueled in Newfoundland and landed at New Castle Airport in Wilmington Delaware at 2 00 a m on September 20 1945 Because the Germans were under military custody they could not be traditionally processed by Customs After a few hours the sixteen Germans boarded a second smaller airplane and were flown to the Naval Air Station at Squantum in Quincy Massachusetts At the naval base the Germans were loaded into sedans and driven out to the edge of dock where a troopship waited for them They boarded the vessel and made a short trip to a chain of small islands in Boston Harbor the Harbor Islands and out

twenty one year old intelligence officer who would take charge of the Germans was named Henry Kolm Each German scientist was lowered down into the little Boston whaler by a harness hanging from a rope They were all seasick as can be Kolm later recalled Fort Strong on an island in the middle of Boston Harbor had been used as a training camp during the Civil War and remained in use on and off through World War I The fortresslike nature of the coastal defense facility made it an ideal place for a secret military program like Operation Overcast When the first German scientists arrived in September 1945 the fortress was still under army control but had not been used for nearly thirty years Thick weeds grew in between the gun blocks and pedestal mounts The administration and observation buildings had fallen into disrepair But the army barracks was easily converted into what would become known as the Operation Overcast hotel German prisoners of war were moved onto the island to work as staff including as translators cooks bakers and tailors Kolm s job was to process the scientists which included fingerprinting medical examinations and coordination with the FBI This all took time and the Germans were not known for patience Before long an insidious unease settled in among the scientists Kolm recalled When the weather was clear the Germans played volleyball games outside Far off in the distance they could make out the Boston skyline and see the tall shiny buildings on shore But often the fog rolled in and the island was soaked in a thick dense mist for days at a time To pass the time the scientists stayed indoors and played Monopoly which they called the capitalists game Still it was impossible to deny that Fort Strong took on a penal colony feel as Kolm recalled Soon the Germans started calling their new home Devil s Island Finally on September 29 1945 Major James P Hamill an intelligence officer with the Army Ordnance Corps was sent to the east coast of the island to

Eberhard Rees Erich Neubert Theodor Poppel August Schulze Wilhelm Jungert and Walter Schwidetzky to Aberdeen Proving Ground where they began translating cataloguing and evaluating the information from the Dörnten mine stash Hamill s next mission was to escort Wernher von Braun by train to Fort Bliss Texas The train ride began on October 6 1945 and was a memorable event Operation Overcast was a highly classified military matter and Major Hamill was required to keep watch over von Braun twenty four hours a day Drawing any kind of attention to the German scientist was to be avoided at all cost In St Louis Major Hamill and von Braun were assigned to a Pullman car filled with wounded war veterans from the 82nd Division renowned for parachute assaults into Sicily and Salerno Also in the train

what business he was in Von Braun apparently well versed in lying on demand replied that he was from Switzerland and that he was in the steel business Well it turned out that this particular gentleman knew Switzerland like the back of his hand Major Hamill later recalled and was himself in the steel business Von Braun quickly qualified steel business to mean ball bearings As it so happened the man

Ordnance finally had their scientists on U S soil and work commenced at Fort Bliss without delay In Germany the drama between the U S Chemical Warfare Service and FIAT over the suspected war criminal Otto Ambros escalated Despite orders from SHAEF to arrest him Ambros remained a fugitive in plain sight He lived and worked with impunity in the French zone At Dustbin FIAT officers continued to learn more about who Ambros was and the wartime role that he had played in chemical weapons research and development In an interrogation with Albert Speer FIAT learned that no single person had been as critical to the development of Hitler s vast arsenal of nerve agents and poison gases as Otto Ambros had been He is known to have spoken to Hitler at a highlevel German conference on Chemical Warfare a FIAT report read Another stated Ambros importance from the Intelligence point of view has been re emphasized by the recent Chemical Warfare investigation at Dustbin Speer and the German Chemical Warfare experts agree that he is the key man in German Chemical Warfare production Major Tilley was outraged by it all but there was little he could do except put Ambros under surveillance Initial attempts to capture Dr Ambros maintained the fiction of civility At the end of August or beginning of September 1945 an attempt was made to induce Ambros to return to the American zone Tilley wrote in a FIAT report In response Ambros claimed to be unable to return then as the French authorities would not permit him to leave the French zone Major Tilley knew this was a lie Ambros regularly traveled back and forth between Ludwigshafen in the French zone and the IG Farben guesthouse Villa Kohlhof outside Heidelberg in the American zone This made Tilley furious This man is thought to be far too dangerous and undesirable to be left at liberty let alone be employed by the Allied authorities Tilley wrote FIAT authorized him to set up a sting operation in an attempt to capture and arrest Ambros

continued to interrogate Ambros s colleagues In late August 1945 Tilley got a very lucky lead from Ambros s former deputy the Farben chemist Jürgen von Klenck Von Klenck was back at Dustbin now and under intense scrutiny after having been in attendance alongside Ambros at the meeting with Tarr and the representative from Dow Chemical Wilhelm Hirschkind Jürgen von Klenck had amassed a sizable Dustbin dossier of his own A Nazi ideologue von Klenck had been a loyal party member since 1933 and an officer with the SS since 1936 One interrogator described him as wily untrustworthy and not employable Von Klenck was also an elitist and had made more than a few enemies because of this Speaking in confidence with Major Tilley fellow chemist and Dustbin internee Wilhelm Horn candidly expressed his thought about Jürgen von Klenck Von Klenck had a magnetic presence a brilliant mind was handsome polished and a wonderful talker but lack ed the essential characteristics that would make him a truly great man said Horn This was because von Klenck was an egoist very proud of the nobility implied in his name and an opportunist who knew how to make the best of his chances Horn confirmed that von Klenck was a long standing and avowed Nazi but that it had always grated von Klenck s pride that such common people as Hitler and his minions were in the highest places said Horn Tilley asked Horn how high up von Klenck was in the production of war gases Horn revealed that von Klenck had been deputy chief of the ultra secret Committee C for chemical weapons In other words Jürgen von Klenck was Otto Ambros s right hand man Armed with this information Major Tilley presented von Klenck with a piece of paper to sign It was a declaration stating that he knew none of which had been concealed by others Von Klenck refused to sign Tilley explained that withholding information was a crime Threatened with arrest von Klenck admitted that there were a few things he hadn t been entirely truthful

he hadn t been entirely truthful about He told Major Tilley that in the late fall of 1944 Ambros had instructed him to destroy all paperwork regarding war gases particularly the contracts between Farben and the Wehrmacht Instead von Klenck had carefully selected a cache of important documents and secreted them away in a large steel drum He had hired someone to bury the steel drum on a remote farm outside Gendorf Where exactly von Klenck said he wasn t sure He told Tilley that he had deliberately refused to learn where the documents were buried in order to be able to deny that he knew of any documents concealed anywhere He gave Major Tilley a list of possible hiding places For two months Major Tilley searched the countryside around Gendorf for the steel drum interviewing locals and patiently waiting for a solid lead Finally on October 27 1945 he found what he d been looking for During an interrogation with Gendorf s fire chief a man called Brandmeister Keller the location was revealed There was more Brandmeister Keller had also hidden documents for Otto Ambros At first Keller denied that he had secreted any documents read the FIAT report When he was told that his arrest order was in Major Tilley s pocket he remembered four boxes Ambros had asked him to fetch in 1945 Ambros gave him various barrels and boxes to hide with various farmers in Gendorf But the most important barrel the large steel drum from von Klenck had been buried at the lonely farm of Lorenz Moser near Burghausen Von Klenck s hidden barrel produced hard evidence including a letter from Ambros stating that he had been in charge of document destruction and why All papers which prove our cooperation with Tabun and Sarin in the low works the DL plant in the upper work must of course be destroyed or placed in security read one letter inside the drum signed by Otto Ambros It was attached to a stack of nerve agent contracts between Farben and Speer s ministry papers that von Klenck had been ordered to destroy These contracts chronicled full details of TABUN production and other details of DYHERNFURTH now in Russian hands including a detailed plan of all buildings and much or most of the apparatus photographs and drawings and many other valuable data covering the period from 1938 or earlier until March 1945 Now Major Tilley had two key pieces of evidence he had not had before

Tilley had two key pieces of evidence he had not had before There was more damning information pertaining specifically to Otto Ambros that had been hidden in the steel drum One document written by Albert Speer described two meetings with himself Ambros and Hitler in June 1944 which not only confirmed the high position that Ambros held but that he was a war profiteer I SPEER reported to the Führer that Dr AMBROS of I G FARBEN had developed a new process by which Buna of the same quality as natural rubber can be produced Some time in the future no further imports of natural rubber will be required the Führer has ordered a donation of one million marks to Ambros Speer wrote A final piece of evidence shined a light on Farben s long term plans for its business venture at Auschwitz In addition to its Buna factory IG Farben planned to produce chemical weapons at the death camp The company had plans for further construction of CW plant at AUSCHWITZ in February 1945 Tilley wrote in his FIAT report Tilley returned to Dustbin with the steel drum and the documents Von Klenck appeared shocked when Tilley told him that the steel drum had been located There are indications that he did not expect them to be found read Tilley s intelligence report FIAT now had documentary evidence that Ambros was guilty of contravening American Military Government laws by concealing documents connected with German military preparations There were hundreds of documents including full data on Dyhernfurth production sheets for Tabun and other war gases as well as many other matters which Ambros claimed to have burned in the furnaces at Gendorf in April 1945 It may well be that these papers added to the formulas production methods and the secret CW contracts between IG and the Reich from 1935 to 1945 which were discovered in a Gendorf safe on that same day may give us a more complete picture of German CW preparations than of most other fields of German armament and general war

the steel drum find on October 29 1945 the British Intelligence Objectives Sub committee issued a warrant for the Arrest of Dr Ambros Now there were two out of three Allied nations lobbying for the immediate arrest of Hitler s favorite chemist Otto Ambros was dangerous and undesirable and should not be left at liberty read the arrest report FIAT knew Ambros could remain protected as long as he stayed in the French zone He is wily and he will remain there as he knows the hunt for him is on in the U S Zone the report explained There was little to do but wait But patience again paid off It took three months for Otto Ambros s hubris to get the better of him On January 17 1946 Ambros traveled outside the French zone and was arrested He was sent to Dustbin where Major Tilley was waiting to interrogate him After FIAT squeezed him for information Ambros was turned over to Colonel Burton Andrus now commandant of the Nuremberg jail Sometime in the foreseeable future Ambros would face judgment at Nuremberg Any suggestion that Otto Ambros would one day have a prominent and prosperous place in civilized society and that the American government would be just one of the governments to employ him would have seemed pure fantasy Then again the Cold War was coming PART III The past is a foreign country L P Hartley CHAPTER ELEVEN The Ticking Clock In the late summer of 1945 the Nazi scientist program underwent a significant organizational change At the behest of the State War Navy Coordinating Committee control over the program was removed from the Military Intelligence Division of the War Department G 2 and given over to the Joint Chiefs of Staff The newly created Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency JIOA would now be in charge of decision making for the rapidly expanding classified program The JIOA was a subcommittee of the Joint Intelligence Committee which provided national security information to the Joint Chiefs of Staff To understand the JIOA s power and how it ran the Nazi scientist program so secretively is to first understand the nature of the Joint Intelligence Committee According to national security historian Larry A Valero who has written a monograph

Intelligence Committee According to national security historian Larry A Valero who has written a monograph on the subject for the CIA the JIC was and remains one of the most enigmatic of all the American intelligence agencies The JIC structure was always in motion always morphing and changing a flexible ad hoc system Valero says Subcommittees came and went so did staff officers but JIC decisions always had to be by consensus and were always reported to the Joint Chiefs Little has been written about the inner workings of the JIOA but the stories of individual Nazi scientists and the JIOA s trail of partially declassified papers help to define this powerful postwar organization In the immediate aftermath of the German surrender the Joint Intelligence Committee was focused on the emerging Soviet threat Between June 15 1945 and August 9 1945 the JIC wrote and delivered sixteen major intelligence reports and twenty seven policy papers to the Joint Chiefs The most important JIC estimates involved the military capabilities and future intentions of the USSR says Valero Those intelligence estimates determined that the Soviets were ideologically hostile to the West and would continue to seek global domination an attitude they had managed to skillfully conceal during the war In September 1945 the JIC advised the Joint Chiefs that the Soviet Union would postpone open conflict with the West in the immediate future but only so it could rebuild its military arsenal and by 1952 be back at fighting strength After this date said the JIC the Soviets would be ready and able to engage the United States in total war The following month JIC intelligence report 250 4 the fourth report in the JIC 250 series warned the Joint Chiefs that eight out of ten leading German scientists in the field of guided missiles had recently gone missing from Germany had most likely been captured by the Soviets and were now at work in the USSR Similarly threatening noted the report two German physics institutes had been seized by the Red Army and reassembled in the USSR not just the laboratories and the libraries but the scientists as well JIC 250 4 warned of intensive Soviet scientific research programs under way across Russia all of which threatened the West It was from within this environment of intense suspicion that the JIOA was created The Nazi scientist program was

German scientists was specifically and strategically aimed at achieving military supremacy over the Soviet Union before the Soviet Union was able to dominate the United States Attaining supreme military power meant marshaling all the cutting edge science and technology that could be culled from the ruins of the Reich In the eyes of military intelligence the fact that the scientists happened to be Nazis was incidental a troublesome detail It had no bearing on the bigger plan The clock was ticking and according to the Joint Intelligence Committee would likely run out sometime around 1952 There was language in the existing Nazi scientist policy that now had to be dealt with by the JIOA The phrase no known or alleged war criminal could not remain as part of policy nomenclature for long nor could the phrase no ardent Nazis These words had been put there to appease a few generals in the Pentagon certain individuals in the State Department and moralists like Dr H P Robertson General Eisenhower s chief of scientific intelligence For the program to move forward according to this new strategy the language needed to change With the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency now in control a new aggressive recruitment process would begin On its governing body the JIOA had one representative of each member agency of the Joint Intelligence Committee the army s director of intelligence the chief of naval intelligence the assistant chief of Air Staff 2 air force intelligence and a representative from the State Department The diplomat in the group was outnumbered by the military officers three to one The State Department officer assigned to the JIOA was Samuel Klaus and he was perceived by his JIOA colleagues to be a troublemaker from day one Samuel Klaus was a forty two year old

Administration during the war During the war Klaus ran Operation Safe Haven a program with international reach designed to capture Nazi assets including stolen art and gold being smuggled out of Germany for safekeeping in neutral countries During his years running Safe Haven Klaus had interviewed hundreds of German civilians and he had developed the belief that many ordinary Germans had profited from the Nazi Party and had had a tacit understanding of what was happening to the Jews In his role as the State Department representative on the JIOA Klaus argued that the Germans at issue were not brilliant scientists who had been unwittingly caught in a maelstrom of evil but rather that they were amoral opportunists of mediocre talent JIOA records indicate that Klaus s sentiments were shared by at least two of his State Department colleagues including Herbert Cummings and Howard Travers But it was Samuel Klaus who was unabashedly vocal about how he felt and what he believed At a JIOA meeting in the late fall of 1945 Klaus vowed that less than a dozen German scientists would ever be permitted to enter the U S on his watch For this he was seen as a thorn in the side of military intelligence and he was also outnumbered Per the JIOA s charter it was required to share its plan with a cabinet level advisory board which included a representative from the Department of Commerce As it so happened the representative from the Commerce Department John C Green was an advocate of the German scientist program apparently without benefit of knowing who these German scientists really were In the fall of 1945 Green came up with an idea that would undermine Samuel Klaus s resistance to Operation Overcast After the war in Europe ended President Truman put the Department of Commerce in charge of a program designed to excite the nation about a unique form of reparations being culled from the defeated German state namely the acquisition of scientific and technical information There would be no financial compensation coming from Nazi Germany the Department of Commerce explained but American industry could now benefit from a different kind of restitution knowledge Secretary of

"from the defeated German state namely the acquisition of scientific and technical information There would be no financial compensation coming from Nazi Germany the Department of Commerce explained but American industry could now benefit from a different kind of restitution knowledge Secretary of Commerce and former vice president Henry Wallace had been appointed by the president to supervise the release of thousands of what would become known as PB reports named after the Commerce Department s Office of the Publication Board These reports contained non armamentsrelated information collected by CIOS officers in Germany after the war The idea behind the PB reports was to get average Americans to start their own small businesses inspired by German technological advances These new businesses would be a boon to America s postwar prosperity the Commerce Department said Thanks to Reich scientists the public was told beverage manufactures could now sterilize fruit juice without heat Women could enjoy run proof hosiery Butter could be churned at the rate of 1 500 pounds per hour These lists seemed not to end Yeast could be produced in unlimited quantities and wool could be pulled from sheepskins without injuring the animal s hide all because of brilliant German scientists Hitler s wizards had reduced suitcase sized electrical components to the size of a pinkie finger and pioneered electromagnetic tape Henry Wallace was one of the nation s greatest champions of the idea that Americans could find prosperity thanks to science Wallace had served under Roosevelt in 1944 when Roosevelt promised Americans sixty million jobs The promise became the subject of a book by Wallace Sixty Million Jobs As secretary of commerce he intended to make good on it Business industry and government could work together to make the world prosperous in peace Wallace said German science was a jumping off point The public was not made aware of a second list regarding captured German scientific and technical information one marked classified This list catalogued eighteen hundred reports on German technology with military potential Subject headings included rockets chemical warfare medical practice aeronautics ordnance insecticides and physics nuclear The man in charge of both lists the classified and the unclassified one was Henry Wallace s executive secretary and his representative on the JIOA John C Green Regarding the classified list Green got an idea Peace and prosperity were in principle sound ideas But there was big business in war Green wanted to make the classified list available to certain groups in industry Specialized knowledge should not be locked up in the minds of German scientists and technicians Green said It needed to be shared To help foster

shared To help foster this sharing in the fall of 1945 John C Green traveled to Wright Field in Dayton Ohio to meet with Colonel Donald Putt The first group of six Germans brought to Wright Field in the fall of 1945 lived in an isolated and secure housing area called the Hilltop a cluster of five single story wooden buildings and three small cottages that had once housed the National Youth Administration Almost no one but the program s administrators knew that the German scientists were there There was a single lane dirt road that passed by the Hilltop used only by locals who needed to visit the town dump Trucks and station wagons filled with trash sped by the Hilltop s secret inhabitants and when it rained the road turned into a sea of mud This annoyed the Germans and they began compiling a list of grievances to share with Colonel Putt at a later date They knew better than to complain just yet Considering the fate and circumstances of many of their colleagues back in Germany theirs was a particularly good deal But when the timing was right they would share this list of indignities which would in turn affect the Nazi scientist program in the most unusual way The original scientists at Wright Field were listed as Dr Gerhard Braun motor research Dr Theodor Zobel aerodynamics and Dr Rudolph Edse rocket fuels the specialists were Mr Otto Bock supersonics Mr Hans Rister aerodynamics and Mr Albert Patin a businessman Their salaries averaged 12 480 a year plus a 6 00 per diem the equivalent of about 175 000 in 2013 Because of an oversight later caught and corrected the Germans did not pay U S taxes for the first two years and twenty months of the program At the Hilltop a husband and wife team of housekeepers looked after the Germans domestic needs washed their laundry and made their beds German prisoners of war who had already been brought to the United States and were not yet repatriated acted as cooks The six scientists and specialists and the others who would soon follow carried military issue identification cards that had a large green S stamped on the front indicating that they were not allowed to leave the base on their own A gate running around

quarters assigned to you What the Germans craved most was respect and this eluded them During the war Hitler s scientists and industrialists had been treated with great admiration by the Reich Most scientists enjoyed financial reward But here at Wright Field many of the Germans American counterparts looked down on them with disdain The mere mention of a German scientist is enough to precipitate emotions in Air Corp personnel ranging from vehemence to frustration one manager stated in an official classified report As commanding general for intelligence at Wright Field Colonel Donald Putt was in charge of the German specialist program Putt had great admiration for each of the scientists having handpicked almost every one of them in Germany at the Hermann Göring Aeronautical Research Center at Völkenrode and elsewhere He could not fathom why the specialists were looked upon with contempt A ll they wanted was an opportunity to work Putt said Colonel Putt s vision for the Germans workload in America was threefold Initially he planned for the men to write reports on their past and future work Next those reports would be translated and circulated among American engineers at Wright Field Then Air Technical Service Command would hold research and development seminars at Wright Field with invitations sent out to defense contractors university laboratories and any other interested parties with Top Secret clearance and a contract with the Army Air Forces But Putt s idea came to a grinding halt after the War Department weighed in on his proposal responding to what it called calculated risk The German scientist program was a highly classified military program and needed to remain secret A War Department memo required that the Germans remain properly segregated from

to take field trips into Manhattan The Germans at Wright Field told Putt they felt like caged animals and they demanded that something be done about it Putt saw opportunity here He wrote to Army Intelligence G 2 to say that the Germans overall malaise was critically affecting their ability to work When the Pentagon ignored Putt s concerns he appealed to Major Hugh Knerr his commanding general at Air Technical Service Command Knerr wrote to the Pentagon Intangibles of a scientist s daily life directly affect the quality of his product he said but this too had little effect In Washington the general feeling was that Operation Overcast was temporary and that the Germans should be happy to have jobs Besides the Nuremberg trials were about to begin On October 18 1945 an indictment was lodged by the International Military Tribunal against the defendants named as major war criminals The trial would take place inside the east wing of the Nuremberg Palace of Justice with opening statements beginning November 20 Because this was a military tribunal sentences would be passed by judges not jurors Nuremberg as a city had played a unique role in the rise of the Nazi Party It had been the site of Hitler s Nazi Party rallies colossal military parades supported by as many as 400 000 Nazi loyalists and home to the Nuremberg race laws Now the leaders in the regime would be tried in this location for conspiracy crimes against peace war crimes and crimes against humanity As the trial began twenty one defendants sat crammed onto two benches inside Courtroom 600 headphones over their ears There were twenty two defendants Martin Bormann was tried in absentia Behind them on the wall symbolically positioned over their heads was a large marble statue of the hideous monster Medusa The

the War Department General Staff The same month the Nuremberg trial opened in October 1945 the Army Air Forces hosted a grand two day long fair at Wright Field On display were captured German and Japanese aircraft and rockets seen by the public for the first time since war s end Over half a million people from twentysix countries came to marvel at the confiscated enemy equipment said to be worth 150 million Among the items on display were the V 2 rocket the Focke Wulf Fw 190 G3 fighter aircraft and the Messerschmitt Me 262 Particularly fascinating to the public was that some of the airplanes still had swastikas painted on their tails The fair was so popular that the Army Air Forces extended it for five days There was no mention made of the fact that several of the men who had designed and engineered these weapons were living a stone s throw away at the Hilltop Among the half million visitors at the fair was John C Green the Commerce Department s representative on the JIOA advisory board and its executive secretary overseeing the PB reports The board had just changed its name to the Office of Technical Services underscoring its transformation from a passive board to a more active service that would make use of cutting edge science and technology As planned Green tracked down Colonel Putt at the Wright Field Fair He had a myriad o f questions for Putt all of which centered around one idea How could all this science and technology on display benefit American industry moving forward Initially Putt was uneasy about Green s attention but in the end he decided to take a gamble on him After all John C Green had access to the classified list Putt shared with him some information about the German scientists on the Hilltop How they were like men kept in an ivory tower how their talents were squandered by policy and prejudice in some circles in Washington D C They needed employment opportunities Putt lamented Perhaps Green could help Green seemed amenable and

reaction of industry toward the possible employment of German scientists Putt wrote in a memo He was not yet clear if Green s influence is favorable or unfavorable But Putt decided to take the risk He forwarded to Green several letters of interest from defense contractors regarding potential employment of the German scientists These documents had already been received by Air Material Command They included letters from Dow Chemical Company the AiResearch Manufacturing Company and the Aircraft Industries Association Defense contracts meant that there was business in the wings waiting to be transacted It was Washington D C that stood in the way Putt explained to Green that these private businesses did not have a high enough security clearance to deal directly with the German scientists themselves John C Green wrote to JIOA explaining what he had in mind German scientists of international repute should be allowed with their families to enter the United States for long term work argued Green This was good for American businesses The letters from the defense contractors indicated that there was a great demand for this kind of work The Commerce Department would set up a board to weed out the Nazis and bring the good Germans in The German scientists knowledge and knowhow would be fully and freely available to all Americans said Green This boom to industry would help create tens of thousands of American jobs Inside the JIOA reactions were mixed particularly among advisory board members The assistant secretary of the interior was skeptical as to how Commerce could guarantee to keep old Nazis out of the program The War Department did not like the idea of having to bring the families to America Army Intelligence felt Green s proposal had validity from an economic perspective If Commerce got involved in the German scientist program the army would not necessarily have to shoulder so much of the financial burden The State Department continued to voice objections saying that regardless of who footed the bill visas were not going to be granted to former enemies of the state without thorough and individual investigations The Nazi scientist program was a

Science would help create those sixty million jobs Wallace said and nothing had a higher national priority in peacetime than American jobs It was wise and logical to bring to America scientists of outstanding attainments who can make a positive contribution to our scientific and industrial efforts Wallace wrote to President Truman on December 4 1945 The knowledge these men possessed Wallace said if added to our own would advance the frontiers of scientific knowledge for national benefit To illustrate his point Wallace used one of the most benign scientists in all of Germany a concrete and road construction expert named Dr O Graff who had helped design the autobahn If you agree that the importance of a selected few approximately 50 in number would be an asset to our economy I suggest you declare that this to be U S policy Wallace urged the president For Colonel Donald Putt at Wright Field and the military intelligence members of the JIOA Henry Wallace s endorsement of the program was like a shot in the arm Before Wallace s letter to the president Samuel Klaus of the State Department had suggested that the public would be outraged by the program once they found out about it It could not stay secret forever nor was it meant to Klaus had said that bringing Hitler s former scientists to America for weapons research and development gave the impression that the army and the navy were willing to make deals with the devil for national security gains Henry Wallace s economically minded endorsement changed all that It gave the German scientists program an air of democracy offering counterbalance to what could be perceived as an aggressive military program Henry Wallace had been staunchly anti Nazi during the war Preceding Truman in the vice presidency Wallace had publicly called Hitler a supreme devil operating through a human form In another famous speech he had likened Hitler to Satan seven times That Henry Wallace was encouraging President Truman to

best kept secrets of Operation Paperclip for decades to come Here starting on September 20 1945 fifty eight doctors handpicked by Dr Strughold had been working on medical research projects begun for the Third Reich Some of the data the Nazi doctors were using in their new Army research had been obtained in experiments in which test subjects had been murdered For Grow and Armstrong the plan was to have these Luftwaffe doctors reconfigure the results of their war work in Heidelberg under army supervision The follow on plan was for these doctors to come to the United States under Paperclip contracts Because conducting military research inside Germany was a violation of Allied Control Council Law 25 of the Potsdam Accord the Aero Medical Center s classified nature shielded the Nazi doctors from chance exposure The codirectors of the secret research facility Colonel Harry Armstrong and Dr Hubertus Strughold were alike in many ways so much so that some saw the two men as mirror

Armstrong would eventually be promoted to U S surgeon general of the air force Strughold would become the father of U S space medicine Harry Armstrong born in 1899 entered into the U S military when horses were still being ridden into battle During World War I Armstrong learned how to drive a six mule ambulance and decided to become a doctor After receiving his medical degree from the University of Louisville he opened a private practice in Minneapolis He might have become a country doctor but he was preoccupied by airplanes and dirigibles Appointed first lieutenant in the Medical Corps Reserve Armstrong entered the School of Aviation Medicine SAM at Brooks Field in San Antonio Texas in 1924 In 1925 he decided to specialize in a field of medicine few had ever heard of and soon he would become a flight surgeon He had never flown in an airplane before It was a master sergeant named Erwin H Nickles who inspired Armstrong to make his first parachute jump In a lecture that took place in a parachute hangar Nickles presented the idea that one day entire troops of infantrymen just might jump out of airplanes into combat situations as a group After the class was over Armstrong got in a long conversation with Nickles He told me that he was puzzled by the fact that people who he supervised in practice jumps almost invariably failed to follow his instruction which was to count ten after leaving the airplane before pulling the rip cord Armstrong explained He said that Nickles feared jumpers would black out or get into a panic and pull the rip cord too quickly When Nickles hinted that he would be very happy if some doctor would make a jump to see if they could solve his problem Armstrong s mind was made up I decided I would make a practice jump and delay my opening as long as possible A few weeks later Armstrong was standing in the cockpit of a biplane wearing a flying suit and a gabardine helmet and getting ready to jump I had a feeling of panic Armstrong explained but he hurled himself out of the aircraft anyway As he fell through the air he kept his eyes closed and paid attention to what his body felt like as he descended The feeling of panic

parachute opened and he floated the last one thousand feet to earth where he landed in a grassy Texas field Harry Armstrong had set a U S Army record He was the first flight surgeon to make a free fall from an aircraft Armstrong finished school and returned to Minnesota but with an insatiable love of flying On March 21 1930 he closed his practice in Minneapolis and joined the army for good His life as one of the most important figures in the history of American aviation and aerospace medicine had begun When Armstrong arrived with his family at Wright Field in 1934 the world was enamored with airplanes which were not yet associated with war but with peacetime progress and the spirit of adventure Jimmy Doolittle set a transcontinental record flying from California to New Jersey in eleven hours sixteen minutes Wiley Post and Harold Gatty circled the globe in eight days At Wright Field the primary task of the flight surgeon was determining who was physically fit to fly in the airplanes of the day Armstrong was a man with a vision and he was also a soldier He envisioned a future where wars would be fought in the air The Army Air Corps most advanced fighter aircraft was a biplane with a speed of around 200 miles per hour and a flight ceiling of 18 000 feet Armstrong s work centered around resolving problems related to oxygen deprivation and exposure to cold One day Armstrong spotted a trapdoor in the floor of his office inside Building 16 at Wright Field He opened the door saw a staircase and climbed down He found himself in a basement filled with old machinery and drafting tables An unusual looking chamber like something out of a novel by Jules Verne caught his eye It was shaped like a globe made of iron and had windows like submarine portholes This was the

ever before Armstrong wanted to begin research and development on the medical effects that flying these new airplanes would have on pilots He wrote a letter to the engineering division at Wright Field requesting permission The letter was forwarded to Washington In no time Armstrong was appointed director of the Physiological Research Unit later called the Aero Medical Research Laboratory and other variations on the name at Wright Field His lab took off Shop mechanics built test chambers from old airplane parts He hired a scientist from Harvard a PhD named John Bill Heim Using volunteer test subjects Heim and Armstrong gathered data on how the body responds to speed lower oxygen levels and decompression sickness and extreme temperatures But it was an experiment on himself with a rabbit on his lap for which Armstrong became legendary He had been wondering what really happened to the human body above 10 000 feet Why and at what specific height would a man die Armstrong climbed into the low pressure chamber with the rabbit on his lap His technician adjusted the pressure to simulate high altitude Armstrong s chest began to tighten and his joints hurt When he rubbed his hands he felt tiny bubbles along his tendons ones that he could move around under his skin He surmised that these were nitrogen bubbles forming in his blood and tissues and that death at high altitude was caused by blood clotting Armstrong indicated to the technician that he should simulate an even higher altitude inside the chamber He was wearing an oxygen mask but the rabbit on his lap was not Soon the rabbit would be dead As the lab technician raised the pressure the rabbit convulsed and died When Armstrong got out of the chamber he dissected the rabbit and found nitrogen bubbles proving that his hypothesis was correct Armstrong s discovery gave way to a major milestone in aviation medicine Working with Heim on more tests he inserted a viewing tube into the artery of a test animal The two men

thousand feet This point would become known as the Armstrong line This is the altitude beyond which humans cannot survive without a pressure suit In 1937 Captain Harry Armstrong was considered one of America s aviation medicine pioneers On October 2 of that year he attended the Aero Medical Association s first international convention which took place in the Astor Gallery of the Waldorf Astoria hotel There he and Heim reported the results of their recent studies at Wright Field One of the doctors most interested in these studies was the Luftwaffe physician representing Germany Dr Hubertus Strughold The two men Armstrong and Strughold were pioneers in the same field We hit it off immediately remembered Harry Armstrong decades later That fortuitous meeting would profoundly shape Strughold s post Nazi career Some men claim to be shaped by a single event For Hubertus Strughold it was watching Halley s Comet streak across the sky from his backyard tree house in Westtünnen Germany in 1910 Forever after said Strughold he became preoccupied with what lies above That same year a second event shaped the rest of his life Strughold watched a solar eclipse through a viewing glass and nearly went blind The lens wasn t as dark as he thought it was and he burned the retina of his right eye causing permanent damage When I looked at somebody with the right eye at his nose he had no nose When I looked at somebody at the street at a distance of about a hundred meters at somebody s head with the right eye he did not have any head It was always clear with both eyes Strughold later explained Hubertus Strughold had learned the hard way that experiments using one s own body could be dangerous Still as a young man he pursued auto experimentation with vigor and imagination In college he studied physics anatomy and zoology but it was physiology that interested him most the functions of living organisms and their parts At the University of Würzburg Strughold taught the world

descent which in turn made him curious to know how he would feel during radical banking turns For that he needed an airplane Strughold found the perfect mentor in a World War I flying ace by the name of Robert Ritter von Greim Von Greim was a legend Renowned for his fearlessness in battle in World War I he had recorded twenty eight kills In the 1920s and 1930s he was considered one of the top pilots in Germany and performed a variety of flight related jobs including exhibition dogfights against fellow World War I flying ace Ernst Udet When Adolf Hitler needed a pilot to fly him from Munich to Berlin for the Kapp Putsch coup attempt in 1920 he chose Robert Ritter von Greim for the job In 1926 von Greim was hired by Chiang Kai shek to set up the Chinese air force in Canton China Returning to Germany von Greim opened a flight school located at the top of a mountain in Galgenberg two miles from where Hubertus Strughold taught aviation medicine to college students Strughold hired von Greim to teach him how to fly paying him six marks per lesson The two men became fast friends In Robert Ritter von Greim Hubertus Strughold found a brilliant match another man willing to push pilot performance to the edge of unconsciousness The men would strap themselves into harnesses in von Greim s open cockpit airplane and fly loops and rolls in the skies over Galgenberg Strughold kept track of their physiological reactions to extreme flight seeking answers to questions Can a man draw a straight line while flying upside down Can a pilot mark a bull s eye on a piece of paper immediately after a barrel roll With how little oxygen could a man legibly write his name How far up can a man fly before his vision fades Von Greim was challenged by Strughold s strange requests and he was willing to fly faster and higher as his new young physician friend recorded data on von Greim s pilot performance and physical capabilities in the air Strughold knew his tests were original and hoped they would attract interest from the United States In 1928 his wish came true when he received a prestigious fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation Strughold packed his bags boarded the SS Dresden

Foundation fellow at the University of Chicago he was at the center of the music scene in the roaring twenties Listening to jazz music was his favorite pastime after flying In Chicago he attended vaudeville shows parties and dances and became fluent in English He loved to drink and almost always smoked His thick German accent distinguished him from everyone else around and made most people remember him His first scientific paper in English was on oxygen deficiency and how to revive a heart using electric shock For research he used dogs as test subjects importing them from Canada at a time when experimenting on dogs from the United States was illegal Strughold attended conferences in Boston and visited the laboratories at Harvard at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and at Columbia University in New York And he met and became friendly with American aviation medicine pioneers like Harry Armstrong The Rockefeller fellowship lasted only a year Back in Germany Strughold and von Greim took up where they left off Von Greim was now flying a double decker Udet Flamingo aircraft an aerobatic sports biplane made of wood To determine how many g forces a man could take before his eyeballs suffered damage the two men would climb high in the air then dive down toward the ground until one of them blacked out Von Greim s longtime friend and colleague Adolf Hitler took power in 1933 In secret von Greim was called upon by Hermann Göring to rebuild the German Air Force in violation of the Treaty of Versailles Through his personal friendship with von Greim Strughold ingratiated himself into this inner circle of Nazi power In 1935 he was offered a job that would shape the rest of his life As director of the Aviation Medical Research Institute of the Reich Air Ministry in Berlin he was now in the uppermost echelon of Luftwaffe medical research The lab located in the suburb of Charlottenburg featured a state of the art low pressure chamber and a ten foot centrifuge in which test subjects could be exposed to varying degrees of gravitational pull The chamber could take both apes and humans to between fifteen and twenty Gs The job required time commitment and most of

Reich s aviation medicine chain of command The Reich had vast resources and a desire to conduct groundbreaking experiments for the benefit of its pilots There were risks but with risks came rewards For Strughold the reward was monumental For ten years he enjoyed a career as one of the most powerful physicians working for the Third Reich In Berlin Strughold treated his expansive new laboratory as a haven for risk takers Colleagues including officials from the Nazi Party and the SS would stop by to marvel over his work with the low pressure chamber and the centrifuge Experiments were almost always in progress Strughold s medical assistants were forever allowing themselves to be hooked up to these odd looking contraptions with pipes valves and hoses projecting from all sides Assistants one with and one without an oxygen mask would allow themselves to be locked inside the low pressure chamber in order to determine how high up a man could go before becoming unconscious During one experiment two officials with the Reich Air Ministry were on hand to observe The man without the oxygen mask began to lose consciousness First his eyes closed then his head fell to his chest The second man inside the chamber wearing a mask administered first aid It did not take long for the man to quickly recover Our studies are all very risky Strughold told the Nazi Party officials They require great ability on the part of the assistants and great responsibility If the man did not get oxygen he might be dead in five minutes As the Luftwaffe prepared its pilots for war Strughold continued to use his staff as test subjects He also experimented on himself He was said to have ridden the centrifuge for a full two minutes simulating what it would be like to experience fifteen

progressed and the Luftwaffe unveiled one new airplane after the next the pilot physiology challenges grew By 1940 new engine systems were being developed including turbo and jet engines with countless pilot parameters to explore including the effects of speed lower oxygen levels decompression sickness and extreme temperatures on the body A web of institutions sprang up across Germany and its newly conquered lands all financed by the deep pockets of the Reich Research Council and including Strughold s Aviation Medical Research Institute in Berlin The institute worked hand in hand with two Luftwaffe facilities close by and Strughold developed strong relationships with the director of each institute Dr Theodor Benzinger of the Experimental Station of the Air Force Research Center at Rechlin and Dr Siegfried Ruff of the German Experimental Station for Aviation Medicine Aero Medical division in Berlin This is why after the war when Strughold was asked by Colonel Armstrong to be the codirector of the classified AAF Aero Medical facility in Heidelberg Strughold asked Benzinger and Ruff to come along He put each man in charge of one of the four areas of aviation research at the new facility They trusted one another They all had the same secrets to protect Dr Theodor Benzinger was tall thin as a rail 5 11 and just 138 pounds He had dark blue eyes sharp angular features and kept his black hair slicked back with a pencil part Born in 1905 Benzinger was described in his army intelligence dossier as an old school Prussian willful selfserving and willing to get what he wants by any means At Heidelberg he was put in charge of a department that developed oxygen equipment for airplanes Benzinger was a committed Nazi and had been from the earliest days of National Socialism He joined the Nazi Party the year Hitler took power in 1933 He was also a member of the SA holding the position of medical sergeant major He and his wife Ilse Benzinger were members of the NSV the Nazi Party s so called social welfare organization which was overseen by Reich propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels Ilse was active in NSV sponsored programs like Mother and Child whereby unwed German

in the near future In service of this idea Benzinger and his staff at Rechlin researched high altitude durability and explosive decompression They took great risks experimenting on themselves On one occasion one of Benzinger s technicians died as a result of complications from oxygen deprivation experienced inside a low pressure chamber In addition to researching aviation medicine Benzinger became a pilot and served as a colonel in the Luftwaffe He flew reconnaissance and combat missions over the British Isles In 1939 showing bravery before the enemy Benzinger was awarded the Iron Cross Class I and Class II In Heidelberg at the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center Strughold put Dr Siegfried Ruff in charge of work involving the effect g forces have on human beings This was work that Ruff had begun at the test center in Rechlin with Dr Benzinger during the war Ruff did not have the same striking looks as his colleague Dr Benzinger Ruff s smiling professorial posture made it hard to imagine he had spent so much time supervising medical experiments inside the Dachau concentration camp including Rascher s murderous high altitude studies in Experimental Cell Block Five Like Benzinger Ruff was an avowed and dedicated Nazi He joined the party in 1938 The facility Dr Ruff was in charge of for the Third Reich was located just ten miles across town from the institute that Dr Strughold oversaw As the directors of the two most important Luftwaffe medical facilities in Berlin Ruff and Strughold collaborated closely on a number of projects during the war Ruff and Strughold coauthored several papers together and coedited Aviation Medicine Luftfahrtmedizin One of the articles they cowrote so fascinated the U S Army Air Corps that in 1942 intelligence officers had it translated and circulated among flight surgeons at Wright Field The two men also coauthored a book called the Compendium on Aviation Medicine which served as a kind of handbook for Luftwaffe flight

This was not Schäfer s primary area of expertise His wartime research work which had been supported by both the Nazi Party s Reich Research Council and the Luftwaffe was the pathology of thirst Schäfer was a tall man slightly overweight with a receding hairline and thick lensed glasses that made him appear slightly cross eyed Unlike most of his colleagues Schäfer avoided joining the Nazi Party which he later said cost him jobs In 1941 he was drafted and sent to a Luftwaffe air base at Frankfurt on the Oder When his talents as a chemist came to light he d worked as chief physiological chemist for the firm Schering AG Schäfer was transferred to Berlin and given an assignment in Luftwaffe sea emergencies This included research on various methods to render seawater potable Schäfer later explained under oath Sea emergencies were an area of great concern As the man in charge of aviation medical research for the Luftwaffe Dr Strughold had solutions to sea emergencies high on his priority list During the air war every pilot knew that drinking ocean water destroyed the kidneys and brought death faster than suffering indomitable thirst But German pilots shot down over the sea and awaiting rescue were known to break down and drink seawater anyway The Luftwaffe announced a contest Any doctor or chemist who could develop a method to separate the salt from seawater would be greatly rewarded Konrad Schäfer one of Strughold s protégés in Berlin aimed to solve that conundrum Schäfer worked in co operation with IG Farben to create Wolfen a mixture from barium and silver zeolith he later explained which he synthesized into a tablet named Wolfatit which was developed to separate the salt in a residue The results produced drinkable water which was a remarkable achievement Schäfer had succeeded where so many other doctors and chemists had failed Dr Oskar Schröder head of the Luftwaffe Medical Corps was thrilled Konrad Schäfer had developed a process which actually precipitated the salts from the sea water Schröder later testified But another group of Luftwaffe doctors were already backing a different process called the Berka method which was bad news

experiments conducted on prisoners inside Experimental Cell Block Five Dr Hermann Becker Freyseng had been a member of the Nazi Party since 1938 His specialty was oxygen poisoning in the human body An odd looking man Becker Freyseng s unusually large ears gave the appearance of handles on either side of his head During the war Becker Freyseng served as chief of the Department for Aviation Medicine and Medical Services in the Luftwaffe another branch under an umbrella of medical facilities and laboratories overseen by Dr Strughold Becker Freyseng was held in great esteem by his colleagues many of whom under interrogation described him as heroic for the masochistic extremes he was willing to go in auto experimentation Becker Freyseng conducted over one hundred experiments on himself many of which rendered him unconscious At least one took him to the brink of death The story repeated most often about Becker Freyseng was of a self experiment he did in a chamber also with a rabbit

research projects Dr Strughold was put in charge of hiring doctors all of whom are considered authorities in a particular field of medicine Across the American zone of Germany entire laboratories were dismantled and reassembled here at the secret facility in Heidelberg More than twenty tons of medical research equipment was salvaged from the Tempelhof Airport in Berlin including a huge human centrifuge and a low pressure chamber the length of two ordinary Pullman cars There was equipment here that American physicians had never seen before esoteric items including a Nagel Anomaloscope a Zeiss made interferometer an Engelking Hartung adaptometer a Schmidt Haensch photometer and a precisionbuilt Siemens electron microscope with which to study night vision blood circulation g forces and the bends Even the low pressure chamber from Georg Weltz s research facility at Freising near the Munich dairy farm was brought to Heidelberg This was the laboratory where Dr Leo Alexander had experienced his revelation that Nazi doctors had been freezing people to death It was a precarious time for doctors who had previously worked for the Reich With the Nuremberg trial under way the international press had its attention focused on war crimes German doctors were looked at with suspicion Articles about Nazi doctors including the November 1945 piece in the Washington Post about the

doctor at the University of Berlin who conducted the freezing experiments at Dachau with Sigmund Rascher committed suicide in June 1945 after being interrogated by British investigators The list of suicides was long but the number of German doctors believed to have been involved in war crimes was even longer The U S war crimes office for the chief counsel wrote up a list of doctors involved in medical research that resulted in mercy killings a euphemism used by the Reich for its medical murder programs The list was classified with a strict caveat that access to it remain restricted for 80 years from the date of creation This meant that by the time the world would know who was on this list it would be the year 2025 and everyone named would be dead A copy of the list was given to the commander of the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center Robert J Benford Five doctors working at the center starting in the fall of 1945 were on the list Theodor Benzinger Siegfried Ruff Konrad Schäfer Hermann Becker Freyseng and Oskar Schröder Instead of firing these physicians suspected of heinous war crimes the center kept the doctors in its employ and the list was classified The list remained

scientists had been secreted into America The single largest group was comprised of the 115 rocket specialists at Fort Bliss Texas led by Wernher von Braun The men resided in a two story barracks on

country during our first year or so von Braun later recalled At Peenemünde we d been coddled Here they were counting pennies he said of the U S Army V 2 launchings would take place about eighty miles away on the White Sands Proving Ground and getting there meant a long and beautiful ride An army bus took scientists around the Franklin Mountains through El Paso and along the Rio Grande to Las Cruces Next came the rugged journey over the San Andreas pass and into the Tularosa Basin where the army s proving grounds began Twelve to fifteen Germans were sent at a time to White Sands where they lived in barracks alongside men from the General Electric Company and a technical army unit The actual rocket firings took place inside a single forty foot deep pit with the Germans watching the launches from a massive but rudimentary concrete blockhouse nearby When the first V 2 was launched in April 1946 it climbed to three miles Although one of the fins fell off von Braun felt inspired to draft a memo to Robert Oppenheimer director of Los Alamos proposing the idea of merging his missile with the atomic bomb The memo turned into a proposal Use of Atomic Warheads in Projected Missiles submitted to the army In it von Braun discussed building a rocket that could carry a two thousandplus pound nuclear payload a distance of one thousand miles Two personal changes in von Braun were afoot The first was that he joined an Evangelical Christian church and became born again something he rarely discussed in public The second was that he decided to marry his first cousin Maria von

Generals For Army Ordnance there were many problems to overcome Funding was scarce Shrinking military budgets offered very little room for missile development immediately after the end of a world war

who had done some work in the Peenemünde valve shop Von Braun called him an eminent scientist In reality Weisemann learned engineering in America working for the army Fifteen hundred miles across the country in the winter of 1946 there were now thirty German scientists at Wright Field Colonel Putt considered this sum to be offensively low At least once a month he wrote to Army Air Forces

Freiberger was so amazed by Patin s industrial vision that he called the soundness of his principles a revelation For Colonel Putt Albert Patin s wartime innovations represented the best and the brightest of Reich science Putt coveted the scientific inventions that Patin s factories mass produced which included navigation aids in flight steering mechanisms and automatic control devices This kind of technology would give the Army Air Forces a ten year jump on anything the Russians had Putt believed Hiring Patin for a U S Army Air Forces contract meant ignoring his past His armaments factories used slave labor which was a war crime In an autobiographical report for Putt Albert Patin admitted that many of the people in his six thousand person workforce were slave laborers supplied

this made him a war profiteer He was just following orders Patin took summer holidays with the Göring family and winter trips with Albert Speer s munitions procurement chief Dieter Stahl but so did a lot of people He was no better and no worse During this slow period at Wright Field Colonel Putt had Albert Patin survey the other Germans He told Patin to be alert to grudges so that Patin could formalize his list of complaints Putt would in turn forward this summary to his superiors at Air Materiel Command Patin s job Putt counseled was to emphasize how the Germans had become depressed even suicidal without their families and without the promise of long term work Colonel Putt sent Patin s summary of complaints to Air Force Headquarters in Washington to the attention of Brigadier General John A Samford In his own cover letter Putt requested that immediate action be taken to improve the morale of the Germans and save the existing situation The name Albert Patin had already caught General Samford s eye All mail sent to the scientists at Wright Field was screened by army intelligence first Albert Patin regularly received letters from his staff back in Germany many of whom also

important German scientists and technicians into the Soviet zone is stopped read a JIC memo to the Joint Chiefs we believe that the Soviet Union within a relatively short time may equal United States developments in the fields of atomic research and guided missiles and may be ahead of U S developments in other fields of great military importance including infra red television and jet propulsion The JIC also stated incorrectly that German nuclear physicists were helping the Russians develop a nuclear bomb and that their assistance had already cut substantially probably by several years the time needed for the USSR to achieve practical results In reality the Soviets had gotten to where they were in atomic bomb development not because of any German rare minds but by stealing information from American scientists at Los Alamos Not until 1949 would the CIA learn that the Russian mole was a British scientist named Karl Fuchs who worked on the Manhattan Project In response to the perception that the Soviets were getting all the important German scientists the Joint Intelligence Committee proposed to the JIOA that three changes be implemented in the Nazi scientist program effective immediately The first was to do everything possible in Germany to prevent more scientists from working for the Russians The second was that the U S Army was to make sure that German scientists and their families were given whatever it was they were asking for including American visas Third a list was drawn up proposing that as many as one thousand additional Germans be brought to America for weapons related research For Samuel Klaus the second proposed policy change was untenable The Nazi scientist program was originally defined as temporary with scientists working under military custody That was how the War Department was able to circumvent immigration law for all the scientists already here Now the JIOA was demanding that immigration visas be issued to scientists and their families Even if the policy change were approved Klaus argued the visa process was a slow going one The State Department was legally required to approve each scientist s visa application individually This was not an overnight task but a lengthy investigative process The person requesting a visa was required to list on his or her application contacts who would in turn be interviewed by

scientist Nazi Party records would have to be pulled from the Berlin Document Center If the scientist had won an honorary award from the National Socialist German Workers Party NSDAP the Nazi Party or was a member of the SS or the SA that needed to be explained This was the law Klaus said With the new information about the Soviets Robert Patterson now secretary of war shifted from being weary of the Nazi scientist program to becoming its champion Only a year earlier Patterson had called the German scientists enemies capable of sabotaging our war effort and had warned the Joint Chiefs of Staff that b ringing them to this country raises delicate questions Now he stated in a memorandum that the War Department should do everything possible to clear away obstacles that may be raised in the State Department This in turn caused Secretary of State James F Byrnes Samuel Klaus s boss to soften his opposition to Operation Overcast Due to the emerging Soviet threat Secretary of State Byrnes and Secretary of War Patterson agreed informally that leaving German scientists unsupervised inside Germany where they could be bought by the Russians was too dangerous If the State Department required individual investigations so be it Byrnes said German scientists and their families should be allowed to enter the country under temporary military custody with an interim State Department blessing Patterson wrote The logic was simple If we don t get them the Russians will The State War Navy Coordinating Committee now acting as an advisory body to JIOA confirmed agreement with the positions of the Secretaries of War and State but added another consideration to the argument German scientists left to their own devices presented serious military implications to the future of United States Security according to SWNCC In other words Samuel Klaus s argument could now be used against him in the military s attempt to speed up the visa application process Yes the German scientists were inherently untrustworthy so much so that they could not be trusted if they were left unsupervised let alone left available to competing powers On March 4 1946 SWNCC Paper No 275 5 went

whether or not someone was a Nazi to whether they were someone the Russians would be interested in The commander in chief of U S Forces of Occupation in Germany and commander of U S Forces European Theater USFET General Joseph T McNarney was told to draft a list of one thousand top scientists in Germany who were to be brought to the United States at once so the Russians couldn t get them A military intelligence officer named Colonel R D Wentworth was assigned to provide General McNarney with material support on behalf of Army Intelligence G 2 The scientists families were to be given food and clothing and were to be housed in a secret military facility northeast of Munich called Landshut until their visa applications were approved It was a radical revision of the initial terms of the German scientist program and it was exactly what the JIOA had envisioned all along The following month the members of JIOA were called together to spend an entire day hammering out new program protocols Expert consultants like Alsos scientific director Samuel Goudsmit were invited to attend Expedite the German scientist program said the Joint Chiefs of Staff There were now 175 German scientists in America under military custody none of whom had visas The consensus save Klaus was that the application process needed to be sped up The thorniest issue had to do with getting the State Department to approve certain individuals who had clearly been Nazi ideologues including members of the SS and SA Also at issue were those men who received high awards for their important contributions to the Nazi Party These were people that by regulation were entirely ineligible for citizenship The meeting resulted in a clever workaround Army Intelligence officers reviewing the OMGUS security reports of certain scientists could discreetly attach a paperclip to the files of the more troublesome cases Those files would not be presented to the State Department right away Instead those men would remain under military custody in America most likely for a longer period of time than some of their fellows As a result the Nazi scientist program got a new code name Operation

came just a few months later on July 17 1946 General Joseph McNarney wrote to JIOA stating that he had worked with Colonel Wentworth to identify 869 German scientists who were ready to sign Paperclip contracts But there was an obstacle There is a large number of former Nazis and mandatory unemployables among those shown on the list General McNarney wrote These men cannot now or later be employed in the United States zone of Germany except in the labor category McNarney was following USFET rules that said all members of the SS and the SA had to go through mandatory denazification trials Citing America s national interest the JIOA would now change the language of the core principle guiding Paperclip s original charter No known or alleged war criminals and no active Nazis would become no persons who might try and plan for the resurgence of German military potential Assistant Secretary of War Howard Petersen felt this new language would allow the JIOA to bypass the visa people as stated in a memo dated July 24 1946 But this was meant to be temporary Eventually State Department officials like Samuel Klaus would take umbrage at this language What JIOA really needed was an endorsement from President Truman By the summer of 1946 the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union was shattering The legendary Long Telegram written by George F Keenan America s diplomat in Moscow had been received at the State Department reviewed by the president and his advisers and sent to every U S embassy around the world After analyzing the Soviet s neurotic view of world affairs Keenan warned his bosses at the State Department that in the long run there can be no permanent peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union The two nations were destined to become steadfast enemies Keenan said Influenced by Keenan s insights President Truman asked White House counsel Clark Clifford to prepare a study of the current state of affairs and the future prospects regarding Soviet American relations from a military standpoint To do so Clifford culled reports and briefings from the Secretaries of War State and Navy as well as the attorney general the Joint

and their duty is to prepare the Soviet Union for this conflict Clifford warned that Soviet leaders were on a path designed to lead to eventual world domination The Russians were developing atomic weapons guided missiles a strategic air force and biological and chemical weapons programs The idea of peaceful coexistence of communist and capitalist nations is impossible Clifford wrote The only way to counter this threat was to use the language of military power Not military force but military threat On August 30 1946 the undersecretary of the State Department Dean Acheson asked President Truman to make a decision on Paperclip If the president did not act quickly Acheson wrote many of the German scientists may be lost to us After four days of deliberation Truman gave his official approval of the program and agreed that Operation Paperclip should be expanded to include one thousand German scientists and technicians and allow for their eventual immigration to the United States With presidential approval official the attorney general was able to expedite the proposed changes to the program A new JIOA contract was drawn up allowing scientists who had been in the United States for six months to sign on for another year and with the government maintaining the right to renew the contract for another five years Operation Paperclip was transitioning from a temporary program to a long term one Former enemies of the state would now be eligible for coveted U S citizenship In response to the Clifford Report the Joint Intelligence Committee conducted its own classified assessment of the Soviet threat JCS 1696 The Soviet Union wrote the JIC sought world domination and would begin by bringing other nations into Soviet control to isolate the capitalist world JIC saw a future war with the Soviet Union as being of apocalyptic proportion In a war with the Soviet Union we must envisage complete and total hostilities unrestricted in any way on the Soviet part by

biological warfare atomic warfare and any other kind of warfare the other side dreamed up Copies of the classified report were sent out to thirty seven or thirty eight people says CIA historian Larry A Valero including the Joint Chiefs of Staff It was not known if President Truman received a copy of JCS 1696 as he was not on the distribution list One of the scientists on the JIOA list of one thousand was Dr Kurt Blome The Allies were unsure what to do with Hitler s biological weapons maker Clearly no discreet paperclip attached to Blome s file would be able to whitewash the reality of his inner circle role as deputy surgeon general of the Third Reich But if the United States were to go to war with the Soviet Union it would mean total war and according to JCS 1696 would likely include biological warfare America needed to envisage such a scenario and to plan for it with both sword and shield Dr Blome had spent months at the Dustbin interrogation facility Castle Kransberg but had recently been transferred to the U S Army Military Intelligence Service Center at Darmstadt located eighteen miles south of Frankfurt In the summer of 1946 Dr Blome was employed there by the U S Army in the capacity of a doctor Dr Kurt Blome s expertise was in great demand but his future was as yet undecided In his Posen laboratory Blome had made considerable progress with live plague pathogens including bubonic and pneumonic plague How far that research progressed remained vague likely because it would put an unwanted spotlight on human experiments many believed had taken place there Blome repeatedly told investigators that he had intended to conduct human trials but never actually did Blome s American counterpart in wartime plague weapon research was a left leaning bacteriologist named Dr Theodor Rosebury During the war the biological weapons work Rosebury conducted was so highly classified that it was considered as secret as atomic research He had worked at a research facility outside Washington D C called Camp Detrick It was like Posen only bigger Detrick had 2 273 personnel working on Top Secret biological warfare programs Like Blome Rosebury worked on bubonic plague

diseases and insect research in an effort to determine which bugs were the most effective carriers of certain diseases Almost no one in America had any idea that the U S Army had been developing biological weapons until January 3 1946 when the War Department released a slim sanitized government monograph called the Merck Report That is when the American public learned for the first time that the government s Top Secret program had been cloaked in the deepest wartime secrecy matched only by the Manhattan Project for developing the Atomic Bomb The rationale behind developing these kinds of weapons the public was told was the same as it had been with America s wartime chemical weapons program If the Nazis had used biological agents to kill Allied soldiers the U S military would have been prepared to retaliate in kind Yes the war was over Americans were now told but unfortunately there was a new and emerging threat out there the Merck Report warned an invisible and insidious evil capable of killing millions on a vast unknowable scale America s bioweapons program needed to continue the Merck Report made clear America may have won the war with the mighty atomic bomb but biological weapons were the poor man s nuclear weapon Biological weapons could be made by just about any country without vast expenditures of money or the construction of huge production facilities A bioweapon could be hidden under the guise of legitimate medical or bacteriological research the report said The Merck Report was written by George W Merck a forty eight year old chemist and the owner of Merck Co a pharmaceutical manufacturer in New Jersey Merck had served Presidents Roosevelt and Truman as civilian head of the U S biological warfare effort during the war Merck Co made and sold vaccines notably the first commercial U S smallpox vaccine in 1898 and in 1942 it manufactured penicillin G among the first general antibiotics During World War II U S soldiers received smallpox vaccines The man diagnosing the bioweapons threat George Merck was also the man whose company might sell the government the solution to combat the threat In 1946 this was not looked upon with the same

surrounded by cow fields about an hour s drive north of Washington and under the jurisdiction of the former Chemical Warfare Service then the Chemical Corps After the release of the Merck Report and coupled with the ominous total war prospects as outlined in the Clifford Report and the JCS 1696 Congress would grant vast sums of money to the Chemical Corps for biological weapons research and Detrick would expand exponentially Dr Kurt Blome had information that was coveted by the bacteriologists at Camp Detrick and plans were being drawn up to interview him And then in the summer of 1946 a totally unexpected event occurred inside the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg that would render hiring Dr Kurt Blome for Operation Paperclip an impossibility at least for now In the tenth month of the trial the Soviets presented a surprise witness putting an unforeseen and unwelcomed focus on Dr Kurt Blome The witness was Major General Dr Walter Schreiber the shield to Blome s sword On August 12 1946 prosecutors for the Soviet Union stunned the tribunal by announcing that a missing Nazi general and the former surgeon general of the Third Reich Major General Walter P Schreiber was going to testify against his colleagues at Nuremberg Schreiber was brought forth as a witness to show that after the Nazis crushing defeat at Stalingrad the Third Reich was planning to retaliate by conducting a major biological warfare offensive against Soviet troops This was the first time information about biological warfare was being presented at the trial The Allies were not informed that Schreiber was going to be a witness U S prosecutors asked to interview him in advance of his testimony but the Soviets denied the request The medical war crimes investigator Dr Leopold Alexander appealed to speak

the Soviets captured him After being taken by train to the Soviet Union he was moved around various interrogation facilities he said until he ended up in Lubyanka Prison the notorious penitentiary located inside KGB headquarters in Moscow Nuremberg was Schreiber s first public appearance since war s end No one including his family members had any idea where he had been That the former surgeon general for the Third Reich was now going to help Russian prosecutors send his former Nazi colleagues to the gallows for their crimes was as ironic as it was outrageous Dr Schreiber was on the U S

possible war crimes If the Americans had located him and had a chance to interrogate him he might well have been in the dock at Nuremberg facing the hangman s noose alongside his colleagues Instead

pounds A long sleeve shirt covered the saber scars on his right forearm At fifty three years old Schreiber had been an active military doctor since 1921 He was an expert in bacteriology and epidemiology and had traveled the globe studying infectious diseases from a plague outbreak in West Africa to a malaria epidemic in Tunisia He claimed to understand medical aspects of desert warfare and winter warfare better than anyone else in the Third Reich He was also an expert in biological and chemical weapons in typhus and malaria epidemics and in the causes and conditions of jaundice and gangrene When war came Schreiber an affable and ambitious son of a postal worker was catapulted to the top of the Wehrmacht s medical chain of command This was in part due to the Reich s zealously germ phobic core Schreiber s vast knowledge of and experience with hygiene related epidemics made his expertise highly valuable to the Nazi Party He was put in charge of the research to fight infectious disease and also in remedial means to defend against outbreaks In this way he became privy to Reich medical policy from the top down In 1942 Hermann Göring also put General Schreiber in

the report of Dr Kramer and Professor Holzlehner Holzlöhner here in Nuremberg I was deeply shocked at the obviously perverted conceptions of some of the German doctors he said Holzlöhner and Schreiber

aristocratic men s club as opposed to the draconian penal institution that it was I had to wait and see whether this Court itself might not raise the question of bacteriological warfare Schreiber said When I saw that it did not raise this question I decided in April to make this statement Witness said General Alexandrov will you kindly tell us what you know about the preparations by the German High Command for bacteriological warfare In July 1943 the High Command of the Wehrmacht called a secret conference in which I took part as representative of the Army Medical Inspectorate said Schreiber A bacteriological warfare group was formed at this meeting As a result of the war situation the High Command authorities now had to take a different view of the question of the use of bacteria as a weapon in warfare from the one held up till now by the Army Medical Inspectorate Schreiber testified Consequently the Führer Adolf Hitler had charged Reich Marshal Hermann Goering to direct the carrying out of all preparations for bacteriological warfare and had given him the necessary powers Schreiber said In this statement Schreiber was contradicting the generally accepted notion that Hitler had never authorized his generals to use chemical or biological weapons against Allied troops In fact no chemical or biological weapons were ever used in World War II which", "chunk_id":

Allied troops In fact no chemical or biological weapons were ever used in World War II which made it strange that Schreiber had been brought all the way to Nuremberg to testify to something that was ultimately irrelevant to the war crimes trial Why then was Schreiber really there At this secret conference it was decided that an institute should be created for the production of bacterial cultures on a large scale Schreiber said and the carrying out of scientific experiments to examine the possibilities of using bacteria in warfare The institute was also to be used for experimenting with pests which could be used against domestic animals and crops and which were to be made available if they were found practicable And what was done after that Major General Alexandrov asked rather pointedly A few days later I learned that Reich Marshal Goering had appointed the Deputy Chief of the Reich Physicians League Dr Kurt Blome to carry out the work and had told him to found the institute as quickly as possible in or near Posen And what do you know about the experiments which were being carried out for the purpose of bacteriological warfare General Alexandrov asked Experiments were carried out at the institute in Posen Schreiber said ominously referring to Blome s institute for plague research I do not know any details about them I only know that aircraft were used for spraying tests with bacteria emulsion and that insects harmful to plants such as beetles were experimented with but I cannot give any details I did not make experiments myself Alexandrov asked if the army high command knew about these experiments Schreiber replied I assume so Will you kindly tell us precisely what the reason was for the decision of the OKW to prepare for bacteriological warfare Alexandrov asked The defeat at Stalingrad Schreiber said led to a reassessment of the situation and consequently to new decisions It was no doubt considered whether new weapons could be used which might still turn the tide of war in our favor So why didn t the Reich use biological weapons Alexandrov asked Instead of answering the question General Schreiber went into minute detail regarding a meeting in March 1945 with Dr Blome In March 1945 Professor Blome visited me at my office at the Military Medical Academy Schreiber recalled He had come from Posen and was very excited He asked me whether I could

the advance of the Red Army He had had to flee from the institute and he had not even been able to blow it up He was very worried at the fact that the installations for experiments on human beings at this institute the purpose of which was obvious might be easily recognized by the Russians for what they were He had tried to have the institute destroyed by a Stuka bomb but that too was not possible Therefore he asked me to see to it that he be permitted to continue work at Sachsenburg on his plague cultures which he had saved Schreiber said Dr Blome wasn t on trial Why was Schreiber spending so much of his testimony talking about Dr Blome During his visit Blome told me that he could continue his work at an alternative laboratory in Geraberg Thuringia Schreiber said but that this was not yet completed It would take a few days or even a few weeks to complete it and that he had to have accommodation until then He added that if the plague bacteria were to be used when the military operations were so near to the borders of Germany when units of the Red Army were already on German soil it would of course be necessary to provide special protection for the troops and the civilian population A serum had to be produced Here again time had been lost and as a result of all these delays it had never been possible to put the idea into effect Was Schreiber s testimony focused against Dr Kurt Blome out of some kind of personal rivalry or vendetta On the witness stand Schreiber also fingered a number of other Reich medical doctors none of whom was on trial In addition to naming Kramer and Holzlöhner as organizers of the freezing experiments Schreiber said that a man called Dr Ding had artificially infected KZ prisoners with typhus using typhus infected lice and that the talented

Laternser was given an opportunity to cross examine the witness Laternser asked Schreiber if his testimony for the Russian assistant prosecutor was prepared Schreiber said no Was any advantage promised to you for making this report Laternser asked No nothing was promised me I would refuse to allow anybody to hold out advantages to me Schreiber said Well let us assume that such a devilish idea as actually to use bacteria did exist Would that not have involved your troops in serious danger Laternser asked Not only our troops but the whole German people for the refugees were moving from East to West The plague would have spread very swiftly to Germany I have one more question Witness Did you ever write down your objections to this bacteriological warfare Dr Laternser asked Schreiber said Yes in the memorandum which I mentioned before Dr Laternser asked When did you submit that memorandum In 1942 may I now That is enough Laternser interrupted He d caught Schreiber in a lie The conference took place in July 1943 Laternser had no further questions The tribunal adjourned Perhaps embarrassed by the fact that their star witness had been caught in a lie the Russians did not call Schreiber back to the stand Dr Alexander made yet another attempt to interview him again without success The Russians said they were sorry but Dr Schreiber had already been transported back to Moscow It was a curious event but something did result from Schreiber s bizarre testimony Two days later a military vehicle pulled into the U S Army Military Intelligence Service Center at Darmstadt where

in white lab coats had been working on an array of research projects in state of the art laboratories studying human endurance night vision blood dynamics exposure to bomb blast acoustic physiology and more They all reported to Dr Strughold who reported to the facility s commanding officer Colonel Robert J Benford High ranking military officers regularly visited the facility including its two founders General Malcolm Grow and Colonel Harry Armstrong Grow was working in Washington D C as the air surgeon soon to be the first surgeon general of the U S Air Force Harry Armstrong had returned to Texas where he was now commandant at the School of Aviation Medicine SAM at Randolph Field Working alongside the Nazi doctors in Heidelberg were dozens of army translators preparing English language versions of the physicians reports By September 1946 there were over a thousand pages of documents completed Soon everything would be compiled into a two volume monograph for the Army Air Forces entitled German Aviation Medicine World War II Work progressed well for Strughold s staff of doctors in Heidelberg until the institute was thrown into psychological chaos On September 17 1946 military security officers with the Counter Intelligence Corps 303 Detachment arrived at the center with five arrest warrants in hand Doctors Theodor Benzinger Siegfried Ruff Konrad Schäfer Hermann Becker Freyseng and Oskar Schröder were wanted by the International Military Tribunal Nuremberg for War Crimes as suspect The men were arrested and taken to the prison complex at the Nuremberg Palace

bureaucrats were virtually unknown figures in the eyes of the American public What was known from earlier press coverage was that these proceedings would put lurid Nazi science on trial In the words of chief prosecutor General Telford Taylor Nazi doctors had become proficient in the macabre science of killing Torturous medical experiments conducted on concentration camp prisoners included freezing experiments high altitude tests mustard gas research seawater drinkability tests malaria research mass sterilization and euthanasia The New York Times called the doctors crimes beyond the pale of even the most perverted medicine and cautioned that some details were difficult to report because they were impossible to comprehend The New York Times cited one particularly grotesque example Perfectly healthy people Jews and Slavs had been murdered at the request of SS physician Dr August Hirt for a university skeleton collection of the Untermenschen This was the same anatomist named by Dr Eugen Haagen in papers discovered by Alsos officers in Strasbourg in November 1944 Hirt an expert in dinosaur anatomy had committed suicide before the trial The defendants ran the gamut from the dregs of the German medical profession to doctors who had once been internationally esteemed like Dr Kurt Blome On October 12 1946 the Stars and Stripes newspaper which operated from inside the Pentagon listed the individual names of the doctors charged a list that included the five Luftwaffe doctors who had been arrested at the U S Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center Theodor Benzinger Siegfried Ruff Konrad Schäfer Hermann Becker Freyseng and Oskar Schröder In a matter of weeks these physicians had gone from being employed by the U S Army to being tried by the U S military for war crimes The ultimate judicial punishment was on the line Each doctor faced a possible death sentence The following week inside the prison complex at the Nuremberg Palace of Justice there was a strange occurrence involving Dr Benzinger In Benzinger s pretrial investigation he admitted being aware of the fact that medical experiments were taking place at concentration camps and that nonconsenting test subjects had been murdered in the process Benzinger also admitted that he had attended the October 1942 conference in Nuremberg Medical Problems of Sea Distress and Winter Distress where data

Benzinger s Nuremberg incarceration prosecutors revealed to him that they had a new detail regarding his accessory to medical crimes namely the motion picture of the record of the medical murder experiments that had been shown at a private screening at the Air Ministry Benzinger did not deny that he had been one of a select group of doctors invited by Himmler to attend this film screening nor did he deny that he was one of nine persons chosen by Himmler to host the event Benzinger was part of an elite inner circle of Luftwaffe doctors favored by the Reichsführer SS he conceded but that was not a crime But prosecutors also had a document that suggested Benzinger was far more implicated in the crimes than he let on After the showing of the film most of the spectators withdrew and a small group of doctors remained behind including Benzinger They asked Rascher for a verbal report on the experiments the document read Benzinger insisted that all he did was listen That there was no evidence of his having participated in any of the medical murders and that there were no documents and no eyewitnesses that could prove otherwise On October 12 1946 Dr Theodor Benzinger was announced as a defendant in the forthcoming doctors trial And then just eleven days later on October 23 1946 Benzinger was released from the Nuremberg prison without further explanation He was returned directly to the custody of the Army Air Forces as stated in his declassified Nuremberg prisoner file After spending a little over a month in the Nuremberg jail Benzinger was back in Heidelberg continuing his U S Army research work There was no explanation as to why Benzinger was dropped from the list of defendants in the upcoming doctors trial It would take decades for an important clue to be revealed by Nuremberg trial expert and medical history professor Paul Weindling As it turned out in the fall of 1946 Benzinger had recently completed a paper on pilot physiology concerning stratospheric or extremely high altitude aircraft The US Army Air Forces Wright Field circulated his report on this topic in October 1946 just weeks after his detention and release from the prison complex at the

classified programs taking place there began to quietly wind down While Doctors Ruff Schäfer Hermann Becker Freyseng and Schröder faced judgment at Nuremberg thirty four of the doctors remaining at the center prepared for shipment to the United States under Operation Paperclip One of the first doctors in the group to head to America for work in February 1947 was Dr Theodor Benzinger At Nuremberg while the doctors from Heidelberg remained incarcerated in one wing of the prison awaiting trial preparations of another kind were also going on The trial of the major war criminals was over On the morning of October 1 the judges took turns reading the verdicts nineteen convictions and three acquittals of the twenty two accused major war criminals one Bormann in absentia That same afternoon the tribunal pronounced what sentences would be imposed twelve death sentences three life sentences and four lengthy prison terms Albert Speer the only defendant who pled guilty was sentenced to twenty years The doctors from Heidelberg were housed in a separate wing of the prison where pretrial interviews would continue for another two months Also in custody inside the prison complex at the Palace of Justice was Dr Otto Ambros Ambros would be tried in a subsequent trial Case VI or the Farben trial which was scheduled to begin in the summer of 1947 As commandant of the facility Colonel Burton

only at the very last minute that their time had come to be hanged The Nuremberg gymnasium was chosen as the location where the executions would take place Each night the U S Army prison guards played basketball there to blow off steam The night before the gallows were constructed Andrus allowed the usual game to go on Late at night remembered Andrus when the sweating players had trotted off to their showers the grim faced execution team passed through a door specially cut into the catwalk wall and began their tasks in the gymnasium A doorway had been cut into the blind side of the building so that no prisoner would see scaffolding being carried in The condemned prisoners were also shielded from seeing the stretchers that would soon carry their corpses away While the gallows were being built drama unfolded in the prison Göring had requested death by firing squad instead of hanging to be hanged was something he considered beneath him His plea was considered by the Allied Control Commission and rejected The night before he was to be hanged Göring swallowed a brass and glass vial of potassium cyanide that he had skillfully managed to keep hidden for eighteen months In a suicide note he explained how he had managed to keep the vial hidden from guards by alternating its hiding place from his anus to his flabby navel War crimes investigator Dr Leopold Alexander would later learn that it was Dr Rascher of the notorious Dachau experiments who had originally prepared Göring s suicide vial for him Shortly after midnight in the early morning hours of October 16 1946 three sets of gallows had been built and painted black Each had thirteen stairs leading up to a platform and crossbeam from which a noose with thirteen coils hung The executioner was Master Sergeant John C

in between Was the old German proverb true Jedem das Seine Does everyone get what he deserves CHAPTER THIRTEEN Science at Any Price The same week that the major war criminals convicted at Nuremberg were hanged and their ashes thrown into a river Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson called Samuel Klaus into his office at the State Department to discuss Operation Paperclip At issue was the fact that JIOA had circulated a new Top Secret directive JIOA 257 22 The way in which Paperclip participants would now receive visas had officially been changed Instead of allowing State Department representatives to conduct preexaminations in Europe prior to visa issuance as was required by law that process would be completed here in America by the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service INS The Department of State would accept as final the investigation and security reports prepared by JIOA for insuring final clearance of individuals concerned wrote JIOA director Colonel Thomas Ford Acheson and Klaus were both aware that JIOA had wrested control of how visas were issued and had done so in defiance of U S law But the president had signed off on the directive Operation Paperclip was now officially a denial program meaning that any German scientist of potential interest to the Russians needed to be denied to the Russians at whatever cost There

this vague new language meant military intelligence officers could withhold damaging information about certain scientists from State Department officials The pipeline to bring ardent Nazis and their

that one thousand additional German scientists were on the way All were described as volunteers and under contract the article reported Their trial periods are generally six months after which they can apply for citizenship and have their dependents brought to the United States Newsweek magazine revealed that the secret military program s classified name was Project Paperclip Rather than deny the story the War Department decided to go public with a sanitized version of its program They would also make several scientists at Wright Field available to press radio and pictorial services An open house was organized with army censors releasing details and photographs that would foster the appearance that all of the German scientists in the United States were benign At Wright Field the dirigible expert Theodor Knacke gave a demonstration with a parachute The eighty year old Hugo Eckener former chairman of the Zeppelin Company explained to reporters that thanks to his army contract

America the army stated This Command is cognizant of Mr Salmon s Nazi activities and certain allegations made by some of his associates in Europe namely that during the war Emil Salmon had been involved in burning down a synagogue in his hometown of Ludwigshafen But Emil Salmon was now at Wright Field because the Army Air Forces found his knowledge and expertise difficult if not impossible to duplicate Emil Salmon built aircraft engine test stands For various press events the army provided photographs of some of the more wholesome looking German scientists definitely no one with a

Wright Field actually was about to be sent home But tunnel engineer Georg Rickhey s downfall came not because of the demands made by the public but because of the actions by a fellow German In the fall of 1946 of the 233 Nazi scientists in America 140 were at Wright Field With that many single men living together in isolation the Hilltop became divided into social cliques The Nazi businessman Albert Patin continued to serve as Colonel Putt s ears and eyes among the Germans reporting to Putt about the Germans needs and complaints In this arrangement Patin wielded power at the Hilltop With the arrival of former Mittelwerk general manager Georg Rickhey in the summer of 1946 Albert Patin saw a business opportunity Rickhey was a former employee of the Speer ministry He served as the general manager of the Mittelwerk slave labor facility in Nordhausen where the V 2 rockets were built Colonel Beasley of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey had evacuated Rickhey to London and after that work was completed Rickhey was hired to work at Wright Field When asked by military intelligence officers what his job was Rickhey said Giving my knowledge and experience in regard to planning construction and operating underground factories Georg Rickhey was a tunnel engineer and his value to the U S military was the knowledge he had gained while overseeing vast underground building projects for the Reich A memo in Rickhey s dossier written by the army s Office of the Deputy Director of Intelligence kept his most powerful negotiating secret a secret He was in charge of all tunnel operations directly under Hitler s headquarters in Berlin Georg Rickhey had overseen the building of the Führerbunker where Hitler lived the last three months and two weeks of his life With its more than thirty rooms cryptlike corridors multiple emergency exits and hundreds of stairs all located more than thirty feet under Berlin the Führerbunker was considered an engineering tour de force The army was impressed by how well Hitler s Führerbunker had withstood years of heavy Allied bombing and was interested in learning from Georg Rickhey how to build similar underground command centers of its own As the Cold War progressed the U S Army would begin the secret construction of such facilities notably ones that could continue to function in the aftermath of a chemical biological

underground command centers had been secretly built for this purpose including one in the Catoctin Mountains called Raven Rock Mountain Complex or Site R and another in the Blue Ridge Mountains called Mount Weather Georg Rickhey s expertise in underground engineering was not limited to the construction of the Führerbunker During the war he had also served as a director of the Reich s Demag motorcar company where he oversaw the construction of a massive underground facility where tanks had been assembled And as general manager of the Mittelwerk he oversaw the construction of the rocket assembly facility near Nordhausen In his army intelligence dossier it was noted that Rickhey had overseen the underground construction of more than 1 500 000 square feet of space At Wright Field Rickhey was meant to start consulting with American engineers on underground engineering projects for the army But that work was slow and Rickhey was given a second job Despite poor English skills Rickhey was put in charge of examining V 2 documents captured at Nordhausen and in his words the rendering of opinions on reports In the late summer of 1946 Albert Patin and Georg Rickhey started running a black market operation at the Hilltop selling booze and cigarettes to their colleagues at premium prices Rickhey had years of experience in wartime black market operations Military intelligence would later learn that during the war what little rations the slave laborers were allotted by the Speer ministry Rickhey would sometimes sell off at a price At Wright Field Rickhey and Patin s black market business quickly expanded and the men enlisted outside assistance from Rickhey s sister Adelheid Rickhey who was living in a hotel in New Jersey at the time Adelheid Rickhey agreed to move to Ohio to help the men expand their black market business into Dayton and beyond Because the Germans mail was monitored it did not take long for the higher ups at Wright Field to learn what was going on but the

The two men regularly hosted parties at the Hilltop staying up late drinking and playing cards One night in the fall of 1946 a sixty three year old German aircraft engineer named Hermann Nehlsen decided he had had enough It was a little after midnight during the second week of October when Rickhey Albert Patin and a third man were playing cards The noise woke up Hermann Nehlsen who knocked on the door and told the three cardplayers to quiet down After Nehlsen s second request was ignored he opened the door walked into the room and turned off the lamp on the card table Rickhey by Nehlsen s account was drunk As Nehlsen was leaving Rickhey lit a candle and laughed at his German colleague A man could still play cards with a good kosher candle Rickhey joked The incident was a tipping point for Hermann Nehlsen and he went to Colonel Putt to file a formal complaint against the two men There was more to the story Nehlsen told Colonel Putt Rickhey was a war criminal He had been the primary person behind a mass hanging at Nordhausen the hanging by crane of a dozen prisoners and had bragged about it on the ship ride coming over to the United States As for Albert Patin Hermann Nehlsen told Colonel Putt he was an ardent Nazi as well a member of the SA Patin s companies used slave laborers from concentration camps What Hermann Nehlsen did not know was that Colonel Putt was not interested in the past histories of the German scientists in the Army Air Forces employ Or that Putt had a gentleman s agreement with Albert Patin and had been using him to keep an eye on the other Germans at the Hilltop Colonel Putt said he would look into the allegations Instead Putt had Nehlsen watched for future security violations Hermann Nehlsen remained angry about the incident and wrote so in a

Washington D C where it was read by Colonel Millard Lewis Executive Assistant Chief of Air Staff 2 The allegations were serious Colonel Lewis decided They involved alleged war crimes Lewis sent a memorandum to the director of intelligence for the War Department General Staff summarizing the situation and advising that an investigating officer be assigned to look into the matter Mr Nehlsen stated that Dr Georg Rickhey age 47 specialist in the field of engineering and production of guided missiles was employed in the underground plant at Nordhausen as a strong Nazi Party member where in 1944 twelve foreign workers were strung up on a cross beam and raised by a crane in the presence of the group of workers and killed read Colonel Lewis s memorandum One of the group who acted as an observer asserted that Dr Rickhey was the chief instigator for the execution The Pentagon assigned an Air Corps Major named Eugene Smith to look into the Georg Rickhey case Back at Wright Field Colonel Putt likely believed that the allegations against Rickhey had fallen by the wayside Meanwhile Hermann Nehlsen had been banished to Mitchel Field In January 1947 Putt recommended that Rickhey be given a long term military contract for employment at Wright Field That request was authorized and on April 12 1947 Georg Rickhey signed a new five year contract with the War Department Separately and without Putt s knowledge the Rickhey investigation was moving forward At Army Air Forces Headquarters in Washington Major Eugene Smith made preparations to travel to various military bases for interviews It was Smith s job to talk to Rickhey s former colleagues from Nordhausen to write up his findings and to file a report Colonel Putt did not learn about this investigation until Major Smith arrived at Wright Field Putt suggested Major Smith discuss Rickhey s case with Captain Albert Abels the officer in charge of the Paperclip scientists at the Hilltop so that Abels could clear things up

He headed to Mitchel Field to interview Hermann Nehlsen and other German scientists who might have knowledge regarding the Rickhey case Hermann Nehlsen stood by his original story In 1944 twelve foreign workers were simultaneously hanged by being strung up on a cross beam and raised by a crane in the presence of the workers Nehlsen swore in an affidavit Dr Rickhey was the chief instigator for the execution meaning it was Rickhey s idea to hang the men A second witness emerged at Mitchel Field a former engineer on the Nordhausen rocket assembly lines named Werner Voss Voss also testified that Rickhey was involved in the hangings and he provided important new details that added context to the executions Shortly before the hangings Voss said British airplanes had dropped leaflets urging the Nordhausen slave laborers to revolt A group of them did revolt and those men were among the ones hanged The execution was a public event Voss said meant to intimidate other slave workers into subservience These were serious allegations of war crimes Major Smith needed corroboration and for that he headed to Fort Bliss Texas Smith had been told by the army that he would be able interview Wernher von Braun as well as some of the other men who had worked closely with Georg Rickhey inside the Nordhausen tunnels At Fort Bliss in the evenings the German rocket specialists gathered in a clubhouse built in a grove of cottonwood trees There they played cards while drinking American cocktails and beer They strung hammocks between the trees and enjoyed balmy desert nights Once a month most of the Germans went into El Paso as a group to shop and have a restaurant meal The nightmarish environment at Nordhausen which the majority of the rocket engineers had participated in must have seemed like another world until Major Smith arrived to take official depositions for the U S Army and ask the men to recollect what those days had been like Major Smith s first interviews would be with Wernher von Braun and his brother Magnus von Braun But after Major Smith arrived at Fort Bliss he was told that both von Braun brothers were out of town Smith interviewed Günther Haukohl instead

that he had no clear memories about what happened in the tunnels in the last months of the war but yes prisoners were abused Rickhey s involvement is probably a rumor Haukohl said V 2 engineers Hans Palaoro and Rudolph Schlidt seconded Haukohl s position repeating the idea that the end of the war was nothing but a blur Engineer Erich Ball who also worked on the rocket assembly lines at Nordhausen told Major Smith that he had witnessed two sets of prisoner hangings in the tunnels but that Georg Rickhey had not been involved in either of them Major Smith accepted that the men might not be able to remember details about what had gone on but surely as engineers they could remember the layout of the facility Smith asked Haukohl Schlidt Palaoro and Ball to use their engineers precision and help him create an accurate illustration of the work spaces inside the Nordhausen tunnels including where the rockets were assembled and where the hangings occurred This was an important artifact for the investigation Next Major Smith interviewed the former Mittelwerk operations director Arthur Rudolph Like Georg Rickhey Arthur Rudolph had authority over the Mittelwerk s Prison Labor Supply office which was the unit responsible for getting food rations to the slave laborers In his interview Arthur Rudolph first denied ever seeing prisoners abused Major Smith showed Arthur Rudolph the illustration that had been drawn by Rudolph s Nordhausen colleagues Haukohl Schlidt Palaoro and Ball Major Smith pointed out to Arthur Rudolph that Rudolph s office was directly adjacent to where the twelve so called political prisoners had been hanged from the crane As Arthur Rudolph continued to deny ever seeing prisoners abused Smith found his testimony increasingly suspicious Everyone else interviewed admitted to having seen some prisoner abuse Rudolph was adamant I did not see them punished beaten hung or shot he told Major Smith Smith approached the question in a different manner He asked Rudolph if he could recall anything about the twelve men who had been hanged from the crane This public execution Smith said had been confirmed by many of Rudolph s colleagues and Smith was

Smith wrote He did not wish to become involved in any investigations that might involve him in any way with illegal actions in the underground factory and as a result was cautious of his answers Smith returned to Washington and advised U S Army Air Forces Headquarters of his findings In Germany a serendipitous incident occurred at this same time William Aalmans the Dutch citizen who had been working on the U S War Crimes Investigation Team had been hunting down SS officers from Dora Nordhausen for an upcoming regional war crimes trial Aalmans had managed to locate only eleven out of three thousand SS officers who had run the concentration camp Aalmans was the man who had interviewed many of the newly liberated prisoners back in April 1945 and he was also the individual who had found the Mittelwerk employee telephone list tacked to the tunnel wall The two names at the top of that list were Georg Rickhey and Arthur Rudolph Aalmans had no idea that both men had been recruited into Operation Paperclip In Germany no one Aalmans interviewed claimed to know the whereabouts of either man Then one afternoon in May 1947 Aalmans was taking a break from his Nazi hunting work reading the Stars and Stripes newspaper in the sunshine when as he told journalist Tom Bower decades later I just saw a tiny headline German Scientist Applies for American Citizenship The name mentioned was Georg Rickhey Aalmans explained I screamed for joy and rushed into the head office shouting We ve found him Within three days the Georg Rickhey matter had been escalated to the attention of the Joint Chiefs of Staff On May 19 1947 an arrest warrant was issued for Georg Rickhey on orders from the War Crimes Branch Civil Affairs Division in Washington Georg Rickhey is wanted as a principal perpetrator in

Nordhausen Concentration camp case The War Department s Intelligence Division assigned the chief of security at Wright Field Major George P Miller the role of escorting Rickhey back to Germany Rickhey s five year contract was terminated He was instead going to be a defendant in the Dora Nordhausen war crimes trial On June 2 1947 JIOA deputy director Bosquet N Wev wrote to J Edgar Hoover the powerful director of the FBI alerting him of the situation and sending along Rickhey s classified dossier If the public learned that an Operation Paperclip scientist had been returned to Germany to stand trial for war crimes the JIOA the Army the War Department and the FBI would all have a lot of explaining to do It was in everyone s interest to keep the Georg Rickhey fiasco under wraps On August 7 1947 Georg Rickhey appeared as one of nineteen defendants in the Dora Nordhausen trial The Nazis were charged with the deaths of at least twenty thousand laborers who were beaten tortured starved hanged or worked to death while being forced to build V 2 rockets The trial which took place inside a former SS barracks adjacent to the Dachau concentration camp lasted four months and three weeks The prosecution requested that Wernher von Braun be allowed to testify at the trial but the army said it was too much of a security risk to allow von Braun to travel to Germany The Russians could kidnap him the U S Army said They did not say that von Braun had recently traveled to Germany to marry his cousin and bring her back to Texas with him At the end of the trial fifteen of the

the Nordhausen tunnel complex to get out to the public The trial record would call attention to the backgrounds of the 115 rocket scientists at Fort Bliss The future of the United States missile program was too important The Russians had their rocket scientists and America needed hers too Shortly after Rickhey was acquitted back in Washington D C the office of the secretary of the air force received a call from the State Department The official identified himself as Henry Cox The air force captain who took Cox s call wrote up a memo of what was said After exchanged pleasantries Cox inquired if we had ever returned a specialist to Europe for trial I thought a moment and realizing that the Rickhey case was in the public domain and in all probability facts known to the State Department since his sister made inquiries I did not dare deny the story I therefore told Mr Cox that one Air Force case had been returned to Europe under suspicion that my recollection was he was cleared that in any event we did not desire to take further chances on the case and that he had not been returned to the United States The State Department appeared to have bought the story Rickhey was gone but there was no shortage of Nazis coming to Wright Field to work On August 22 1947 one of the Reich s top ten pilots Siegfried Knemeyer arrived This was the daring pilot and engineer whom

of his deceitful nature While holding Dornberger for war crimes British intelligence had eavesdropped on him and recorded what he said When the Americans listened to these secret audio recordings they

momentum with America s scientific elite On February 1 1947 the Federation of American Scientists FAS met in New York City to ask President Truman to put an end to it The American scientists saw the Nazi scientist program as a drastic step in the search for military power When it was learned that some of the one thousand additional German scientists on the Paperclip recruiting list were being hired for short term military work followed by longer term positions at American universities many were outraged Certainly not wishing to jeopardize the legitimate needs of the national defense and

said Albert Einstein was the most esteemed figure to publicly denounce Operation Paperclip In an impassioned letter written on behalf of his FAS colleagues Einstein appealed directly to President Truman We hold these individuals to be potentially dangerous Their former eminence as Nazi Party members and supporters raises the issue of their fitness to become American citizens and hold key positions in American industrial scientific and educational institutions Another important figure among the opposition was the nuclear physicist Hans Bethe Bethe had fled Nazi Germany in 1933 and had worked on the Manhattan Project during the war In the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Bethe and Dr Henri Sack a colleague from Cornell University posed a series of simple questions about Operation Paperclip Was it wise or even compatible with our moral standards to make this bargain in light of the fact that many of the Germans probably the majority were die hard Nazis Bethe and Sack asked Did the fact that the Germans might save the nation millions of dollars imply that permanent residence and citizenship could be bought Could the United States count on the German scientists to work for peace when their indoctrinated hatred against the Russians might contribute to increase the divergency between the great powers Had the war been fought to allow Nazi ideology to creep into our educational and scientific institutions by the back door Their final question struck at the dark heart of the Nazi scientist program Do we want science at any price The condemnation of Operation Paperclip by these leading American scientists and others had a ripple effect on the general public Reporters began searching for leads about individual German scientists wartime activities but this proved an almost impossible effort given the program s classified nature Frustrated by the lack of information some Americans sent threatening letters addressed to the German scientists at Wright Field and Fort Bliss The army tightened security and surveillance In Washington D C the War Department was rightly concerned that intense opposition and bad publicity had put the entire program in jeopardy of collapse and in the winter of 1947 the War Department forbade the further release of information about the program Despite the precautions two individuals from the program at Fort Bliss were exposed by an angry public as real Nazis Mr and Mrs Herbert Axster Herbert Axster a former lieutenant colonel in the Wehrmacht had been a Nazi Party member since 1940 He was not a scientist but

stating that a few ardent Nazis may have slipped into the program based on unavailability of records immediately after the war CHAPTER FOURTEEN Strange Judgment The doctors trial was the first of twelve subsequent war crimes trials at Nuremberg wherein the U S government prosecuted individuals in specific professions including industrialists lawyers and generals who had served the Third Reich The first trial called the trial of the major war criminals was prosecuted by the four Allied powers When it ended in October 1946 tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States had escalated to the degree that cooperation between the two nations was no longer possible The subsequent twelve trials took place at the Palace of Justice as the others had but with only American judges and prosecutors The twenty three defendants in the doctors trial were charged with murder torture conspiracy and atrocity in the name of medical science Mere punishment of the defendants said Brigadier General Telford Taylor in his opening statement can never redress the terrible injuries which the Nazis visited on these unfortunate peoples But General Taylor reminded the tribunal and the world that

the United States and as the voice of humanity stamps these acts and the ideas which engendered them as barbarous and criminal Dr Leopold Alexander the Viennese born American psychiatrist who had first learned of the Luftwaffe freezing experiments helped General Taylor write his opening speech Dr Alexander s official title was expert consultant to the secretary of war but in layman s terms he was the most influential person involved in the doctors trial after Telford Taylor Dr Alexander worked tirelessly to supply information and answers for the prosecution team as they prepared to go to trial He conducted hundreds of hours of pretrial interrogations with the defendants and interviewed scores of witnesses and victims He was able to converse in both German and English and he took extensive notes in both languages Throughout the trial Dr Alexander delivered presentations of evidence and cross examined witnesses When the trial was over he would be given credit for writing the Nuremberg Code Of the twenty three defendants no one outside a small group of American medical military elite had any idea that four of the accused had already worked for the U S Army under Paperclip This fact would remain secret for forty years Neither Siegfried Ruff nor Konrad Schäfer Hermann Becker Freyseng nor Oskar Schröder mentioned this damning fact during the trial Siegfried Ruff was one of the few physicians who admitted he d overseen the medical murders at Dachau but said he did not perform any of the experiments himself In his defense he said he didn t believe that what he did was wrong It was understood that concentration camp inmates who had been condemned to death would be used in the experiments and as compensation they were to have their sentences commuted to life in prison Ruff told the judges Personally I would not consider these experiments as immoral especially in war time This line of defense that extraordinary times called for extraordinary measures was also used by Schröder and Becker Freyseng The strange case of Konrad Schäfer played a unique role in Operation Paperclip Having invented the Schäfer process to separate salt from seawater Schäfer was

drew up the letter which was sent to Himmler requesting more prisoners to conduct experiments on But Schäfer said he never actually went to Dachau and no evidence placing him there survived the war As for eyewitness testimony all but one of the saltwater experiment victims had been killed The sole survivor Karl Höllenrainer was located by Dr Alexander and put on the witness stand Höllenrainer did not recognize Konrad Schäfer but he recognized one of his codefendants in the dock Höllenrainer s testimony proved to be one of the most dramatic events in the doctors trial It was June 27 1947 and Karl Höllenrainer stood trembling in the hushed courtroom Small in stature dark haired and nervous he was a broken man Now witness asked U S Prosecutor Alexander G Hardy for what reason were you arrested by the Gestapo on May 29 1944 Because I am a Gypsy of mixed blood Höllenrainer said Höllenrainer s crime was that he had fallen in love with and married a German girl a violation of the infamous Nuremberg law that prohibited a non Aryan from marrying or having sexual relations with a German citizen After being arrested Höllenrainer was sent to three different concentration camps first Auschwitz then Buchenwald and finally Dachau where he was selected to take part in the seawater experiments being performed by Luftwaffe At Dachau Höllenrainer was deprived of food forced to drink chemically processed seawater and then monitored for signs of liver failure and madness One experiment among the many stood out in his memory Without using anesthesia a Luftwaffe doctor had removed a piece of Karl Höllenrainer s liver in order to analyze it Now from the witness stand Höllenrainer was asked to identify the Nazi doctor who d performed this liver puncture on him Do you think you would be able to recognize that doctor if you saw him today Prosecutor Hardy asked Yes said Höllenrainer I would recognize him at once Höllenrainer stared across the courtroom his eyes

waited tensely recalls Vivien Spitz a young American court reporter whose job it was to take down the testimony Spitz sat in front of the judges within clear view of the witnesses and defendants Höllenrainer was a little man and I watched him stand up she explains The prosecutor asked Höllenrainer to proceed to the defendants dock to identify the doctor who d removed a piece of his liver without anesthesia He paused for just a moment Vivien Spitz remembers with his eyes seeming to be fixed on a doctor in the second row of the prisoners dock Then in a flash he was gone from the witness stand Karl Höllenrainer sprang into action To Vivien Spitz s eye Höllenrainer seemed to leap over the German defense counsels tables and appeared to be almost flying through the air toward the prisoners dock In his right hand stretched up high in the air Karl Höllenrainer clutched a dagger Vivien Spitz recalls He was reaching for Dr Beiglböck the consulting physician to the German Air Force There was shock in the courtroom Confusion and mayhem The Nazis defense attorneys scrambled to get out of Höllenrainer s way Three American military police rushed forward and grabbed Höllenrainer Vivien Spitz remembers how security subdued Karl Höllenrainer just before he reached Beiglböck preventing him from delivering his own brand of justice It took minutes for order to be restored in the courtroom The military police set Karl Höllenrainer before Presiding Judge Walter Beals who was furious Seventy years old overworked and in failing health Judge Beals clung to the idea that his primary role at Nuremberg was to educate the German people in the ways of American democracy and due process Witness thundered the judge You were summoned before this Tribunal as a witness to give

days Why not one or two days just to make a point After all the torture the witness had suffered it seemed to me to be an outrageous elevation of process over substance Karl Höllenrainer was removed

remembered it Beiglböck was caught cheating and had to leave the school He does not recognize me Dr Alexander told his wife but I regularly recognize him Two men whose professional lives had begun so similarly had taken such radically diffent paths There was another dramatic turning point in the doctors trial and that involved the case of Dr Kurt Blome Blome was admittedly the director of biological weapons research for the Reich which was not in itself a crime But there were scores of documents in which Blome discussed the need to conduct experiments on human beings so as to further plague research at the Bacteriological Institute in Posen where he was in charge Blome s defense some of which he argued himself was that he intended to experiment on humans but that he never actually performed the experiments Intent said Blome was not a crime The prosecution had been unable to find any witnesses to testify against Blome and Blome used this fact in his defense There was the testimony of Major General Walter Schreiber against Blome from the first Nuremberg trial but the Soviets had refused to let Dr Alexander interview Dr Schreiber himself so the veracity of his testimony was never independently verified The prosecution presented many documents in which Blome discussed with Himmler his plans to experiment on humans But there were no documents showing Blome s actual guilt There was another element of Blome s defense that the prosecution was completely unprepared for and that was Dr Blome s wife Bettina a physician and bestselling author Frau Blome meticulously researched experiments that were conducted by the U S Office of Scientific Research and Development OSRD during the war This included malaria experiments on Terre Haute federal prison inmates She also

1945 that described how OSRD conducted experiments on eight hundred U S prisoners during the war Servatius read the entire article word for word in the courtroom None of the American judges was familiar with the article nor were most members of the prosecution and its presentation in court clearly caught the Americans off guard Because the article specifically discussed U S Army wartime experiments on prisoners it was incredibly damaging for the prosecution Prison life is ideal for controlled laboratory work with humans Servatius read quoting American doctors who had been interviewed by Life reporters The idea that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures and that both nations had used human test subjects during war was unsettling It pushed the core Nazi concept of the Untermenschen to the side The Nuremberg prosecutors were left looking like hypocrites On August 6 1947 the verdicts were read Seven defendants were given death sentences and nine were given prison sentences of between ten years and life including Beiglböck fifteen years Becker Freyseng twenty years and Schröder life Seven Nazi doctors were acquitted including Blome Schäfer Ruff and Weltz Of Blome s acquittal the Nuremberg judges noted It may well be that defendant Blome was preparing to experiment on human beings in connection with bacteriological warfare but the record fails to disclose

done a great deal for Germany He Strughold said that prior to Nazism the Jews had crowded the medical schools and it had been nearly impossible for others to enroll To counterbalance this derogatory depiction of Strughold Dr Konrad Schäfer was asked to write a letter of recommendation for his former boss In a sworn statement written just a few weeks after Schäfer was acquitted at Nuremberg Schäfer praised Dr Strughold for his ethical principles while conducting research work I also know that he strictly refused to take part in or permit scientific research work which was damaging to human health Schäfer wrote The following year Dr Konrad Schäfer would be on a boat headed for America an Operation Paperclip contract in hand As for Dr Blome he was seen as a highly desirable recruit for Operation Paperclip Blome allegedly knew more about bubonic plague research than anyone else in the world But given his former position in Hitler s inner circle coupled with the fact that Blome had worn the Golden Party Badge bringing him to America as part of Operation Paperclip remained too difficult for the U S Army to justify But as the Cold War gained momentum and intense suspicion of the Soviets increased even someone like Kurt Blome would eventually be deemed eligible for Operation Paperclip PART IV Only the commander understands the importance of certain things and he alone

scientists who had come to America in this time frame had nearly doubled from 175 in March 1946 to 344 in February 1947 but none of these scientists had been granted visas yet JIOA officials perceived

individuals concerned Klaus told Ford that he would not sign a document that was essentially a blanket waiver of anything that he would have to see the list of scientists first Ford told Klaus that

Department he would give the information to several senators who would take care of the Department Klaus wrote of Ford s threat Colonel Ford accused him of standing in the way of national interest

Operation Paperclip spearheaded by the Federation of American Scientists and given further momentum by the American Jewish Congress s having identified the Axsters of Fort Bliss as real Nazis the War

assigned to the case Captain F C Groves explained what happened next On April 5 1942 he Craemer was dragged before a Sondergericht a special Nazi court and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment Groves s lengthy summary and analysis of the incident was sent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff Debus s deliberate and vicious denunciation of Craemer was not something army intelligence could disavow wrote Groves It was a matter of public record in Germany An OMGUS report put von Braun on equally shaky footing and army intelligence cautioned that given his international profile pushing the State Department for a visa for von Braun could cause problems The report revealed that not only had von Braun been an SS officer with the high rank of SS Sturmbannführer or SS Major but his membership had been sponsored

was outnumbered The same month that the standoff between the State Department and the JIOA began the Chemical Corps finally imported its first German scientist an expert in tabun nerve agent synthesis named Dr Friedrich Fritz Hoffmann The U S Army had been interested in stockpiling tabun ever since it obtained its first sample from the Robbers Lair in the British zone in Germany in May of 1945 The man in charge of the tabun nerve agent program for the Chemical Corps was Colonel Charles E Loucks commander of the Army Chemical Center at Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland The fifty one year old Colonel Loucks had dedicated his life to chemical warfare Born and raised in California Charles E Loucks received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University and first became fascinated by war gas while serving in World War I During his assignment with the first Gas Regiment at Edgewood Arsenal in 1922 his life s path seemed to have been set While Loucks distinguished himself as an expert rifleman competing in National Rifle and Pistol matches and winning awards chemical weapons fascinated him the most He went back to school to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study chemical engineering and in 1929 he received a Master of Science degree By 1935 Loucks was the technical director of Chemical Warfare Service Research and Development at Edgewood He had served as an officer with chemical weapons ever since Major Loucks spent the first year of World War II refining the U S military s standard issue gas mask He even worked with Walt Disney and the Sun Rubber

commander of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal outside Denver Colorado where he was in charge of planning building and operating the largest capacity toxic manufacturing plant in the United States Rocky Mountain produced mustard gas and incendiary bombs on an industrial scale incendiary bombs that were dropped on Germany and Japan Loucks was awarded the Legion of Merit for his war service During the war the U S Army had more than four hundred battalions ready for chemical combat If chemical warfare broke out the army expected it would involve mustard gas Sixty thousand soldiers trained in chemical warfare were sent into battle with gas masks and protective suits carrying a small card that explained what to do in the event of a chemical attack Fortunately World War II ended without the use of chemical weapons but experts like Charles Loucks were caught off guard when they learned just how outperformed America s chemists had been by Hitler s With the discovery that the Nazis had mass produced previously unknown agents like tabun and sarin gas came the realization that if Germany had initiated chemical warfare it would have been a grossly uneven match Since war s end the army s Chemical Corps had received 530 tons of tabun courtesy of the British who had seized the Reich s colossal cache from the Robbers Lair But the Chemical Corps had yet to produce much tabun on its own which is why Dr Fritz Hoffmann had been brought to America under Operation Paperclip Hoffmann arrived in February 1947 and immediately got to work synthesizing tabun Nerve agents were Hoffmann s area

explained that Hoffmann s father in law the German economist Dr Erwin Respondek had risked life and limb to work as a spy for the Americans during the war Respondek rendered extremely valuable services to the Allied war effort wrote Consul General Woods These services which are known to the former Secretary of State the Honorable Cordell Hull were rendered at great personal risk to himself and family were performed without compensation and were so valuable to our cause that every courtesy and help should be accorded to all members of the family including Respondek s son in law Fritz Hoffmann the affidavit read After being interrogated by army intelligence in Germany Hoffmann was found fit for exploitation for the Office of the Military Government United States He was sent to the Army Chemical Center in Berlin where he started working for the Chemical Warfare Service until his Operation Paperclip contract was finalized When Friedrich Hoffmann arrived at Edgewood Arsenal in February 1947 America s premier chemical weapons research and development facility had been producing war gases for thirty years The three thousand acre peninsula thick with field and forest was located twenty miles northeast of Baltimore Maryland on the Chesapeake Bay Because Fritz Hoffmann was the first German at Edgewood thus far he was quartered inside a barracks with American soldiers The Top Secret research and development division he had been assigned to was called the Technical Command and it was there that he began work synthesizing new insecticides rodenticides and miticides

called Operation Osoaviakhim the Soviets captured German chemist Dr von Bock and members of his team The group was taken to Chemical Works No 91 where von Bock an expert in air filtration systems decontamination systems and hermetically sealed production compartments was put to work Von Bock s esoteric knowledge gave the Soviets access to critical technical aspects of producing tabun The hope was that Fritz Hoffmann could bring the Americans up to speed at Edgewood Indeed Fritz Hoffmann proved to be a great asset for the classified program Within months of his arrival at Edgewood he was delivering work of a high order and had shown considerable ingenuity and excellent knowledge according to a declassified internal review of his performance Tabun work progressed When military intelligence learned that the Soviets Chemical Works No 91 was also producing sarin Edgewood was told to continue working on tabun but also to redouble efforts in sarin production with a plan to start producing it on an industrial scale as soon as possible Project AI 13 was given even higher priority and a new code name Project AI 13 2 1 In Germany Nazi scientists with knowledge of tabun and sarin were now being even more aggressively sought for recruitment into Operation Paperclip Declassified documents reveal that the Chemical Corps wanted to employ Otto Ambros but he was not available Ambros

available It had been a little over four months since the New York Times had broken the story of Operation Paperclip and the negative attention to the program had not subsided Then on March 9 1947 journalist Drew Pearson reported the most outrageous news story about Operation Paperclip to date According to Pearson the U S Army had offered Farben executive Karl Krauch a Paperclip contract while he was incarcerated at Nuremberg Krauch was the lead defendant in the upcoming war crimes trial He had served as Göring s plenipotentiary for chemical production and had advocated for the use of nerve agents against the Allies Krauch was the man who galvanized his fellow German industrialists to mobilize resources to help the Nazis go to war Drew Pearson s column Washington Merry Go Round was widely read and highly influential and the report about Krauch caused such a scandal that General Eisenhower the U S Army chief of staff demanded to know what was going on with Operation Paperclip The man who briefed Eisenhower was chief of military intelligence Stephen J Chamberlin After what was reported to be a twenty minute meeting General Eisenhower remained in support of the Paperclip program For the military chiefs inside the JIOA the problems with the public s perception of Paperclip were almost universally blamed on the State Department Dean Rusk who worked in the office of the assistant secretary of war summed up JIOA s attitude toward the State Department in a memorandum the day after the Eisenhower briefing The public relations people are feeling mounting pressure on the German scientist business Our position is inherently weak because the State Department finds this whole program difficult to support The JIOA decided it was time to get rid of Samuel Klaus Director Thomas Ford wrote General Stephen Chamberlin saying that Klaus was obnoxiously difficult and needed to be removed Within the week Klaus was transferred from the visa section of the State Department to the Office of the Legal Adviser He no longer had any say over the policies and procedures regarding Operation Paperclip It remains a mystery if Klaus had anything to do with the public s perception of

But even with Klaus banished from the program for the first time since Paperclip s inception in the spring of 1945 the entire operation was now in danger of collapse Assistant Secretary of War Howard Petersen worried with colleagues that the War Department would be buried in scandals involving Nazi scientists Petersen predicted that the whole program would be shut down in a matter of months Instead the opposite happened With the signing of the National Security Act by President Truman on July 26 1947 America s armed services and intelligence agencies were restructured The War Department was reconstituted into the Department of Defense the State War Navy Coordinating Committee became the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency was born A new age was dawning for the controversial Paperclip program On the one hand it struggled to hold up a false face of scientific prowess behind which lay a tawdry group of amoral war opportunists many of whom were linked to war crimes But just as von Braun admitted to New Yorker writer Daniel Lang that what he really cared most about was seeing how the golden cow could be milked most successfully the newly created CIA saw the Paperclip scientists in similar quid pro quo terms There was advantage to be had in using men who had everything to lose and were at the same time uniquely focused on personal gain In Operation Paperclip the CIA found a perfect partner in its quest for scientific intelligence And it was in the CIA that Operation Paperclip found its strongest supporting partner yet Sometime in the spring of 1947 scientists at Edgewood Arsenal began conducting human experiments with tabun nerve agent All soldiers used in these experiments were so called volunteers but the men were not made privy to the fact that they were being subjected to low level concentrations of tabun Some of the tests took place in Utah at the Dugway Proving Ground Other tests took place inside Edgewood s gassing chamber for human tests a 9 x 9 foot tile and brick cube with an airtight metal door One of the people observing the tabun tests was Dr L Wilson Greene technical director of the Chemical and

in height he made up for in vision While observing the behavior of the soldiers in the tabun gas experiments L Wilson Greene had a revelation Greene noticed that after soldiers were put in the gassing chamber they became partially disabled for from one to three weeks with fatigue lassitude complete loss of initiative and interest and apathy What struck Greene most was that the men were wholly incapacitated for a period of time but not permanently injured The men recovered entirely on their own the antidote was time Dr L Wilson Greene saw in this a new kind of warfare He sat down and began outlining his idea for America s war fighting future in an opus that would become known as Psychochemical Warfare A New Concept of War In the monograph Greene wrote The trend of each major conflict being characterized by increased death human misery and property destruction could be reversed His seminal vision for psychochemical warfare a term he coined was to incapacitate a man with drugs on the battlefield but not to kill him Greene believed that in this way the face of warfare could change from barbaric to human Incapacitating agents were gentle weapons they knocked a man out without permanent injury With psychochemical warfare Greene explained America could conquer its enemies without the wholesale killing of people or the mass destruction of property Greene was not proposing to use low levels of tabun gas on the battlefield He was talking about using other kinds of incapacitating agents drugs that could immobilize or temporarily paralyze a person hallucinogenic or psychotomimetic drugs whose effects mimic insanity or psychosis There can be no doubt that their will to resist would be weakened greatly if not entirely destroyed by the mass hysteria and panic which would ensue Greene explained Greene proposed that an immediate search be made for a stable chemical compound which would cause mental abnormalities of military significance He sought drugs that made people irrational In his monograph Greene provided the army with a list of 61 materials known to cause mental disorders These sixty one compounds he said should be studied and refined to determine which single compound would be the best possible incapacitating agents for U S military use Greene requested a budget of fifty thousand dollars roughly half a million dollars in 2013 which was granted

multitude of toxins for potential military use Fritz Hoffmann was by now recognized at Edgewood as one of the most gifted organic chemists in the Chemical Corps If anyone could find and prepare the ideal incapacitating agent for the battlefield Hoffmann could He began a broad spectrum of research on everything from well known street drugs to highly obscure toxins from the third world There was mescaline obtained from the peyote cactus and used by Native American Indians with side effects ranging from divination to boredom He studied fly agaric a hallucinogenic mushroom found on the barren slopes of Mongolia and rumored to facilitate contact with the spirit world and piruri a toxic vegetable leaf from Australia used by Aborigines that was found to suppress thirst Yaxee and epena from Venezuela Colombia and Brazil caused people to see things that weren t really there It was a drug that for centuries had been used by primitive tribes to escape the realities of their plight by using hallucinogenic properties Soon Hoffmann would travel the world in search of these incapacitating agents on behalf of the Chemical Corps Dr Greene s idea of psychochemical warfare would have a profound effect on the future of the U S Army s Chemical Corps but it would also greatly affect the direction of the newest civilian intelligence organization in Washington the CIA The Agency had deep pockets and big ideas For the CIA using drugs to incapacitate individuals had many more applications than just on the battlefield and the Agency began developing programs of its own Fritz Hoffmann and L Wilson Greene were at the locus of a growing partnership being forged between the Chemical Corps and the CIA Soon biological warfare experts from Camp Detrick would also be brought into the fold This particular biological weapons program which would be run by a group called Special Operations Division or SO Division was fueled by Operation Paperclip and would develop into one of the most controversial and collaborative efforts in the history of the CIA It had been a year and a half since the Merck Report on the biological weapons threat had been released and an influx of congressional funding had transformed Camp Detrick into a state of the art bioweapons research and development facility The army purchased 545 acres of land adjacent to what had been called Area A and created a new

to what had been called Area A and created a new area designated Area B where some of Detrick s first postwar field tests with crop dusters and spray hoses would occur During the war dangerous pathogens like anthrax and X had been tested and cultured inside Detrick s germ lab a rudimentary wooden building covered in black tarpaper and nicknamed the Black Maria by scientists During the war an industrial size boiler used for fermenting sat on the lawn outside the germ lab Now given the scope of work planned for the immediate future Detrick needed an aerosol chamber that was bigger and better than anything else like it in the world The job of designing such a structure was assigned to a bacteriologist named Dr Harold Batchelor Detrick s British counterparts at Porton Down had an excellent chamber of their own but it fit only two or three mice What Batchelor came up with was a monstrous spherical one million liter chamber called the Eight Ball shaped like a giant s golf ball and held upright by iron legs The Chicago Bridge and Iron Works was commissioned to build the Eight Ball to specifications that made it airtight and bombproof The Eight Ball was to have portholes doors and hatchways and steel walls of one and a half inches Inside the Eight Ball airflow would simulate weather systems with scientists on the outside controlling temperatures on the inside within a range of 55 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit Humidity could be controlled inside the Eight Ball to fluctuate between 30 and 100 percent This state of the art environmental control would allow Detrick s scientists to understand how aerosolized biological agents would work at different altitudes in the open air The sphere would weigh more than 131 tons and would stand four stories tall A catwalk around its center would allow scientists to observe through portholes the test subjects sitting inside as they were exposed to the world s deadliest germs The Chicago Bridge and Iron Works agreed to a delivery date of 1949 With the chamber s design complete Dr Batchelor prepared to travel to Germany There was an important German scientist who was just now becoming available for an interview This

scientific friends and this is an opportunity for us to enjoy meeting Dr Blome and to discuss our various problems with him To begin Batchelor asked Would it be possible for Dr Blome to give us an overall picture of the information that he has The nature of the world under discussion Blome spoke in English pausing on occasion for the interpreter to help him with a word In 1943 I received orders from Goering for all the research of Biological Warfare Blome explained all the research for BW would fall under the name Kanserreseach Cancer Research had already started long before that and I was already working all the time but in order to keep this development secret the Reich disguised it Dr Blome laid out the command structure of those involved in biological weapons work under Himmler and

the Reich s outpost on the island of Riems a facility that specialized in Sickness of Cattle research including rinderpest and foot and mouth disease Blome said that because the isle was completely

international fame Blome was referring to the fact that before the war Traub spent several years in America doing research at the Rockefeller Institute in New Jersey Rinderpest was a terrible disease Blome said In many ways it was the biological weapon he feared most Germany depended on milk and butter for 60 of her fat resources said Blome In 1944 it would have resulted in a great catastrophe if

Blome confirmed that Dr Erich Traub went to Turkey on direct orders from Himmler and acquired a strain of the dangerous virus there At Riems Traub then succeeded in producing a dry form of the virus Dry forms were the deadliest of all said Blome After a period of seven months based on experimentation on the Isle this virus was still effective After seven months they still spread and the cattle were all infected Blome then spoke of experimental tests conducted by Luftwaffe pilots in Russia where the disease was sprayed from low flying aircraft over fields of grazing cattle Positive results said Blome Where were Dr Traub and Dr Waldmann now I believe that they have been taken prisoner of the Russians and they are still active in their research for the Russians Blome said The conversation shifted to plague research at Posen where Blome had set up an institute during the war Perhaps we would like to talk about the human angle Dr Phillips asked trying to veil the uncomfortable subject by using the royal we Dr Blome had been acquitted of war crimes charges five weeks earlier Seven of his codefendants were to be hanged Clearly the subject of experiments on humans was not something he was going to discuss The question was rephrased What did Blome believe was the most groundbreaking biological weapons work conducted by the Reich Blome said that at Posen he had been working at dispersing biological agents in a combination with gas that a ffects the throat When membranes are hurt that is damaged bacteria have a better chance to infect Blome said Dr Phillips rephrased his question again Everyone wanted to know about the human experiments it was the ultimate forbidden knowledge the Nazis possessed Perhaps we would like to talk about the human angle which was I think Kliewe s work he said Blome was no fool Professor Kliewe has not worked himself with experiments Blome said Heinrich Kliewe performed intelligence work He was in charge of keeping tabs on the biological weapons programs being pursued by nations at war with the Reich Kliewe investigated Polish and Russian sabotage Blome said The activity here was not to cause an epidemic amongst the population merely to kill certain people The Detrick doctors were intrigued by this line of conversation and asked Dr Blome", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:Operation

asked Dr Blome to explain further During the war Polish resistance fighters in Posen had succeeded in assassinating about twenty people Blome said most of whom were SS officers A lot of cases of Typhoid said Blome The waiters in restaurants took fountain pens filled with the inoculum and injected the inoculum into the soup or the food on their way to and from the dining room This has been proved Polish resistance movement was heading all these activities A German Polish woman doctor was working in the hospital and got hold of the bacteria and forwarded it to the other people Were any preventative measures taken Dr Phillips asked Blome explained that there was an extensive and well funded Reich research program going on in the field of vaccines antidotes and serums against many pathogens and diseases from cholera to parrot virus to plague But Blome explained that the holy grail of biological weapons research was the plague I believe the only thing of danger to Germany would have been the plague Because for propaganda reasons the plague got more attention tha n any others Blome added People all over the world believe it is the worst sickness there is Dr Phillips wanted to learn more about the use of live vaccines in Blome s plague research Schreiber as the head of the department epidemics had very good vaccine material on hand for typhoid paratyphoid cholera diphtheria and Ruhr Blome explained For the plague they had serum on hand but the serum was not very powerful it was very weak They did not have any vaccine so I started to build an institute which has never been completed On occasion Blome said he worked in concert with Schreiber s vaccine research laboratory to provide them with good vaccine material meaning the germs Which laboratories asked Dr Falconer In the Medical Laboratory in Berlin said Blome There was an official appointed only for research of epidemics Prof Schreiber Was he under Kliewe Dr Phillips asked apparently still unaware

and who was telling the truth The time came to have a meal In closing this particular angle we express our gratitude to Dr Blome for his wholehearted cooperation Dr Batchelor said He suggested that they all have dinner together Pleasant talk During that time we will not discuss this matter Batchelor said As if the Americans had not just tried to hang Dr Blome for war crimes As if Blome had not been a hard core Nazi ideologue and member of the inner circle or had not worn the Golden Party Badge Pleasantries were exchanged and the meeting was adjourned After the meeting the Detrick doctors requested from the Army Chemical Corps everything they knew about Dr Erich Traub That Dr Blome said he was most afraid of an outbreak of cattle plague was serious news Traub was the world s leading expert in the disease Now the U S Army wanted him as their own Dr Traub was a virologist microbiologist and professor and a doctor of veterinary medicine He had been the second in command at the Reich s State Research Institute at Riems since 1942 He was also an expert in Newcastle disease a contagious bird flu that he was rumored to have weaponized The Chemical Corps knew Traub spoke fluent English that he had dark brown hair gray brown eyes and two pronounced saber scars on his face on the forehead and upper lip And they knew that from 1932 until 1938 Traub had been a staff member at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New Jersey But after meeting with Dr Blome the Chemical Corps wanted more information on Traub and they tracked down two of his former American colleagues for interviews One of them Dr Little described Traub as a domineering German and a surly type individual with a violent temper Another colleague Dr John Nelson found that despite long

shows little distinction and difference to his treatment of his fellow human beings Before the war Traub was given the opportunity to stay in America and continue his research fulltime He chose to return to Germany citing loyalty to the Reich In 1939 Traub was drafted into the Wehrmacht Veterinary Corps and in 1940 he was elevated to captain and fought in the campaign against France He was a member of several Nazi organizations including the Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrerkorps NSKK or National Socialist Motor Corps the National Socialist People s Welfare NSV and the Reichsluftschutzbund RLB or State Air Protection Corps Dr Traub s talents as a virologist had been identified and he had been pulled back from the front lines and assigned to biological weapons work According to Blome Traub was the most talented scientist working on anti animal research biological weapons designed to kill the animals that a nation relies upon most for food At the end of the war when the Riems lab fell to the Russians with it went Dr Traub his wife Blanka and their three children The laboratory was renamed the Land Office II for Animal Epidemic Diseases and the Soviets put Traub back to work on bioweapons research Now in 1947 the Army began a plan to lure Traub away As for Dr Blome the scientists from Detrick knew it was far too risky to offer him a Paperclip contract just weeks after he d been acquitted of capital war crimes at Nuremberg Drew Pearson s reporting on the Paperclip contract offered to Karl Krauch in prison had upset General Eisenhower and nearly brought the program to its knees While Blome made clear his willingness to work for the Army the Detrick scientists knew he would have to remain an under the radar consultant relegated to the JIOA target list for potential hire at a future date The army bacteriologist and biological weapons expert Dr Harold Batchelor returned to Camp Detrick with many new ideas to explore including assassination by poison techniques that had been shared with him by Dr Blome The Reich had been researching biological weapons that would initiate epidemics but could also kill certain people

scientist for the job of exploring poisons that could be used for individual assassinations Fritz Hoffmann But Hoffmann had a backlog of work He still had to figure out how to synthesize tabun gas so the Chemical Corps could hurry up and begin producing it on an industrial scale CHAPTER SIXTEEN Headless Monster In June 1948 Colonel Charles E Loucks the man who oversaw the Paperclip scientists at Edgewood was made brigadier general and transferred to Heidelberg Loucks now served as chief of intelligence collection for Chemical Warfare Plans European Command In Heidelberg he had access to a whole new group of Hitler s former chemists from those who had been at the top of the chain of command on down Within weeks of his arrival Loucks formed a working relationship with Richard Kuhn the former director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg Because Kuhn had an international profile before and during the war he was a problematic candidate for Operation Paperclip Though Kuhn had once been revered among scientists Samuel Goudsmit of Operation Alsos was never afraid to remind colleagues that Kuhn had become an active Nazi during the war and that he began his lectures with Sieg Heil and the Nazi salute Kuhn had lied to Goudsmit in a postwar interview swearing that he had never worked on Reich projects during the war In fact Kuhn was a chemical weapons expert for the Reich and developed soman nerve agent Soman was even deadlier than sarin and tabun but considered too delicate and therefore too costly to industrialize Richard Kuhn began working with General Loucks in Heidelberg on chemical weapons projects for the Chemical Corps General Loucks s friendly relationship with Richard Kuhn drew ire from the British When formally queried about his professional partnership with Kuhn Loucks replied I was under the impression that Professor Kuhn had been cleared of his Nazi complicity or had suffered the penalty and is now in the good graces of both the British and the Americans Further wrote Loucks I am sure our people are certainly familiar with his background To General Loucks moving forward on military programs considered vital

of the most complicated issues regarding Operation Paperclip When working with ardent Nazis some American handlers appear to have developed an ability to look the other way Others like General Loucks looked straight at the man and saw only the scientist not the Nazi Richard Kuhn had a connection with a scientist in Switzerland with whom General Loucks was particularly interested in working The scientist had been investigating a little known incapacitating agent that was far more potent than anything the Chemical Corps was working on at the time This Swiss chemist had recently given a lecture New Hallucinatory Agent to a gathering of the Swiss Society of Psychiatry and the Association of Physicians in Zurich On December 16 1948 General Loucks took a trip to Switzerland So as not to draw attention to himself or the U S military he took the unusual step of taking off his military uniform This story does not appear in any known declassified army record but is told in Loucks s own words in his personal diaries that were left to the U S Army Heritage Center in Pennsylvania Went back to the house and put on civilian clothes Loucks wrote in his diary His wife Pearl took the plainclothed general to the train station En route to his destination in Switzerland Loucks shared a compartment with a foreigner dark nationality unknown and a Dutchman who acted Jewish in quizzing me all about myself The train compartment Loucks noted provided a clean comfortable well lit ride and General Loucks arrived in Bern at 8 55 that night Before heading to bed Loucks enjoyed a fire in the fireplace in his hotel room General Loucks did not note in his journal any of the details of the meeting with the mysterious Swiss scientist The mission was classified Loucks returned to Germany the following day and he did note in his journal that Richard Kuhn came over to his house for lunch with a special guest Dr Gerhard Schrader the inventor of Preparation 9 91 or tabun gas With snow

prepared for the Amherst chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Sons of the American Revolution General Loucks revealed that this Swiss chemist referred to him by Richard Kuhn had been Professor Werner Stoll a psychiatric researcher at the University of Zurich The hallucinatory agent that Loucks was after in Switzerland would be the ultimate incapacitation chemical also sought by L Wilson Greene at Edgewood to knock out not kill The chemical said Loucks was called Lysergic Acid Diethylamide or LSD Stoll did not discover LSD That distinction went to Albert Hofmann a chemist for Sandoz pharmaceutical company in Basel Werner Stoll a colleague of Hoffmann s and the son of Sandoz chief chemist Arthur Stoll repeated Albert Hofmann s original LSD experiment and concluded modified LSD 25 was a psychotropic compound that was nontoxic and could have enormous use as a psychiatric aid In 1947 Werner Stoll had published the first article on LSD in the Swiss Archives of Neurology Stoll s second paper entitled A New Hallucinatory Agent Active in Very Small Amounts was published two years later in 1949 But General Loucks did not see LSD as a psychiatric aid but rather as a weapon an incapacitating agent with enormous potential on the battlefield Soon the army and the navy would all be experimenting with LSD as a weapon and the CIA would be experimenting with LSD as a means of controlling human behavior an endeavor that soon came to be known as mind control Eventually physicians and chemists from Operation Paperclip would work on jointly operated classified programs code named Chatter Bluebird Artichoke MKUltra and others LSD the drug that induces paranoia and unpredictability and makes people see things that are not really there would become a strange allegory for the Cold War One day in the late summer of 1948 a call came in to Brigadier General Charles Loucks s new office in Heidelberg A lieutenant answered the phone The caller a German left a cryptic message to be relayed to General Loucks It was short and to the point I can help the caller said He left a return telephone number and his name Schieber General Loucks had been in Germany

develop industrial scale production of nerve gas an effort that by now had officially switched from the pursuit of tabun to the pursuit of sarin The American university professors Loucks had hired back in the U S were making very little progress We put samples of sarin in front of them and everything but yet they could not come up with any process to make some Sarin General Loucks explained decades later in an oral history for the U S Army A fire in the sarin plant at Edgewood had set the program back even further Along came the Schieber call In 1947 a thick OMGUS security report had been compiled on SS Brigadeführer Dr Walter Schieber He had been involved with the U S Army since the fall of the Reich Schieber was a Nazi Bonzen a big wheel He was unattractive fat and wore a Hitler mustache and false teeth Since the 1920s he had been regarded as one of Hitler s Alte Kämpfer the Old Fighters trusted members of Hitler s inner circle who wore the Golden Party Badge Dr Schieber was also a loyal SS man and served on the personal staff of Heinrich Himmler SS Brigadeführer Dr Walter Schieber had been a dedicated and loyal member of the Nazi Party since 1931 He had also been frequently photographed alongside Hitler Himmler Bormann and Speer as part of the inner circle A number of these photographs survived the war which made public dealings with Schieber impossible U S Army transactions with him were classified Top Secret As head of the Reich Ministry of Armaments Supply Office Rüstungslieferungsamt first under Fritz Todt when the ministry was called the Munitions Ministry or Organisation Todt and then under Albert Speer Schieber was an engineer and a chemist and handled business in both areas for the Third Reich As an engineer he oversaw many of the Reich s

concentration camp For a period of six months starting in December 1943 a group of one hundred and fifty slave laborers were denied the watery broth they usually received and instead were fed an artificial paste designed by Schieber and made up of cellulose remnants or pieces of used clothing One hundred and sixteen of the one hundred and fifty test subjects died After the war there was a judicial inquiry into Schieber s Eastern Nutrition program The West German courts determined that the resulting deaths could not necessarily be attributed to nutrition because there were so many other causes of death in the concentration camp Walter Schieber was further linked to the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of slave laborers through the various chemical weapons programs that were carried out at Farben s multiple production plants Schieber was not tried at Nuremberg but was used as a witness for the prosecution instead During the war with his expertise as a chemist SS Brigadeführer Dr Walter Schieber was the Speer ministry s liaison to IG Farben and he oversaw the industrial production of tabun and sarin gas According to his intelligence file one of his titles was confidential clerk of IG Farben AG Dr Walter Schieber and Dr Otto Ambros worked together at the Dyhernfurth nerve agent production facility By the late summer of 1948 Otto Ambros had been tried and convicted at Nuremberg and was serving an eight year sentence at Landsberg Prison for mass murder and slavery Schieber had been released from his obligations as a witness for the tribunal and was a free man Now here he was on the telephone requesting to speak with Brigadier General Loucks Schieber was looking for work with the U S Army Chemical Corps I m free now Schieber told Loucks s lieutenant during the call They have nothing against me It was of course more complicated than that Four months prior in February 1948 former SS Brigadeführer Walter Schieber had signed a Top Secret

Schieber was risky and the potential problems facing the U S Air Force for doing so were candidly discussed in an exchange of memorandums A JIOA case officer wrote to military headquarters in Frankfurt summarizing how things were progressing Subject is Dr Walter Schieber requested priority shipment to Wright Field Schieber s ability is outstanding and his potentialities believed invaluable to the United States For the past three months the case officer explained Schieber had been working on the underground factory project a massive undertaking at U S military headquarters in Germany The project was spearheaded by Franz Dorsch and Schieber had been working as Dorsch s first assistant In Germany Schieber and Dorsch had supervised 150 scientists and technicians who had built underground factories for the Reich The result was a thousand page monograph for U S Air Force Schieber the report explained has been especially cooperative and is agreeable to going to the United States He is

Deliveries on the Reich Ministry for Armaments and War Production Head of the Central Office for Generators Deputy Head of the Reich Organization Industry SS Brigadefueher sic PSt presently held at this enclosure read the decree was tried by the Sonder Spruchkammer for Hesse Neustadt Lager and sentenced to Group II 2 years Labor Camp and restriction to 5 years ordinary labor The Group 2 designation meant that Schieber was in a category with party activists militarists and profiteers His Paperclip contract would have to wait Five days after his trial Schieber contacted the U S Army Counter Intelligence Corps to relay to his Paperclip handler his version of events Herr Berbeth the judge had subject brought into the chamber and asked him about his trip to the United States to which Schieber replied that he did not think it would be wise for him to go to the U S as an offender Herr Berbeth suggested that he should immediately apply for a re trial or ask the Minister for Political Liberation for a pardon Herr Berbeth also told Schieber that he would recommend such a pardon Schieber told his Paperclip handler that after leaving the courtroom he had returned to the internee camp where he was being held Then according to Schieber something rather shocking happened Berbeth of the court joined Schieber and told him contrary to his previous statement not to apply for another trial or a pardon but to go to Frankfurt immediately contact the Russian Liaison Officer and ask for an Interzonal Pass With this pass subject Schieber was to enter the Russian Zone and proceed to one of his factories in the Schwarza Saale where he could be assured of every possible help should he have the desire to work in his former position In other words according to Schieber the

Schieber s Counter Intelligence Corps handler asked him what he thought of the judge s black market offer Schieber believes that the Spruchkammern sentence was imposed to prevent his contract with the United States and to make his residence in Germany so difficult as to force him to accept the Russian Offers The handler had his own thoughts Cancellation of Schiebers sic contract after he has possibly jeopardized his safety and after he has cooperated so whole heartedly with intelligence agencies here is certain to have an adverse effect on the future contracting or exploitation of specialists and will only serve as another example of broken faith on the part of the United States The CIC officer felt that when considering the magnitude of Schiebers sic potential value to the United States either for military or civil exploitation it was obvious that his contract needed to be honored one way or other The officer recommended that Schieber be paid as a consultant to the U S Army in Heidelberg In the meantime he could appeal the judgment of the Spruchkammern trial and become part of Operation Paperclip after the attention died down The air force had already soured on Schieber At the Pentagon his case had been reviewed again The air force now saw Schieber s Nazi Party history in a wholly different light In their eyes Schieber had transformed from a brilliant

said to have constantly profited from being a party man noted the air force There was only one conclusion Cancel Air Force request for Walter Schieber Subject considered ineligible Paperclip United States European Command EUCOM headquarters in Frankfurt various commands had different headquarters cabled the JIOA office at the Pentagon to let them know that cancellation of the request was an unsound idea It is believed here that these considerations outweigh the risk of possible criticism of his being sent to the United States and if necessary warrant an exception to present policy Further it is considered advisable that for Schieber s future personal safety and for intelligence reasons he not be present when and if official action against him occurs Therefore it is strongly recommended that reconsideration be given the decision to cancel Schieber s contract and that he be sent to the United States regardless of the outcome of his appeal EUCOM wanted Schieber moved out of Germany and sent to the United States now Nothing happened for three months until Brigadier General Charles Loucks arrived in Heidelberg After the second Schieber call came in to General Loucks s office Loucks told his lieutenant to set up a meeting with the man As of 2013 their official meeting remains classified But General Loucks wrote regularly in his desk diary which fills in what the

be dirty business as President Roosevelt once said But to men like General Loucks and Walter Schieber to advance a nation s arsenal of chemical weapons was a challenging and necessary job It was more interesting than going down to Paris on weekends Loucks wrote in his journal General Loucks asked to meet with Dr Schieber again this time to ask Schieber if he could assist with a problem the U S Army was having producing sarin gas Schieber was happy to help He told Loucks that during the war it was the Farben chemists who had produced sarin gas and that he knew all these chemists very well They were his friends They worked with me during the war Schieber explained We wouldn t expect you to do this for free Loucks told Schieber meaning provide the U S Chemical Corps with secrets The two men arranged to meet again in the following weeks On October 28 1948 Loucks and his wife Pearl hosted a dinner party in their home Again Schieber was a guest Loucks had by now taken an extraordinary liking to Dr Schieber and wrote his impressions of the man in his diary that night Schieber is interesting an independent thinking intelligent and very competent man He related much of his experience

is a loyal German Is willing to do anything for the future of the world and Germany Why was General Loucks so willing to overlook SS Brigadeführer Dr Walter Schieber s criminal past and his central role inside the Third Reich A story that Charles Loucks told an army historian decades later sheds light on this question At the end of World War II after the Japanese surrendered Colonel Loucks went to Tokyo where he served as the chief chemical officer for the U S Army Sometimes Loucks took day trips into the countryside In the last five months of war in Japan American bombers conducted a massive incendiary bombing campaign against sixty seven Japanese cities that killed nearly a million citizens most of whom burned to death Still the Japanese refused to surrender and it took two atomic bombs to end the war The incendiary bombs dropped on those sixty seven cities were produced at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Colonel Loucks oversaw the production of tens of thousands of them In Japan after the fighting was over and when Loucks took day trips he often brought his camera along and took photographs of the landscape the damage and the dead When Loucks returned home to America he compiled these photographs into an album of more than one hundred black and white snapshots One photograph in the album which is archived at the U S Army Heritage Center in Pennsylvania shows Colonel Loucks standing next to an enormous pile of dead bodies Years later Colonel Loucks explained to the army historian what the photograph meant to him Driving one day in a Jeep from Yokohama to Tokyo I stopped along the side of a road The incendiary attacks had done their work Loucks explained The area was all burned out a wasteland all the way through We dropped tens of thousands of them incendiary bombs on the whole area between Yokohama and Tokyo Out there in the Japanese countryside said Loucks I noticed a great stack of incendiary bombs small ones I went over to take a look at them They looked like something that we had made at Rocky Mountain Sure enough they were Here in one place they had a great stack of them They were burned out but the bodies were still there because they didn t

those incidents that didn t mean anything but I just happened to see what had happened to some of our incendiary bombs that were over there In describing the photograph an enormous pile of dead bodies next to a stack of incendiary bombs Colonel Loucks expressed a peculiar kind of detachment To the army historian interviewing him Loucks made clear that what interested him in the photograph was noting the effectiveness or in this case ineffectiveness of the bombs he had been responsible for manufacturing Similarly Loucks expressed detachment as far as Dr Schieber was concerned as evidenced in his journal entries It was as if Loucks could not or would not see Schieber in the context of the millions of Jews murdered on the direct orders of Schieber s closest wartime colleagues What interested Loucks about Schieber was what an effective chemical weapons maker he was During the next meeting between General Loucks and Dr Schieber Loucks got very specific with Schieber in terms of what he was after Could you develop the process and put it on paper with drawings specifications and tables and safety regulations to make Sarin Loucks asked as noted in his desk diary Yes I could do that Schieber said Loucks recalled the next conversation the two men had He said they had a big works outside of Berlin that was just completed when the war was over and made little token amounts but no production When the Reich announced that the Russians were taking over those engineers and chemists both came West into the American and British occupied zones Schieber was lying to General Loucks The nerve gas production plant outside Berlin to which Schieber referred was Falkenhagen and it was run by Otto Ambros s deputy and the man who had stashed the steel drum outside Gendorf Jürgen von Klenck By war s end the factory at Falkenhagen had produced more than five hundred tons of sarin gas hardly little token amounts as Schieber claimed If Loucks had read von Klenck s OMGUS security

locate these chemists who knew so much about sarin production and bring them to Heidelberg He held out to Schieber the promise of a U S Army contract Further We will pay all their the chemists expenses and give them something for their work Loucks said Yes I can do that Schieber replied He said that he knew all of the Farben chemists and could easily get them to tell the Americans everything He listed their names for Loucks One of the six Farben chemists on the list was Ambros s deputy and the man who ran Falkenhagen Jürgen von Klenck On October 29 1948 Colonel Loucks wrote a memorandum to the chief of the Army Chemical Corps The best fastest way to get German technical information on tabun and sarin gas was to hire Dr Schieber Colonel Loucks advised In his diary Loucks wrote Hope the chief will support us If he does we ll be able to get all of the German CW technical ability on our side and promptly They know on what side they belong All we need to do is treat them as human beings They recognize the military defeat and the political and ideological defeat as well and accept it One week later General Loucks told Schieber that he had been authorized to pay him 1 000 marks a month for consulting work Schieber gave Loucks the contact information for the six chemists and technicians who would join him in his efforts to explain precisely how to produce sarin gas On December 11 1948 Loucks hosted the first roundtable meeting of Hitler s chemists in his Heidelberg home secrecy assured For the next three months the chemists met every other Saturday at Loucks s home There they created detailed step by step reports on how to produce industrial amounts of sarin gas They drew charts and graphs and made lists of materials and equipment required Years later Loucks reflected One of the team members was a young engineer who had an excellent command of English which helped greatly and was his major contribution and that was Jurgend sic von Klenck When the

Colonel Loucks oversaw at Rocky Mountain Arsenal during World War II would now be replaced by M34 cluster bombs filled with sarin gas The Top Secret program was code named Gibbett Delivery A friendship between two brigadier generals Loucks and Schieber had been solidified The following summer Schieber sent Loucks a thank you note and a gift not identified in the records but described by Schieber as a piece of equipment that once stood at the beginning of the same work group The unknown item had been used by Schieber during the Nazi era when sarin gas was first developed for Hitler Over the next eight years the two brigadier generals exchanged Christmas cards In January 1950 General Loucks was called to Washington D C for several meetings at the Pentagon According to Loucks s desk diary during his first meeting there he was reprimanded by a Pentagon official for cultivating friendly relationships with Hitler s chemists I don t like this Loucks wrote that his superior had informed him I don t want to be made a fool of over this Everyone seems to have cut them the Nazis off their list To be friendly with them seems bad form But General Loucks noted in his diary that he had every intention of defying this superior s request He had become good friends with the German chemists He regularly had meals with Walter Schieber and Richard Kuhn and on at least one occasion Schieber had spent the night at Loucks s house I ll see them anyhow he wrote in a diary entry dated February 1 1950 The following day Loucks was called back in to the Pentagon Went to Pentagon he

business with a former brigadier general of the Third Reich allegedly in the interests of the United States It was a Cold War black program that was paid for by the U S Army but did not officially exist There were no checks and no balances Operation Paperclip was becoming a headless monster The CIA s working relationship with the JIOA and Operation Paperclip had begun within a few months of the Agency s creation Within the CIA Paperclip was managed inside the Office of Collection and Dissemination and one of the first things requested by its administrator L T Shannon was a photostatted copy of a set of files compiled by Dr Werner Osenberg and consisting of biographical records of approximately 18 000 German scientists By the winter of 1948 hundreds of memos were going back and forth between the JIOA and the CIA Sometimes the CIA would request information from the JIOA on certain scientists and sometimes the JIOA would ask the CIA to provide it with intelligence on a specific scientist or group of scientists Also in the first three months of the CIA s existence the National Security Council issued Directive No 3 dealing specifically with the production of intelligence and the coordination of intelligence production activities within the intelligence community The National Security Council wanted to know who was producing what intelligence and how that information was being coordinated among agencies In the opinion of the CIA the link between scientific planning and military research on a national scale did not hitherto exist The result was the creation of the Scientific Intelligence Committee SIC chaired by the CIA and with members from the army the navy the air force the State Department and the Atomic Energy Commission Very early in its existence the SIC undertook to define scientific intelligence delineate areas of particular interest and establish committees to handle these areas wrote SIC chairman Dr Karl Weber in a CIA monograph that remained classified until September 2008 Priority was accorded to atomic energy biological warfare chemical warfare electronic warfare guided missiles aircraft undersea warfare and medicine every area

scientists bound for America had arrived but not a single one of them had a visa Troublemaker Samuel Klaus was gone from the State Department but the JIOA could still not get the visa division to make things happen fast enough On May 11 1948 military intelligence chief General Stephen J Chamberlin the man who had briefed Eisenhower in 1947 took matters into his own hands Chamberlin went to meet FBI director J Edgar Hoover to enlist his help with visas Cold War paranoia was on the rise and both men were staunch anti Communists The success of Operation Paperclip said Chamberlin was essential to national security The FBI had the Communists to fear not the Nazis Hoover agreed Paperclip recruits needed the promise of American citizenship now more than ever Chamberlin said before any more of them were stolen away by the Russians Chamberlin asked Hoover to put pressure on the State Department J Edgar Hoover said he would see what he could do What if anything Hoover did remains a mystery Three months later the first seven scientists had U S immigrant visas Now it was time to put the transition process to the test For Operation Paperclip moving a scientist from military custody to immigrant status required elaborate and devious preparation but in the end the procedure proved to be infallible Scientists in the southwestern or western United States accompanied by military escort were driven in an unmarked army jeep out of the country into Mexico either at Nuevo Laredo Ciudad Juárez or Tijuana With him each scientist carried two forms from the State Department I 55 and I 255 each bearing a signature from the chief of the visa division and a proviso from the Joint Chiefs of Staff Section 42 323 of Title 22 signifying that the visa holder was a person whose admission is highly desirable in the national interest The scientist also had with him a photograph of himself and a blood test warranting that he did not have any infectious diseases After consulate approval the scientist was then let back into the United States no longer under military guard but as a legal U S immigrant in possession of a legal visa The pathway toward citizenship had begun If the scientist

and reenter through the consulate at Niagara Falls It was an international crisis in June of 1948 that finally gave Operation Paperclip its long term momentum Early on the morning of June 24 the Soviets cut off all land and rail access to the American zone in Berlin This action would become known as the Berlin Blockade and it was seen as one of the first major international crises of the Cold War The Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948 clearly indicated that the wartime alliance between the Soviets and the United States had dissolved explained CIA deputy director for operations Jack Downing Germany then became a new battlefield between east and west The CIA presence in Germany was redoubled as its plans for covert action against the Soviets shifted into high gear The CIA needed to hire thousands of foreign nationals living in Germany to help in this effort spies saboteurs and scientists many of whom had spent time in displaced persons camps and interrogation facilities operated by the U S Army in the American zone of occupied Germany Initially the CIA and the JIOA worked hand in glove inside Germany to thwart Soviet threats but soon the two agencies would start competing for German scientists and spies The two agencies worked together inside a clandestine intelligence facility in the American zone informally called Camp King The activities there between 1946 and the late 1950s have never been fully accounted for by either the Department of Defense or the CIA Camp King was strategically located in the village of Oberursel just eleven miles northwest of the United States European Command EUCOM headquarters in Frankfurt Officially the facility had two other names the U S Military Intelligence Service Center at Oberursel and the 7707th European Command Intelligence Center A small plaque in a park outside the officers club explained to visitors the significance of the informal name Colonel Charles B King an intelligence officer had been in the process of accepting the surrender of a group of Nazis on Utah Beach in June 1944 when he was double crossed and slain by a strong and concentrated barrage of enemy artillery fire There was tragic

American officers would be double crossed and at least one of them would be killed A lot had changed at Camp King since John Dolibois had personally delivered six Nazi Bonzen here in August 1945 The interrogation facility had become one of the most clandestine U S intelligence centers in Western Europe and for more than a decade it would function as a Cold War black site long before black sites were known as such Camp King was a joint interrogation center and the intelligence agencies that shared access to prisoners here included Army Intelligence Air Force Intelligence Naval Intelligence and the CIA By 1948 most of its prisoners were Soviet bloc spies How the CIA used Camp King remains one of the Agency s most closely guarded secrets It was here in Oberursel that the CIA first began developing extreme interrogation techniques and behavior modification programs under the code names Operation Bluebird and Operation Artichoke The unorthodox methods the CIA and its partner agencies explored included hypnosis electric shock chemicals and illegal street drugs Camp King was chosen as an ideal place to do this work in part because it was off site but mainly because of its access to prisoners believed to be Soviet spies When the Americans captured the facility in the spring of 1945 the Nazis had been using it as an interrogation facility for Allied fliers Camp King s first commanding officer was Colonel William Russell Philp and through the fall of 1945 Philp shared the Military Intelligence Service Center at Oberursel with General William J Donovan founding director of the Office of Strategic Services General Donovan oversaw an operation here whereby high ranking Nazi generals including those dropped off by John Dolibois were paid to write intelligence reports on subjects like German order of battle and Nazi Party chain of command Dolibois fluent in German acted as Donovan s liaison to the Nazi prisoners during this time General Donovan kept an office at Oberursel until the OSS was disbanded in September 1945 after which he returned to Washington D C and civilian life Colonel Philp s job was to handle the rest of the prisoners In the months that

claimed to know and Colonel Philp began using several of them to interpret and analyze information from Soviet defectors These Nazis were experts in espionage against the Russians Philp later said Two of them seemed particularly knowledgeable Gerhard Wessel who had been an officer in the German intelligence organization Abwehr and Wessel s deputy Hermann Baun Philp put the men to work What started out as a research project using POWs became a gradual drift into operations said Philp He moved the Nazis into a safe house on the outskirts of Camp King code named Haus Blue where they oversaw counterintelligence operations against the Soviets under the code name Project Keystone Philp found that working with Nazis was a slippery slope and in a matter of months the Germans had transformed from prisoners to paid intelligence assets of the U S Army In the summer of 1946 a major event occurred that influenced the CIA s future role in Operation Paperclip and Camp King Major General Reinhard Gehlen former head of the Nazis intelligence operation against the Soviets arrived at Camp King Gehlen had been in the United States under interrogation since 1945 Here at Oberursel Army Intelligence decided to make Gehlen head of its entire anti Communist intelligence organization under the code name Operation Rusty Eventually the organization would become known simply as the Gehlen Organization A network of former Nazi intelligence agents the majority of whom were members of the SS began working out of offices at Camp King side by side with army intelligence officers Colonel Philp was in charge of overall supervision By late 1947 the Gehlen Organization had gotten so large it required its own headquarters Army intelligence moved the organization to a self contained facility outside Munich in a village called Pullach This compound was the former estate of Martin Bormann and had large grounds sculpture gardens and a pool The two facilities at Oberursel and Pullach

with The Gehlen Organization was a murderous bunch free wheeling and out of control As one CIA affiliate observed American intelligence is a rich blind man using the Abwehr as a seeing eye dog The only trouble is the leash is much too long The army became fed up with the Gehlen Organization but there was no way out Its operatives were professional double crossers and liars many were also alleged war criminals and now they had the army over a barrel Decades later it would emerge that General Gehlen was reportedly earning a million dollars a year In late 1948 CIA director Roscoe Hillenkoetter met with army intelligence to discuss the CIA s taking charge of the Gehlen Organization The two parties agreed and on July 1 1949 the CIA officially assumed control of Gehlen and his men That same summer the CIA created the Office of Scientific Intelligence OSI and its first director Dr Willard Machle traveled to Germany to set up a program for special interrogation methods against Soviet spies The CIA had intelligence indicating that the Soviets had developed mind control programs The Agency wanted to know what it would be up against if the Russians got hold of its American spies In an attempt to determine what kinds of techniques the Soviets might be using the CIA set up a Top Secret interrogation program at Camp King The facility offered unique access to Soviet spies who had been caught in the Gehlen Organization s web Revolutionary new interrogation techniques could be practiced on these men under the operational code name Bluebird A limited number of official CIA documents remain on record from this program Most were destroyed by CIA director Richard Helms Initially the CIA envisioned Operation Bluebird as a defensive program Officers from Scientific Intelligence were to apply special methods of interrogation for the purpose of evaluation of Russian practices But very quickly the Agency decided that in order to master the best defensive methods it needed to first develop the most cuttingedge offensive techniques This sounded like doublespeak and was indicative of the Cold War mindset that was taking hold in intelligence circles and also in the military The CIA believed it needed to develop the sharpest sword to create the strongest most impenetrable shield Operation Bluebird was just the beginning Soon the program", "chunk_id":

Operation Bluebird was just the beginning Soon the program would expand to include mind control techniques and Nazi doctors recruited under Operation Paperclip CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Hall of Mirrors In the fall of 1948 in Germany one of the most unusual press conferences of the Cold War took place Major General Walter Schreiber the former surgeon general of the Third Reich had last been seen on the stand at Nuremberg testifying against fellow members of the Nazi high command Then on November 2 1948 he reappeared at a press conference After three years five months and three days in Soviet custody Schreiber had allegedly escaped from his Soviet captors Now the vaccine specialist said he had important news to share with the free world The press conference opened with Schreiber delivering a brief statement about what had happened to him he d been a prisoner of the Soviets since the fall of Berlin and had recently escaped followed by a lengthy question andanswer period with an American official acting as translator The first question asked by a reporter was How did Schreiber manage to escape Schreiber said he had broken free of his Communist guards in a life or death situation but hesitated to say more With him now in the safety of U S protective custody he said were his wife Olga his fourteen year old son Paul Gerhard and one of his two grown daughters How was it possible the Russians let him get out asked another member of the press a question on everyone s mind In the two years since General Schreiber s stunning testimony at Nuremberg he d been made starshina or elder in the Soviet military It was almost inconceivable that a major player like Schreiber simply slipped away from his Soviet guards Yet here he was I m not asking the details the reporter clarified but how was it possible he was able to escape In November 1948 Berlin was a city under psychological and physical siege For more than four months now the Soviets had blocked all rail canal and road access between East and West Berlin To feed the civilians in the western zone the Americans were flying in airplanes full of food Schreiber s escape happened during the height of the Berlin Blockade For reasons of security I would not like to answer this question Schreiber said I don t want to ask any details repeated the newsman But is", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:Operation

same position to get out The question was answered said Schreiber Pressed further Major General Dr Schreiber reconstructed some of the events in his tale of escape He d been in Soviet Russia until the summer he said There he and a group of other former Nazi generals lived together in a villa outside Berlin In July or August six of the generals including Schreiber were unexpectedly transported to a country house on the German Polish border near Frankfurt on the Oder east of Berlin not to be confused with Frankfurt on the Main located in the American zone southwest of Berlin With regard to this mysterious journey and its greater purpose Major General Schreiber said We were not asked but we were told that we were going to join the police Only then Schreiber explained did he learn he had been appointed Chief Medical officer for the newly formed East German police Schreiber said he was offered food clothing housing furniture for advantages Four of the Nazi generals agreed to take the job Schreiber said he objected He was a scientist not a policeman he claimed to have told his Soviet handlers The group of generals was transported to a home in Saxony close to the Czechoslovakian border Finally The last day of September the four generals who had agreed were sent to Berlin in order to start their jobs Schreiber said He and another general who had by this time also voiced objection remained guarded by police Two days later Schreiber was sent to Dresden in the Soviet zone There we were very well received and I was offered the chance to become professor at the University of Leipzig Schreiber told the press corps I demanded the University of Berlin I had special reason for this demand That was denied of me For this reason I made myself free So that was that A chorus of West German reporters wanted more details How does one simply make oneself free of Soviet military police especially if one is the former surgeon general of the Third Reich For the Soviets turning high ranking Nazi generals into Communist officials was an immense propaganda coup in the early days of the Cold War One had to assume that Soviet military intelligence Glavnoye Razvedyvatel noye

that Soviet military intelligence Glavnoye Razvedyvatel noye Upravleniye or GRU was keeping a watchful eye on each of the generals through their transition from Soviet Russia into the East German zone The GRU s notorious official emblem featured an omnipotent bat hovering above the globe The GRU kept radarlike track of people They had eyes in the night To allow Dr Schreiber to get away sounded implausible I took off alone by express train on the railroad from Dresden to Berlin and it was a trip of life and death Schreiber said And that was all he was going to say about it Next Schreiber began to lecture his audience on the Soviet threat He singled out a former colleague Vincenz Müller to blame not unlike what he had done with Dr Blome before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg Lieutenant General Vincenz Müller was a dangerous man exclaimed Schreiber Now that he d gone over to the Russian side he was a threat to world peace Lieutenant General Müller had recently been installed by the Soviet government as the new police leader in Berlin Schreiber said He is a fanatical communist promised Schreiber completely devoted to the Russians This is all the more astonishing as Müller comes from a very devout Catholic family The Russians had plans to arm Müller s new Berlin police force with heavy weapons tanks and artillery The Soviets had only one goal Schreiber promised and that was world domination It was beginning right now with the rearmament of East Berlin Can you give us the names of the four other generals outside of General Vincenz Müller a news reporter asked I don t think it is necessary in the scope of this press conference to give those names said Schreiber Could the Russians be selling you a bill of goods asked another reporter The Russians are animated by the idea of world revolution Schreiber said He explained that in Russia most people believe the revolution is coming Another news reporter asked Were you wearing your Soviet uniform when you escaped It was a good question If Schreiber had been wearing his Soviet uniform then clearly he would have been noticed by border patrol guards stopped and questioned as he passed from the Soviet zone to the American zone of occupation If Schreiber had not been wearing his Soviet uniform then the obvious next question was Why not Schreiber s answer was convoluted His Soviet

question was Why not Schreiber s answer was convoluted His Soviet uniform happened to be at the tailors shop on the day of his escape he said getting new shoulder straps and embroidery on the collar To emphasize his point Schreiber even went so far as to re create a conversation between himself and his Soviet handler a man named Fisher regarding the missing uniform Fisher said to me You are going to get your uniform later For the time being this is not yet possible The explanation seemed implausible to at least one newsman Why didn t you get your uniform tailored earlier the reporter asked Schreiber said that his measurements had been taken for the new uniform but the tailoring was delayed When Schreiber s American handler moved to change the subject another reporter asked for more information about the human experiments Dr Schreiber had spoken of during the Nuremberg trial How did the Doctor obtain knowledge of experiments on human beings he queried Schreiber insisted he had never taken part in any such research work The knowledge I gained about it I either gained through documents I ran across in my position or in medical conventions where intellectuals could see that something like that was being conducted in the background Every aspect of Schreiber s escape story seemed unreasonable which made it difficult for the reporters to take seriously almost anything else he said Yet the press conference went on for more than thirty minutes with Schreiber standing his ground As it turned out Schreiber s press conference was not impromptu but rehearsed He had been discussing his testimony with officers from the U S Counter Intelligence Corps for two weeks since October 18 1948 the day he had walked into the CIC s Berlin office CIC special agent Severin F Wallach was Schreiber s handler Wallach had heard a much longer version of what had allegedly been going on with Schreiber since his capture by the Red Army during the fall of Berlin According to the thirteen page report by Wallach in Schreiber s intelligence dossier On the 5th of May Dr Schreiber was sent together with other captured German Generals back to Berlin The Generals were put in a cellar of the Reich Chancellery in Berlin and received orders to emerge from this cellar under strong Soviet guard This whole scene was photographed by the Soviets who were engaged in putting together

Soviets who were engaged in putting together an authentic documentary film of the capture of Berlin On May 9 with the Reich s surrender complete Dr Schreiber was sent with other officers to a much larger prisoner of war camp in Posen where he stayed until August 12 1945 A transport of generals to Moscow had been organized Schreiber said he arrived there on August 29 The transport was very badly organized Schreiber said according to the dossier report There was a food shortage because the cooks on the transport sold the food on the black market or kept it for themselves Schreiber s testimony was resplendent with details All generals were sent to the PW camp No 7027 in Krasnogorsk near Moscow he recalled Here the food tasted wonderful because it came from the United States in cans Schreiber repeatedly told Wallach how much he loved everything about the United States On March 12 1946 Schreiber said he was transferred to the Lubyanka prison in Moscow Treatment not bad On March 20 he claimed to have been interrogated by the Russians for the first time Subject was The German Preparation for Biological Warfare Wallach had to have known that this was highly improbable Schreiber was one of the Third Reich s highest ranking medical doctors and he was a major general in the army On March 20 1946 he would have been in Soviet custody for ten months That this was his first interrogation was absurd Schreiber told Wallach he was questioned by a lieutenant general named Kabulow for three days Kabulow didn t believe his testimony Schreiber said and so he was told Soviet interrogators are going to use now physical violence to break you and get the whole truth out of you The next interrogation recalled Schreiber took place at three o clock that same morning I was beaten by a Soviet officer who me knows as Lt Smirnow Smirnov Together with a Col Walter Stern who speaks German without the slightest accent and who was an excellent interrogator Schreiber said he withstood three weeks of rough interrogation at which point he finally broke down and wrote the statement which later on was submitted by the Soviet Government to the International War Crimes Tribunal

to the interests of the Soviet Union he would be hanged on his return to Russia After testifying at Nuremberg Schreiber said he was taken back to the Soviet Union where he and three generals were set up in a two story country house in Tomilino sixteen miles southeast of Moscow One of the three generals was Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus the highest ranking Nazi general to ever have surrendered to the Soviets which Paulus did during the Battle of Stalingrad Paulus s own story of the events leading up to his capture and his final communication with Hitler was remarkable The Soviets had also brought Paulus to testify at Nuremberg As William Shirer explained in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich the last days of Paulus s command during the battle for Stalingrad were cataclysmic Paulus torn between his duty to obey the mad Fuehrer and his obligation to save his own surviving troops from annihilation appealed to Hitler Paulus sent an urgent message to the Führer that read Troops without ammunition or food Effective command no longer possible 18 000 wounded without any supplies or dressings or drugs Further defense senseless Collapse inevitable Army requests immediate permission to surrender in order to save lives of remaining troops But Hitler refused to allow Paulus to surrender Surrender is forbidden Hitler wrote in return Sixth Army will hold their positions to the last man and the last round and by their heroic endurance will make an unforgettable contribution toward the establishment of a defensive front and the salvation of the Western world Heroic endurance was a euphemism for suicide Paulus was now supposed to kill himself Hitler nudged him further in this direction by making Paulus a field marshal in what he hoped would be the last hour of the general s life There is no record in military history of a German Field Marshal being taken prisoner Hitler told Alfred Jodl who was standing next to him at the time Instead at 7 45 the following

of war camps of Siberia Of the ninety one thousand Germans taken prisoner by the Soviets only five thousand would come out of the prison camps alive Paulus was one of them By 1947 he was living comfortably in this two story country house with Major General Dr Schreiber outside Berlin Actually explained Schreiber there were a total of four former Nazi generals living together under one roof In addition to Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus there was Lieutenant General Vincenz Müller captured outside Minsk in 1944 and General Erich Buschenhagen captured in eastern Romania in August 1944 For what purpose Wallach asked Subject Schreiber is convinced Lt Gen Vincenz Mueller was ordered by the Soviets to indoctrinate Professor Dr Schreiber with communistic ideas Whatever the real reason Schreiber said he and his fellow generals lived a relatively enjoyable life full of Soviet perks At one point General Schreiber and General Buschenhagen were taken to live in Moscow in a nicely furnished private house Their Soviet handler with them constantly acted as a guide and took them to the museum opera and to play houses stressing the fact that Soviet Russia has a highly developed culture For Schreiber the motive was clear This too was of course part of the planned indoctrination program he told Special Agent Wallach All the while Schreiber feigned that he was a happy Communist In July 1947 Field Marshal Paulus became sick and the group was taken to a summer resort Livadia on the Crimea There was no shortage of irony here This was the same palatial resort at which the Yalta Conference took place in February 1945 The dangerous Lieutenant General Vincenz Müller was with Paulus and Schreiber at the resort The group stayed through the summer and returned to Moscow by private

to Schreiber that was when he got away Special Agent Wallach summarized the details Subject remained alone without anybody looking after him Subject simply took a train in Dresden on the 17th and arrived in Berlin on the same day After contacting his family in Berlin subject established contact with this agent and was since then under the protection of U S authorities in Berlin At the end of October subject was evacuated with his family to the U S Zone for detailed exploitation by ECIC European Command Intelligence Center Camp King Was Schreiber a double agent Was he a true to life James Bond How was he able to resist the Soviets notoriously brutal interrogation techniques when so many others from hardened generals to civilians to spies were beaten into human ruin Was he a charlatan

Paperclip In the meantime he and his family were taken to Camp King and put up in a safe house there When General Charles E Loucks learned that Schreiber was in U S custody he traveled to Camp King to interview him Loucks was the man who had welcomed Hitler s chemists into his home in Heidelberg to work on the secret formula for sarin production He was particularly interested in learning from Dr Schreiber about vaccines or serums produced by the Reich to defend against nerve agents Loucks found Schreiber to be cooperative in all respects and hired him to work for the U S Chemical Corps in compiling data concerning the Nazi Chemical Corps To oversee the project General Loucks traveled back and forth from Heidelberg to Camp King Next Schreiber was hired to write a monograph for the U S Army about his experiences in Russia When Loucks was finished working with Schreiber he was asked by Camp King s commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Gordon D Ingraham if he would testify as to Schreiber s character for the doctor s OMGUS security report Given Schreiber s position as a general in the Nazi high command it was going to take serious effort on the part of JIOA to bring Schreiber into the United States Loucks agreed but was uncharacteristically skeptical of the Nazi general s motivations Loucks stated subject was energetic and a good organizer of work projects Schreiber had apparently given accurate information to Loucks on all occasions which has been checked and confirmed by Technical Research experts in the United States However Loucks stated that Schreiber may also have given this same information to the Russians Loucks told Lieutenant Colonel Ingraham that he believed that Schreiber could be persuaded by any attractive offer In other words Schreiber s loyalty could be bought At Camp King Dr Schreiber and his family were moved into a nice home provided by the U S Army Despite General Loucks s concern about Schreiber s trustworthiness in November 1949 Major

Schreiber was in charge of the health and well being of the Soviet prisoners held here some of whom were being subjected to special interrogation methods by the CIA Given the army s obsession with Soviet spies and the possibility of double agents hiring a Nazi general turned Soviet starshina was an unusual choice when one considered the real possibility that Schreiber had not escaped from the Russians but was working for them If Schreiber was a Soviet spy it would have been very easy for him to learn everything that the CIA and military intelligence were doing at Camp King On the other hand if Schreiber really had escaped from the Russians then there was a lot to be exploited from his Soviet experience Having been a prisoner of the Russians for the past three and a half years he was familiar with at least some of the Soviets interrogation techniques He spoke Russian fluently as well Lieutenant Colonel Ingraham was confident that Dr Schreiber was a truthteller Ingraham kept him on as post doctor until August 1951 Colonel Ingraham also hired Schreiber s twenty three year old daughter Dorothea Schreiber to serve as his personal secretary While employed at Camp King Schreiber told his Army handler that the Russians were trying to capture and kill him and he asked to use the cover name of Doc Fischer to hide his identity It was a cryptic choice for an alias Fisher had been the name of the Soviet handler from whom Schreiber had allegedly escaped in Dresden and it was also the name of an SS doctor who served as one of Schreiber s wartime subordinates at the Ravensbrück concentration camp Dr Fritz Fischer had performed medical experiments on Polish women and girls at Ravensbrück crimes for which he had been tried and convicted of murder at the Nuremberg doctors trial

Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg before the doctors trial and was now serving a life term at Landsberg Also in the prison were Hermann Becker Freyseng and Wilhelm Beiglböck serving twenty and fifteen year sentences respectively The twelve subsequent war crimes trials at Nuremberg had ended just a few months prior to John J McCloy s becoming high commissioner of Germany Most Americans had long since lost interest in following any of the trials The majority of Germans disagreed with the whole war crimes trial premise and many saw those convicted as having been singled out by American and British victors and given victors justice as punishment At war s end U S occupation authorities had determined that 3 6 million Nazis in the American zone alone were indictable for political or war crimes This enormous number was eventually whittled down to a more manageable 930 000 individuals who were then processed through 169 282 denazification trials More than 50 000 Germans had been convicted of various Nazi era crimes most in the Spruchkammern courts but also in Allied military tribunals The majority of those convicted served some time in postwar detention camps or paid nominal fines When McCloy took office 806 Nazis had been sentenced to death and sent to Landsberg Prison with 486 executions carried out to date By the fall of 1949 the German press had begun referring to the convicted criminals held at Landsberg as the so called prisoners of war This was just one of the sensitive issues that Commissioner McCloy was faced with when he arrived Another was Operation

of war He was also the chairman of the State War Navy Coordinating Committee at the time which put him in charge of making some of the first decisions regarding the fate of the program McCloy was a statesman and a lawyer but he was also an economist In between his tenure as assistant secretary of war and high commissioner of Germany he was president of the World Bank His service there came at a critical time in the bank s early history McCloy is credited in World Bank literature as defining the relationship between the Bank and the United Nations and the Bank and the United States Now he was back in government service as a diplomat having come to Germany to fill the shoes of General Lucius D Clay exiting OMGUS chief John J McCloy was a short plump man balding with a banker s bravado When in public he almost always wore a crisp suit As high commissioner he traveled around Germany in the private diesel train that had belonged to Adolf Hitler While power had been officially transferred to a new West German civilian government run by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer McCloy remained in charge of many aspects of Germany s law and order as West Germany transitioned into becoming its own sovereign nation once again One area that Chancellor Adenauer had absolutely no jurisdiction over was the Landsberg prisoners Several hundred of these convicted war criminals had already been hanged in the Landsberg courtyard Eighty six others faced death When McCloy took office as high commissioner the rhetoric around the Landsberg prisoners was at an all time high Many Germans wanted the prisoners released In November of 1949 a group of German lawyers linked to the Farben industrialists including Otto Ambros requested a meeting with John J McCloy at his office in the former IG Farben building in Frankfurt The IG Farben building had been taken over by the U S Army when troops entered Frankfurt in March of 1945 and had served as a home for the U S Army and various U S government organizations ever since The massive complex the largest office building in Europe until the 1950s had panoramic views of Frankfurt as well as parklands a sports field and a pond In August 1949 OMGUS

McCloy settled in The CIA maintained an office in the IG Farben building throughout the Cold War It was located just a few floors and a few doors down from McCloy s office It was a precarious time for an American civilian to be governing occupied Germany The Soviets had just detonated their first atomic bomb years ahead of what had been predicted by the CIA The U S military was on high alert perhaps nowhere more so than in West Germany During the November meeting in McCloy s office at the IG Farben complex German lawyers told McCloy that if West Germany and the United States were going to move forward together in a united front against the Communist threat something had to be done about the men incarcerated at Landsberg These prisoners were viewed unanimously by Germans as political prisoners the lawyers said and they told McCloy that he should grant all of them clemency After the meeting McCloy sent a memo to the legal department of the Allied High Commission inquiring if after sentences were imposed by military tribunal he as U S high commissioner had any authority to review the sentences The legal department told him that as far as the Landsberg war criminals were concerned he had the authority to do whatever he thought appropriate In America Telford Taylor the former Nuremberg prosecutor general caught wind of what was going on in the high commissioner s office in Frankfurt and was outraged He wrote to McCloy to remind him that the Nazi war criminals at Landsberg are without any question among the most deliberate shameless murderers of the entire Nuremberg List and any idea of further clemency in their cases seems to me out of the question McCloy never responded according to McCloy s biographer Kai Bird McCloy established an official review

advising him that he should grant the widest possible clemency for persons sentenced to confinement In June 1950 North Korean forces supported by Communist benefactors moved across the 38th parallel marking the start of the Korean War The idea that the Communists were also about to invade Western Europe took hold in the Pentagon On July 14 1950 the commander at Wright Patterson Air Force Base sent an urgent memo to Operation Paperclip s in house champion Colonel Donald Putt Due to the threat of impending hostilities in Europe and the possibility that forces of the USSR may rapidly overrun the continent this command is concerned with the problem of the immediate implementation of an evacuation program for German and Austrian scientists Were these scientists to fall into enemy hands they would constitute a threat to our national security Air force intelligence recommended to JIOA that it initiate a mass procurement effort in Germany JIOA agreed and began making formal plans with the high commissioner s office to effect this The Korean War sparked a new fire under Operation Paperclip Inside the high commissioner s office McCloy maintained a group called the Scientific Research Division that was specifically dedicated to the issue of German scientists The head of the division was Dr Carl Nordstrom and ever since McCloy had taken office Nordstrom had been trying to expedite the procession of German scientists to America Dr Nordstrom maintained a thick file labeled Allocation of German Scientists and Technicians and had sent many eyes only memos to McCloy in support of certain research projects he foresaw as valuable to national interest Now in light of the Korean War Nordstrom got a new job from JIOA He was assigned to be the German liaison to a new JIOA program

too old too rich too busy and too thoroughly disgruntled with past experiences with Americans to see a free room at the Alamac Hotel in New York City as a career move Besides Germany had its own chancellor now and for the first time in five years many German scientists saw that a prosperous scientific future was possible in their own country Others could not wait to come to America With Accelerated Paperclip s newest policy in place Class I offenders could now be put on a JIOA list This included Dr Schreiber still serving as post physician at Camp King Another Class I offender was Dr Kurt Blome former deputy surgeon general of the Third Reich and Hitler s biological weapons expert The sword and the shield Finally there was Dr Otto Ambros the war criminal convicted at Nuremberg of slavery and mass murder In the winter of 1951 Otto Ambros was placed on the JIOA list for Accelerated Paperclip even though he was still incarcerated at Landsberg Prison In January of 1951 John J McCloy s office announced that he had come to a decision regarding the war criminals incarcerated at Landsberg Prison The Peck Panel had finished its review process and recommended substantial reductions of sentences in the majority of cases involving lengthy prison terms As for those who had been handed death sentences the panel advised McCloy to consider each case individually Also at issue was a financial matter At Nuremberg the judges had ordered the confiscation of property of convicted war criminals whose money was so often earned on the backs of slave laborers tens of thousands of whom had been worked to death Now the Peck Panel suggested that this confiscation order be rescinded For Otto Ambros this would mean that he could keep what remained of the gift from Adolf Hitler of 1 million reichsmarks a figure that has never been revealed before McCloy spent several months considering the panel s recommendations During this time he was deluged with letters from

International Military Tribunal judges including the commander of the Malmédy Massacre considered one of the war s worst atrocities against prisoners of war and several SS officers who had overseen the mobile killing units called Einsatzgruppen would be released back into society within one and seven years Among the death sentences McCloy chose to uphold were those of Otto Ohlendorf commander of Einsatzgruppe D responsible for ninety thousand deaths in Ukraine Paul Blobel commander of Einsatzgruppe C responsible for thirty three thousand deaths at Babi Yar in Kiev and Oswald Pohl chief administrator of the concentration camps McCloy also drastically reduced the sentences of sixty four out of seventy four remaining war criminals which meant that one third of the inmates tried at Nuremberg were freed On February 3 1951 Otto Ambros traded in his red striped denim prison uniform for the tailored suit he had arrived in He walked out of the gates of Landsberg Prison a free man his finances fully restored General Telford Taylor was indignant In a press release he stated Wittingly or not McCloy has dealt a blow to the principles of international law and concepts of humanity for which we fought the war Eleanor Roosevelt asked in her newspaper column Why are we freeing so many Nazis The will and wherewithal to punish Nazi war criminals had faded with the passage of time Doctors who had participated in the murder of patients continued to practice medicine Nazi judges continued to preside over courtrooms and former members of the SS SD and Gestapo found positions in the intelligence services explains Andreas Nachama curator of the Nazi Documentation Center in Berlin Even some leaders of the special mobile commandos Einsatzkommandos paramilitary extermination

requested more details He feels he is too old to begin a new type of work and would prefer to return to biological research or cancer research Blome alluded to the fact that he had already worked on Top Secret germ warfare research for the British under Operation Matchbox the British equivalent of Operation Paperclip Blome said that the British had helped secure his house in Hagen for him McPherson left Dortmund with the impression that the fifty seven year old was very interested but would need a definite offer before he could make up his mind Approximately three months later on Thursday June 21 1951 McPherson again interviewed Dr Blome I presented him with a copy of our contract form and informed him that we were willing to pay him about 6400 per year for the duration of the contract Blome had additional questions He asked McPherson about the buying power of this salary and the amount of taxes he would have to pay He then had another request which I informed him that I could do nothing about McPherson wrote Blome said he had some money which was tied up in a professional account because it had been determined that these are funds of the Nazi Party Blome asked McPherson for his help in trying to release the money back to him and to look into the possibilities of transferring the money from Marks into Dollars in order to bring it to the United States

The couple traveled to the Berlin Document Center and provided sworn testimony regarding their Nazi past The documents were reviewed by McCloy s office Per Accelerated Paperclip a key document that

Accelerated Paperclip Project 63 was now stated on page one Based on available records Subjects have not been in the past and are not at the present time members of the Communist Party The issue of being an ardent Nazi had lost first position and was relegated down to section six There the issue of Blome s Nazi Party record was addressed Kurt Blome entered the Party on 1 July 1931 with Party number 590233 He is also listed as a member of the SA since 1941 and is a holder of the Golden Party Badge since 1943 His wife Dr Bettina Blome entered the Party on 1 April 1940 with Party number 8

but undoubtedly were ardent Nazis wrote Lieutenant Colonel Harry R Smith an authorized representative of John J McCloy Blome was a Nazi ideologue and Smith stated so He also wrote that Blome was not likely to become a security threat It is the opinion of the United States High Commissioner for Germany that they are not likely to become security threats to the United States The report was signed

Schreiber s eighty fouryear old mother in law had been brought along to live in Texas courtesy of the United States Air Force It could be said that Dr Schreiber was living the American dream But in the fall of 1951 the dream was unexpectedly interrupted by a former war crimes investigator named Dr Leopold Alexander and a concentration camp survivor named Janina Iwanska CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Downfall In the fall of 1951 Dr Leopold Alexander s life in Boston had returned to normal It had been four years since he had served as an expert consultant to the secretary of war during the Nuremberg doctors trial Since returning home Dr Alexander continued to speak out against medical crimes nonconsenting human experiments and medicine under totalitarian regimes He coauthored the Nuremberg Code the set of research principles that now guided physicians around the world The first principle of the Nuremberg Code was that informed voluntary consent was required in absolute terms Dr Alexander gave lectures wrote papers and practiced medicine The doctors trial had affected him deeply as evidenced in nearly five hundred pages of journal entries Whenever the occasion arose he provided pro bono service to victims of the Nazi regime One day in the fall of 1951 Dr Alexander was contacted by an aid group called the International Rescue Office The group was organizing medical assistance for several concentration camp survivors who had been experimented on by Nazi doctors during the war and asked if Dr Alexander could help Dr Alexander in turn contacted his friend and colleague at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston chief surgeon Dr Jacob Fine and the two men helped arrange for the camp survivors to come to Massachusetts for medical treatment One of the women was twenty seven year old Janina Iwanska a former prisoner at the Ravensbrück concentration camp On November 14 1951 Iwanska arrived at the Port of New York aboard a Greek ocean liner the SS Neptunia At the doctors trial Janina Iwanska had delivered much of her testimony with Dr Alexander standing beside her pointing to her injuries and providing the judges with a professional medical analysis of what had been done to her by Nazi doctors during the war Iwanska s testimony was generally regarded as among the most powerful evidence presented at the trial At Ravensbrück she had had her legs broken by Waffen SS surgeon Dr Karl Gebhardt and pieces of her shinbones removed Dr Gebhardt then ordered that Iwanska s surgical wounds be deliberately infected with bacteria to cause gangrene so he could treat them with sulfa drugs to see if the drugs worked It was nothing short of a miracle that Janina Iwanska survived Now nine years later she continued to suffer great physical pain She", "chunk_id":

suffer great physical pain She walked with a limp because of the decimation of her shinbones The purpose of the trip to the United States was to allow Iwanska to undergo surgery at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston to help alleviate this pain Dr Gebhardt had been Major General Dr Schreiber s direct subordinate at Ravensbrück Gebhardt had been one of the twenty three defendants tried at the doctors trial He was convicted sentenced to death and hanged in the courtyard at Landsberg Prison in June 1948 Dr Schreiber was working for the U S Air Force in Texas The same month that Janina Iwanska arrived in the United States a brief note appeared in a medical journal stating that a doctor from Germany named Walter Schreiber had just joined the staff of the U S Air Force School of Aviation Medicine in Texas As circumstance would have it Dr Leopold Alexander was a regular reader of this journal When he came across Schreiber s name familiar as he was with Dr Schreiber s testimony at the Nuremberg trial of the major war criminals Alexander was appalled He wrote to the director of the Massachusetts Medical Society at once I regard it as my duty to inform you that the record shows that Dr Schreiber is a thoroughly undesirable addition to American Medicine in fact an intolerable one Alexander explained He has been involved as an accessory before and after the fact in the worst of the Medical War Crimes which were carried out by the Nazi Government during the war and was a key person in perverting the ethical standards of the members of the medical profession in Germany during the war Dr Alexander demanded that Dr Walter Schreiber be barred from practicing medicine in the United States When he did not get the response he d expected he took the matter to the Boston Globe It was shortly after 10 30 p m on December 8 1951 in San Antonio Texas when Dr Walter Schreiber heard the telephone ring He had been in America for three months and it was an unusual hour

spent most of his time lecturing about classified matters to a small group of other doctors Sometimes he boasted to other doctors about how his area of expertise was extremely rare He would tell colleagues that he was particularly valuable to the U S military because his knowledge was so esoteric Dr Schreiber knew everything there was to know about winter warfare and desert warfare About hygiene and vaccines and bubonic plague At the officers club at the School of Aviation Medicine where he gave lectures he could be loud and boastful delivering a highly sanitized version of his colorful life He enjoyed telling long winded stories about himself how he had been a prisoner of the Soviets after the fall of Berlin how he d spent years in the notorious Lubyanka prison in Moscow how he d doctored Field Marshal Paulus in a Russian safe house when Paulus got sick But what Dr Schreiber never discussed with anyone at Randolph Air Force Base was what he did before the fall of Berlin from 1933 to 1945 Schreiber answered the telephone and was greeted by a man who identified himself as Mr Brown I am calling from the Boston Globe Brown said Mr Brown did not ask Schreiber his name Instead Brown asked if he d reached telephone number 61 210 in San Antonio Texas Dr Schreiber told Brown the number was correct There was a pause Later Dr Schreiber recalled to military intelligence that he d asked Mr Brown what it was that he wanted at this time of night Are you the individual who performed experiments on the bodies of live Polish girls who were interned in German concentration camps during World War II Brown asked Schreiber told Brown he had never been connected in any way with experiments of that nature I have never worked in a concentration camp Schreiber said I have never in my entire life conducted ordered or condoned experiments on humans of any nationality Brown told Schreiber he assumed he d passed investigations before being brought to America to

Office of Special Investigations OSI at Randolph Air Force Base to provide details of the phone call with Mr Brown the previous evening Schreiber confirmed that during World War II he had held a position in the Wermacht sic similar to the Surgeon General of the U S Army But his story his struggle he told the investigating officer was so much more than that Schreiber relayed his capture in Berlin his life as a prisoner of war in Soviet Russia and how he d served as a prosecution witness during the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials Schreiber explained that owing to feigned compliance with the Russians he d been awarded a high position with the East German Politzei sic Instead of taking that job he d escaped Schreiber lied to the Office of Special Investigations and said that he had met Dr Leo Alexander at Nuremberg That he had been given a clean bill of health by Doctor Alexander himself Schreiber told the air force investigator he was certain that the Russians were behind all of this He had recently written a manuscript called Behind the Iron Curtain Schreiber said and while he hadn t found a publisher yet he believed that the Russians had gotten hold of a copy of it He was of the

taken seriously But the air force was unwilling to give up Dr Schreiber right away To garner support for him a memo classified Secret was circulated among those involved heralding the Professional and Personal Qualifications of Dr Walter Schreiber The memo stated He possesses an analytical mind critical judgment objectivity and a wealth of well detailed exact information Schreiber possessed know how on preventative health measures military and civilian under conditions of total war He had detailed information of medical problems in connection with desert and Arctic warfare and had contributed to Zeiss Atlas of Epidemology sic He d been a key prisoner of war in Russia for three and a half years and he is in a position to provide authoritative information and serve as a consultant on vitally

general of the United States Air Force That position was now held by none other than Harry Armstrong recently promoted to major general Armstrong knew the situation could very quickly get out of control And hardly anyone had more to lose personally and professionally than he did With the assistance of Dr Hubertus Strughold Harry Armstrong had personally recruited fifty eight former Nazi doctors for work at the U S Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg five of whom had been arrested for war crimes four of whom were tried at Nuremberg two of whom were convicted at Nuremberg and one of whom was acquitted and then rehired by the U S Air Force to work in America before being revealed as incompetent and fired That said nothing of the thirty four doctors who had since been

of Aviation Medicine Randolph Air Force Base Texas that they recently forwarded to your office a request for a new contract for Doctor Walter Schreiber until June 1952 Armstrong wrote Recent information indicated that Doctor Schreiber may have been implicated in the medical war crimes in Germany during World War II and his presence in this country has aroused a considerable amount of criticism As a consequence of this it is the firm opinion of this office that the Air Force Medical Service cannot associate itself with Doctor Schreiber beyond the six months contract under which he is now employed Further said Armstrong it may be advisable to terminate this contract even prior to its expiration Armstrong promised that the commandant of the School of Aviation Medicine Major General Otis Benson concurs with this recommendation General Benson had equal reason to want the Schreiber scandal to quietly disappear After the war Benson had served as technical supervisor of the German scientists working at the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg Two weeks after the scandal broke Dr Schreiber was informed that his contract would not be renewed General Benson delivered the news in person According to Schreiber Benson also proposed a secret alternative plan involving Schreiber s future career in America In an affidavit Schreiber swore that General Benson stated that he felt sure my services could be utilized in other branches of the government or in medical schools and offered his assistance in soliciting for a position for me In Boston the matter continued to generate press The Janina Iwanska story was news people were interested in reading about Despite what had been done to her during the war Janina Iwanska was a vibrant beautiful credible young woman it was almost impossible not to marvel at her resilience After being liberated from Ravensbrück she had moved to Paris where she had been working as a journalist for Radio Free Europe She also worked as the Paris based correspondent for several Polish newspapers in Western Europe When Iwanska was experimented on at Ravensbrück she was only seventeen years old While imprisoned there she

the camp Remarkably a French prisoner named Germaine Tillion took photographs of the women s wounds then smuggled a roll of film out of the camp The story was printed in the Polish underground press during the war notifying the world about the Ravensbrück medical experiments The story was eventually picked up by the BBC as the women had hoped Now with the Schreiber story gaining momentum in January 1951 FBI agents arranged to interview Janina Iwanska in Boston Under oath and from a photograph she identified Dr Schreiber as a high ranking doctor who had overseen the medical experiments at Ravensbrück How do you know that the Dr Schreiber whom you saw in the Concentration Camp in Germany in 1942 and 1943 is the same Dr Walter Schreiber who is now in San Antonio an FBI agent asked her Three weeks ago the journalist was coming from the Boston Post sic and they showed me about fifty 50 pictures and they asked me if I know which one is Dr Schreiber Iwanska said She described how she had no trouble picking Schreiber s photograph out of fifty presented to her I saw this face in the doctors group in Ravensbrück she said After they asked me if I knew Schreiber s name I told them I know Schreiber s name Dr Schreiber in a separate interview claimed that he had had nothing to do with the Ravensbrück experiments that he had never even visited a concentration camp and that he had never met Janina Iwanska who was accusing him of outrageous acts In response Janina Iwanska had this to say I had an operation done on my legs by Dr Gebhart sic During the first dressing after the

Gebhart and Dr Schreiber about your experiment I think it was about three weeks after the operation of 15th of August 1942 Janina Iwanska said Did any of the people who were experimented on die as a result of the experiments Yes Five died 48 hours after the operation and six were shot after the operation Iwanska said Do you know the names of those who died as a result of the operation I have the list at my house I sent the names to the United Nations They have all the documents It was seventy four who had the experiment Do you have any knowledge as to whether Dr Schreiber ordered these experiments done I don t know if he gave the orders Only I know he was very interested in it she said Back in Texas Dr Schreiber began plotting his escape to Argentina He wrote to his married daughter

secretary of the air force Thomas Finletter made a public announcement stating that Dr Schreiber would be dropped from his contract and put under military custody He would leave the United States at once But Dr Schreiber refused to leave the United States Instead he packed up his family left Texas and drove to San Francisco There the Schreibers moved in with Dorothea the couple s married daughter

California since More than a month passed The Physicians Forum received new information about Schreiber which they submitted to President Truman on April 24 1952 along with a telegram marked Urgent They attached a document that showed that Brigadier General Otis Benson commanding general at Randolph Field School of Aviation Medicine sought continued employment for Dr Schreiber in the United States preferably a University Appointment after the air force had already promised that Schreiber would soon be leaving the United States The outrageous part said the physicians was that the U S Air Force was colluding to keep Schreiber in the United States In their letter to President Truman they quoted General Benson from a letter he d written to the dean of the Minnesota School of Public Health seeking a new job for Schreiber in the private sector I like and respect the man but he is too hot for me to keep here using public funds General Benson said of Schreiber He said that the bad press had been little more than an organized medical movement against him emanating from Boston by medical men of Jewish ancestry The Physicians Forum s board of directors demanded that President Truman order the attorney general to open an investigation into the case A few days later a lieutenant colonel named G A Little representing the Joint Chiefs of Staff flew to California to visit with Dr Schreiber at his daughter s house for the purpose of attempting to persuade Dr Schreiber to go to Buenos Aires at once regardless of job opportunities which might or might not be developed through our office According to Little the visit went well We were very cordially received by Dr Schreiber and spent approximately two hours in conversation with him Lieutenant Colonel G A Little wrote in a confidential report for the Joint Chiefs of Staff In exchange for transportation to South America and funds for travel and travel allowance for Schreiber Family Group Dr Schreiber agreed to leave the United States at once Schreiber s voluntary and immediate departure for Buenos Aires will provide a satisfactory solution for all concerned The amount Schreiber was paid to leave was never disclosed and is not mentioned in his declassified Operation Paperclip file On May 22 1952 Dr Schreiber and his family were flown by military aircraft from Travis Air Force Base in California to New Orleans

were revealed The Senate hearings never happened and the attorney general never opened a case In Argentina Dr Schreiber bought a home and named it Sans Souci without a care the name of the summer palace in Potsdam outside Berlin of Frederick the Great king of Prussia According to personal family documents Schreiber s final quest was to prove that he had been born a baron and was descended from Prussian royalty As a consequence of what the official investigation turned up in addition to his own extraordinary meritorious achievements say the family documents Oberstabsarzt Military Medical Doctor Walter P Schreiber was given official permission to add von to his name The personal papers do not say who gave this official permission Schreiber died in September 1970 in San Carlos de

chemicals in unconventional interrogation Dr Kurt Blome was Camp King s post doctor during this period According to a memo in his declassified foreign scientist case file Blome worked on Army 1952 Project 1975 a Top Secret project that itself has never been declassified Blome s file becomes empty after that Bluebird was rechristened Artichoke writes John Marks a former State Department official and authority on the CIA s mind control programs The goal of the Artichoke interrogation program Marks explains was modifying behavior through covert means According to the program s administrator Richard Helms the future director of the CIA using drugs was a means to that end We felt that it was our responsibility not to lag behind the Russians or the Chinese in this field and the only way to find out what the risks were was to test things such as LSD and other drugs that could be used to control human behavior Helms told journalist David Frost in an interview in 1978 Other U S intelligence agencies were brought on board to help conduct these controversial interrogation experiments In 1951 the CIA Director approved the liaison with Army Navy and Air Force intelligence to

with Army Navy and Air Force intelligence to avoid duplication of effort writes Marks The Army and Navy were both looking for truth drugs while the prime concern of the Air Force was interrogation techniques used on downed pilots Since the end of the war the various U S military branches had developed advanced air land and sea rescue programs based in part on research conducted by Nazi doctors But the Soviets had also made great advances in rescue programs and this presented a serious new concern If a downed U S pilot or soldier was rescued by the Russians that person would almost certainly be subjected to unconventional interrogation techniques according to the CIA The purpose of Operation Bluebird was to try to predict what kinds of methods the Soviets might use against American soldiers and airmen One of the so called truth serum drugs the CIA believed the Soviets were most heavily involved in researching was LSD One CIA report later shared with Congress stated that the Soviets purchased a large quantity of LSD 25 from the Sandoz Company reputed to be sufficient for 50 million doses Or so the CIA thought A later analysis of the information determined that the CIA analyst working on the report made a decimal point error while performing dosage calculations The Soviets had in fact purchased enough LSD from Sandoz for a few thousand tests a far cry from fifty million For its Operation Bluebird experiments involving LSD and other drugs the CIA teamed up with the Army Chemical Corps The initial research and development was conducted by officers with the Special Operations Division who worked inside a classified facility designated Building No 439 a one story concrete block building set among similar looking buildings at Camp Detrick so as to blend in Almost no one outside the SO Division knew about the Top Secret work going on inside The SO Division was paid for by the CIA s Technical Services Staff TSS a unit within the CIA s Clandestine Service

Olson was issued a diplomatic passport Olson was not a diplomat the passport allowed him to carry items in a diplomatic pouch that would not be subject to searches by customs officials Frank Olson began taking trips to Germany flying to Frankfurt and making the short drive out to Camp King In one of the rare surviving official documents from the program Deputy Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles sent a secret memo to Richard Helms and CIA Deputy Director for Plans Frank Wisner regarding the specific kinds of interrogation techniques that would be used In our conversation of 9 February 1951 I outlined to you the possibilities of augmenting the usual interrogation methods by the use of drugs hypnosis shock etc and emphasized the defensive aspects as well as the offensive opportunities in this field of applied medical science wrote Dulles The enclosed folder Interrogation Techniques was prepared in my Medical Division to provide you with a suitable background Camp King was the perfect location to conduct these trials Overseas locations were preferred for Artichoke interrogations since foreign governments permitted certain activities which were not permitted by the United States government i e anthrax etc The next trip on record made by Frank Olson occurred on June 12 1952 Olson arrived at Frankfurt from the Hendon military airport in England and made the short drive west into Oberursel There Artichoke interrogation experiments were taking place at a safe house called Haus Waldorf Between 4 June 1952 and 18 June 1952 an IS O CIA Inspection and Security Office team applied Artichoke techniques to two operational cases in a safe house explains an Artichoke memorandum written for CIA director Dulles and one of the few action memos on record not destroyed by Richard Helms when he was CIA director The two individuals being interrogated at the Camp King safe house could be classed as experienced professional type agents and suspected of working

unreported chapter of Cold War history is from Dr Henry Knowles Beecher chief anesthetist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a CIAarmy navy adviser on Artichoke techniques Beecher traveled to Germany to observe what was happening at Camp King He was a colleague of Dr Leopold Alexander s in Boston and like Alexander was an outspoken advocate of the Nuremberg Code the first principle of which is informed consent And yet in one of the stranger Cold War cases of dissimulation Dr Beecher was a participant in secret government sponsored medical experiments that did not involve consent Beecher was paid by the CIA and the navy to consult on how best to produce amnesia in Soviet spies after they were drugged and interrogated so they would forget what had been done to them Dr Frank Olson returned from Germany to his office in Detrick in a moral bind according to his Detrick colleague the bacteriologist Norman Cournoyer He had a tough time after Germany d rugs torture brainwashing Cournoyer explained decades later for a documentary for German television made in 2001 Cournoyer said that Olson felt ashamed about what he had witnessed and that the experiments at Camp King reminded him of what had been done to people in concentration camps Back in America Olson contemplated leaving his job He told family members he was considering a new career as a dentist Instead he stayed on at the bioweapons facility becoming chief of the SO Division for a while He continued to work on Top Secret biological and chemical weapons programs in the CIA s office at Detrick Building No 439 Unknown to Frank Olson the CIA was expanding its Artichoke program in new ways including expanding its use of LSD in unconventional interrogations through covert means Strapping a suspected Soviet spy to a chair and dosing him with drugs as was done at Camp King s Haus Waldorf was one approach to getting a spy to spill his secrets But the CIA wondered what would happen if an

the experience would be remembered These were questions the CIA wanted answered The director of the Technical Services Staff Dr Sidney Gottlieb a stutterer with a club foot decided that the first field tests should be conducted on men from the SO Division without them knowing about it One of those targeted for experimentation was Dr Frank Olson A week before Thanksgiving in November 1953 six SO Division agents including Frank Olson and the new SO Division chief Vincent Ruwet were invited to a weekend retreat at a CIA safe house in western Maryland called Deep Creek Lake There the men from Detrick were met by TSS director Sidney Gottlieb and his deputy Robert Lashbrook a chemist One part of the agenda was to discuss the latest covert means of poisoning people with biological agents and toxic substances including those that had been acquired from around the globe by Fritz Hoffmann the Operation Paperclip scientist with the Chemical Corps The second goal was to covertly dose the six SO Division men with LSD and record what happened After dinner on the second night Robert Lashbrook secretly added LSD to a bottle of Cointreau The unwitting test subjects were all offered a drink and all but two of the SO Division officers drank the aperitif one had a heart condition and the other abstained from alcohol Frank Olson had a terrible reaction to having been drugged with LSD He became psychologically unstable and could not sleep His boss Vincent Ruwet who had also been dosed described his own LSD poisoning experience as the most frightening experience I ever had or hope to have The CIA had at least one of their questions answered now covert LSD poisoning did not produce amnesia When Monday morning came around Ruwet arrived for work at 7 30 as usual Inside Detrick s Building No 439 he found a very agitated Dr Frank Olson waiting for him Olson told Ruwet that he was devastated by what had happened at Deep Creek Lake He wanted to quit or be fired Ruwet told him to give the issue some time and to get back to work But when Ruwet arrived for work the following morning at 7 30 he again found Frank Olson waiting for him Olson s mental state had deteriorated considerably and

most controversial behavior modification and mind control programs If he had a psychotic break in public he could inadvertently talk terribly ironic since getting a man to spill his secrets was what this LSD poisoning program was all about Were Frank Olson to talk the Agency would have a nightmare on its hands Dr Olson was in serious trouble and needed immediate professional attention Lashbrook wrote in an after incident CIA report Lashbrook told Vincent Ruwet to bring Olson to headquarters immediately From there the two men took Olson to a townhouse in New York City at 133 East Fifty eighth Street There Olson met with a doctor on the CIA s payroll named Harold Abramson Abramson was not a psychiatrist He was an allergist and immunologist who worked on LSD tolerance experiments for the CIA and he carried a Secret clearance of his own Frank Olson told Dr Abramson that he was suffering from memory loss confusion feelings of inadequacy and terrible guilt Dr Abramson noted that Olson seemed to have a perfectly good memory and could remember people places and events easily on demand In other words Frank Olson s problems were all in his mind The next morning Robert Lashbrook and Vincent Ruwet took Frank Olson on another visit to another CIA contract employee John Mulholland a semifamous New York City magician Like Dr Abramson magician John Mulholland had a Secret security clearance with the TSS Mulholland taught CIA agents how to apply the magician s art to covert activities One of his specialties was the delivery of various materials to unwitting subjects During the visit Olson became suspicious of what was going on and asked to leave By the next day Frank Olson was hearing voices He told Dr Abramson that the CIA was trying to poison him which they already had done at least once Vincent Ruwet returned to Maryland to be with his family for Thanksgiving Abramson and Lashbrook decided to have Frank Olson committed to the Chestnut Lodge sanitarium in Rockville Maryland

hotel window and fell more than one hundred feet to his death on the street below According to the coroner s report Olson hit the ground feet first as if standing up fell backward and broke his skull The Statler Hotel night manager Armand Pastore heard the impact and ran outside He found Olson lying on the pavement still alive His eyes were open Pastore told the police and he tried to say something But no words came out and after a few moments Frank Olson took his last breath Pastore looked up to see which room Olson had come out of He could see that one of the window shades in a room high above was sticking out as if the shade had been down when Olson crashed through it Pastore noted which room it might be When the police arrived he took them up to the tenth floor and into room 1018A using the manager s passkey to get inside There inside the bathroom CIA agent Robert Lashbrook sat on the toilet seat in his underwear holding his head in his hands Lashbrook had already made two telephone calls The first call was to the CIA s director of the Technical Services Staff Sidney Gottlieb the man who had with Lashbrook poisoned Frank Olson with LSD a little over a week before The second call was to the hotel s front desk to report Olson s suicide When New York City Police detective James W Ward arrived on the scene he asked Robert Lashbrook several questions to which Lashbrook responded using only the words yes and no Lashbrook did not identify himself as a CIA agent Dr Lashbrook was taken in for questioning homicide had not yet been ruled out At the precinct Detective Ward asked Lashbrook to empty his pockets Among the contents were papers with addresses for Dr Harold Abramson in New York City and the Chestnut Lodge sanitarium in Rockville Maryland When

Nazi scientist program was a nefarious child of the Second World War Operation Paperclip in turn created a host of monstrous offspring including Operations Bluebird Artichoke and MKUltra Before Frank Olson became involved in the CIA s poisoning and interrogation programs he conducted research and development of the airborne delivery of biological weapons Olson had been working in the field of biological weapons research since 1943 He was recruited by Detrick s first director Ira Baldwin during the war After the war Dr Olson became a civilian scientist at Detrick He joined the Special Operations Division in 1950 and was part of a team that covertly tested how a weaponized biological agent might disperse if used against Americans In the late 1940s and early 1950s Olson had traveled across the United States overseeing field tests that dispersed biological agents from aircraft and crop dusters in San Francisco the Midwest and Alaska Some field tests involved harmless simulants and others involved dangerous pathogens as Senate hearings later revealed One such dangerous experiment was conducted by Olson and his Detrick colleague Norman Cournoyer The two men went to Alaska and oversaw bacteria being sprayed out of airplanes to see how the pathogens would disperse in an environment similar to that of a harsh Russian winter We used a spore Cournoyer explained which is very similar to anthrax so to that extent we did something that was not kosher Because we picked it up all over the United States months after we did the tests A third man involved in the covert tests with Cournoyer and Olson was Dr Harold Batchelor the bacteriologist who learned airborne spray techniques from Dr Kurt Blome whom Batchelor consulted with in Heidelberg Olson and Batchelor also conducted

government and his doctor was violated on orders from the very same people to whom he had dedicated his life s work This new war the Cold War was now the father of its own dark events PART V War is the father of all things Heraclitus CHAPTER TWENTY In the Dark Shadows The Cold War became a battlefield marked by doublespeak Disguise distortion and deception were accepted as reality Truth was promised in a serum And Operation Paperclip born of the ashes of World War II was the inciting incident in this hall of mirrors But in 1952 the heedless momentum of Operation Paperclip began to slow as conflicts emerged between the JIOA and the CIA over policies with the new West German government German officials warned High Commissioner John J McCloy that Operation Paperclip violated NATO regulations and even America s own policies for governance in Germany On February 21 1952 McCloy sent a memo to the U S Secretary of State expressing his concern that if Paperclip was not curtailed it could result in a violent reaction from officials in West Germany With McCloy no longer expressing unbridled enthusiasm for Operation Paperclip the JIOA began to lose its once indomitable grip on the program But the CIA was not bound to the same NATO policies as were the Joint Chiefs of Staff and so the CIA continued to do what it had been doing namely recruiting Nazi scientists and intelligence officers to act as advisers at Camp King The five year partnership between the two agencies began to unravel JIOA officials became furious as they watched the CIA poach German scientists and technicians from the Accelerated Paperclip lists In response and in spite of McCloy s requests otherwise in the winter of 1952 the JIOA prepared to send a twenty man team to Frankfurt on a recruiting

unnamed Paperclip scientists who were already working in America When McCloy learned of the trip he asked the State Department to intervene and cancel it fearing it would draw the ire of German officials which it did The trip happened anyway A compromise was reached between U S officials and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer s office whereby the JIOA and the CIA agreed to stop recruiting new scientists but could continue to work with the scientists who remained on the original President Truman approved thousand person list Official numbers vary dramatically in different declassified record groups but there were approximately six hundred Paperclip scientists in the United States at this time meaning some four hundred German scientists were still on the target list JIOA renamed Paperclip the Defense Scientists Immigration Program or DEFSIP and the CIA renamed one vein of its involvement the National Interest program but most parties still referred to it all as Operation Paperclip It was a dwindling empire In 1956 the CIA ceded control of the Gehlen Organization to the West German government which renamed it the BND Bundesnachrichtendienst The former Nazi general and his men were spies for Chancellor Adenauer s government now Then in 1957 JIOA got a new officer in Lieutenant Colonel Henry Whalen a man whose actions would have a profound effect on the legacy of the Paperclip program By 1959 Whalen was promoted to deputy director of JIOA which meant he had access to highly classified intelligence reports from scientists working on atomic biological and chemical weapons Whalen had an office in the E Ring of the Pentagon reserved for senior officials and enjoyed direct access to the Joint Chiefs of Staff During his year long tenure as JIOA deputy director no one had any idea that Whalen was working as a Soviet spy It wasn t until 1963 that the FBI learned that he had been passing military secrets to Colonel Sergei Edemski a GRU intelligence agent posing as a military attaché in the Soviet embassy in Washington By then Henry Whalen had already left the JIOA When the Justice Department began investigating Whalen they seized all of the JIOA records that he had been working with The FBI learned that Whalen had destroyed or given away thousands of Paperclip files In 1966 a grand jury was presented with evidence against Whalen behind closed doors He was

prohibited from reporting on the trial and no one made the connection between Whalen the JIOA and Operation Paperclip The Nazi scientist program had long since faded from public discourse Whalen was sentenced to fifteen years at a federal penitentiary but was paroled after six years Most of the FBI s investigation of Whalen remains classified which likely explains why so few Paperclip files from that time frame are housed at the National Archives In 1962 the JIOA was officially disbanded What remained of the Paperclip program was taken over by the Research and Engineering Department at the Pentagon Under the DoD Reorganization Act of 1958 this new office had been created to handle the military s scientific and engineering needs under a scientific director who reported to the Secretary of Defense The act also gave a home to the Pentagon s new in house cutting edge science agency the Advanced Research Projects Agency or ARPA later renamed DARPA with a D for defense The first director

understood as America s military industrial complex It was President Eisenhower who in his Farewell Address to the nation in 1961 coined this phrase Eisenhower cautioned Americans to be wary of the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex Eisenhower s famous warning is well known and often paraphrased But he also delivered a second warning in his farewell speech not nearly as well known Eisenhower told the American people that indeed science and research played a crucial role in national security y et in holding scientific research and discovery in respect as we should we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite Herbert York as both ARPA chief and director of the Research and Engineering Department at the Pentagon worked closely with President Eisenhower on matters of military science during the last three years of Eisenhower s presidency He was deeply troubled by Eisenhower s words in his Farewell Address Scientists and technologists had acquired the reputation of being magicians who had access to a special source of information and wisdom out of reach of the rest of mankind said York In the mid 1960s York went to visit Eisenhower at the former president s winter home in the California desert I asked him to explain more fully what he meant by the warnings but he declined to do so York said I pressed this line of questions further by asking him whether he had any particular people in mind when he warned us about the danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite York was surprised when Eisenhower answered without hesitation Wernher von Braun and Edward Teller father of the hydrogen bomb York spent decades considering what the President had told him Eisenhower s warnings which were based largely on his intuition pointed up very real and extremely serious problems If we forget or downgrade his warnings it will be to our peril York wrote in his memoir Arms and the Physicist in 1995 The legacy of some of the Operation Paperclip

programs can now be looked back upon as distinct failures and the product of vague and often wrong intelligence So it was with the Chemical Corps relationship with former SS Brigadier General Dr Walter Schieber Declassified files reveal that Schieber was double crossing the Americans from the moment he began working for the U S Army in Germany including the entire time he worked for Brigadier General Charles Loucks on the sarin gas project at Loucks s private home in Heidelberg It took military intelligence until 1950 to determine that something about Hitler s trusted servant was untoward and even longer to fully realize the extent to which Speer s Armaments Supply Office chief was deceiving them Almost immediately after Schieber was released from Nuremberg he began using his old Nazi contacts to sell heavy weapons to at least one enemy nation through a Swiss intermediary In 1950 military intelligence intercepted a four page letter addressed to Schieber sent from Switzerland There was no return address on the envelope and only an illegible signature inside The letter writer discussed with Schieber the sale of weapons to a third party describing the buyer as A Prince of the Royal House which military intelligence surmised was a code name They are looking for everything tanks aircraft etc weapons ammunitions in short everything that pertains to armament I can t write all that in a telegraph stated the author who requested PAK anti tank guns willing to pay 5 000 a piece 75 mm weapons at 3 000 4 000 a piece and 50mm about 2 000 00 This was a first class business deal if we could arrange it the intermediary promised Special Agent Carlton F Maxwell commander of a CIC Team in Heidelberg was assigned the task of analyzing the letter and the situation Maxwell quickly determined that the letter was legitimate and its implications dangerous Dr Schieber described as an extremely valuable scientist in the employ of the Chemical Division EUCOM where he possibly has access to Chemical Corps information of a highly classified nature appears to be one person whom the United States can ill afford to have involved in any sort of international scheme of the nature

as Armaments Supply Chief under Dr Albert Speer would make him valuable as a consultant and intermediary in any sort of plan involving illegal sales and shipments of arms It is remarkable that despite many warning signs the U S Army placed so much trust in Schieber in the first place and that General Loucks was allowed to make back door deals with him Special Agent Maxwell worried that in light of recent indication of revival of right wing activity it is not impossible to image that these arms might be used in a possible German monarchist coup Schieber needed to be watched closely Maxwell advised The Counter Intelligence Corps put a tail on him and followed him into the Soviet zone In four months time CIC confirmed Schieber has contacts with a Swiss Import Export Agency in a dubious transaction involving the sale and shipment of arms to a foreign power But there was even worse news for U S national security The CIC also learned that Schieber was working for Soviet intelligence Subject is in some way involved with the MGB Ministerstvo Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti or the Ministry of State Security a forerunner of Komitet Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti or the KGB in Weimar Maxwell learned Maxwell advised his superiors that it appeared Schieber was a Soviet mole and summarized the dangers involved Schieber had been cleared to work with highly classified material for the U S Chemical Corps including but not limited to tabun and sarin nerve gas He had worked on classified design projects involving underground bunker systems for the U S Air Force ones that would supposedly protect the U S government s greatest military assets in the event of a nuclear attack And now he was meeting with Soviet agents who were connected to the intelligence service Maxwell was told to notify the CIA The response from the Agency was surprising Just forget it the CIA told Maxwell and he was instructed to share this message with his colleagues inside the Counter Intelligence Corps According to declassified memos in Schieber s file in addition to working for the Chemical Corps Schieber was also working for the CIA The Agency told Special Agent Maxwell that they had

America Dr Walter Schieber left an indelible mark on the future of the U S Chemical Corps After he and his team of Farben chemists provided General Loucks with the secret of sarin gas the United States began stockpiling the deadly nerve agent for use in the event of total war The program was fast tracked at the start of the Korean War On October 31 1950 Secretary of Defense George C Marshall authorized 50 million roughly 500 million in 2013 for the design engineering and construction of two separate sarin production facilities one in Muscle Shoals Alabama and another inside the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Most information on biological and chemical weapons was classified and no one outside a core group of senior congressmen who portioned out money for these programs had a need to know about them Only five members of the House Appropriations Committee and no more than 5 percent of the entire House of Representatives were cleared for information on chemical and biological weapons writes chemical weapons expert Jonathan Tucker As a result a small clique of senior congressmen was able to allocate money for these programs in secret session and then bury the line items in massive appropriations bills that were brought to the floor for a vote with little advance notice so that few members had time to read them Sarin production took off at a frenzied pace Twenty four hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year the two plants cranked out thousands of tons of sarin nerve agent each year The facility at Rocky Mountain Arsenal code named Building 1501 was a windowless five story blockhouse designed to withstand a 6 0 earthquake and 100 mph winds It was the largest poured concrete structure in the United States and for years no one in America without a need to know had any idea what went on inside The Chemical Corps also fast tracked its chemical warfare munitions program developing state of the art weapons with which to deliver deadly nerve agents in battle At the

Chemical Corps began releasing public service announcements to educate Americans about chemical warfare In November 1953 when Collier s magazine published G Gas A New Weapon of Chilling Terror We Have It So Does Russia the public learned for the first time that World War III with the Soviets would most likely involve nerve agents Journalist Cornelius Ryan presented the information about sarin in the starkest of terms Right now you and your family all of us are unprotected against the threat of a terror weapon which could prove more deadly than an atomic bomb The army described sarin as an odorless colorless tasteless nerve gas designed to destroy people with paralyzing suddenness and warned Americans of a possible Pearl Harbor type attack Ryan described for readers a scenario wherein a Russian strategic bomber the Tu 4 carrying seven tons of sarin bombs would drop its load on an American city killing every unprotected human in a 100 square mile radius within four minutes of the attack The chief of the Chemical Corps Major General E F Bullene promised the nation that the only defense was offense At this time the only safe course is to be prepared to defend ourselves and ready to use gas in overpowering quantities Brinkmanship the practice of pushing dangerous events to the edge or brink of disaster was the new Cold War mentality In 1957 after years of producing sarin and filling munitions around the clock the Chemical Corps finally fulfilled the Defense Department s stockpile requirement Later that same year Edgewood chemists found an even more lethal killer a toxic insecticide that penetrated the skin like snake venom explains Jonathan Tucker This nerve agent was code named VX the V stood for venomous a battlefield killer that was three times more toxic than sarin when inhaled and one thousand times more lethal when it came in contact with the skin Ten milligrams of VX could kill a man in fifteen minutes VX would be much more effective on the battlefield than sarin ever would be sarin dissipated within fifteen or so minutes but when VX was sprayed it stayed on the ground for up to twenty one days Now in 1957 the Chemical Corps began producing VX by

Corps began producing VX by the thousands of tons Operation Paperclip scientist Fritz Hoffmann moved over from synthesizing tabun at Edgewood to working on VX munitions But Fritz Hoffmann s more haunting legacy lies in the work he performed for the CIA s Special Operations Division and the Chemical Corps antiplant division Antiplant agents include chemical or biological pathogens as well as insects that are then used as part of a program to harm crops foliage or other plant life After the death of Frank Olson the SO Division continued its LSD mind control schemes But Sidney Gottlieb the man who had suggested poisoning Frank Olson at the CIA safe house in Deep Creek Lake Maryland was assigned to also work on the CIA s assassination by poison program Fritz Hoffmann was one of the chemists at the locus of this program He was our searcher Edgewood laboratory director Dr Seymour Silver told journalist Linda Hunt He was the guy who brought to our attention any discoveries that happened around the world and then said Here s a new chemical you better test it Hoffmann s daughter Gabriella remembers her unusually tall soft spoken father regularly traveling the globe in the late 1950s and early 1960s always with a military escort gathering obscure poisons from exotic toads fish and plants He would send me postcards from places like Japan Australia and Hawaii she recalls He always flew military and he was always escorted by military staff They would pick him up at our house and bring him back home on a Sunday night A teenager at the time Gabriella Hoffmann remembers the unconventional items her father brought home He d unpack his luggage before he would go back to Edgewood on Monday and in his suitcase he d have all these little jars They were filled with sea urchins and things It all seemed very exotic to me The poisons Fritz Hoffmann sought for the CIA included substances like curare a South American blowpipe poison that paralyzes and kills people Curare was the poison that the CIA s U 2 pilots carried in their flight suit pockets hidden inside a tiny sheath inserted into an American coin The SO Division had a Device Branch which was run by Herb Tanner co

fountain pens filled with poison projectiles briefcases that spread bacterial aerosols poisoned candies invisible powders and the non discernible microbioinoculator a high tech dart gun that injected a tiny poison tipped dart into the bloodstream without leaving a mark on the body In other situations it behooved the CIA to locate and weaponize a poison where death came after a delay sometimes with an incubation period of about eight or twelve hours sometimes much longer The SO Division s Agent Branch worked to find poisons that could make a target mildly ill for a short or long period of time followed by death very ill for a short or long time followed by death or any number of combinations including mild to extreme illness followed by death The rationale behind assassinating someone with a built in time delay was to allow the assassin to get away and to deflect suspicion SO Division targets included Fidel Castro whose favorite drink a milkshake the CIA tried to poison several times Another CIA target was Patrice Lumumba the first legally elected prime minister of Congo who the CIA believed was a Soviet puppet Sidney Gottlieb the man who poisoned Frank Olson was assigned the job of assassin Gottlieb later told congressional investigators that for this job he needed to locate a poison that was indigenous to that area Congo and that could be fatal Gottlieb decided on botulinum toxin Armed with this toxin concealed inside a glass jar within a diplomatic pouch Sidney Gottlieb traveled to Congo with the intention of killing Prime Minister Lumumba himself On September 26 1960 Gottlieb arrived in the capital Léopoldville and headed to the U S embassy There Ambassador Lawrence Devlin was expecting him Two days prior Ambassador Devlin had received a Top Secret cable from CIA director Allen Dulles We wish give every possible support in eliminating Lumumba from any possiblity sic resuming govermental position Dulles wrote Ambassador Devlin knew to be on the lookout for a visitor who would introduce himself as Joe from Paris This was Sidney Gottlieb Gottlieb s plan was to inject the botulinum toxin into Lumumba s toothpaste tube with a hypodermic syringe Ideally

at Edgewood Gabriella Hoffmann says Because he never spoke of anything he did there is so much that is unknown For Gabriella Hoffmann memories of an unusual childhood include trips to military bases Whenever we traveled me and my mom and dad it was always to a military installation We went to White Sands in New Mexico We went to military bases in California Arizona North Dakota and Dugway Utah I remember dad giving a lecture at Dugway Proving Ground Hoffmann was a central player in some of the most mysterious and controversial government programs of the 1950s and 1960s but the record of most of his work was destroyed or as of 2013 remains classified Gabriella Hoffmann is in the dark about her father s legacy as is most of the rest of the world What remains are Gabriella Hoffmann s memories of the company her father kept Dr L Wilson Greene the man who coined the term psychochemical warfare lived down the street and was a colleague and family friend During the late 1950s and early 1960s Greene continued his LSD research for the army and the CIA s psychochemical warfare programs LSD and other incapacitating agents were tested on thousands of U S soldiers and sailors with a questionable degree of informed consent To Gabriella Hoffmann Greene was simply an eccentric neighbor I recall going to the Greenes house to see the amazing train garden his hobby that he built in the basement It had hills and towns and little people Ponds and lights and trains that whistled and chugged along with wisps of smoke My attention and interest was solely on the trains Another unusual neighbor on the same street was Maurice Weeks from the Directorate of Medical Research at Edgewood Weeks was chief of the Vapor Toxicity Branch with expertise regarding the inhalation toxicity of

monkeys for hours on end Obviously it never dawned on me back then what they were for Gabriella only learned the true nature of her father s job during interviews for this book The strange tragic thing about Fritz Hoffmann and his legacy in Operation Paperclip is that during the war he was anti Nazi at least according to the affidavit written by the wartime American diplomat Sam Woods And yet here in America working for the Army Chemical Corps and for the CIA Fritz Hoffmann s science projects took on a monstrous life of their own This includes what his daughter believes was a role in the development of Agent Orange the antiplant weapon or defoliant used by the U S military during the Vietnam War During the Vietnam War I remember one evening we were at the dinner table and the war was on the news Gabriella Hoffmann explains The family was watching TV Dad was usually a quiet man so when he spoke up you remembered it He pointed to the news you could see the jungles of Vietnam and he said Wouldn t it be easier to defoliate the trees so you could see the enemies That s what he said I remember it very clearly Years later I learned one of Dad s projects was the development of Agent Orange The army s herbicidal warfare program during the Vietnam War started in August 1961 and lasted until February 1971 More than 11 4 million gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed over approximately 24 percent of South Vietnam destroying 5 million acres of uplands and forests and 500 000 acres of food crops an area about the size of the state of Massachusetts An additional 8 million gallons of other anticrop agents code named Agents White Blue Purple Pink and Green were also sprayed mostly from C 123 cargo planes Fritz Hoffmann was one of the earliest known U S Army Chemical Corps

Serling in The Twilight Zone Gabriella Hoffmann recalls One hundred days later Fritz Hoffmann was dead He was fifty six years old He did try periodically to go to work Gabriella Hoffmann remembers but he was in too much pain I do have a recollection of a lot of different men in dark suits always coming by the house to talk to him At the time Demerol as a painkiller had just come on the market He had a prescription for it from a doctor at Edgewood During the time that he was dying there were a lot of questions asked of my mother and me that led me to think the FBI or the CIA or whoever the men in the dark suits were were worried that my father would start talking about whatever it was that he did He never did say anything He was silent until the end Hoffmann s antiplant work in herbicides

had approved a 30 million budget for antianimal weapons research roughly 300 million in 2013 but because this work was so dangerous Congress mandated that it needed to take place outside the continental United States on an island and not connected to the nearest mainland by a bridge Plans moved forward and the army chose Plum Island a 1 3 square mile land parcel located off the coast of Connecticut in the Long Island Sound The obvious choice for a director was the world s expert on antianimal research Dr Erich Traub But the plan to activate Plum Island for biological weapons research languished for several years Traub received his immigrant visa on September 7 1951 and he worked on classified programs for three more years Then under mysterious circumstances in 1954 he resigned his

did not Whenever Traub traveled outside Germany military intelligence kept a watchful eye on him Dr Traub was a man experienced in the illegal trafficking of deadly pathogens During World War II he was the trustworthy scientist chosen by Heinrich Himmler to travel to Turkey to obtain samples of rinderpest to weaponize on Riems And after the war when Traub fled the Russian zone at great risk of personal harm he managed to smuggle deadly cultures with him out of the Eastern bloc which he then stashed at an intermediary laboratory in West Germany until he was able to locate an appropriate buyer In the mid 1960s according to Traub s FBI file Traub moved from Germany to Iran with a new permanent address at the Razi Institute for Serums and Vaccines in Hesarak a suburb of the city of Karaj When Traub traveled from Iran to the Shoreham Hotel in Washington D C for a meeting with unknown persons FBI agents watched him What they learned about the mysterious Dr Traub remains classified as of 2013 Through the lens of history it is remarkable to think that U S biological warfare and chemical warfare programs grew so quickly to the size they did But the Pentagon was able to keep the scope and cost of these weapons programs secret from Congress in much the same way that it was able to keep the damaging details of Operation Paperclip secret from the public Everything was classified It took President Richard Nixon to realize that playing chicken with the Russians using a huge arsenal of biological and chemical weapons was pure madness On November 25 1969 Nixon announced the end

States of America will renounce the use of any form of deadly biological weapons that either kill or incapacitate Nixon said His reasons were simple and self evident The use of biological weapons could have uncontrollable consequences for the world Mankind already carries in its hands too many of the seeds of its own destruction said Nixon After twenty six years of research and development America s biological weapons programs came to an end For the first time during the Cold War a president decided that an entire group of weapons was going to be unilaterally destroyed The end of America s chemical weapons program was not far behind Nixon reinstated the retaliation only policy which meant no new chemical weapons would be developed and produced Over the next few years Congress worked with the military to determine the best way to destroy this entire group of weapons The original plan was to dispose of some twenty seven thousand tons of chemical filled weapons in the deep sea But upon investigation it turned out that many of the sarinand VX filled bombs stored at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal were already leaking nerve agent These munitions needed to be encased in steel and concrete coffins before they could be dumped in the ocean The Pentagon also had thirteen thousand tons of nerve agent and mustard gas stored in secret on its military base in Okinawa Japan which now needed to be disposed of In 1971 these munitions were brought to an American owned atoll in the South Pacific called Johnston Island in an operation called Red Hat The plan was to store the sarin and VX filled bombs in bunkers on the atoll until scientists figured out how best to destroy them But as it turned out the sarin and VX bombs were not made to ever be dismantled So the army had a massive new scientific endeavor on its hands for which it created the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System the world s first full scale chemical weapons disposal facility It took another thirty four years for America s arsenal of chemical weapons to be destroyed The numbers speak volumes says the army More than 412 000 obsolete chemical weapons bombs land mines rockets and projectiles

8 billion as of 2006 or approximately 30 billion in 2013 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE Limelight America s Cold War biological and chemical weapons programs existed in the shadows and the majority of the Nazi scientists who worked on them maintained anonymity for decades Their JIOA case files and OMGUS security reports were classified as were the programs they worked on But some of the Operation Paperclip scientists enjoyed the limelight for their work notably in instances where their work crossed over from weapons projects into space related endeavors In this manner Walter Dornberger Wernher von Braun and Hubertus Strughold attained varying degrees of prominence and prestige in the 1950s and 1960s and onward Within two years of his arrival in the United States Dornberger had transformed from public menace to American celebrity In 1950 he left military custody at Wright Patterson Air Force Base to work for Bell Aircraft Corporation in Niagara Falls New York quickly becoming vice president and chief scientist His vocation was now to serve as America s mouthpiece for the urgent need to weaponize space Dornberger was given a Top Secret security clearance and a job consulting with the military on rockets missiles and the future of space based weapons In his desk diary housed in the archives at the Deutsches Museum in Munich he kept track of his cross country business trips with an engineer s precision He attended classified meetings at U S Air Force bases including Wright Patterson Elgin Randolph Maxwell and Holloman as well as at Strategic Air Command headquarters in Omaha Nebraska and the Pentagon He also became a consultant to the Joint Chiefs on Operation Paperclip visiting the inner circle in the Pentagon to discuss clearance procedures and the hiring of German Scientists As a Paperclip scout in 1952 Dornberger traveled with what he called Pentagon Brass to Germany to interview German scientists and engineers in Frankfurt Heidelberg Wiesbaden Stuttgart Darmstadt Witzenhausen In his desk diary Dornberger also detailed an ambitious schedule of public appearances carefully noting the places he traveled and the people he met with They were the kinds of engagements usually reserved for congressmen Throughout the 1950s he jetted from one event to the next lecturing at dinners and luncheons and sometimes weeklong events His speeches were always about

Intercontinental Weapons Systems and A Realistic Approach to the Conquest of Space He orated to anyone who would listen the Men s Club of St Mark s Episcopal Church the Boy Scouts of America the Society of Automotive Engineers When the Rochester Junior Chamber of Commerce hosted General Dornberger for a women s luncheon in the spring of 1953 the local press covered the event with the headline Buzz Bomb Mastermind to Address Jaycees Today Dornberger became so popular that his memoir about the V 2 originally published in West Germany in 1952 was published in America in 1954 In these pages Dornberger was able to reengineer his professional history from that of warmongering Nazi general to beneficent science pioneer According to Dornberger the research and development that had gone into the V 2 at Peenemünde was a romantic science laboratory by the sea affair There was no mention made of the slave labor facility at Nordhausen or the slaves at Peenemünde The book was originally titled V 2 The Shot into Space V 2 Der Schuss ins All It would be nice to know who invented the subtitle says Michael J Neufeld which so neatly captures the reinvention of a Nazi terror weapon as the space rocket it most certainly was not In 1957 Dornberger seemed to have found his true post Nazi calling attempting to sell Bell Aircraft s BoMi bomber missile to the Pentagon BoMi was a rocket powered manned spacecraft designed for nuclear combat in space Occasionally and behind closed doors usually at the Pentagon Dornberger faced challenges He was once pitching the benefits of BoMi to an audience of air force officials when abusive and insulting remarks were shouted at him according to air force historian Roy F Houchin II In that instance Dornberger is said to have turned on his audience and insisted that BoMi would receive a lot more respect if Dornberger had had a chance to fly it against the United States during a war There was deafening silence in the room Houchin noted In 1958 the FBI opened an investigation into General Dornberger based on an insider s tip that he might be engaged in secret discussions with Communist spies The special agent who interviewed Dornberger did not

satisfactorily in the role of a double agent Dornberger was a cunning man and this quality coupled with his scientific acumen served him No matter what the circumstances Dornberger always seemed to come out on top Wernher von Braun became the biggest celebrity of the Operation Paperclip scientists By 1950 the army decided that it required a much larger facility to research and develop longer range rockets so the Fort Bliss rocket team moved from Texas to the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville Alabama There the German scientists began work on the army s Jupiter ballistic missile The group had launched sixty four V 2s from White Sands At the same time von Braun was ambitiously developing a persona for himself as America s prophet of space travel Rockets outer space and interplanetary travel had gained a foothold in American culture It was the dream of many 1950s American children to fly into outer space and von Braun and Dornberger became national spokesmen on this issue They promised the nation that the army s development of a ballistic missile was the necessary first step in reaching outer space In 1952 von Braun experienced a breakthrough in his role of national space advocate when Collier s magazine paid him 4 000 approximately 36 000 in 2013 to write the lead article in what would eventually become an eight part series on future space travel edited by Cornelius Ryan Within the next 10 or 15 years von Braun wrote the earth will have a new companion in the skies a man made satellite that could be either the greatest force for peace ever devised or one of the most terrible weapons of war depending on who makes and controls it This space satellite or station would also be a terribly effective atomic bomb carrier von Braun added From its earliest days space travel would be intertwined with war making It still is In addition to earning von Braun a small fortune the Collier s magazine series propelled him into the national spotlight increasing his fame and

Christianity and democracy In the article von Braun claimed that during the war he opposed Nazism and was never in a position to do anything but follow orders The piece earned him an award for patriotic writing even though it had been written by a ghostwriter The article was reprinted in at least one book and explains Michael J Neufeld would thereafter be taken as a fundamental source by many later journalists and authors The national attention caught the eye of Walt Disney Studios in Burbank California and an executive called von Braun to see if he wanted to film a couple of space related shows for a new television series that Disney was working on For over a year von Braun had been trying to find a New York publisher for the science fiction novel he had written while living in the Texas desert By this time the novel had been rejected by eighteen publishers The Disney contract offered a wider road to fame and von Braun signed on The first Disneyland TV broadcast in which von Braun appeared in 1955 called Man in Space had an estimated 42 million viewers and was reported to be the second highest rated television show in American history at the time The following month on April 15 1955 von Braun and many of his fellow German rocket scientists became U S citizens in a public ceremony held in the Huntsville High School auditorium In 1958 von Braun and his team launched America s first successful space satellite Explorer I as a quick response to the Soviets Sputnik Kurt Debus was in charge of the launch In 1960 von Braun and a group of approximately 120 Operation Paperclip scientists engineers and technicians were transferred from the army to the newly established National Aeronautics and Space Administration or NASA with a mandate to build the Saturn rockets designed to take man to the moon Von Braun was made director of the new NASA facility the Marshall Space Flight Center also located at the Redstone Arsenal as well as chief architect of the Saturn V

engineering colleague over to the Gestapo for making anti Hitler remarks To house the giant Saturn rocket NASA constructed the Vertical Assembly Building on nearby Merritt Island The structure would soon become the most voluminous building in the world larger than the Pentagon and almost as tall as the Washington Monument It was designed by Bernhard Tessmann former facilities designer at Peenemünde and Nordhausen and one of the two men who at war s end stashed the V 2 documents in the Dörnten mine As had Dornberger von Braun worked carefully to whitewash his Nazi past He knew never to speak of the fact that he had become a Nazi Party member in 1937 When a reporter once asked him incorrectly about his joining the party in 1942 von Braun put his scientist s precision aside and chose not to correct the newsman Instead von Braun did what he always did he said that he d been coerced into joining the Nazi Party Never did von Braun speak of the SS cavalry unit he joined in 1933 or that he was made an SS officer in 1944 and wore the SS officer s uniform with its swastika on the armband and its cap with the death s head image With a revelation like that he could have been deported under the Internal Security Act of 1950 which was meant to keep Communists out of the country but also covered anyone who had held membership in a totalitarian dictatorship Instead the fact that he was an officer with the SS remained a jealously guarded secret by all parties von Braun the U S military and NASA until CNN journalist Linda Hunt broke the story in 1985 But the dark shadow of

reached out to Haber rubbed a piece of the scientist s leather coat between his fingers and said wryly Human skin of course As man got closer and closer to the moon Wernher von Braun enjoyed a parallel ascent in fortune and in fame Because von Braun was a public figure his Nazi past was always there but in shadow By the 1960s it was sometimes treated as a joke One night before an Apollo mission von Braun stormed out of a press conference after a reporter asked him if he could guarantee that the rocket would not hit London Tom Lehrer wrote a song famously satirizing von Braun Once the rockets are up who cares where they come down That s not my department says Wernher von Braun Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick created a von Braun inspired character in his black comedy Dr Strangelove in which a mad scientist famously gets out of a wheelchair and cries Mein Führer I can walk But in 1963 in East Berlin a popular author and lawyer named Julius Mader wrote a book called The Secret of Huntsville The True Career of Rocket Baron Wernher von Braun On the dust jacket there was a drawing of von Braun wearing a black SS Sturmbannführer s uniform Around von Braun s neck was the Knight s Cross bestowed upon him by Albert Speer at the Castle Varlar event The book published by Deutscher Militärverlag portrayed von Braun as an ardent Nazi and included detailed pages about the murderous conditions at the slave labor facility at Nordhausen where von Braun oversaw work and at the Dora Nordhausen concentration camp which supplied the slave laborers Several German speaking U S citizens alerted NASA about the allegations against von Braun as if NASA did not know The space agency s three top officials James E Webb Hugh Dryden and Robert Seamans discussed the situation with von Braun and counseled him on how to handle it If anyone were to ask him about this matter NASA administrator James Webb told von Braun pointedly his answer was to be Everything related to my past activity in

secret police the revelations lost their potential power If need be Mader s book could be discounted as Sovietengineered lies meant only to damage the prestige of the U S space program The Secret of Huntsville The True Career of Rocket Baron Wernher von Braun was a success in the Eastern bloc It was also translated into Russian and sold half a million copies in the Soviet Union The book inspired a Soviet sponsored film Die Gefrorenen Blitze Frozen Lightning also written by Mader and released by the East German state film studio DEFA Deutsche Film Aktiengesellschaft in 1967 The same year West German prosecutors opened a new Dora Nordhausen trial this one called the Essen Dora trial An SS guard a Gestapo official and the chief of security for the V 2 were all charged with war crimes that took place while V weapons were being built in the Mittelwerk tunnel complex Mittelwerk general manager and former Paperclip scientist Georg Rickhey was called as a witness as was Wernher von Braun Rickhey who lived in Germany took the stand He testified under oath that he did not know about the Dora Nordhausen concentration camp that he learned about it after the war I don t know much more because they were secret concentration camps Rickhey told the court It was a secret commando group in charge Eyes only There were bad catastrophic conditions at Nordhausen but I learned about this only after the war This was an absurd misrepresentation of the truth Back in America NASA general counsel refused to send the star of their space program to Germany this would open Pandora s box Instead they allowed von Braun to deliver oral testimony at a West German consulate in the United States As a venue NASA lawyers suggested New Orleans Louisiana a place about as far away from the

between the rocket engineer the SS and the concentration camps NASA s moon program would never survive that kind of publicity and the State Department denied Dr Friedrich Kaul a visa Instead at the courthouse in Louisiana von Braun answered questions put to him by a German judge As the U S Army had done with the 1947 Nordhausen trial the government sealed von Braun s testimony Word leaked to the news media that von Braun had been deposed for a war crimes trial causing von Braun to issue a brief statement on the matter He said he had nothing to hide and I am not implicated When a reporter asked if there had been any concentration camp prisoners used as slave laborers at Peenemünde von Braun said no The judge prosecuting the Essen Dora trial also took the testimony of General Dornberger in Mexico where the now retired Dornberger spent winters with his wife Some months later von Braun and Dornberger corresponded about the matter In regards to the testimony fortunately I too have heard nothing more wrote von Braun No news was good news for both men After the Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969 columnist Drew Pearson whose fierce exposés of Major General Dr Walter Schreiber had helped to banish the man from America wrote in his column that von Braun had been a member of the SS But von Braun s glory had reached epic proportions and Pearson s article went by relatively unnoticed Von Braun was an American hero Citizens all across the nation showered him with praise glory and the confetti of ticker tape parades After the Apollo space program ended von Braun moved into the private sector In his new life as a defense contractor he traveled the world and met its leaders including Indira Gandhi the Shah of Iran and Crown Prince Juan Carlos of Spain In 1973 he decided

Presidential Medal of Freedom The idea almost passed until one of President Ford s senior advisers David Gergen famously wrote in a note passed to colleagues Sorry but I can t support the idea of

years before the intrepid CNN reporter Linda Hunt became the first person to crack the pretense of Wernher von Braun It took a Freedom of Information Act FOIA record release to reveal Wernher von Braun s Nazi past Dr Hubertus Strughold though never as famous as Wernher von Braun played an equally vital role in the U S space program in the field of medicine In November 1948 fifteen months after Strughold arrived at the School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Air Force Base he and Commandant Harry Armstrong hosted the first ever U S military panel discussion on biology in space Strughold served as professional adviser to Armstrong at the SAM and he oversaw the work of approximately thirty four German colleagues under Operation Paperclip contracts there Strughold s broader vision which he shared with Armstrong was to create a space medicine program for the U S Air Force In 1948 the notion of human space flight was still considered science fiction by most But Strughold s team had recently conducted a groundbreaking experiment with von Braun s rocket team at White Sands the results of which they desired to make public On June 11 1948 a nine pound rhesus monkey named Albert was strapped into a harness inside the nose cone of a V 2 rocket and jettisoned into space Albert s pressurized space capsule its harness and its cage had been designed by Dr Strughold and his team The V

was time to seek funding for a new department inside the SAM dedicated solely to researching space medicine For this Armstrong later explained we needed much larger accommodations more space and facilities and much more sophisticated research equipment Armstrong traveled to Washington D C to sell the idea to Congress and to explain that he and Dr Strughold needed between fifteen and twenty years lead time to do the necessary research to prepare humans for space travel Congress approved Armstrong s idea There were no wild headlines Armstrong later explained The Department of Space Medicine at the SAM opened with little fanfare on February 9 1949 I appointed myself Director of the new aerospace laboratory not Dr Strughold since there were sic still some lingering enmity toward the Germans Armstrong told an air force historian in 1976 But just a few months after the department officially opened Armstrong was transferred to the Pentagon to serve as surgeon general of the U S Air Force The man he was replacing was his long time mentor Major General Malcolm Grow Back in Texas Dr Strughold was promoted to the position of scientific director of the Department of Space Medicine at SAM Strughold continued to oversee the professional activities of the Paperclip scientists He also played an active role in further recruiting endeavors In the fall of 1949 he traveled to

acquitted at the Nuremberg doctors trial was able to secure a Paperclip contract with Dr Strughold s help Konrad Schäfer the thirst and thirst quenching expert who had participated in the planning and execution of the saltwater experiments at Dachau arrived at the School of Aviation Medicine in August 1949 In Texas Schäfer s military research was supervised by Dr Strughold and an air force captain named Seymour Schwartz During Schäfer s time at SAM he worked in three departments internal medicine radiobiology and pharmacology One of his research projects involved an effort to make Mississippi River water drinkable Konrad Schäfer s American supervisor found him inept The scientist Schäfer has been singularly unsuccessful in producing any finished work and has displayed very little real scientific acumen Captain Schwartz wrote The experience of this Headquarters indicates that this man is a most ineffective research worker and on the basis of his performance here his future worth to the U S Armed Forces is nil In a letter to the director of intelligence at U S Air Force headquarters in Washington D C in March 1951 Captain Schwartz requested that Schäfer s Paperclip contract be terminated and that he be sent back to Germany The air force terminated Schäfer s contract but the German doctor refused to leave the United States Thanks to expedited protocols put in place by the JIOA Schäfer was already in possession of a valid U S immigration visa by the time it was determined that he was incompetent He moved to New York City to work in the private sector In the early 1950s the School of Aviation Medicine and its Department of Space Medicine swiftly gained momentum as formidable medical research laboratories The Journal of Aviation Medicine began publishing articles on space medicine including ones written by Paperclip scientists and covering topics like weightlessness urinating in zero gravity and the effects of cosmic radiation on humans There was also classified military research going on at the SAM including experiments involving human test subjects In January 1994 President Clinton created the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments to investigate and report on the use of human beings in medical research related to Cold War atomic tests The Advisory Committee found many of these experiments to be criminal and to be in violation of the Nuremberg

Energy Commission AEC and the Department of Defense conducted aboveground nuclear weapons tests in the Nevada desert at a facility called the Nevada Proving Ground and later renamed the Nevada Test Site The experiments were designed to determine how soldiers and airmen would perform on the nuclear battlefield The AEC and the DoD agreed that subjecting soldiers to blast and radiation effects of various sized atomic bombs was required to accurately prepare for a nuclear war Colonel John E Pickering was the director of medical research at the SAM in the early 1950s In this capacity Pickering oversaw the research of two German doctors working on a group of AEC studies involving flashblindness the temporary or permanent blindness caused by looking at a nuclear weapon during detonation According to testimony Colonel Pickering gave to the Advisory Committee in 1994 one set of flashblindness studies had been suggested by Dr Strughold Pickering said Strughold was interested in learning about permanent eye damage based on the fact that he himself had been partially blinded in one eye as a boy after watching a solar eclipse with a faulty viewing glass That s the thing that gave us curiosity Pickering recalled of Strughold s accident Among the Paperclip scientists who carried out the initial flashblindness studies were Heinrich Rose and Konrad Büttner Both men had been working for the U S government since the fall of 1945 when Dr Strughold first recommended them for employment at the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg And like so many of Strughold s close Luftwaffe colleagues Rose and Büttner had been Nazi ideologues during the war Both men were long term members of the Nazi Party and also members of the SA For the first set of flashblindness studies Rose and Büttner s test subjects were large pigs The two doctors calculated that the flash of a 20 kiloton atomic bomb could produce retinal burns as far a s forty miles from ground zero As the atomic tests progressed the Atomic Energy Commission sought more specific data regarding humans In the fall of 1951 for an atomic test series called Operation Buster Jangle soldier volunteers were asked to

out the windows of the airplane when the bomb went off Some wore protective eye goggles while others did not No visual handicaps were reported according to Pickering In the spring of 1952 for an atomic test series called Operation Tumbler Snapper a trailer was set up on the Nevada desert floor with porthole like windows at viewing range Soldier volunteers were asked to sit in front of the windows and stare at the nuclear explosion The distance from ground zero was also approximately nine miles only this time the soldiers were at blast level One of the volunteers in the viewing trailer was Colonel Pickering who said that some of the human test subjects were given protective eye goggles to wear but others were asked to observe the fireball with the naked eye Two soldiers had their eyeballs burned and the trailer tests were suspended In the spring of 1953 for an atomic test series called Operation Upshot Knothole soldier volunteers were asked to perform duck and cover drills inside five foot deep trenches that had been dug into the desert floor several miles from ground zero The men were specifically instructed not to look at the atomic blast But curiosity got the better of at least one young officer a twenty two yearold lieutenant identified in declassified records as S H Instead of facing away from the blast the lieutenant looked over his left shoulder in the direction of the atomic bomb when it detonated with a force of 43 kilotons He didn t wear his goggles and he looked Colonel Pickering told President Clinton s Advisory Committee in 1994 Because light enters the eye through the cornea and is refracted when it hits the lens Pickering explained images are flipped upside down As a result the image of an inverted nuclear fireball was seared on the lieutenant s retina forever leaving what Pickering described as probably one of the most beautiful images of a fireball you d ever see in your life Pickering said that doctors at the SAM kept a photograph of the man s eyeball for their collection The Advisory Committee determined that the SAM continued its classified flashblindness studies until at least 1962 but that most of the records had

the point at which outer space begins and reached an altitude of 83 miles Albert II died back on Earth on impact when his parachute failed to open By 1952 Strughold had succeeded in convincing the air force to fund the construction of a sealed chamber or capsule to be used for space medicine research on humans The cabin was designed by fellow Paperclip scientist Fritz Haber brother of Heinz Haber and completed in 1954 The sealed chamber was one hundred cubic square feet with a single seat and an instrument panel and was meant to duplicate the conditions that an astronaut would experience during a voyage to the moon The first human test was conducted in March 1956 when an airman named D F Smith spent twenty four hours inside the chamber performing various tasks while being monitored by Strughold and his team Approximately two years later in February 1958 pilot Donald G Farrell a twenty three year old native of the Bronx chosen from a pool of rigorously screened airmen stepped into the chamber for seven consecutive days and nights This time period Strughold explained was inspired by Jules Verne s prediction of how long it would take for a spaceship to get to the moon During the test Strughold and Hans Georg Clamann Strughold s former assistant during the Luftwaffe years as well as two air force colleagues monitored Donald Farrell s vitals and his ability to perform tasks The space capsule simulator test with airman Donald Farrell attracted all kinds of media attention On the seventh and final day Texas senator Lyndon B Johnson stopped by the School of Aviation Medicine to personally escort Farrell out of the chamber and join him at a press conference Dr Strughold stood by Farrell s side as did General Otis Benson the man who had tried and failed to find Major General Dr Walter Schreiber a teaching position so he could remain in America Benson singled out Strughold for his excellent work in the name of medical science So excited was Lyndon Johnson by the event that

later recalled the event After the soup Lyndon Johnson asked me to give a five minute talk about the scope of space medicine and the meaning of the experiment Hubertus Strughold like Wernher von Braun and Walter Dornberger was now an accepted member of the U S military scientific elite But there was a bump in the road In May 1958 Time magazine featured a piece about Strughold showering him with praise as America s space medicine research pioneer In response the widely read Saturday Review published an editorial by Julian Bach Jr a former war correspondent for the Army Talks series of pamphlets for GIs and the first American correspondent to report in the general press on medical experiments on human beings by Nazi doctors during World War II Bach s editorial was called Himmler the Scientist In it the war correspondent reminded the public of the human experiments that the Nazi doctors had conducted on prisoners in concentration camps The German doctors carving them up were medical men of stature in many cases wrote Bach Only the fewest were quacks Bach correctly linked Strughold to the freezing experiments at Dachau stating that at minimum he had knowledge of them This was the first time the public had heard anything about Dr Strughold having knowledge of the medical murder experiments a fact he had previously been able to keep hidden The article prompted an investigation at the federal level Because Strughold had become a U S citizen two years prior in 1956 the Immigration and Naturalization Service INS was now compelled to investigate But after checking with the air force the INS released a statement saying that Strughold had been appropriately investigated before becoming a U S citizen The INS had not been shown Strughold s OMGUS security report or his classified dossier If it had been INS would have learned that military intelligence had concluded that Strughold s successful career under Hitler would seem to indicate that he must be in full accord with Nazism In October 1958 the twenty ninth meeting of the Aero Medical Association convened in San Antonio Texas for a daylong symposium Aviation Medicine on the Threshold of Space The group

attendance had been brought to America from Germany as part of Operation Paperclip They were American citizens now A prolific writer Strughold authored papers and journals sometimes more than a dozen in a year He had contributed a piece about space cabins to the Collier s magazine series He created new space related nomenclature including the words bioastronautics gravisphere ecosphere and astrobiology He studied jet lag how the body responds to flight and wrote a book about his findings Your Body Clock In 1964 he was interviewed by the space writer and journalist Shirley Thomas for her eight volume series Men of Space Now with nearly two decades of distance between himself and his Nazi past and with so many accolades to his name Strughold began to construct a fictional past for himself one in which he had actually been an opponent of the Nazis I was against Hitler and his beliefs Strughold told Shirley Thomas I sometimes tried to hide myself because my life was in danger from the Nazis he said This was of course absurd Strughold was among the highest ranking doctor professors in the Luftwaffe Were you ever forced to join the Nazi Party Thomas asked It was tried Strughold said They tried it but failed Strughold told Thomas that the same went for the staff at his Aviation Medical Research Institute in Berlin Only the janitor and the man who took care of the animals were members of the Nazi Party Strughold lied It was as if his close colleagues from the Nazi era Doctors Siegfried Ruff Konrad Schäfer Hermann Becker Freyseng and Oskar Schröder did not exist

a copy of the documents pertaining to the conference Medical Problems of Sea Distress and Winter Distress at the Hotel Deutscher Hof in Nuremberg in 1942 including the travel expenses that Strughold had submitted and the amount he was paid to attend The Luftwaffe doctors in attendance had discussed the medical data of murdered people But knowledge was not a crime and there was no further action for the Central Office of the State Justice Administration to take Rückerl said A few months later toward the end of 1973 the U S Immigration and Naturalization Service announced that it was investigating Strughold and thirty four other long dormant cases of Nazi war criminal suspects living in the United States That Strughold s name was on the list which was published in the New York Times came as a shock to him Strughold rehearsed a succinct response for reporters the same as von Braun had when allegations arose I was cleared before I came here before I was hired Strughold said Leaders of Jewish groups sprang into action and Charles R Allen Jr the former senior editor of The Nation writing for Jewish Currents presented evidence about Strughold s knowledge of human experiments Allen had acquired the first public copy of the proceedings of the Nuremberg medical conference at the Hotel Deutscher Hof in 1942 which included a list of those in attendance On this list were five other Nazi doctors who had worked in America under Operation Paperclip Major General Walter Schreiber Konrad Schäfer Hans Georg Clamann Konrad Büttner and Theodor Benzinger but neither Charles R Allen Jr nor anyone else involved in the Strughold exposé appears to have recognized any of these names Twenty years prior Major General Walter Schreiber had been fired from the SAM and

periodically as they were freezing to death the victims suffered agonizing deaths after which they were dissected for data INS director Leonard Chapman made inquiries with the U S Air Force and was told that there was no derogatory information on Strughold The case was closed yet again Now more than ever Strughold felt the need to promote the fiction that he was anti Nazi In an air force oral history interview that took place two days after Blumenthal s piece ran in the New York Times Strughold told interviewer James C Hasdorff that during the war he constantly feared for his life He said that he had been written up on Hitler s so called enemy list Strughold insisted that at one point shortly after the attempted assassination of Hitler by Count Claus von Stauffenberg in July 1944 he Strughold had to go into hiding because he was receiving death threats that he went from farmhouse to farmhouse until it was finally safe to return to Berlin This was an absurd distortion of reality In the months after the Stauffenberg incident in the winter of 1945 Hubertus Strughold had been promoted to full colonel in the Luftwaffe reserves Three years passed The spotlight moved away In a ceremony on January 19 1977 a bronze plaque bearing a portrait of Dr Hubertus Strughold was unveiled in San Antonio Texas in the foyer at the Aeromedical Library at the School of Aerospace Medicine The library which was the largest medical library in the U S Air Force was being dedicated to Dr Hubertus Strughold the Father of Space Medicine The air force promised that Strughold s bronze plaque

Cracow Poland in 1947 in which a number of camp functionaries were tried including Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss who was sentenced to death and hanged But before the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial which ran through 1965 Germany had not conducted any major war crimes trials of its own The Nuremberg trials of course were presided over by the Allied forces At the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial 360 witnesses from 19 countries including 211 Auschwitz survivors would confront the accused The judges hearing the case were all Germans Throughout the 1950s Germany s political and legal elite had opposed holding these kinds of trials for a variety of reasons but mostly because it would likely generate additional trials Just as it behooved U S military intelligence to keep the details of Operation Paperclip a secret so it went for many German jurists Thousand of their fellow citizens had committed heinous crimes during the war and were now living perfectly normal and sometimes very productive lives But in 1963 with the trial under way for the first time since 1945 people in Germany were openly talking about gas chambers death camps and the Holocaust The trial was triggered by a letter I received recalled Hermann Langbein the secretary of the International Auschwitz Committee It was mailed to me by an Auschwitz survivor A German named Rögner At Auschwitz where both Langbein and Rögner had been prisoners the SS guards had made Rögner a kapo someone who supervised slave laborers He was a kapo in an electrical detail explained Langbein a decent kapo There were some decent kapos there at Auschwitz In Rögner s letter to Langbein he wrote I know where Boger is Boger was a loaded name to anyone who had survived Auschwitz Survivors knew Boger as the Tiger of Auschwitz Wilhelm Boger was a man of indisputable evil Witnesses watched him murder children on the train ramps with his own hands In Rögner s letter to Langbein he said that he d filed murder charges against Boger with the German authorities in Stuttgart In the spring of 1958 in his capacity as the secretary of the International Auschwitz Committee Hermann Langbein followed up on Rögner s tip and discovered that Boger was

these men under scrutiny at the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial Germany faced its past through the lens of its own jurists not American judges Many young Germans paid attention and began to wonder how so many war criminals could have gotten away with so many war crimes for so long More important to the Operation Paperclip legacy is that when Rögner filed his civil suit he named another name Dr Otto Ambros Ambros was listed as a criminal in Rögner s complaint because he had been general manager of IG Farben s Buna factory at Auschwitz German prosecutors looked into the Ambros case and saw that

during his own trial at Nuremberg in 1947 He also said that the conditions at the Auschwitz Buna factory had been cozy and that the workers had enjoyed good hospitality which many Auschwitz survivors found appalling in its offensiveness While contradictory statements might have gone unnoticed by Frankfurt s judges and jurors there were a number of high profile Israeli journalists in the courtroom who had become experts on the subject and caught Ambros s lies These journalists began at once to investigate Otto Ambros s post Nuremberg life Here was a man who had been convicted of slavery and mass murder and had served very little time considering the crimes The Farben slaves at Auschwitz numbered sixty thousand approximately thirty thousand of whom had been worked to death The journalists covering the trial were outraged by what they discovered Otto Ambros now sat on the board of directors of numerous private corporations but he was also on the board of directors of five companies that were owned by the Federal Republic of Germany The exorbitant fees Ambros commanded in these positions were being paid by the German taxpayer An Israeli female journalist identified in Bundesarchiv

suggest that he had been wrongly convicted at Nuremberg In a letter dated April 25 1964 Ambros reminded Finance Minister Westrick that after he had been released from Landsberg Prison in 1951 You helped me get back on the boards For this Ambros said he was grateful I see it as an honor and a duty to remain there I do this for pure altruistic reasons I appreciate anything you can do In turn Finance Minister Westrick wrote letters to the various boards on Ambros s behalf Ambros was chosen for the board because of exceptional talent Westrick said In his field he is as wanted as Wernher von Braun Everyone wants him He can get a job anywhere he wants anywhere in the world The Israeli journalists refused to let up on Otto Ambros They continued to write news stories about him making it increasingly difficult for both the Federal Republic of Germany and the publicly traded companies on whose boards Ambros sat to maintain business associations with him Former War Criminal Found Refuge

trying to blame him In late summer of 1964 AEG s board members met and decided that they could no longer retain convicted war criminal Otto Ambros Ambros then also quietly left at least two of the five taxpayerfunded consulting positions he held on Federal Republic of Germany boards In separate letters to Finance Minister Ludger Westrick and Deputy Finance Minister Dr Dollinger a new secret was revealed though Ambros promised not to make public a piece of the information they shared Concerning the firms abroad where I am a permanent co worker advisor Ambros wrote I won t name them publicly because I don t want to tip off any journalists who might cause trouble with my friends You know about W R Grace in New York and I hope I can stay with Hibernia Company Concerning the firms in Israel Ambros wrote stating their names publicly would be very embarrassing because they are run by very public well respected persons in public positions that have actually been at my home and are aware of my position how I behaved during the Reich and they accept this The well respected public figures in Israel to whom Ambros referred have never been revealed That Ambros also had worked for the American company W R Grace would take decades to come to light When it did in the early 1980s the public would also learn that Otto Ambros worked as a consultant for the U S Department of Energy

San Francisco Chronicle telephoned Ambros at his home in Mannheim Germany and asked Ambros about his 1948 conviction at Nuremberg for mass murder and slavery This happened a very long time ago Ambros told the reporter It involved Jews We do not think about it anymore The third act of Dr Kurt Blome s life contradicts the idea that the Soviets were desperately trying to hire Hitler s former biological weapons maker In February 1962 a group of Communist physicians from Karl Marx University in Leipzig East Germany sent an open letter to all the doctors and dentists living in Dortmund as well as many widely distributed newspapers regarding the matter of the Dortmund physician Dr Kurt Blome The letter listed the war crimes Blome had been accused of at the Nuremberg doctors trial and stated that everyone in the town of Dortmund should know who he is and what he did to the Jewish people The Leipzig doctors identified the doctor in Dortmund as the Deputy Surgeon General of the Third Reich They wrote that Western German medical colleagues should distance themselves from this man who dares to call himself a doctor Blome was contacted by the East German radio station Radio Berlin

pawn of the Russians It s a sworn lie Blome spent the rest of his radio time blaming Schreiber for his own misfortunes He ended by pointing out his innocence Blome reminded the radio announcer that he had endured a ten month trial at Nuremberg I was acquitted on every point that there was Blome said The U S judges were not easy They handed out seven death penalties and five lifelong imprisonments If I had been guilty they would have convicted me The allegations opened a subsequent investigation into Blome Two weeks later on April 4 1962 the state s attorney in Dortmund wrote to the Central Office of the State Justice Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes to see if there was anything on Dr Kurt Blome The state s attorney put together a dossier on Blome with most of the focus on a letter Blome had written on November 18 1942 to Reich Governor Reichsstatthalter Arthur Karl Greiser mayor of a Polish area near Posen and subsequently executed for war crimes The subject matter was Sonderbehandlung or special treatment of Poles with tuberculosis By now in 1962 it had been established that Sonderbehandlung was a Nazi euphemism for extermination In this 1942 correspondence Blome and Greiser agreed that the best way to deal with this group of tubercular Poles being discussed was to give them special treatment But Blome also raises a problem that had to be dealt with namely that if these tubercular Poles were to be exterminated t he general perception by relatives would be that something unorthodox is going on Blome reminds Reich Governor Greiser that

Blome said that Dr Schreiber was the true murderer and that he had framed Dr Blome to deflect the guilt away from himself After several days of consideration on May 21 1962 the state s attorney placed the investigation of Dr Blome on hold Blome continued to practice medicine in Dortmund and the case against him was never reopened Three years later Blome was dead He died of emphysema says his son who also reports that by the time of his father s death Dr Kurt Blome was alone and estranged from the world Albert Speer served all twenty years of his sentence at Spandau Prison outside Berlin despite the efforts by John J McCloy as U S High Commissioner for Germany to get Speer released earlier In 1956 McCloy wrote to Speer s wife Margarete I have a very strong conviction that your husband should be released and would be very happy if I could do anything to expedite such a release In prison Speer secretly worked on the memoirs he would publish upon his release On pieces of toilet paper cigarette wrappers and paper scraps he jotted down recollections of his days working alongside Hitler and the inner circle It was illegal to write and send unscreened notes out of Spandau so Speer had his writing smuggled out by two sympathetic Dutch Red Cross nurses The notes were delivered to Speer s old friend and colleague Rudolf Wolters a diehard Hitler loyalist living in Berlin Over the course of twenty years Wolters painstakingly typed up tens of thousands of these individual paper scraps that Speer continued to send to him After twenty years they amounted to a thousand page

for his twenty years of work at least not in his book and not publicly A decade later Speer defended this decision to his biographer Gitta Sereny saying I t was for Wolters s own protection Wolters s son reported that when Wolters died the last word he uttered was Speer After Speer sent Wernher von Braun a copy of Spandau von Braun wrote a letter to his old friend and former boss at the Reich s Ministry of Armaments and War Production pointing out how divergent their lives had been over the past twenty years While Speer had been at Spandau Prison von Braun s star had risen steadily He thanked Speer for the book How often I thought of you during those last twenty long years when so much was happening in my life wrote von Braun When Siegfried Knemeyer learned that Albert Speer was out of prison Knemeyer took a trip to visit his old friend in Germany The last time the two men had seen each other was in Berlin in April 1945 when Knemeyer was helping Speer plot his escape to Greenland In the years that Speer had been in prison Knemeyer had been working for the United States formerly the sworn enemy of both men As an employee of the U S Air Force in the 1940s 1950s 1960s and 1970s Knemeyer worked on classified and unclassified projects won awards and rose up through the ranks For the air force he established the Pilot Factors Program which coordinated technologies as

I think he should have been hanged Albert Speer died in a London hotel room in 1981 He was in town doing an interview for the BBC One seldom recognizes when the Devil puts his hand on your shoulder Albert Speer told James P O Donnell in a New York Times Magazine interview shortly after his release from Spandau He was referring to Hitler but might have been talking about himself CHAPTER TWENTY THREE What Lasts In the 1970s several events led to a major shift in the American public s perception of the Holocaust Nazis and the United States A series of congressional oversight hearings were convened as a result of many high profile cases of Nazi war criminals found living in America The hearings drew attention to the fact that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had been negligent in its investigations of these individuals and in turn led to the creation of the Justice Department s Office of Special Investigations Then came the 1978 broadcast of NBC s four part miniseries Holocaust which broke records for family viewing and made Americans who had never contemplated the Holocaust think seriously about what had happened in Nazi Germany and what the state sponsored murder of six million people really meant These events set the stage for a simple fortuitous occurrence for a young Harvard law student named Eli Rosenbaum the consequences of which would profoundly impact the Paperclip scientists who had something to hide In 1980 Eli Rosenbaum was perusing book titles inside a Cambridge bookstore when he came across Dora The Nazi Concentration Camp Where Modern Space Technology Was Born and 30 000 Prisoners Died written by a former Dora prisoner the French Resistance fighter Jean Michel The narrative is detailed and revelatory in its brutal honesty Jean Michel

about Nordhausen I do not reproach these men with not having made public confessions after the war Michel writes I do not hold it against the scientists that they did not choose to be martyrs when they discovered the truth about the death camps No mine is a more modest objective I make my stand solely against the monstrous distortion of history which in silencing certain facts and glorifying others has given birth to false foul and suspect myths In that same Cambridge bookstore on that same day Eli Rosenbaum came across a second book about the V 2 rocket This one was called The Rocket Team and was written by Frederick I Ordway III and Mitchell R Sharpe with an introduction by Wernher von Braun The book discusses and quotes the German scientists involved in the U S rocket program In one part of the book engineer Arthur Rudolph praised as the developer of NASA s Saturn V rocket program shares his thoughts with the authors Rudolph is not identified as having once been operations director at the Mittelwerk slave labor facility Rudolph relates an anecdote from the war concerning his dismay at being called away from a New Year s Eve party in 1943 44 because of a problem with some of the V 2 rockets An accompanying photograph shows a POW in striped prisoner pajamas moving rocket parts Eli Rosenbaum had spent the previous summer working for the Department of Justice in its Office of Special Investigations He knew that the Geneva Convention forbade nations from forcing prisoners of war to work on munitions He had also just read about what went on in the Nordhausen tunnels in Jean Michel s book Dora Rosenbaum later recalled that he was particularly offended by Rudolph s taking umbrage at missing a gala party while slave laborers toiled The following year after graduating from Harvard Law School Rosenbaum started full time work at the Department of Justice as a trial lawyer He persuaded his boss Neal M Sher to open an investigation into Arthur Rudolph In

so Marianne Rudolph who worked as an artist for NASA told the caller that her parents were vacationing in Germany and would be back at the end of the month The day after the Rudolphs returned Arthur Rudolph received a registered letter in the mail from the Department of Justice Office of Special Investigations The letter stated that questions had been raised regarding Arthur Rudolph s activities during the Second World War Rudolph was asked to meet with DOJ officials at the San Jose Hyatt on October 13 and to bring any documents with him that he owned covering the period between 1933 and 1945 During this first meeting which included Arthur Rudolph OSI director Allan A Ryan Jr Deputy Director Neal M Sher and trial attorney Eli Rosenbaum the interview lasted five hours There were two central questions the lawyers wanted answered Owing to what set of principles had Rudolph decided to join the Nazi Party which he did in 1933 and what exactly did he know about the Nordhausen executions specifically about the prisoners who had been hanged from a crane DOJ lawyers Allen Sher and Rosenbaum had documents with them including the previously sealed testimony from the 1947 Dora Nordhausen trial These documents included pretrial investigative material regarding former Paperclip specialist Georg Rickhey Among the documents was the interview that Rudolph gave on June 2 1947 to Major Eugene Smith of the U S Army Air Force In that testimony Rudolph had first said that he never saw any prisoners beaten or hanged Later in the interview with Major Smith Rudolph changed his story to say that he had been forced to watch the hangings but had nothing to do with them During the San Jose Hyatt interview in 1982 the three Justice Department lawyers presented Rudolph with the drawing made by his former Nordhausen colleagues from Fort Bliss the rocket engineers Günther Haukohl Rudolph Schlidt Hans Palaoro and Erich Ball This drawing illustrated the layout inside the tunnels and had

hangings The lawyers asked why he had lied They also asked Rudolph about testimony from the 1947 Dora Nordhausen trial that revealed that at the Mittelwerk tunnel complex he received daily prisoner strength reports which showed the number of prisoners available for work the number of new arrivals and the number of people lost through sickness or death They said that clearly Rudolph knew people were being worked to death and were being replaced by fresh bodies from the Dora Nordhausen concentration camp Back in Washington D C the Justice Department put together its case Four months later on February 4 1983 a second meeting took place at the San Jose Hyatt and shortly thereafter Rudolph received a letter from the Justice Department in the mail Certain preliminary decisions have now been made wrote Neal Sher I would be prepared to discuss these decisions as well as the evidence amassed to date with an attorney authorized to represent your interest The government stated intentions to pursue its case against Arthur Rudolph showing that Mr Rudolph enforced the slave labor system at Mittelbau Mittelwerk and aided in the transmission of sabotage reports to the SS Arthur Rudolph had two choices the Justice Department said He could hire a lawyer and prepare to stand trial or alternatively he could renounce his U S citizenship and leave the country at once Thirty eight years after coming to America as part of Operation Paperclip Arthur Rudolph left the United States on March 27 1984 Neal Sher met Arthur Rudolph at the San Francisco International Airport and made sure he got on the airplane It was another seven months before the Justice Department made public that Arthur Rudolph had renounced his citizenship so as to avoid facing a war crimes trial When asked to comment Eli Rosenbaum said that Arthur Rudolph had contributed to the death of thousands of slave laborers But Rosenbaum also said that it was Rudolph s almost unbelievable callousness and disregard for human life that surprised him most The story became front page news around the world Some individuals affiliated with NASA and other rocket related government programs remained staunch supporters of Arthur

Hugh McInnish an engineer with the U S Army Strategic Defense Command helped promote the idea that Rudolph Dornberger and von Braun had all confronted members of the SS during the war and had tried to get better working conditions for the slave laborers Their defenders assertions must be regarded with the greatest skepticism especially as there is not a single document to back them up says Michael J Neufeld There is little doubt in my mind that Rudolph was deeply implicated The Rudolph exposé triggered keen interest in how it was that Arthur Rudolph came to America in the first place This was a turning point in Operation Paperclip s secret history There is a broad misconception in America that there exists some kind of automatic declassification system that requires the government to reveal its secret programs after thirty or fifty years In reality the most damaging programs often remain classified for as long as they can be kept secret The Freedom of Information Act signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson allows for the full or partial disclosure of some documents but a request must be initiated by an individual or a group and is by no means a guarantee that information will be obtained After the Arthur Rudolph story broke journalist Linda Hunt began reporting on Operation Paperclip for CNN and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists She filed FOIA requests with the different military organizations and intelligence agencies involved and received varied responses I obtained six thousand Edgewood Arsenal documents in 1987 but it took more than a year two attorneys and a threatened lawsuit to get the records released says Hunt When she arrived at the Washington National Records Center in the late 1980s to inspect the documents she was told that Edgewood s own historian had checked out seven of the boxes and that another twelve were missing The army later agreed to look for the missing records and sent her a bill for 239 680 in so called search fees the equivalent of 500 000 in 2013 Eventually Linda Hunt was granted access to the documents and in the early 1990s she published a book that unveiled many of Operation Paperclip s seemingly impenetrable

Senate passed a resolution declaring that June 15 was Dr Hubertus Strughold Day Then Ohio State University s medical college unveiled a portrait of Strughold on its mural of medical heroes But the attempts by one organization to perpetrate a false myth can serve as a great motivator for another organization and to this end the World Jewish Congress discovered and released information on Dr Strughold that army intelligence had managed to keep classified for nearly fifty years The New York Times verified that Dr Strughold had been listed as among those being sought on the 1945 Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects or CROWCASS list Strughold s portrait was removed from the Ohio State mural where he appeared ironically alongside Hippocrates Citizens who were offended by the Strughold library at the Brooks Air Force Base asked the air force when Strughold s name was going to be removed from the U S government building Library spokesman Larry Farlow told the Associated Press that there were no plans to remove the name from the Strughold Aeromedical Library But growing pressure from the public forced the air force to reconsider its position In 1995 General Ronald R Fogleman chief of staff of the Department of the Air Force issued a terse statement stating that after reviewing Nazi era documents the evidence of Dr Strughold s wartime activities is sufficient to cause concern about retaining his name in an honored place on the library The sign was removed from the building s exterior brick walls and the Strughold bronze portrait was taken down The permanence of the honor had come to an end Strughold died the following year at the age of eighty eight The Justice Department had been preparing a Nazi war criminal case against Strughold in his final years What does last The desire to seek the truth Or in the words of Jean Michel the ability to take a stand against the monstrous distortion of history when it gives birth to false foul and

monstrous distortion of history when it gives birth to false foul and suspect myths In 1998 Congress passed the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act which required various U S government agencies to identify and release federal records relating to Nazi war criminals that had been kept classified for decades In accordance with the act President Clinton established an Interagency Working Group made up of federal agency representatives and members of the public to oversee the interpretation of over eight million pages of U S government records and report its findings to Congress The documentation revealed a vast web of profitable relationships between hundreds of Nazi war criminals and U S military and intelligence agencies In 2005 in a final report to Congress U S Intelligence and the Nazis the Interagency Working Group determined that t he notion that they the U S military and the CIA employed only a few bad apples will not stand up to the new documentation In hindsight wrote the Interagency Working Group the government s use of Nazis was a very bad idea and there was no compelling reason to begin the postwar era with the assistance of some of those associated with the worst crimes of the war And yet history now shows us that that is exactly what the American government did and continued to do throughout the Cold War In the decades since Operation Paperclip ended new facts continue to come to light In 2008 previously unreported information about Otto Ambros emerged serving as a reminder that the story of what lies hidden behind America s Nazi scientist program is not complete A group of medical doctors and researchers in England working on behalf of an organization called the Thalidomide Trust believe they have tied the wartime work of IG Farben and Otto Ambros to the thalidomide tragedy of the late 1950s and early 1960s After Ambros was released from Landsberg Prison he worked as an economic consultant to German chancellor Konrad Adenauer and to the industrial magnate Friedrich Flick the richest person in Germany during the Cold War Like Ambros Flick had been tried and convicted at Nuremberg then released early by John J McCloy In the late 1950s Ambros was also elected chairman of the advisory committee for a German company called Chemie Grünenthal Grünenthal was about to market a new tranquilizer that promised pregnant women relief from morning sickness The drug called thalidomide was going to be sold under the brand name Contergan Otto Ambros served on the board of directors of Grünenthal In the late 1950s very few people knew that

Baumkötter an SS captain Hauptsturmführer and the chief concentration camp doctor in Mauthausen Natzweiler Struthof and Sachsenhausen concentration camps Ten months before Grünenthal s public release of thalidomide the wife of a Grünenthal employee who took the drug to combat morning sickness gave birth to a baby without ears No one linked the birth defect to the drug and thalidomide was released by the company After several months on the market in 1959 Grünenthal received its first reports that thalidomide caused polyneuropathy or nerve damage in the hands and feet of elderly people who took the drug The drug s over the counter status was changed so that it now required a prescription Still thalidomide was marketed aggressively in forty six countries with a label that stated it could be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without any adverse effect on mother and child Instead the drug resulted in more than ten thousand mothers giving birth to babies with terrible deformities creating the most horrific pharmaceutical disaster in the history of modern medicine Many of the children were born without ears arms or legs and with reptilian flipperlike appendages in place of healthy limbs The origins of thalidomide were never accounted for Grünenthal had always maintained that it lost its documents that showed where and when the first human trials were conducted on the drug Then in 2008 the Thalidomide Trust in England headed by Dr Martin Johnson located a group of Nazi era documents that produced a link between thalidomide and the drugs researched and developed by IG Farben chemists during the war Dr Johnson points out that Grünenthal s 1954 patents for thalidomide cryptically state that human trials had already been completed but the company says it cannot offer that data because it was lost ostensibly during the war The patents suggest that thalidomide was probably one of a number of products developed at Dyhernfurth or Auschwitz Monowitz under the leadership of Otto Ambros in the course of nerve gas research Dr Johnson says The Thalidomide Trust also links Paperclip scientist Richard Kuhn to the medical tragedy Kuhn worked with a wide range of chemicals in his nerve gas research and in his antidote research we know he used Antergan which we are fairly sure was a sister drug to Contergan the brand name for

GDCh announced it would no longer award its once prestigious Richard Kuhn Medal in his name Nazi era documents on Kuhn had been brought to the society s attention revealing that in the spring of 1943 Kuhn asked the secretary general of the KWS Kaiser Wilhelm Society Ernst Telschow to support his search for the brains of young and healthy men presumably for nerve gas research The Society of German Chemists maintains that the sources indicate that these brains were most likely taken from execution victims and that d espite his scientific achievements Richard Kuhn is not suitable to serve as a role model and eponym for an important award mainly due to his research on poison gas but also due to his conduct towards Jewish colleagues It seems that the legacy of Hitler s chemists has yet to be fully unveiled Because so many of these German scientists were seen as assets to the U S Army Chemical Corps nerve agent programs and were thus wanted as participants in Operation Paperclip secret deals were made and the many documents pertaining to these arrangements were classified President Clinton s Interagency Working Group had access to eight million pages of declassified documents but millions more documents remain classified In U S Intelligence and the Nazis the Interagency Working Group s authors write that the truest reckoning with the official past can never be complete without the full release of government records Part of the problem lies in identifying where records are physically located For example a 2012 FOIA request to the State Department asking for the release of all files related to Otto Ambros was denied on the grounds that no such files exist But it is a matter of record owing to a May 1971 news article in the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that Otto Ambros traveled to the United States twice with the State Department s assistance despite his status as a convicted war criminal In an interview with State Department official Fred Scott the Jewish Telegraphic Agency learned Ambros came to the United States in 1967 after the State Department recommended to the Justice Department a waiver on his eligibility which was granted and that in 1969

near Auschwitz The documents include information about several Nazi doctors and Farben chemists who worked at the death camp The sensational value of this discovery is the fact that these original documents bearing the names of the main murderers from Auschwitz were found so many years after the war says Adam Cyra a historian at the Auschwitz museum Otto Ambros lived until 1990 to the age of ninety two After his death the chemical conglomerate BASF on whose board of directors he had served lauded him as an expressive entrepreneurial figure of great charisma Is the old German proverb really true Jedem das Seine Does everyone get what he deserves Still as of 2013 the Space Medicine Association in America continues to bestow its prestigious Hubertus Strughold Award to a scientist or specialist for outstanding contribution to aviation medicine It has done so every year since 1963 On December 1 2012 the Wall Street Journal ran a page one story about Dr Strughold presenting revelatory new information about his criminal activities during the war German historian Prof Hans Walter Schmuhl had been researching another subject when he came across evidence that showed that Dr

which had been given annually in Germany since the mid 1970s In America the Wall Street Journal article renewed debate as to why the Space Medicine Association had not yet eliminated its Hubertus Strughold Award Dr Mark Campbell a former president of the Space Medicine Association insists the award will not go away Campbell blames the Internet for maligning what he sees as Dr Strughold s good character I was a member of a committee investigating Dr Strughold to see if his name should be removed from the Space Medicine Association Strughold Award says Campbell I was amazed to find that the facts that were uncovered were so different from the claims being made on the Internet But most of Dr Campbell s colleagues disagree Why defend him asks Dr Stephen Véronneau a research medical officer at the FAA s Civil Aerospace Medical Institute in Oklahoma City and a member of the Space Medicine Association I can t find another example in the world of an institution honoring Dr Strughold except my own association The National Space Club Florida Committee one of three committees of the National Space Club in Washington D C gives out a similarly prestigious space related award called the Dr

retired in 1974 In 2013 after the Strughold award debate resurfaced I interviewed Steve Griffin the National Space Club chairman to determine why the organization continues to give out an award that is named after someone who was once an avowed and active Nazi Simple as it is Kurt Debus is an honored American Griffin says I read to Griffin information from Kurt Debus s OMGUS security report It is a simple matter Griffin told me Kurt Debus was the first director of the Kennedy Space Center Unlike the Strughold award which was created in 1963 when Strughold s foreign scientist case file was still classified the Dr Kurt H Debus Award was first bestowed in 1990 after Debus s OMGUS security report had been declassified and the revelation that he was an active member of Heinrich Himmler s SS had been revealed It is not my purview to decide if we have an award or what it is called Griffin says But Griffin conceded that he has been on the board of the National Space Club since the Debus award s inception so technically it is and always has been within his purview Like so many of those involved in Operation Paperclip decades ago Griffin looks past Debus s former commitment to Nazi Party ideology He only sees the scientist What do you say when people ask you about Kurt Debus s Nazi past I asked Not a single person has asked me this question in twenty three years Griffin said To report this book I filed dozens of Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests some of which were honored many of which were denied and most of which are still pending I came across oblique references

knowing much about Operation Paperclip back then I was very surprised when I learned that just a few years after the war s end Siegfried Knemeyer was living in America working for the U S Air Force and that he would eventually be awarded the U S Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award the highest civilian award given by the DoD In 2010 I located Siegfried Knemeyer s grandson Dirk Knemeyer and asked if he would meet with me for an interview He agreed Dirk Knemeyer is an American father husband entrepreneur and businessman By his own admission he spends a good deal of his time thinking philosophically about concepts of identity science time and life When I first met him Dirk Knemeyer shared with me that he had never before spoken publicly about his grandfather s wartime activities and that most members of his family go out of their way to maintain silence about Siegfried Knemeyer s high ranking in the Nazi Party For the most part the family s position is Do not discuss Siegfried s past with anyone particularly not a journalist Dirk Knemeyer says But what do you do when you have documents in your attic as I do praising your grandfather and his excellent work and signed by people like Hermann Göring and Albert Speer I find no easy answer to this question The conundrum therein is one of the notions that made me want to learn much more about Operation Paperclip Siegfried s life is complicated Dirk Knemeyer says of his grandfather I am someone who is more interested in learning the truth about the past than denying it Besides some things are unwise to ignore I asked Knemeyer if he would share with me some of his grandfather s documents that were stored in boxes in his own attic He said he would think about it Eventually he agreed Thank you Dirk

sentenced to fifteen years in Landsberg Prison he was granted clemency by U S High Commissioner John McCloy in 1951 Within a year Beiglböck was back practicing medicine at a hospital in Buxtehude Germany thanks to a former SS colleague August Dietrich Dieter Allers who ran the hospital Beiglböck published medical papers and enjoyed prominence in the German medical community until 1962 when he traveled to his native Vienna to give a lecture In Austria there were open war crimes charges against Beiglböck and he was arrested Back in Germany and likely as a result of attention from the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial Dieter Allers was arrested around the same time With no job to return to at the hospital Beiglböck committed suicide on November 22 1963 He was fifty eight years old He left

is an excerpt from Chapter 15 Seedy Business What Big Food is hiding with its slick PR campaign on GMOs by Gary Ruskin co director of the public watchdog group US Right to Know The agrichemical industry s six major firms Monsanto Syngenta Dow DuPont Bayer and BASF have been involved on so many reprehensible activities that documenting them all would require an entire book in itself In fact entire books have been devoted to the wrongdoing of two of these companies while an extensive website documents the misdeeds of a third one 1 Following is a brief sketch of the crimes wrongdoing and other reprehensible acts of these companies BASF BASF is the world s largest chemical company On September 21 1921 a BASF fertilizer silo in Oppau exploded killing at least 550 people 2 It was one of the worst chemical disasters in history 3 The companies BASF Bayer Hoescht and three smaller companies founded IG Farben Interessen Gemeinschaft Farbenindustrie AG in 1925 The war crimes of IG Farben are so heinous as to be impossible to capture in a short space Following the Nuremberg Trials thirteen of its executives were imprisoned for Nazi war crimes for producing Zyklon B the asphyxiating gas used to kill countless Jews and others during the Holocaust and the use of tens of thousands of slave laborers at Auschwitz and conducting involuntary medical or scientific experiments on prisoners 4 On July 28 1948 an explosion at the BASF plant in Ludwigshafen killed more than 200 people and injured up to 3 000 5 In 1999 BASF pled guilty to a criminal conspiracy charge and agreed to pay a 225 million fine for helping to coordinate cartels to illegally fix prices of vitamins in the 1990s 6 Joel Klein then chief of the antitrust division of the U S Department of Justice called it the most pervasive and harmful criminal antitrust conspiracy ever uncovered 7 Gary Spratling head of criminal enforcement of antitrust laws at DOJ explained Simply put the vitamin cartel was as bad as they get Nothing was left to chance or more accurately to competition 8 In 2001 the European Union fined BASF 260 million for the same price fixing scheme This is the most damaging series of cartels the

cough and irritation remedy for children as late as 1912 11 According to Kenaz Filan s history of the poppy Believing incorrectly that heroin produced less respiratory depression than codeine Bayer presented heroin as a safer children s cough suppressant It was also touted as a cure for morphine addiction and a panacea against among other things depression bronchitis asthma tuberculosis and stomach cancer 12 The companies BASF Bayer Hoescht and three smaller companies founded IG Farben Interessen Gemeinschaft Farbenindustrie AG in 1925 See BASF profile above In the early 1970 s Bayer s fungicide Baycovin diethylpyrocarbonate was used as a preservative for wine beer and fruit juices However Baycovin was found to produce a potent carcinogen urethan 13 The FDA banned Baycovin in 1972 14 In April 2003 Bayer pled guilty to a criminal charge and agreed to pay 257 million in fines and damages for defrauding Medicare in a scheme to overcharge for its antibiotic Cipro At the time it was the largest Medicaid fraud settlement in history 15 Bayer is a major producer of neonicotinoid pesticides that have been linked to the decline of bee populations These pesticides were banned for two years in Europe 16 Bayer has mounted a massive campaign to keep its pesticides on the market in part by using the classic tobacco industry strategy of pretending to care Bayer is strictly committed to bee health a Bayer spokesperson told the New York Times Hans Muilerman of Pesticide Action Network Europe explained that Bayer does almost anything that helps their products remaining on the market

Department of Defense 22 Photos and other descriptions of the impact of napalm horrified Americans and in response to nationwide protests and boycotts the company stopped producing napalm in 1969 23 In 1995 Greenpeace released a report arguing that Dow is the world s largest producer of chlorine and chorine based products and that it is likely the world s largest root source of dioxin which is a

tens of thousands of others remain sick 26 Much of the toxic waste remains in Bhopal despite the profitability of Dow Chemical 27 For the last thirteen years Dow has rejected any responsibility for

conduct by the Monsanto Corporation is the subject of a book length treatment by Marie Monique Robin The World According to Monsanto 34 What follows is merely a brief recounting of a few key events Monsanto began producing the pesticide DDT in 1944 along with about fifteen other companies In 1962 Rachel Carson released Silent Spring her seminal book on DDT Carson told the story of how DDT decimated some bird species such as bald eagles and peregrine falcons because it made the birds eggshells too thin so they would break prematurely EPA banned DDT in 1972 because of its impacts on the environment and human health With minor exceptions in 2004 it was banned worldwide by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants Monsanto has thrice been found to have produced false advertising related to Roundup and its genetically engineered crops In 2009 France s highest court upheld two lower French courts convicting Monsanto of falsely advertising that its herbicide Roundup is biodegradable and that it left the soil clean 35 In 1999 the UK Advertising Standards Authority condemned Monsanto for issuing wrong unproven misleading and confusing claims in its advertising 36 In 1996 the Attorney General of New York State fined Monsanto 50 000 for false advertising regarding claims that Roundup is environmentally friendly and biodegradable 37 In 1999 in a notable instance of public relations trickery Monsanto helped to pay protesters to conduct a counter demonstration in support of genetically engineered food The protest was held in Washington DC in front of an FDA hearing on genetically engineered crops 38 Recent articles by the Associated Press raised questions about the health risks of Monsanto s Roundup as it is used in Argentina According to AP Argentine

United States Atrazine was banned in the European Union in October 2003 over concerns about whether it is carcinogenic and an endocrine disruptor 41 According to the New York Times atrazine has become among the most common contaminants in American reservoirs and other sources of drinking water and Recent studies suggest that even at concentrations meeting current federal standards the chemical may be associated with birth defects low birth weights and menstrual problems 42 Syngenta is also a major producer of neonicotinoid pesticides which have been blamed for sharp declines in bee populations across the planet Europe has banned these pesticides for two years due to their destruction of bee populations 43 According to a 2014 study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature neonicotinoids are causing significant damage to a wide range of beneficial invertebrate species and are a key factor in the decline of bees 44 Syngenta s predecessor Ciba Geigy 45 produced a pesticide called chlordimeform which was withdrawn from the market because it was a suspected carcinogen 46 Syngenta s predecessor Ciba paid a 62 million fine including 3 5 million in criminal penalties for illegally dumping laboratory wastes polluting groundwater and filing false reports In 1992 in a much polluted state the head of New Jersey s environmental prosecutions unit said This is

for Disease Control and Prevention CDC demonstrate the company s efforts to influence the CDC for its own benefit according to a study published today in The Milbank Quarterly Coca Cola s contact with the CDC shows the company s interest in gaining access to CDC employees to lobby policymakers and to frame the obesity debate by shifting attention and blame away from sugar sweetened beverages The study is based on emails and documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act by U S Right to Know a nonprofit consumer and public health research group The investigation into Coca Cola is of particular relevance because the CDC has recently faced criticism for its links to manufacturers of unhealthy products including those of sugar sweetened beverages The emails demonstrate Coca Cola s efforts to advance corporate objectives rather than health including to influence the World Health Organization the study says It is not the proper role of the CDC to abet companies that manufacture harmful products said Gary Ruskin co director of U S Right to Know Congress should investigate whether Coca Cola and other companies that harm public health are unethically influencing the CDC and subverting its efforts to protect the health of all Americans Once again we see the grave risks that arise when public health organisations partner with manufacturers of products that pose a threat to health said Martin McKee professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine Sadly as this example and more recent ones in the United Kingdom show these risks are not always appreciated by those who should know better The paper concludes It is unacceptable for public health organizations to engage in partnerships with companies that have such a clear conflict of interest The obvious parallel would be to consider the CDC working with cigarette companies and the dangers that such a partnership would pose Our analysis has highlighted the need for organizations like the CDC to ensure that they refrain from engaging in partnerships with harmful product manufacturers lest they undermine the health of the public they serve The Milbank Quarterly study was co

tactics The following is an excerpt from Chapter 4 Seedy Business What Big Food is hiding with its slick PR campaign on GMOs by Gary Ruskin co director of the public watchdog group US Right to Know When assessing whether or not to trust the agrichemical companies and their genetically engineered food it is noteworthy that several of their public relations firms were once employed by the tobacco industry in its efforts to evade responsibility and liability for the millions of Americans they killed 1 These PR efforts on behalf of the tobacco industry perhaps the most significant and destructive PR campaign ever raise questions about whether these same firms are spinning a similarly deceitful PR campaign for the agrichemical industry to hide any health or environmental risks of genetically engineered food Tobacco Institute s PR firm tasked with reviving Monsanto s image spinning Bayer Americans have a negative view of Monsanto and it s getting worse In a 2013 Harris poll measuring the reputation quotient of the most visible companies Monsanto performed poorly ranking 47 th out of 60 companies 2 In the 2014 Harris Poll it fell to third to last above BP and Bank of America and just behind Halliburton 3 Bloomberg Businessweek even titled its recent profile of Monsanto Inside Monsanto America s Third Most Hated Company 4 Politico s recent profile of Monsanto s PR woes began with Monsanto is the agriculture world s prince of darkness spreading its demonic genetically modified seeds on fields all over the earth 5 In 2013 to boost its public image Monsanto has hired the PR firm Fleishman Hillard to reshape its reputation amid fierce opposition to the seed giant s genetically modified products as the PR industry s Holmes Report put it It notes that the companies both headquartered in St Louis have a solid historic relationship After previously serving as the company s AOR Agency of Record in the 80s FH has more recently worked on branding and comms projects for some of the company s divisions According to sources familiar with the situation Monsanto is aiming to develop a more cohesive communications approach in the face of sustained NGO criticism 6 Among other things Monsanto is trying to resuscitate its image with mommy bloggers trying to convince them that Monsanto is really a sustainable agriculture company 7 In 2013 Fleishman Hillard also became the PR agency of record for Bayer 8 The Tobacco Institute was the cigarette industry s main lobbying organization And Fleishman Hillard worked as its public relations firm In its

to you and the Institute and in return you have always been very generous and supportive of us 9 In the Washington Post Morton Mintz recounted the story of how Fleishman Hillard and the Tobacco Institute converted the Healthy Buildings Institute into a front group for the tobacco industry in its effort to spin away public concern about the dangers of second hand smoke 10 Fleishman Hillard was also caught using unethical tactics against public health and tobacco control advocates According to a study by Ruth Malone in the American Journal of Public Health Fleishman Hillard conducted espionage against tobacco control advocates on behalf of the tobacco company R J Reynolds It even secretly audiotaped tobacco control meetings and conferences 11 However in recent years Fleishman Hillard has worked on a number of anti smoking campaigns Ogilvy Mather DuPont Pioneer s PR Firm Worked for the Tobacco Institute DuPont Pioneer is the world s second largest seed producer and a major producer of genetically engineered seeds On March 26 2012 the Des Moines Register reported that Pioneer had hired the PR firm Ogilvy Mather which also represents Pioneer s corporate parent DuPont 12 Ogilvy Mather s work on behalf of DuPont Pioneer has been highly regarded The PR Society of America awarded Ogilvy PR and DuPont Pioneer its highest honor Best of the Anvils for producing a PR

Fact 17 Two Syngenta PR firms worked for the tobacco industry According to news reports Syngenta hired the PR firm Jayne Thompson Associates to help spin a massive 2004 lawsuit against it regarding atrazine 18 On its website Jayne Thompson s firm boasts of its work on behalf of Altria the parent company of tobacco firm Philip Morris USA to craft and manage a high stakes integrated crisis media relations and public affairs campaign resulting in among other things more than a dozen supportive editorials strong Illinois media coverage national editorial support and international press attention 19 In the New Yorker Rachel Aviv notes that after a critical New York Times article about atrazine Syngenta hired a PR firm called the White House Writers Group to help defend its embattled herbicide 20 Among other things Syngenta s PR firm the White House Writers Group has also done PR work for the Philip Morris tobacco company including work on speeches talking points and fact sheets 21 Top operative against GMO labeling was outside counsel to Philip Morris Tom Hiltachk is the managing partner of the Sacramento law firm Bell McAndrews Hiltachk LLP He was the treasurer for the front group campaign committee that the agrichemical and food industries employed to oppose Proposition 37 the 2012 California ballot initiative for labeling of genetically engineered food 22 Bell

Previously MB Public Affairs worked for the tobacco company Altria formerly Philip Morris Cos according to the Los Angeles Times 29 Using the tobacco industry playbook by pretending to care about farmers and sustainability The tobacco industry was famous for its self serving advertising and public relations campaigns to make smokers think that it cared about them while it was actually promoting a product that when used as intended is often deadly For example in 1953 the tobacco company Liggett Myers ran an advertising campaign called Best For You in which it promoted its Chesterfield cigarettes as Best for you 30 One of its 1954 ads featured the claim that Chesterfields were The cigarette tested and approved by 30 years of scientific tobacco research 31 Another set of advertisements for Virginia Slims promoted the idea that cigarettes could help smokers to be slim beautiful and empowered 32 Many other tobacco ad campaigns ran in a similar vein Of course the tobacco companies cared only about profits not smokers but this ruse helped to hook generations of smokers In a similar way just as tobacco companies pretended to care about smokers the agrichemical companies pretend to care about farmers and sustainability when what they really care about is profits The agrichemical industry uses farmers as spokespeople because Americans typically view farmers as trustworthy and honorable For example Monsanto has produced a website titled American Farmers 33 packed with beautiful and moving photographs of farmers and their families and bountiful harvests of crops Here s what Monsanto says it wants to accomplish Through our America s Farmers programs we hope to help educate consumers about modern agriculture grow rural communities and schools and celebrate women in agriculture 34 The website celebrates farmers and farming in myriad ways Farmers do more than feed fuel and clothe the world Monsanto s website says They are the life blood of rural

genetically engineered food because farmers are seen as trustworthy Farmers were used as spokespeople in ads in the campaigns against GMO labeling ballot initiatives in California 36 Washington 37 Oregon 38 and Colorado 39 In California the name of the industry front group campaign committee against GMO labeling was No On 37 Coalition Against The Deceptive Food Labeling Scheme Sponsored By

second spot titled Food is Love that cynically tries to associate itself with the warmth and love that comes out of sharing food with friends and family In this emotional spot Monsanto is pretending that it cares about you and your loved ones 41 Just as the agrichemical industry pretends to care about farmers and about you it also pretends to care about sustainability Of course given the adverse impact of herbicides like Roundup on soil health 42 there may well be few things less sustainable than spraying vast quantities such herbicides on crops and fields across the planet 43 Nevertheless for example Monsanto boasts often and loudly that it embraces the idea of sustainability producing slick websites posted at sustainability monsanto com 44 beautiful videos on sustainability 45 along with a commitment to sustainable agriculture and statements professing its vision for sustainable agriculture 46 These protestations from Monsanto in support of sustainability are ironic as they come from a company that produced huge quantities of toxic chemicals and pollution For example Monsanto was the main manufacturer of toxic PCBs The dangerous legacy of Monsanto s PCB pollution remains

GMOs by Gary Ruskin co director of the public watchdog group US Right to Know The agrichemical industry s political machine is deeply powerful subtle and complex Here s how the Guardian describes it Monsanto and the US farm biotech industry wield legendary power A revolving door allows corporate chiefs to switch to top posts in the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies US embassies around the world push GM technology onto dissenting countries government subsidies back corporate research federal regulators do largely as the industry wants the companies pay millions of dollars a year to lobby politicians conservative thinktanks combat any political opposition the courts enforce corporate patents on seeds and the consumer is denied labels or information 1 What follows is a brief summary of the agrichemical industry s political infrastructure and its recent major initiatives Personnel In the United States it is the hallmark of a powerful industry to have strong ties to both Democrats and Republicans and across the U S political spectrum Certainly the agrichemical industry does Personnel is power so the saying goes Here is a brief review of the agrichemical industry s most potent political allies Hillary Clinton As of this writing Clinton is the presumptive favorite to be the Democratic nominee for President in 2016 She has a long history of support for the agrichemical industry Most recently on June 25 2014 she delivered the keynote address to the Biotechnology Industry Organization BIO international conference where she essentially endorsed genetically engineered crops stating I stand in favor of using seeds and products that have a proven track record you say and are scientifically provable sic to continue to try to make the case to those who are skeptical 2 Clinton was a strong ally of the agrichemical industry during her tenure as Secretary of State continuing the Bush administration s support of the industry 3 However in the 2007 8 Democratic presidential primaries Clinton supported labeling of genetically engineered food 4 U S Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas From 1977 79 Justice Thomas worked as an attorney in the pesticide and agriculture division of the Monsanto Company 5 Mitt Romney The Republican 2012 candidate for president was an architect of Monsanto s metamorphosis from a chemical manufacturer to a genetic engineering and agrichemical firm Romney was CEO of Bain Company and Monsanto was its largest consulting client 6 U S Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack In 2001 Vilsack was honored by the

signs of the agrichemical industry s sway over the Obama administration While a presidential candidate in 2007 Senator Barack Obama pledged to label genetically engineered food if he were elected president Seven years later he has yet to keep his promise 9 Obama s trade and foreign policy strives to sweep away international concerns about the health and safety of genetically engineered food and crops One major component of the Obama administration s advocacy of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership for Europe and the Trans Pacific Partnership for Asia is to convince Europe and Asia to open their markets to U S genetically engineered crops and foods 10 And a key purpose of the U S State Department s Office of Agriculture Biotechnology and Textile Trade Affairs is to maintain open markets for U S products derived from modern biotechnology according to its website The website continues that The Department of State works with a host of other agencies and organizations to promote acceptance of this promising technology 11 Congress federal pre emption and the DARK Act In Congress the agrichemical industry s allies are pushing legislation to eliminate the ability of states to require labeling of genetically engineered food This legislation dubbed by its sponsors the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2014 and by consumer groups the Deny Americans the Right to Know DARK Act was championed by Rep Mike Pompeo R KS The most generous contributors to Rep Pompeo s campaigns by a large margin have been tied to Koch Industries 12 whose Koch brothers have spent countless millions in advocacy against environmental causes At the end of the 113 th Congress Pompeo s legislation H R 4432 had 37 co sponsors of whom 34 were Republicans It is interesting that this legislation for federal pre emption of states rights to label food would gain Republican support in the House given the Republican Party s advocacy of states rights and returning power to the states Lobbying and the purchase of influence The food and agrichemical industries are spending freely on lobbying in Washington According to an analysis by the Environmental Working Group corporations that oppose GMO labeling spent 27 million on lobbying during the first half of 2014 more than three times what they spent during the whole of 2013 13 In Congress as in the",

during the first half of 2014 more than three times what they spent during the whole of 2013 13 In Congress as in the general public GMOs have greater acceptance among Republicans than Democrats So naturally the agrichemical companies want to bolster their power where they are weakest And so the food and agrichemical industries have been hiring lobbyists with ties to Democrats such as former U S Senator Blanche Lincoln 14 Former U S Congressman Vic Fazio 15 and former top Gephardt staffer Steve Elmendorf 16 This trend may reverse since Republicans will control Congress in 2015 in December 2014 the Grocery Manufacturers Association hired as its top lobbyist Denzel McGuire who had been a senior aide to incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell 17 The Grocery Manufacturers Association s lobbying campaign to oppose GMO labeling has been so effective that the Capitol Hill newspaper The Hill named it one of the Top 10 lobbying victories of the year 18 Massive expenditures against state ballot initiatives for GMO labeling In the 2012 2013 and 2014 elections the agrichemical and food industries and their allies spent more than 103 million to defeat four statewide ballot initiatives for labeling of genetically engineered food In effect this money is a tax on consumers imposed by the agrichemical and food companies to obliterate consumers rights to know what is in our food In California the agrichemical and food companies and their allies spent 46 million to defeat Proposition 37 a 2012 ballot initiative for labeling of genetically engineered food 19 In Washington State these industries spent 20 million to defeat I 522 a 2013 ballot measure for GMO labeling in Washington This is large expenditure in a state with less than 4 million registered voters 20 According to the Seattle Post Intelligencer merely 600 of this money came from within Washington 21 In 2014 these industries spent 20 million to defeat Oregon ballot Measure 92 and 16 million to

to proceed to trial 25 In a notable show of arrogance the GMA retaliated against Washington State by countersuing to strike down Washington s money laundering and anti corruption laws As Washington State Attorney Genera Bob Ferguson explained about the GMA They did not just say We haven t broken the law What they re saying is some of your campaign finance laws are unconstitutional That raises the stakes 26 Among other things this is an effort to deter future attorneys general from enforcing campaign finance laws against the GMA Court stripping and pre empting litigation the Monsanto

be above the law Now imagine what would happen if bank robbers lobbied to successfully strip the courts of any ability to bring them to trial Or perpetrators of fraud Imagine the damage that would be done to our system of justice to rule of law In essence this is similar to what Monsanto did successfully In an affront to the separation of powers Monsanto lobbied its home state senator Roy Blunt R

Association litigates against the consumer s right to know On May 8th 2014 Vermont became the first state to enact a law requiring labeling of genetically engineered food 29 The law does not go into effect for two years In response on June 12 th the Grocery Manufacturers Association Snack Food Association International Dairy Foods Association and the National Association of Manufacturers filed a lawsuit in federal court to block the Vermont GMO labeling law from taking effect 30 In addition on September 11 th the GMA filed for a preliminary injunction to stop Vermont from carrying out its GMO labeling law until the courts have decided whether the law will survive the GMA challenge 31 The GMA s litigation is expected to be costly to the state of Vermont While the actual costs are unknown at this time USA Today estimated that Vermont s legal fees would be 5 8 million if it lost the litigation 32 The GMA s litigation against Vermont serves at least six functions First of course to strike down the law itself Second to deter citizens from trying to pass GMO labeling laws in other states Third to inflict financial retribution against a state that has acted against the interests of the agrichemical industry Fourth to signal that it may inflict similarly costly retribution against other states that pass GMO labeling laws Fifth to discourage legislators especially fiscal conservatives from voting for similar legislation in other states Sixth to drain money from efforts to win other state GMO labeling laws into defensive efforts to protect the Vermont labeling law Knocking down

Constitutionalizing the GMO The agrichemical and agribusiness industries are promoting state constitutional amendments in support of the right to farm including the right to farm genetically engineered crops North Dakota approved such an amendment in 2012 to protect modern farming practices as did Missouri in 2014 Bloomberg Businessweek explains Much of the drive behind the amendments has come from big corporations Members of Missouri Farmers Care a key supporter include Cargill one of the nation s largest processors of beef pork and turkey and Monsanto as well as a long list of state agricultural industry associations 35 The American Legislative Exchange Council ALEC has long been promoting a similar idea According to Bloomberg Businessweek in 1996 ALEC came up with model legislation that would expand existing right to farm laws to grant wide ranging legal rights to farms of all sizes ALEC s bill intended as a template for state politicians voided local farm ordinances and made it harder to lodge complaints about animal mistreatment pollution and noise Supporters and opponents of the amendments see them as the evolution of those efforts taking farm protection for better or worse to the next level 36 The purchase of judicial influence According to a study by the Center for Public Integrity Dow Chemical is one of our nation s leading sponsors of controversial

of Bayer and BASF s genetically engineered crops As he said in 2014 One thing is clear Our citizens do not want genetically modified plants in the fields and want no gene technology products on shop shelves 8 In 2012 BASF withdrew its efforts to even attempt to sell genetically its engineered products in Europe According to BASF board member Stefan Marcinowski There is still a lack of acceptance for this technology in many parts of Europe from the majority of consumers farmers and politicians Therefore it does not make business sense to continue investing in products exclusively for cultivation in this market 9 On November 11 2014 the EU parliament approved a plan to allow EU nations to ban the farming of genetically engineered crops on their lands It awaits final action by the

and public health interest groups Excessive use of antimicrobials in farm animals contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance AMR a problem that killed 1 14 million people globally in a single year Antimicrobials are a group of drugs that kill microorganisms including bacteria viruses and fungi On 1 April the Trump Administration began laying off some 10 000 staff in a planned restructure of the Department of Health and Human Services Those let go include more than 140 leaders and staff including several veterinarians at the FDA s Center for Veterinary Medicine CVM including Tristan Colonius the Center s chief veterinary officer according to news reports The layoffs affect personnel working on antimicrobial resistance the American Veterinary Medical Association

respond to requests to confirm Schell s appointment Andrew deCoriolis executive director of Farm Forward a group advocating for the end of factory farming is concerned that Schell s links to industry will not help efforts to reduce the use of antimicrobial drugs in food animals It s pretty hard to take seriously the idea that FDA is going to curb antibiotic use on farms when they appoint a former drug company lobbyist as the chief regulator he says Promises to cut antimicrobials in animal agriculture The cuts to the CVM staff who worked on antimicrobial resistance come at a time when nations around the world including the United States promised to tackle the crisis which is regarded by the World Health Organization as one of the most urgent threats to global public health In September 2024 at a meeting of the United Nations in New York countries including the US committed to striving to meaningfully reduce antimicrobials used in animal agriculture by 2030 to help curb AMR However nations failed to agree specific targets to reduce use following push back from the US and other meat producing nations More antimicrobials are sold in the US for use in farm animals than for humans each year research suggests They are used to treat sick animals and to prevent disease sometimes given routinely to avoid risk of infection Diseases can spread more quickly between animals on intensive farming systems where large numbers of individuals are kept in close quarters and hygiene and welfare can be poor The FDA and CVM have several initiatives underway to better manage and track the use of antimicrobials in farm animals These include draft guidance to encourage animal drug makers to voluntarily stop the continuous use of medically important antibiotics in food animals At the

from AMR when assessing the safety of new antimicrobial drugs for animals Advocates for cutting antimicrobials in farm animals have criticized aspects of both guidance documents but generally they were regarded as a step in the right direction For example the guidance on setting limits on use didn t go far enough to curb long term use but it could still be an improvement on the current situation where some drugs can be used indefinitely says Steven Roach who works on safe and healthy food at the Food Animal Concerns Trust FACT a campaign group in Chicago Illinois Collecting data on antimicrobial use In 2023 the Reagan Udall Foundation published plans for a public private partnership with industry to voluntarily collect data on the use of antimicrobials in farm animals The project was funded by the Food and Drug Administration Currently the FDA collects annual data on the volume of antimicrobials sold for farm animals But this is only a crude measure of antimicrobial drugs used Accurate use data is crucial to be able to assess how and why drugs are administered say campaign groups Public interest groups have long urged the FDA to collect data on antimicrobial use but they objected to the FDA s proposals for a voluntary system which they say may not provide a representative picture of the industry Large industrial farms that may overuse antimicrobials would have little incentive to participate in a voluntary system because it would make them look bad writes Madeleine Kleven an analyst for FACT It is unclear how far the FDA has gotten in building the data

Louis Robert an agronomist in Québec was fired after releasing controversial research about the limited effectiveness of neonicotinoid pesticides After a year of asking his superiors at the Ministry of Agriculture to release the report Robert sent the unpublished research to Radio Canada The upshot of the study That neonicotinoid seed treatments produced no significant difference in crop yields for corn and soybeans Shortly after he released the report to the press while he was in a field giving a demonstration to farmers Robert s phone rang It was his boss s secretary insisting that he return to the office immediately As soon as I got to the office I was invited to a conference room and my boss was there and on the video was his boss in Québec City and they handed me a letter signed by my ministry Robert said I was suspended from the department Canadian agronomist Louis Robert The research that his superiors kept under wraps was one of several studies in the last decade that have shown that in corn and soybeans the economic benefits of using pesticide treated seeds are questionable Their research was clearly showing that those products were not giving any benefits to farmers Robert said But at the same time they were told by their bosses by the board of directors to not present those results to the outside world and keep them to themselves for the time being In Québec in New York State and in Vermont the findings of this study and others with similar conclusions contributed to the passage of laws that restricted the use of the insecticides according to lawmakers and scientists This year four more states are moving to limit the use of neonics in addition to the 10 states that have already restricted Discussion of economic benefits of the pesticides to farmers and consumers typically factor into these decisions Public drama in Québec After Robert s firing in Québec public drama ensued In fact Robert wrote a book about it called Pour le bien de la terre or For the good of the earth published by Éditions MultiMondes After the government received a petition with 17 000 signatures and members of the public marched on the parliament in Québec City during the coldest day of winter Robert said he was reinstated Québec Premier François Legault and André Lamontagne the minister of agriculture issued personal apologies for the firing Robert said that people in

presence and number of insects in a field or a crop to justify the rate at which neonicotinoid treated seeds are used In fact data from the Canadian province Ontario have shown that crop yields for corn and soybeans increased after farmers stopped using them The most used pesticides in history Thirty years after neonicotinoids were first introduced they became the most widely used class of pesticides in the world and the most used pesticides in human history Neonics are a vital resource for farmers Kyel Richard spokesman Bayer Crop Science According to an extensive body of research the insecticides which were introduced by Bayer in the 1990s conferred several benefits over previous chemicals They controlled many different kinds of pests they protected all parts of the plant they didn t require labor intensive application methods and they were less toxic to people who apply pesticides than the chemicals that were used previously such as pyrethroids carbamates and organophosphates The downside of using treated seeds Neonicotinoids threaten the health of bees and other pollinators according to hundreds of peer reviewed studies Also according to a review of scientific literature published this year contamination of bodies of freshwater near croplands has produced toxic effects on mollusks insects frogs and fish Another review published in 2024 showed consistent negative effects of neonicotinoid exposure on various levels of performance of birds and that direct effects are responsible for part of the global declines in bird populations Manufacturers of neonicotinoids posit that the insecticides are safe for the environment when used correctly Neonics are a vital resource for farmers Kyel Richard a spokesman for Bayer wrote in an email Farmers rely on neonicotinoids to optimize crop yield and quality and they would be forced to use more or less effective and or harsher alternatives if neonics were no longer available Even so

according to research literature An executive summary of the findings produced by the public relations firm Porter Novelli stated that farmers would incur increased costs without the use of neonicotinoid pesticides because alternatives are more expensive and they would have to seed and spray more frequently to get the same yields Paul Mitchell director of the Renk Agribusiness Institute at the University of Wisconsin at Madison was the author of the report In an email he questioned the approach of the entomologists If so many of the farmers are doing this and getting no value it really begs the social question Why Are almost all farmers that dumb to keep losing money over that many acres year after year or do the entomologists not quite understand something about the value farmers get from the seed treatments As a social scientist I think the entomologists are asking the wrong question what is the source of value that they are getting Many of them have a hard time accepting insurance use of insecticides but then wear their seat belts every day when they drive I have spent the time effort and money to have seat belts in my car and wear it religiously but I have never gotten one cent in direct benefit from it so far no accidents but I still get value from wearing it The big difference is that wearing seat belts does not generate negative externalities like insecticides do in the environment Krupke said that the public needs more data to establish the risks and benefits of using neonicotinoid treated seeds Peer reviewed field studies by industry and public sector scientists alike demonstrating consistent benefits of the seed treatment approach to insect pest management in row crops are remarkably scarce he wrote in an email This is surprising when you consider we plant these crops over many millions of acres each year in the U S He advocated for further research in fields with and without treated seeds Those data should be more plentiful

crop yield research will likely continue to factor prominently in public debate Lawmakers in Connecticut Arizona Massachusetts and Hawaii have introduced bills to limit use of the pesticides according to Kate Burgess the conservation manager for the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators This is the most controversial topic in entomology Scott McArt associate professor of entomology Cornell University Further Missouri legislators have introduced a bill to restrict equipment to apply neonicotinoids and a bill in Indiana would initiate research on the impact of the use of the pesticides in the state according to Burgess The report in Indiana would provide recommendations to legislators based on findings The role of crop yield research in setting policy on the use of the pesticides at the state and province level has drawn intense scrutiny to findings Limiting the use of treated seeds has fallen to the states The U S Environmental Protection Agency has determined that the seeds do not qualify as standalone pesticides and that the federal rules that govern the use labeling and safety reviews of pesticides do not apply to them A recent federal court decision upheld that determination In addition to Robert at least one other scientist has faced career trouble after publishing research that shows minimal economic benefits of using neonicotinoid treated seeds The

was questioned by an industry scientist in public as well In 2021 the first time a bill to ban neonicotinoids came up before the New York State Assembly Sean McGee a senior ecotoxicologist and risk assessor for Bayer said that McArt s research did not include all the studies that were reviewed by the Environmental Protection Agency when the agency approved the registration of neonicotinoids It was incomplete McGee said of McArt s research during his testimony In the absence of a defined approach they just said there s the presence of a neonicotinoid there must be an effect That s not risk assessment That s presence equals hazard If that were the case none of us would be drinking caffeine Caffeine is ten times more toxic to humans than neonics are but we drink it every day knowing that the exposure I m going to get is not one at toxic levels After that testimony McArt said I had to get up after he gave this testimony and try to explain why what he said was inaccurate He said it was a huge challenge to explain risk assessment protocols to non scientists The bill was tabled in New York that year not to return until the next session after which it passed Research Neonics rarely produce economic benefits for corn and soybean crops McArt s research conducted over four years showed that while the insecticides including imidacloprid clothianidin and thiamethoxam are highly beneficial in fruits vegetables ornamental uses conservation and forestry they rarely benefit crop yields in corn and soybeans For corn he found that 94 percent of the time the use of the treated seeds produced no economic benefit for farmers For soybeans that number was 93 percent The pests are just not very frequent McArt said The pests are just not very frequent Scott McArt associate

from several additional years of peer reviewed publications our review covered everything up until 2020 Cornell University More than 90 percent of the time neonic treated seeds produced no economic

as whether or not the fields were prepared in ways that augmented pest populations Mitchell the author of the industry funded meta analysis wrote in an email that it is common practice for corn rootworm studies to plant trap crops the year before to ensure egg laying and high larval pressure the subsequent year when the trial is conducted This is a standard practice that way you evaluate the

are at risk of exposure to varying levels of neonicotinoid insecticides including lethal levels during sowing of maize We documented no benefit of the insecticidal seed treatments for crop yield during the study To make these assessments the team conducted experiments in 12 fields by measuring the concentration of neonicotinoid residues during planting They placed dust collection stations around the fields and quantified the amount of neonicotinoids that bees would encounter while foraging in the fields Krupke noted that since this research was conducted a decade ago Bayer has developed polymers for seed treatments that result in less dust and less exposure to bees In its annual report on neonicotinoids Bayer presented several steps the company has taken to mitigate exposures to bees from treated seeds Source Bayer After his research was published in 2017 Krupke fielded questions from industry scientists on his methods execution and conclusions He wrote in an email that I always welcome other data perspectives knowing that ours is not perfect or representative of every situation I did not take it as undermining the work I always hope these conversations will lead to follow up studies Krupke s study in Indiana also concluded that three years of field experiments spread throughout the most intensive maize production region of Indiana failed to demonstrate a significant benefit of planting treated maize seeds which the team pointed out is consistent with findings from research on oilseed rape in the European Union and studies of soybeans in the United States In further conclusion the report said These reports and our data suggest that the current use levels of insecticidal seed treatments in North American row crops are likely to far exceed the demonstrable need and our results likely reflect a scarcity of target pests According to research published in Environmental Science and Technology in 2015 between 79 and 100 percent of

Krupke said that typically when farmers buy seeds they are not thinking about pre treatment and that every seed is treated with multiple compounds When most farmers think about their overall costs that topic the pesticide on the seeds it s of relatively low importance he said You cannot go and say I want pesticides 1 and 3 and 6 but I don t want 2 and 4 and 5 It s not like that One other reason farmers could ditch the treated seeds is that modern plants are superior in many ways One of the things that s neglected when we talk about pest management and these crops Krupke said is that we ve done so much excellent work breeding just classical plant breeding that these plants grow faster they put on more biomass they re more competitive they re more cold tolerant they re more drought tolerant they re just much harder to stop These plants they are far better equipped to navigate the challenges posed by insects as well Their genetics are far superior than those of crop plants from even 10 20 years ago The problem for the growers he said is that they have a hard time getting the elite genetics the topnotch varieties without insecticides Krupke said that virtually all corn is treated with insecticides and fungicides but that soybean seeds are more likely to be available without the treatments Technology and crop insurance Solutions to neonic risks At Cornell University where McArt has described treated seeds as an insurance policy one of the recommendations in his report was to offer exactly that better insurance policies along with better models and methods to monitor for higher levels of pests that threaten crops In Cornell s report for New York state the team posited that farmers expecting normal pest pressures might forgo seed treatments in exchange for more generous insurance covering potential damage from early season pests Inexpensive insurance would also allow farmers not using treated seeds to continue using cover crops and reduced tillage with

and soybean yields have not changed since the European Union banned neonicotinoid seed treatments in 2018 and yields have increased in the Canadian province of Ontario since its ban on neonicotinoid seed treatments in 2017 There s no reason to expect a different result in the USA McArt said If we got rid of neonics McArt said is it going to devastate agriculture in the U S No We already have

by Rebecca Raney Back in 2014 the headlines lit up with bad news about declines in bee health and scientific research tied that decline to the rise in the use of neonicotinoid pesticides In the midst of this onslaught of news Bayer Crop Science opened the Bayer Bee Care Center in North Carolina to great fanfare It was the site of a flurry of bee research and public tour groups for five years Within a year it drew television news coverage Then in 2015 one other significant development cropped up Bayer along with the public relations firm Porter Novelli was named a finalist for two national PR awards for the bee care team as an exemplary form of crisis public relations For PR Week the effort was a candidate in the Crisis of Issues Management Campaign of the Year For PR News the 2014 Bayer North America Bee Care Program was up for a platinum award in crisis management Further a Bayer executive touted the recognition for the team as crisis PR in a company newsletter which was acquired by U S Right to Know through the Florida Sunshine Act In the newsletter dated March 20 2015 Beth Roden now senior vice president and head of communications for Bayer U S wrote that our bee care team was nominated in the crisis or issues management category this year Though we were beaten by Under Armor and how they responded to the winter Olympics speed skating suit controversy I could

policies Entomologist Judy Wu Smart at the U S Capitol Credit Judy Wu Smart In 2016 Judy Wu Smart saw every sign that her career was off to a great start She was starting a new post as leader of the bee lab at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln Her doctoral dissertation on the health of queen bees had made headlines Her students were kicking off some intriguing new research Then all her bees started dying We would walk into our bee yards she said and your heart would just sink In colony after colony the bees were shaking and seizing They were dying in this horrendous way said Wu Smart who is an associate professor of entomology Since her investigation started in 2017 about 90 colonies have died each of which contained 20 000 to 30 000 bees She said her typical work day involved seeing piles and piles of dead bees Their symptoms she said were consistent with exposure to toxins The likely cause Not far from the bee yards a plant was converting excess crop seeds coated with neonicotinoids a pesticide that s chemically similar to nicotine into ethanol The role of neonicotinoids in the health of bees and the collapse of colonies is the subject of significant scientific debate Researchers are also studying multiple factors that may affect bee health including genetics Varroa mites poor nutrition due to the loss of crop diversity the presence of fungus and bacterial infections Wu Smart s experience with the dying bees led her to rethink the role of scientists who are typically encouraged to educate not advocate She has decided to advocate In the years since she encountered the bee die off in her research hives she has testified and consulted on legislation to limit pesticides specifically neonicotinoids which coat the outside of corn seed She has taken her case to Minnesota Nebraska New York California and New Jersey In all these jurisdictions she has told the story of what happened to her hives and she has consistently provided testimony in states that are considering banning the treated seeds Because of the high bar for federal regulation of pesticides she is focusing on efforts in statehouses She knows that bans may not gain traction in many states However she consults with legislative staffers on the issue whenever they call A Dicey Proposition Even in the extreme case of a scientist who has suffered the losses of millions of bees

ready to educate If you sit down to talk with her she ll run a slideshow Wu Smart became fascinated with the mysterious ways of wild bees nearly two decades ago during a research project on orchid bees in South Florida during a posting for the Student Conservation Association for Americorps She described the creatures as an amazing little bumblebee like bee that collects oils from orchids What she learned The bees could synthesize their own perfume to attract mates even without feeding on pollen from orchids That was about the same time as colony collapse disorder was highlighted in Florida she said One moment I m just blown away by these incredible wild bees and then the next moment I m learning all these bees are dying Although her bachelor s degree had been in zoology she entered a master s program in entomology to study bee health and pollination in Washington state where apple pollinators support the state s top crop At Washington State University she studied how pesticide residues accumulate in honeycombs What she learned Beekeepers are creatures of habit to the extent that some of them held onto legacy combs that had been handed down by their grandparents The oldest

recommended that beekeepers remove old combs so that pesticide loads would not accumulate We saw a big shift in beekeepers willingness to cull old combs Wu Smart said It was definitely kind of cool to see that your research results ended up changing a practice in the industry Her posting for her Ph D in entomology proved to be more politically charged From 2010 to 2015 at the University of Minnesota Wu Smart s research dropped her into the scientific controversies surrounding the effects of neonicotinoids on bee health For her research Wu Smart compared the health of queens in honeybee and bumblebee colonies when they were exposed to neonicotinoid pesticides Honeybee queens receive food that s processed and filtered by the worker bees They are less likely to come into direct contact with contaminated nectar or pollen But bumblebee queens may forage directly from flowers especially in spring when they are just starting nests Wu Smart was testing whether the direct contact with toxins affected the bumblebees egg laying cycle These queens were more sensitive to these contaminants she said Her research showed that the bumblebee queens that consumed neonicotinoids experienced a two week delay in the initiation of their nests In a three to five month cycle two weeks makes for a substantial delay The study showed some really alarming concerns she said but it didn t necessarily say that the colonies won t ever recover The nuance in her findings that exposure to chemicals affected hives but did not result in permanent loss underscores the divide in the scientific community over whether to restrict neonicotinoids Regulators at the EPA ban substances that kill or that can contribute to killing bees or disrupting reproduction However if those substances show lesser effects such as impairing communication and foraging those findings do not necessarily reach the level that spurs regulation Scientists in the field she said are working to reach consensus on appropriate benchmarks for regulation Should it happen when a queen stops laying eggs Or when a substance is lethal to a colony The debate over whether sublethal effects of neonicotinoids threaten hives and honeybee health and ultimately the ability to pollinate crops remains one of the most significant areas of debate in the field A subset of the research focuses on the pesticide s potential effects on communication in colonies and behavior of individual bees and whether those effects threaten hives Healthy bees in a frame used for research Credit Judy Wu Smart", "chunk_id":
