Each step is linked to receiving either a jewel or precious metal. **Ruby** will often be next. It is linked to sexual abuse and sexual alters inside. As the child is repeatedly sexually traumatized and survives, or creates sexual alters to please adults, they are \"rewarded\" by being allowed to become a ruby. **Emerald** will often come later (ages 12 to 15). This is considered very precious and is linked to family loyalty, witchcraft, and spiritual achievement. Emeralds will often have a black cat or other \"familiar\" linked to them. **Diamond** is the highest gemstone, and not all children will earn it. As it is considered a high achievement, it may not be earned until adulthood, after passing rigorous tasks. It will be the controlling alter in a gemstone system. **A diamond has passed all twelve steps of discipline plus other unusual tests, and will have highest family loyalty. ** \"Family jewels\" are often passed down internally during training sessions with trainers and family members. All high Illuminati families will have jewels hidden in secret vaults (real, outside jewels) which have been passed down for generations. The children will often be given jewelry to wear in the daytime, as a reminder or reward, once they pass their programming. A child may be given a ruby ring or garnet pin to wear. A grandparent or parent may insist the child wear it. On ritual occasions, the child will be allowed to wear jewelry from the family's vault once they reach a certain status. They may be allowed to wear a ruby pendant or emerald bracelet during high rituals and will be quite proud of the fact, since the cult is first, foremost and always an extremely status conscious group. The children pick up on this, and **the adults will make a big fuss over the children who have earned the right to wear jewels.

Slowly discovering how the colors were put in will help. Grieving for the vast amount of deception, the amount of abuse heaped on the child, and the very young alters who were the original templates may occur. These parts may be barely verbal. They may want to draw their experiences or use colors in collages (with the help of older parts inside) to describe to a safe outside person what their reality has been. Validating to them that they are not just a color, that they are part of a whole person, may help. The survivor may see colored overlays for awhile as they are undoing this programming, as parts inside share their memories. This is normal, although it may feel uncomfortable to see objects as yellow or green, for example. Grounding oneself, having cognitives do reality orientation, and patience will help the survivor work through this time. **Jewel programming and metals may be more complex to work with, since the child's sense of specialness, pride and status may be bound up in these alters.** Rubies, emeralds and diamonds are considered \"high alters\" inside and are used to leadership roles, both internally and externally. Acknowledging their importance to the system, listening to them grieve at leaving the cult (which meant giving up their status externally), and giving them new positions inside that are important can help. They can become system leaders in helping the person stay safe once they make the decision to leave the cult. They can become strong allies. But they will often be among the most resistant, and even hostile, to the idea of leaving the cult at first, since they have only known and remembered being rewarded for jobs well done, and have learned to \"pass down\" the traumas to \"lower parts\" inside. They will often honestly not believe they have been abused, and will only remember being petted or allowed to lead, or being told they were special, valued. Listening to how they feel, acknowledging that leaving means giving up things that were important to them, finding out what needs motivated them, and trying to find healthy outlets for them to get their needs met outside of cult meetings will help. Letting a jewel have leadership within, or chair internal meetings, may make up for loss of external leadership when the survivor leaves the cult. **Acknowledging their importance to the survivor is also important.

This task takes time and good outside support to accomplish. Allow them to vent their feelings. They will often be highly cognitive at first, but feelings will come, especially grieving, then pain at having been deceived by the cult, then the anguish of realizing that the abuse they passed down to others inside was actually happening to them. They may become quite depressed at this stage, but they can also lend tremendous stability and strength to the system in staying safe and cult free, once they have reached this stage. These are some thoughts on color, metals, and jewel programming. Other types of programming will be addressed in the next chapter. **Chapter Six** **Brain Wave Programming ** In this chapter I will address brain wave programming. Brain wave programming, like any other programming, will depend on several factors. These include: The child's ability to dissociate; the region of the country or which country the child grows up in; the level of ability of the trainers the child has contact with; physical resources and equipment available. There is no one \"recipe\" that fits every person, and it would be ridiculous to state that all people who go through brain wave programming have it done the same way. **More and more, programmers are talking, sharing knowledge over the net both nationally and internationally, and sharing both successes and failures. But there is no one standardized methodology for brain wave programming. **It will often be influenced by the child herself, as well as the trainer's whims. Different groups may organize the systems differently or try to achieve different effects. All of this said, what is brain wave programming? Simply put, **brain wave programming involves having a young child go into a deep trance state where they then learn to dissociate into a certain brain wave pattern. **This is a complex skill, and not all children can achieve this. The goal is for the child to reach, for example, a consistent delta state, where delta brain waves show up on the EEG, which is attached to the child's head by electrodes in the scalp. Usually, two or even three trainers will work on one child during the initial stages.

The goal is for the child to reach, for example, a consistent delta state, where delta brain waves show up on the EEG, which is attached to the child's head by electrodes in the scalp. Usually, two or even three trainers will work on one child during the initial stages. One will prep the child using a hypnotic drug to induce a trance state. They will have also placed the electrodes on the head, using an abbreviated version of the method used in traditional hospital setting. If delta state is being induced, only the electrodes needed to pick up delta waves will be placed, for example. This is to save time. The prepped child will be on a trainer's table and will be quite relaxed.** The average child is about eight years old when this is begun, since the cerebral cortex and neurological development are not advanced enough at earlier ages.** Note that it has been tried at earlier ages, though quite unsuccessfully. This practice was dropped because of the neurological damage and \"failure to take\" rate that trainers were seeing. The non-prepping trainer will next let the child know exactly what he/she expects: that they will achieve a special state called \"delta state\". The trainer tells the child while they are in trance state that they will know when they reach it by the readings from the electrodes. The trainer will tell the child alter, who has been called up to be a \"template\" or building block for the new system, that delta is good. They will emphasize this over and over. The child will then be shocked to increase its receptivity to learning. This also arouses the child from its drugged state and it will be more alert. It will want to please the trainer. The trainer will tell the child that she/he wants it to perform certain mental exercises. The trainer will then give backwards counting exercises, used to help the child achieve deeper trance states. Other verbal cues to trance down may be given. When the prepping or technical trainer sees delta waveforms, he or she will signal the verbal trainer with a hand motion. The verbal or teaching trainer will immediately reward the child saying, \"Good, you are in delta now.\" The trainer will caress the child and tell it what a good job it is doing. **If the child bounces out of delta state, the verbal trainer will immediately become harsh and will shock the child as punishment.** The child is told that it left delta and needs to go back in.

The induction, counting, will be repeated until delta state is seen again, when the child is repeatedly rewarded for entering, then staying in this state for longer and longer periods. The trainers are using biofeedback principles to teach the child to consistently cue into a brainwave pattern. When the template can stay in delta pattern consistently, the template will be rewarded. This will occur over several months. **The trainers will now have a template that stays always in delta state that they can begin splitting and using as the basis of forming a new system inside. They will do this using the tools of drugs, hypnosis and trauma. **The new system created will record delta waves on an EEG if done correctly. The new system will be taught what delta means. The trainers will often flash a cue, or delta (triangle) symbol on a projector overhead, and \"grind in\" the delta imprinting. They will wear robes with delta signs on them and cloth the subject in clothing or robes imprinted with the delta sign. They will teach the alters under hypnosis what deltas do and how they act. They will reward them when they comply and shock or otherwise traumatize them if they do not act like \"deltas\". They will be given delta jobs. They will watch high frequency films that show delta functions. They may build in a computer like structure to hold the system, showing pictures of its organization while the subject is under deep trance, after creating a clean slate through trauma. Other brain wave states will be induced in similar manners. They will often be formed using templates which were programmed into extremely young internal child alters, who may be splits from core splits. This can then be used as a basis for programming. Common brain wave states used are: **Alpha:** This is the most easily reached brain wave state. It also includes both the youngest and most easily accessed alters in the entire system. Young children have long periods of alpha activity and must be trained to enter other brain wave states for long periods. **System access programming, access codes and sexual alters will often be placed in alpha, which may also be coded red in some systems. ** **Beta:** This is the next most easily reached state.

It holds more emotion than all other states except alpha. **Suicide programming will often be layered into this system, as these alters would rather die than leave their \"family\". Scholarship programming may be held by this system, since they easily memorize by rote. Several languages may be spoken by different alters in this system,** as the Illuminati like to program in plural linguality, with up to eight languages both modern and ancient being spoken. **Delta:** This is one of the more cognitive brain wave states. It will often be highly dissociated.** It may also be the \"ruling\" or controlling state over the other brain wave systems. Often, delta state may be configured inside as a computer, and the delta alters will have emotionless, flat alters with photographic memories. **They may hold most of the cognitive memories for the other systems, especially if extensive amnesia programming has been done. Delta state may have up to three levels of training: delta 1, delta 2, and delta 3, which will also correlate to security access allowed within the cult, i.e. access to highly confidential information. Behavioral sciences programming may be held by this system.** Internal programmers, self destruct, psychotic, and shatter programming as well as other punishment programming sequences to prevent outside access or internal access to the systems may be held within delta systems. It may be color coded both orange/blue/purple, and will also often be the entry way to higher systems such as jewels or internal councils, inside. ** **Epsilon:** **This is often a hidden system and may hold CIA programming and high level governmental programming. Assassin programming may be held in this system, or in the beta system, depending on the trainer.** Covert operations, courier operations, learning to tail a subject, \"drop a tag\", disguises, and getting out of difficult situations may all be handled by this system, which sees itself as chameleon-like.

These are often placed in over a matter of years, with ages from 8 to 21 being the primary ones, with occasional reinforcement of the programming from time to time. **Suggestions ** **Brain wave programming is a very complex form of programming which creates automatic amnesia and communication barriers between the different brain wave states. This will also be reinforced by shock and punishment to prevent its \"degradation\", or undoing. Internal system controllers and programmers will also work to reinforce the programming, especially at night, when the person's body is asleep. ** All brain wave systems will have system controllers, usually set up in a group of three (the Illuminati love triads, as being the \"mystical\" and most stable number. They believe that systems built upon triads are extremely strong, unbreakable, and so they will often program in threes: three back ups, three system controllers, etc.). With the help of a good therapist, the survivor needs to get to know the internal system controllers and communicators. They are there. They have to be, because the trainers placed them there to communicate with and to be accountable to them externally. They will often have complete knowledge of their own system. They will also be quite flat, and dissociated from the knowledge of their own pain or the abuse that created them. This is a distancing mechanism, as the person's survival depended on the ability of their controller to do this at one time. They will often be quite hostile and very unwilling to look at their own abuse. They will become indignant at the idea and claim that they are cognitive, and \"above\" being abused (another lie they were told by their abusers). Time, patience, and finding out what their needs are; listening to them vent their frustration; pointing out reality (i.e., the controllers and all parts are related to each other; are part of the same person; and all were abused, even though they were able to dissociate from their pain), and trying to help them meet their needs for recognition, acceptance, and approval will begin to allow them to question their previous loyalty. **These systems are often driven by fear: fear of punishment; fear of remembering (they were often the most tortured systems in the survivor, and were promised amnesia in return for continued cooperation). Their fears are real, and should be listened to and respected, as shatter programming and flood programming are real threats to the survivor and can cause functionality to go down. ** **Flood programming", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:34:5dffb66696b8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14431, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 35, "text": "for recognition, acceptance, and approval will begin to allow them to question their previous loyalty. **These systems are often driven by fear: fear of punishment; fear of remembering (they were often the most tortured systems in the survivor, and were promised amnesia in return for continued cooperation). Their fears are real, and should be listened to and respected, as shatter programming and flood programming are real threats to the survivor and can cause functionality to go down. ** **Flood programming is a sequence put in place to punish a system if its internal programming is allowed to degrade or access to an unauthorized person, either internally or externally, is allowed. It will involve the fragments who hold highly traumatic memories, both emotional and physical, being pushed to the front where the person is \"flooded\" with wave after wave of memories.** If this is triggered, and it frequently is if the survivor is in therapy, the first priority should be slowing the memories down. This may mean trying to reason with internal controllers or deltas who are allowing the flooding. They need to know that if the front or previously amnesic alters go down or are re-shattered due to traumatization, it will weaken all the systems. Bargain with them. Prayer will help in this situation. **Physical safety, including inpatient therapy, may be needed if flooding or shatter programming are activated. Suicide programming is often layered in with both types, and external physical safety will be paramount for the survivor, with lots of outside accountability as they undo these intense programming sequences.** Frequent reality orientation and explaining new, better jobs can help. Undoing brain wave programming should ideally only be done with lots of safe external support. This may include extra therapy sessions and even hospitalization (if programming that could cause loss of functionality or suicide are triggered), and should be geared towards increasing internal communication and cooperation. Alters jobs can be changed from internal programmers to internal deprogrammers, from internal shatterers or punishers to internal protectors, and from internal reporters who report back to the cult to reporters who can instead be asked to report internally on what the body is doing and to keep it safe. These are examples of possible changes. Make friends with system controllers, as they can become strong helpers and will work with the therapist to keep things safe for the survivor. **Chapter Seven** **Military Programming** I want to devote an entire chapter to military programming and how it is done. Why? As noted in chapter three, the Illuminati are emphasizing the importance of military training more and more as part of their plan for eventual takeover.

It is often started by three years of age with simple exercises. **The children are taken by their parents to a training area, which may be a large inside auditorium or a remote area outside where training maneuvers are done. Tents are set up, with command centers for the different commanding officers and military trainers. The children are taught to march in time, keeping a straight line. They are punished by being kicked, shocked with a cattle prod, or beaten with a baton if they move out of place. They will be dressed in small uniforms in imitation of the adults. The adults will have ranks, badges and insignia indicating their level of achievement in the cult hierarchy and military. Badges and medals are given out to indicate the person's level of training and tests passed. **Commanding officers are often brutal and will teach even the youngest children with harsh measures. ** The children will be forced to march long distances, which increase as they get older, in any weather. They are forced to learn to cross obstacles. **They will be given fake guns with blanks when they are young. These guns are perfect replicas of real guns, but fire blanks. The children are taught to load and fire all manner of firearms, both real and fake, under close adult supervision.** They will spend hours learning to aim, sight, and fire these guns at targets. At first the targets are bulls eyes, but as the children get older the targets will be similar to police cut outs of humans. The children are taught to aim for the head or the heart. Later, they will graduate to realistic manikins. This is conditioning them to kill a human being. They will be shown violent films of warfare, much more explicit and graphic than normal movies in group classes. Killing techniques will be shown in slow motion.** The motif \"kill or be killed\" will be ground in over and over. **The trainer will ask the children what mistakes the people who were killed made. Being killed is considered weakness; being a killer is considered strength. The children will be forced, by age seven or eight, to crawl on their bellies with simulated blanks firing overhead. They are not told these are blanks, and they are extremely painful if one hits the child in the back or buttocks. They quickly learn to keep down under fire.

Battle conditions will be simulated as the children go through years of boot camp training. **The cult creates a microcosm of real military training for their children and youth.** They will be rewarded with merit badges for doing well in activities such as completing an obstacle course or staying cool under fire. Nazi concentration camps will be simulated with guards and prisoners. The \"guards\" are usually older children or youth who have done well. The \"prisoners\" are younger children or those being punished for not performing well in maneuvers. There is intense pressure to want the guard role and not be a prisoner, since prisoners are locked up, beaten, kicked, and laughed at. **Hunting and tracking games where the prisoners are given a half hour lead are frequent. These may also involve the use of specially trained dogs taught to knock the quarry down but not kill them.** Older children are taught to handle the dogs and use them. Youth are taught to help the adults train the dogs. Teens may be rewarded by becoming \"youth leaders\" who are allowed to plan the week's activities. The military training will closely follow the principles of Nazi military and S.S. training. The trainers often speak in German to the children, who must learn the language. All C.O.s (Commanding Officers) and high ranking adults speak in German during these exercises. They may also speak in French, since linguistic ability is encouraged in the Illuminati. Exercises for older youth will include games where groups compete against each other, in which the older teen leads, with the help of an adult advisor. Groups that win are rewarded, groups that lose are punished. The youth are taught to leave behind the weak or slow members. Unfit members are shot or killed, and the youth leader learns to do these tasks. They are taught to bring their unit through simulated battles with other units. Cool, cognitive logic under these conditions is rewarded. The goal is to creative cognitive leaders inside the military systems who are dissociated from emotions under the stress of battle conditions. **The youth and their followers are taught and trained in all manner of crowd control.** They will see special films that address all possible responses to a military takeover and the crowds' response.

The \"crowd\" is coached by their trainers to act in different ways. **The ultimate goal of all of this is to create an organized army of children, youth, and adults, who will know exactly what to do during the coming takeover of the world.** The training that I described is going on not only in the U.S., but in every country in the world. Top training centers are located in Germany, Belgium, France, and Russia. Military trainers are often sent to these countries, to learn new techniques, then sent back to their home countries. **Suggestions** It is important to realize that military alters inside are extremely hierarchical. They will often be ranked inside, with lower \"foot soldiers\" accountable to inside alters with increasing rank. Usually, the higher the military rank, the higher the alter will be inside the system. A soldier with no rank may not have much knowledge about, or pull, inside the system. Its only job is to blindly obey others after years of conditioning to do this. Ranking officers inside will often be modeled after outside perpetrators, officers, or trainers. An internal general will often have much more knowledge than lower ranks and should be befriended, as they can help with therapy. It will take time, effort, and patience for both the survivor and the therapist to get to know these military officers. They are often abrupt, arrogant, and extremely hostile to therapy. They are often strongly loyal to the cult and proud of their badges, awards, and achievements that were earned through years of traumatization and hard work. They will often be reluctant to give this up, for the perceived loss engendered by leaving the cult. They will also have strong programming surrounding them, including honor/dishonor suicidal programming (the brave, honorable soldier will die rather than betray his group, etc.). It is important to deal with the suicidal programming and intense limbic conditioning that many of these alters have been subjected to, while at the same time reasoning with the higher ranking members.

Letting them go hiking (with a safe support person) and practice outdoor skills can be helpful. Acknowledging their importance to the survivor and the trauma they underwent, respecting their loyalty and bravery, and appealing to their sense of honor to help the system stay safe (these alters often have a highly developed, although misguided, sense of honor) can help. Internal commendation for bravery, even an internal awards ceremony (they are used to this) for the parts that have decided to leave the cult, and protect the body, can be performed. They are accustomed to praise and receiving recognition for work well done and need this motivation. They once got this from the cult, but the survivor can turn the locus of control internally, instead of externally, to break bonds with the cult. **Military protectors can change their job to keeping the body safe, away from perpetrators. They can be a system's greatest asset, as they are great at \"kicking butt\", and are not easily frightened.** They may be able to tell outside perpetrators to leave the survivor alone, and protect the survivor from outside accessing. Allowing them to vent their feelings in therapy, in journaling, in pictures, and in collages can also help. Although higher ranking officers internally are often very dissociated from their feelings, they can begin to empathize with the others below them, who took their pain, and the brunt of the brutal, punitive experiences. They have to be willing to acknowledge that they were abused at some point, and that they were deceived and used. Finding the youngest alters they were split from will help with this process. With time and good internal communication, as well as patience from both the therapist and survivor, military alters can become one of the strongest assets and allies in staying cult free. **Chapter Eight** **CIA, Governmental, and Scholarship Programming** **CIA Programming** **Some systems will have internal CIA programming. Some of the methods mentioned in earlier chapters, such as brain wave programming and color coding were developed in part through funding by the CIA in the 1950's and 1960's. Military intelligence officers working in Langley, Virginia, used these government funds to conduct research on human subjects.

The end result of tagging the victim can include having a sexual assignation with the target or may involve having people inside trained to assassinate a target. These are complex programming sequences which are installed over years of training with periodic reinforcement. Alters may be trained to become hyper aware of their environment and able to overhear conversations that are whispered. Internal recorders are taught to download these conversations as well as other info. Photographic recall is emphasized, as the person will be hypnotized or put into a delta state for \"downloading\" information to the trainer or CIA operative. The survivor with CIA programming will have been taught extensively how to \"drop a tag\" (detect anyone following them and ditch them). This training begins in early childhood and is built upon as the child grows older. They will often be taken into a neutral colored training room. They may be drugged or hypnotized, though it is usually a combination of both. **The child will be shown training films of how a CIA operative works. They will be told that they are \"special\", \"chosen\", \"one in a thousand\" who is the only one who can do this special work. They are told that they get to be a secret agent for the CIA. The young child, having no idea who the CIA is, focuses on the fact that they have been chosen because they are special, needed, and will be eager to please. ** The child will be taken to a dinner party or a drama set up by the trainer. There will be a group, anywhere from ten to sixteen people at the \"party\". Afterwards, the child will be questioned by the trainer extensively. Who was sitting where? What were they wearing? What color were their eyes? Their hair? Who gave the speech? What did they say? The child will be praised for correct answers, but punished, even shocked if unable to recall details. This is to reinforce natural photographic memory and assist the child with recording details. The next few times, the child's abilities will improve, as it wants to avoid punishment. In the next level of training the child will be asked to observe and figure out: Who is the most important person in the room? Why?

They will be taught to engage them in innocuous conversation while looking for information they have been clued to get. **They may be taught to be innocently seductive, and will be dressed for the part. They will frequently be taught to lure the target into having intercourse with them. ** **An older youth or adult will also be taught not only how to lure a target into bed, but later how to kill them, if they are an assassination target, while they are asleep or relaxing after sexual relations. They will be taught to go through the target's belongings for any information needed by the trainer or cult leader. Often, before an assignment for an assassination, the cult member will be indoctrinated with reasons why killing the victim is a service to humanity. ** They will be lied to and told that they are the head of a porno ring, a pedophile, or a brutal villain. This will engage the assassin's natural anger towards the person. It will motivate them, while helping to overcome their natural moral reluctance and guilt at killing a human being. They will be taught how to disguise themselves with changes of clothing, sex (masquerading as the opposite sex), makeup, and contact lenses, and how to get out of the situation safely. They will be taught how to overcome interrogation techniques with extensive training and hypnosis, in case they are ever caught. In most cases, they will be taught to commit suicide with a pill or dagger if they are ever apprehended. **Suggestions** CIA programming will involve the use of sophisticated technology to reinforce its effectiveness. It can be quite difficult to break. It may involve the person being traumatized in isolation tanks (which can be combined with brain wave programming). It may involve sensory deprivation, sensory overload, isolation, and sleep deprivation. It may involve hours of listening to repetitive tapes on headphones. The subject is shocked, or severely punished, if they try to remove the headphones. The subject will also be hypnotized, tortured, subjected to different drug combinations, and exposed to harmonic tones, often in one ear or the other. They will be exposed to flashing strobe lights which may induce a seizure, and alters will be programmed to cause seizures if the subject tries to break programming. They will be shown high speed films with different tracks, one for the left eye", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:41:cb71f94005c8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14438, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 42, "text": "subject is shocked, or severely punished, if they try to remove the headphones.

They will be shown high speed films with different tracks, one for the left eye and one for the right eye, to increase brain splitting or dichotomous thinking. **The survivor and therapist need to work slowly to undo the effects of this trauma. The person will need to come to terms, slowly, and carefully, with how the programming was done.** They may need to learn their own access codes (as with brain wave and other sophisticated programming techniques). They will need to communicate with the traumatized alters and fragments inside, let them know they were used. They will need to help the young alters who were split to create the system and often underwent the worst traumas. Grieving for the abuse, the trauma, the methodical calculation and scientific methods used to put in this programming, will take time. Venting feelings safely, particularly rage, will be important. The survivor may be afraid of strong feelings and will especially fear anger and rage, since they will associate those feelings with having to kill, hurt, or assassinate others. **Allowing the feelings to be expressed slowly and carefully, being aware that homicidal and suicidal feelings will probably come up, is important. ** If there is a concern about the ability to control acting out, the client may need to register as an inpatient in a safe facility that understands mind control and cult programming. They will fear being labeled psychotic since the programmers told them that they would be called this and locked up forever. The worst thing a therapist or hospital can do in a situation like this is play into those fears or label the person psychotic. Constant grounding in reality using grounding exercises; slow, careful venting of rage and betrayal feelings; reinforcing over and over that the survivor can remember; being most careful not to allow the client to go psychotic or die; believing and validating the survivor, are all important. The survivor may have unstable behavior at points. This is not psychosis, but rather the natural reaction to extreme trauma. The survivor needs to realize this so that they can overcome its effects with time and good therapy. They will need hope and a good support system. **Governmental Programming ** Governmental programming will involve the person being trained to take leadership positions or administrative positions in the government.

They may be trained to network with others in governments at local, national, and international levels. The Illuminati's stated goal is to infiltrate, and eventually cause the downfall of, all major governments in the world. Government operatives are taught to do this by infiltrating local political parties and running for leadership both locally and nationally, or by working for top leaders, such as administrators and financial advisors who fund governmental races. They also back the person sympathetic to the Illuminati or put their person in to win, creating political chaos and unrest with operatives trained in dissension. **The people selected for governmental programming are usually highly intelligent with native charm, or charisma. They are also skilled people manipulators. These abilities may be enhanced through programming, encouraging the person to project a persona that will draw people to them. ** They are also taught finances extensively. This programming is done by hypnotizing the person, whether child, youth, or adult (it is usually initiated in late childhood in suitable candidates), and inducing deep trance with drugs. The person is then shocked and told the trainer's and cult agenda for the person. They are told that they are very special to the Illuminati, that they will be one of the people who helps change world history. They are told they will be rewarded with wealth, popularity and power for achieving the cult's agenda. They are told, and shown, what the punishment for disobedience is. They are shown training films about government, how it works, and national and international affairs. They will meet with special teachers who coach them on the inner political workings of the group they want to infiltrate, including the power structure and strengths and weaknesses of key players. They will learn any languages necessary for the position. They will go to university or get other training and education needed for credibility. They will receive special scholarships to finance this, if needed. They are given opportunities to practice their skills at infiltration, information gathering, people manipulation, and politics, first in set ups, and later in real life situations. If they need to learn to control the media, they will learn methods to do this. **They will have extensive back up and coaching during their entire career. ** **Suggestions** Governmental programming is quite complex since it ties in with the person's natural abilities.

They may find it difficult to believe that their career, friendships, marriage and contacts have been secretly guided by the cult for most of their life. These parts may feel offended, betrayed, or furious when this realization hits. They will also find it difficult not to use the manipulation skills that come so naturally, both on their therapist and themselves, to dull the pain that the truth may bring. The person and the alters that have undergone this type of programming have a lot to lose if they give up their roles and persona. They need to count the cost of getting out and acknowledge the difficulty of doing so. They will need to grieve over being used, and for the false interpretation of reality they have believed all their lives. Listening to other parts inside and acknowledging the reality of the cult abuse will be important steps in breaking free. Success in a new career in the person's daily life will also help restore a broken self image. **Scholarship Training** **The Illuminati revere scholarship, especially oral tradition. Children with good memories and native intelligence may undergo specific training in the area of scholarship.** This will include learning under trauma, with praise for accomplishment. It will also mean punishment or being shocked for poor performance. Some of the major areas of scholarship include, but are not limited to: Oral tradition: history of the Illuminati, especially the child's particular branch, and memorizing genealogies. Learning and becoming fluent in multiple languages, both modern and ancient, including but not limited to: English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Egyptian hieroglyphics; ancient Babylonian, ancient Chaldean and cuneiform writings. Some revered ancient texts are written in very ancient languages, and certain ceremonies may include rituals which utilize them. So learning ancient and modern history and becoming adept at planning role plays and dramatizations are most valuable, as is learning to teach others the above skills. The child who becomes adept at scholarship will be expected to become a skilled teacher. They will practice teaching in both classroom and individual sessions. **Suggestions ** Scholarship programming will involve alters who are intensely loyal to the cult, since they believe they are related to a long, unbroken line of people since earliest history.

Appealing to logic and intellect, having an open mind and discussing the pros and cons of leaving the cult with them will often be received the best. They despise open conflict, and prefer addressing issues intellectually. They will be skilled debaters and quite verbal. Asking them to read books that address becoming free from the cult, and asking them to sit in and listen to accounts from traumatized alters both in their system and others inside, will often help them make the decision to switch loyalties. **Although they will have been immersed in false ideologies and doctrines, they are frequently willing to attempt to be intellectually honest.** **They will read and debate both sides of an issue and may become some of the first to make the decision to leave the cult once convinced that it is abusive. ** **Chapter Nine** **Programming Linked to Stories, Movies, Cartoons, or Role Play Dramatization ** In this chapter, I want to address a special type of programming that is universal with the Illuminati. It is programming that is linked to a story, movie, cartoon, or role play dramatization. **For countless centuries, Illuminati trainers and leaders have used role playing to reinforce as well as program children. It is a favorite mode of teaching up to this day. A typical drama set up or role play will involve a \"visit through time.\"** The child is told, while drugged or hypnotized, that it and the other children with it (usually, a small group will go through this programming together) are going to \"time travel\". The trainer or teacher is seen as immensely powerful by the children, as he or she magically transports them through time. The children enter another room where people are dressed up in period costumes from whichever time period in history the teacher wants the children to see. Everything is historically accurate and well researched. An example: if the children are to visit ancient Rome, they will be taken to a room in the Roman Senate where the characters are dressed in togas. They will be speaking to each other in ancient Latin and debating issues. Caesar or another king will enter the Senate. Roman customs for a scenario such as this one will be adhered to throughout the role play.

Illuminati agenda will be put forward, and the children will \"see\" that famous figures in history were actually Illuminists. This will reinforce their own feelings of \"specialness\" and honoring the historicity of the group. It will also reinforce language training, since the scenes may occur in medieval England or the French court of Louis XIV, etc. The scenes will also contain a moral that builds on programming the children have been undergoing. Maybe they will watch a traitor being guillotined in the French court. Or an unworthy senator, who tries to betray his king, will be stabbed. The child may be given a role in the play, such as taking a secret message to the king or queen, to reinforce courier programming. **The child really believes that they have stepped back into history and are part of the process of helping create history. ** With modern times, programming has become more sophisticated with the advent of technology. Before television or movies, programming was often scripted around famous fairy tales or stories and read aloud by one trainer, while the second trainer worked with the child. A good see-song voice is necessary in a \"reader\". The child would be read the story and, under hypnosis and trauma, told that they are one of the characters in the story. **They are then told the \"real\" meaning of the story, its \"hidden meaning\", and told that whenever they hear the story, they will remember what it really means. ** Nowadays, movies and videos are frequently used in programming. Favorite scripts include: Walt Disney movies (Disney was an Illuminist), especially Fantasia, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Cinderella, and Beauty and the Beast. The Wizard of Oz, both books and movie, has also been used. Any movie that incorporates Illuministic themes can be used. E.T. and Star Wars have been used in more recent years. **How Script Programming is Done ** The trainer will play the movie for the child. The child is told that they will be \"asked about\" the movie. This cues the child to use photographic recall about what they are viewing. The trainer may show the child an edited shorter version of the movie, with only parts of the whole, or may show the child a short scene from the movie. After watching the movie or scene, the child is drugged to relax it, then asked what it remembers.

After watching the movie or scene, the child is drugged to relax it, then asked what it remembers. The child will be shocked if it cannot recall items the trainer deems important, and will be forced to watch the scenes repetitively. When the child has total recall of the segments, the trainer will tell the child that it is one of the characters. The child may be heavily traumatized first, and a blank slate personality created inside to be the desired character. The first thing the blank slate sees is a recording of the movie or scene. This is its \"first memory\". The trainer will then link the scene with Illuminati ideology. They will teach the child the \"hidden meaning\" in the movie and praise the child for being one of the few \"enlightened ones\" who can understand what it truly means. **The script programming will often be linked to other programming the child is undergoing.** Military programming may be linked to Star Wars. Total recall programming may be linked to Data in Star Trek. Computer programming may be linked to Hal in 2001 A Space Odyssey; internal labyrinth programming may be linked to the movie \"Labyrinth\". The possibilities are quite varied and will depend on both the child and the trainer as to which direction script programming will go. Music from the show or scene will be used as a trigger to access the programming inside or bring forward these personalities. **Suggestions** Scripted programming will often involve a great deal of traumatization to create the \"blank slate\" alters desired. The programming will be ground in with repetition, electroshock, torture, drugging and hypnosis. **The alters inside who have gone through this programming will often be highly disconnected from external reality and may believe that they are part of a \"script\".** They may be Dorothy seeking the Emerald City (or the achievement of Illuminati rule on earth). They may be a computer or the character Data. Reality orientation will be very important. Allow these parts to experience safe outside reality, and test for themselves if they are really part of a man or woman. Looking in a mirror may help, when they express readiness. Having cognitive helpers who can share daily life memories with them may help to ground them.

They idealize betrayal as being the true state of man. The quick witted, the adept, learns this quickly and learns to manipulate it. ** The child will learn this principle through set up after set up. The child will be placed in situations where an adult who is kindly in set up after set up \"rescues\" the child, and so gains its trust. After the adult intervenes and protects the child several times, the child looks up to the adult as a \"savior\". After months or even a year of bonding, one day in a set up the child will turn to the adult for help. The adult will back away, mocking the child, and begin abusing it. This sets in place the programming: adults will always betray a child and other adults. **Twinning** Another set up will involve twinning, which deserves special mention here. **The Illuminati will often create twin bonds in their children. The ideal is to have a set of real twins, but of course this is not always possible. So, the child is allowed to play with, and become close to, another child in the cult from earliest childhood. At some point early on, the child will be told that the other child is actually their \"twin\", and that they were separated at birth. **They are told that this is a great secret and not to tell anyone, on pain of punishment.

They are taught together and do military training together. They tell each other secrets. They are also frequently friends in the daytime as well. They are taught to cross access each other just as real siblings would be. **But at some point, they will be forced to hurt each other. If one \"twin\" is considered expendable, the ultimate set up will be one in which one twin is forced to die while the other watches.** One twin may gather secrets from the other twin, be forced to disclose them to a trainer or cult leader, then may be forced to kill the other. One twin may be forced to hit, or hurt the other. If they refuse, the other twin will be brutalized by the trainer, and the refusing twin told that the child was hurt because of their refusal to comply. Many setups will involve one twin being forced to betray the other, turning on the other child after intense programming. **This betrayal set up will devastate both children, and they will learn the true lesson: trust no one. Betray, or be betrayed.** The children will also have adult role models on every hand, since the cult is a very political, hierarchical, back stabbing society. **Adults are constantly betraying each other, stepping over each other to move up. The children will watch one adult being praised, advanced, because they betrayed others below them, or set them up to fail.** The children will learn quickly to mimic the adults around them, and both adults and children can become quite cynical as to human nature. They will have seen it at its worst, whether in training sessions, the brutality of a C.O. in military, or the gossip and back stabbing that occurs before and after rituals. They also incorporate the message internally: play the game or be run over. Even the youngest children learn to manipulate others adeptly, at a very young age, while the adults laugh at how quickly they are learning adult ways. **People manipulation is considered a fine art in the cult, and those who do it best, as in any group, often win out. ** **Suggestions** Betrayal programming may have totally shattered the survivor's trust in outside people.

Inside littles will be very cautious at first, not trusting that the therapist is not just another trainer who will one day shout \"aha!\" and betray them if they begin to trust. This trust building takes time and patience, and must be earned through session after session where the therapist shows trustworthiness and non abusiveness. Survivors will test therapists over and over again, to see if they really are what they say they are. This is a normal part of the therapy process. Survivors may even try to back away from therapy, or outside support, as true caring support will \"wig them out\", i.e. conflict incredibly with their world view and experiences prior to leaving the cult. Both survivor and therapist need to realize that some amount of distrust is healthy, based on what the survivor has experienced, and may be life saving, helping to protect them from outside accessing. Honor this need and be patient while the survivor tests over and over. The survivor can try to reason with inside alters who may have been betrayed to the point of legitimate paranoia. They may ask them to watch, and see what the therapist, and/or support person is like. To take their time, check them out. To be aware that what they went through may magnify normal feelings of caution. Helping orient these parts to outside reality, and especially positive experiences of trusting a little, and not being harmed, will help make great strides in undoing this. The survivor may feel confusion and internal conflict, as they experience a world where trust is possible. They may pull away, or the reverse, become highly dependent on the therapist and share too quickly due to a longing for safe intimacy that has never been met. Setting healthy boundaries while acknowledging needs will help the survivor through this stage. Another type of programming involves the deliberate creation of internal structures within the cult member. **Internal Structures: Temples, eyes, mirrors, carousels etc.** The Illuminati trainers will try to create internal structures within the person's personality systems. Why? They believe this creates better stability. It also gives the alters and fragments a place to \"hang on to\" inside and creates a convenient way to call them up.

Internal structures will vary greatly depending on the trainer, the group, the region of the U.S. or Europe and the goals for the individual. Common internal structures will include, but are not limited to: **Temples:** These are often consecrated to principle Illuminati deities. Spiritual alters will congregate here. This may also represent actual temples, Masonic or private, that the subject may have visited. **Temple of Moloch:** Created out of black stone with a fire burning internally. **All seeing eye of Horus:** One of the most common structures in an Illuminati system; universal. **Horus is a deity revered by the Illuminati, and the all seeing eye internally represents the fact that the cult can always see what the individual is doing.** It will also represent being given to Horus in a high ceremony. The eye may be closed, or open, depending on the system's status at the time. This eye will also be linked to demonic watching of the person's activities at all time. **Pyramids:** The Illuminati revere ancient Egyptian symbology, especially \"mystery religion\" and Temple of Set teachings. Pyramids will be placed internally both for stability (a triangle, and/or pyramid represents strength and stability), and as a calling place for the demonic. Pyramids and triangles, and the number three, represent calling up the demonic in Illuminist philosophy. **Sun:** Represents Ra, the sun god. **Geometric figures:** Configurations of circles, triangles, pentagons, etc. Geometric patterns are considered sacred and are based in ancient philosophy. There may be hundreds overlapping in a training grid for complex systems, which will house fragments in each one. **Training grids:** These may be simplistic, such as cubes with patterns on them, rows of boxes, or more complex such as helixes, double helixes, and infinity loops. Each trainer will have favorites classified as simple, medium and complex, depending on the child and its ability to recall and memorize. **Columns:** Greek Doric and Ionic columns often hold \"time travel\" programming, with a portal between two columns. **Computers:** Complex, highly dissociated systems with alters and fragments held within a computer system. **Robots:** May be seen in older systems. **Crystals:** Gems, balls, multifaceted. Used in spiritual systems to enhance occult powers. Alters and fragments may congregate on facets of a large ball. **Mirrors:** Used internally to reinforce other programming sequences, internal twinning, and distortion of reality programming. May create shadow systems of functional systems. May also lock in demonic programming. **Carousels:** Used in some programming sequences to confuse alters inside.

Often linked to spin and confusion programming internally. May be used to punish internal alters; they will be spun on the carousel if they tell. **Deck of cards:** This can include cards from a deck, or complex configurations made of hundreds of cards inside. Dominoes programming is similar. All touch each other, so if a person tries to dismantle programming, the whole deck will fall. **Black boxes:** Represent self destruct and shatter programming sealed off into a black box to protect system. Should not be opened without careful preparation and good therapy. **Mines, booby traps:** See above. **Spider webs:** Represent linked programming with a spider (internal programmer) who continuously reweaves the web and reinforces internal programming and punishments. The web also communicates with other systems. Can also represent demonic linkages internally woven in. **Internal training rooms:** Used as punishments for internal alters. Will represent external training rooms person has been in. **Internal walls:** These will often represent very large internal amnesia barriers. The walls may be very thick, impermeable or semi permeable. **A typical use for a wall will be to maintain high levels of amnesia between \"front\" or daily living, amnesic alters, and \"back\" or cult active alters that contain more of the person's life history.** The back may be able to selectively see over and cross past the wall, but the front will be completely unaware that there is a wall, or what lays behind it. **Seals:** Usually in a group of six or seven, represent demonic sealing and may cover end times, shatter programming, as well as role within cult in the new hierarchy. These are some common programming structures. Again, there are many, many other types of internal structures used. The number and type are only limited by the trainer's and survivor's creative abilities. The way that these structures are placed within the person are fairly similar. Under drugs, hypnosis and electroshock, the person is traumatized into a deep trance state. In the deep trance they will be told to open their eyes and look at: either a projected image of the structure, a 3D model of it, or a holographic image using a virtual reality headset. The image will be ground in using shock and bringing the image closer and closer to the person's visual field. It may be rotated, if graphics are available or a 3D is used.

If it is a temple or pyramid, they may be told that they are entering inside it under deep hypnosis, or that they (the alter being programmed) will now \"live inside\" the structure/box/card, etc. This will also be used to reinforce amnesia and isolation programming internally, since the structure will be used to reinforce walls between the alter/fragment and other alters and fragments internally. **Suggestions** **If the survivor finds structures inside, it will help for them first of all to try and realize why they are there. What purpose do they serve?** To reinforce amnesia? Isolation? Spiritual programming? Punishment? To hold dangerous programming sequences? This is important, since some structures such as internal walls or barriers may have been created not only by the cult, but reinforced by the survivor as well, as a means of internal protection. The survivor may not want to dismantle internal structures too quickly without knowing their purpose and what they contain. Both the survivor and the therapist will need to go slowly. Learning how the structures were put in and which alters are linked to the structure will be a first step. Long, slow and careful preparation with lots of system cooperation will be needed to look at some structures. This may only come after years of extensive therapy. Each survivor will progress at their own pace. If a wall is present, taking it down slowly, one brick at a time, or allowing part of it to become semi permeable, may be first steps in healing. Training rooms can have the equipment turned off and dismantled. A room can be turned into a safe room, redecorated and refitted with toys and safe objects. Computers can slowly begin to realize that they are human and gradually allowed to take on human characteristics. Survivors can use their creativity to reclaim themselves with the support of their therapists and undo what was done. **Chapter Eleven** **Suicidal Programming ** I have decided to write an entire chapter about suicidal programming, since it is often the most dangerous programming that the survivor will face during their healing process. **All Illuminati survivors will have suicidal programming protecting their systems.** I emphasized this to also reiterate the need for good therapy and a strong support system for the survivor.

They may even desire to leave the group or try to dismantle their own programming. The trainers are well aware of this possibility and to prevent this, will always program in suicidality. The suicidality, or suicidal programming, may surround one or more systems internally. It may be layered into more than one system. **From earliest childhood, survivors have been conditioned to believe that they would rather die than leave their \"family\" (the Illuminati group). This is the core, or basis of suicidal programming.** It will be closely linked to loyalty to one's family as well as the group (remember, this is a generational group and leaving it may mean giving up contact with one's parents, spouse, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins and children, as well as close friends). These people will all try to contact the survivor and try to draw them back into the cult, asking things like \"don't you love us anymore?\", or even becoming accusatory and hostile if the survivor does not respond the way they wish. **The survivor will be told that they are crazy or delusional, that their family loves them and would never be part of a cult. The family members will all still be amnesic, unless something happens to trigger their own memories. ** One of the most frequent suicidal programming sequences placed internally will be \"come back or die\" programming. A family member may activate it by telling the survivor that they are missed and their family wants to see them. If the survivor fails to return, the programming will start running. It can only be deactivated by a code word from the person's trainer or cult contact person. This ensures that they will recontact. If the survivor tries to break this programming, they will need assistance, both internal and external, for safety. Hospitalization may be needed in a safe facility that understands DID and programming, as well as suicidality, as the alters inside will begin fighting if the person tries to break the programming. They have been programmed to commit suicide, or to be shattered internally, or at the very least, severely punished, and are afraid of the repercussions of not obeying. The survivor will need to get to know these internal alters, and reassure them that they no longer need to do their jobs. Chronometric suicidal programming is another type placed within. This does not need contact with family members to activate. In fact, it is activated automatically after a certain", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:54:7b5958a40d18", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14451, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "the programming.

This does not need contact with family members to activate. In fact, it is activated automatically after a certain amount of time without cult contact. **Controller alters and/or punishing alters will have been programmed that if a certain period of time goes without contact with the trainer, they are to commit suicide. They will be told that the only way to prevent this is recontact with the trainer, who knows a command code to halt the program. The time interval may be anywhere from three months to nine months, each system is different.** Call back programming may have this type of programming as a back up, to ensure that it is followed through on. Systems layered programming is a particularly complex form of suicide programming where several systems (up to six at a time), are programmed to fire off suicide programming simultaneously. This always needs hospitalization for the survivor's safety. Honor/dishonor programming is common in military systems. In this, the military parts are told that an \"honorable and courageous\" soldier will take his life, rather than reveal secrets or leave his unit. \"No tell\" programming will often be reinforced by suicidal programming. Access denied programming, which prevents unauthorized access both externally and internally, will often be reinforced by either or both suicidal/homicidal programming. Almost all suicidal programming is put in place to either ensure continued obedience to the cult's agenda; to ensure regular recontact; or to prevent the individual or an outside person from accessing the person's system without authorization (i.e. the correct access codes, which the trainers are careful to use at the beginning of each session). It will frequently block therapy, as the survivor will be terrified, and rightly so, of dying if they reveal their internal world or disclose their history. **Suggestions** First, both the survivor and the therapist need to find out what suicide programming is present (it's a safe bet it's there, no need to ask if it is present). Internal communication and finding out which alters or fragments hold suicide programming will be important. Physical safety, whether with a safe outside person or inpatient hospitalization, while working on suicide programming is extremely important, as this programming may either drive the survivor to self destructive behavior or back to the cult. Dealing with suicide programming assumes that the survivor and therapist have initiated good system communication internally. This is extremely important, since the survivor will need cooperation inside with dismantling suicidality.

This is extremely important, since the survivor will need cooperation inside with dismantling suicidality. Letting alters inside know that they no longer have to do their job, that they can change, may help. Reality orientation, letting them know that if they kill the body, that they will die, may also help (many times, these parts have been deceived into believing that they themselves will not die if they do their jobs. This means they need to hear the truth). Having controller alters (high alters with pull inside the system) agree to work with the therapist to dismantle the programming will help. But be aware that **some internal suicide sequences will be put in that even controllers cannot dismantle.** **Creating a safety committee inside whose main job is to keep the body safe and ask for help if suicidal programming begins to kick in, before acting out occurs will help tremendously. ** As the survivor develops trust with their therapist and realizes the value of life, and that life can be much better than it has ever been before, they will become more willing to reach out and ask for help if they become suicidal. The survivor may also find that they encounter core despair. This despair may have been used by the cult to run suicidal programming, but it is not programming itself. A very young core split may have taken many of the feelings of despair, hopelessness, failure to thrive and desire to die, that the child felt growing up in a horribly abusive atmosphere. This is not programming, but true feelings, and it will be important to differentiate this from programming. If core despair comes up, the alter containing this may also report having been trained to not suicide, or give up. The trainers will do this, if despair begins overwhelming the subject at an early age, to prevent the child's suicide. The survivor's cognitives, helpers, and nurturers will all need to be gathered together to help this part of the core heal. There will be intense and rightful grieving and anguish for the immense pain that the young child suffered. Hopelessness will come out. It can help if alters with happier memories can try and share their memories with this very young part. External support and caring can also make a big difference. **Healing the immense pain held by this core split will take a long period of time and should not be hurried.** Antidepressants can help, as the depression may be shared through all systems.

Time, patience, support, the ability to vent feelings in a safe manner and physical safety when needed, will all help immensely as the survivor works through these issues. **Chapter Twelve** **Preventing Reaccessing of the Survivor ** This is by far one of the most important chapters I have written in this book. Why? **Deprogramming cannot be consistently successful if the person is still in contact with the abusers. **Survivors will take one step forward, then will find themselves knocked down internally. All the hard work in therapy will be undone or set back. They and their therapist will find that they have trouble finding internal alters. Whole systems may shut down. A child presenting system may come out. Confusers and scramblers will take over therapy sessions and blockers will block therapy. No one chapter can ever be totally comprehensive in how to prevent reaccessing. What I will share are some of the more common ways that the cult and trainers will try to reaccess individuals, and give some techniques on avoiding this. The cult has a vested interest in keeping its members. After all, it has spent generations telling its members that if they leave they will die, be killed, or go psychotic. It makes them quite unhappy to see someone who is quite alive and very clearly not psychotic leave. It also makes their more restive members question the truth of what they have been told if they see someone get out. Having a member leave may break the hold of some programming in other members. Trainers especially hate to see anyone leave, and grind their teeth over this problem at night. When people leave the cult, it is considered a training failure and the trainers may be punished severely. So, the cult has come up with certain ways to keep their members with them, willingly or unwillingly. These include, but are not limited to: **E.T.**** phone home (phone programming):** **The individual will have personalities whose sole job is to call and report to the trainer or cult leader.** These are often young child alters who are eager to please, starved for attention and nurturing, and who are heavily rewarded for calling back in. Any survivor who attempts to leave the cult must deal with the urge to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:57:0928ff85b115", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14454, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 58, "text": "ways to keep their members with them, willingly or unwillingly.

Any survivor who attempts to leave the cult must deal with the urge to phone home, to phone their abusers, to phone their friends who are in the group, and to phone their parents, siblings, cousins, or aunts. This urge may become overwhelming at times, and worst of all, the survivor may be totally amnesic to the fact that the people they are calling are cult members who are urging them, in code, to come back. Common phrases used include: your 'family' loves you, misses you, needs you; so and so is ill and needs to see you; you are so special to us; you are so valuable; you need to come see us; why are you so distant?; and why haven't we heard from you lately? The list goes on and on. Sweet, kind phrases with double meanings which were placed in the person during training sessions can be used. Trainers are not stupid and know that if cult members said \"come to the ritual meeting at midnight next week\", the survivor would run the other way, and be validated as well that they are not making things up. So,** they embed coded messages behind innocuous phrases such as those described above.** These, and other messages, are meant to trigger recontact programming. In recontact programming, (**all Illuminati members have recontact programming - it is never left to chance**) the person has parts whose only job is to have contact with their trainer, cult leader, or accountability person (person one step above them in the cult). These parts are heavily programmed under drugs, hypnosis, shock, torture, to have recontact. The individual will feel restless, shaky, weepy, and afraid if they try to break this programming. It will often be linked or joined in to suicidal programming (see previous chapter for more on suicidal programming). They may experience PTSD symptomology, or even flood programming and internal self punishment sequences as they fight this programming internally. Siblings are often cross trained to access each other with special codes. Remember when.... may initiate this. I love you, or your family loves you, can also be used. Phrases will be adapted to each individual, depending on the person's family members and background.

Each individual was \"keyed into\" a particular person during the programming sequence to prevent inadvertent popping out of alters by anyone wearing a ruby pin, for example. So cueing can be based on sight recognition of a person who resembles the one keyed into, plus the clothing color or jewelry being worn a certain way. **Phone calls from concerned family members, friends, and cult members will flood the survivor's phone lines and answering machine, especially during the initial getting out phase. Hang up calls, three or six in a row, or calls where a series of tones are heard, may be used as cues to recall the individual and fire off internal programming.** Birthday, holiday or we miss you cards or letters may be sent with trigger codes imbedded in them. Flowers with a particular number of flowers or color may be sent. Daisies may fire off daisy programming internally. The possibilities are almost endless depending on the trainers, the group the person was with, and the people they are most bonded to in the cult. Special training sessions will be given, with code words and cues built into the system's programming. **If all else fails, hostility will start.** \"You don't love us\" will be heard, even when the survivor has stated repeatedly that they care. Boundaries drawn with cult members will be misinterpreted as lack of concern or withdrawal. Accusations, guilt, and anger, as well as manipulation will be used as hooks to make the survivor feel guilty for withdrawing from the cult. As the cult support system is withdrawn in the survivor's life and they try the difficult task of developing healthy, appropriate relationships outside of the cult, isolation programming may activate. Often the therapist will be the survivor's lifeline and sole support at first. The individual may fall into codependent relationships quickly, or into relationships with other survivors to fill the void in their life. At worst, desperate for caring and feeling isolated, they will make friends with the first kind person they meet.

It will seem unbelievable at first when back parts come up in therapy and disclose that beloved or even barely tolerated family members are in the cult. Believing these parts and listening to them will be crucial to safety. Protectors will be important to the survivor's safety, especially if they are willing to give up cult allegiance and help keep the person safe. Outside accountability with safe persons is extremely important. **The problem is that generational Illuminati survivors have often been surrounded all their lives by a network of other cult members. Unknown to them, their closest friends and family members are part of the group. **Amnesia poses the greatest danger to the survivor in the beginning stages, as they will trust people before they remember that they are unsafe. A survivor may remember the father taking them to rituals, and believe that their mother or grandparent is safe. Only later in therapy will they remember that mother or granny was actually their trainer, since the most painful memories tend to come later. The survivor may only remember ritual abuse in early childhood and think they were let go at a certain age. Yet this kind of letting go is extremely rare, since the group has put years of effort into training them. Almost never will they just \"let someone go\" in generational families. But they may be given false or screen memories, especially if they are in therapy, to confuse the survivor and the therapist. The client will need to listen to and believe internal parts who have more information than they do, and take appropriate steps to be safe. This will probably mean cutting off contact with perpetrators at this point. Again, **outside accountability is paramount.** Safe houses, a women's shelter or a safe church family may be alternatives. One of the worst things the survivor can do is isolate, or go out walking late at night alone, or go camping in the woods by themselves. Abduction will often occur in these scenarios when the survivor is alone and vulnerable. Safe roommates can help keep the survivor safe. **Locking up the phone in the trunk of the car may help if phone programming is intense.** This gives the survivor the chance to wake up or stop phone calls, if an alter has to get up, find the car keys, turn on the light, go outside, and open a car trunk, bring the phone inside and hook it up again before making a phone call.

Building a support system through safe support groups, a good therapist, church, or work can also help. **Whenever possible and practical, moving away from the town or state where the survivor was active in the cult can help.** Why? Remember the survivor's whole support network was the cult in their old town. The trainers and/or family members have invested time and effort into the survivor and have a big stake in their coming back. If the survivor moves far enough away, a cult group in the new city or state will not know them as well, and will not have a lengthy history with them. This, in conjunction with good therapy and a safe support network, can help decrease the chance of reaccessing by the cult. The survivor will have to rebuild their support system anyway, so why not do it as far as possible away from people they have known who might hurt them? It can be intensely triggering to the survivor to see their old trainer walking down the street towards them, and inside alters may destabilize or feel unsafe. This is one case where distance is good. One caution though: even if the survivor moves, they will need to work intensely on blocking internal recontact programming at the same time, or they may be quickly reaccessed. **Trainers will often send the person's system codes and grids over the internet to cult groups in the new city and will try to send someone who physically resembles the trainer or a family member to initiate contact with the survivor. ** Internal communication and letting inside alters know that they can change their jobs will help. Reward internal reporters for changing allegiance and committing to keep the survivor safe. The cult used to reward them for doing their job; now the survivor can reward them for changing jobs. Develop new interests, work or hobbies that can help the survivor meet new, safe people. The survivor may want to practice friendship skills in support groups, as long as they are run by reputable, safe therapists. Be aware that holiday dates are often important dates for reaccessing.

Callback programming (where the person is given a specific date or holiday when they are to return to the cult or be punished) may need to be broken as well. Allowing the alters who went through the programming to share their memories, acknowledging their needs, and trying to meet those needs in healthy ways will bring healing. **The survivor will need to go through a period of grieving for loss of contact with family members and friends in the cult. No matter how abusive, how disliked, it can be very difficult to cut off with perpetrators, especially if they were the only people close to the survivor.** The survivor needs to acknowledge the difficulty of creating a new, healthy, cultless support group. They need to recognize that learning new skills and developing healthy friendships will take time. One issue often brought up by survivors is: how much do I tell others about my past? This is an individual decision that the survivor and therapist need to look at together. In general though,** caution in sharing is best, since sharing too much about the survivor's past may draw the wrong people to them. **These people may be dysfunctional or possibly even cult members. It is usually best to base new, non-cult friendships on healthy aspects of the person at first, and only very gradually share small bits of information as the friendship progresses and sharing seems appropriate. With time and opportunities, the survivor will learn the importance of appropriate boundaries and will want healthier relationships in their life. **Chapter Thirteen** **Shell Programming, Internal Councils, Human Experimentation, Function Codes** **Note:** Parts of this chapter may be extremely triggering. Please read with caution and only with a therapist if you are a survivor. **Shell Programming** **Shell programming is a form of programming used to create a \"shell\" on the outside that other alters inside speak through. This is a designed to hide the person's multiplicity from the outside world and works extremely well with highly fragmented systems.** This kind of programming works best with a person who has the ability to dissociate to a great degree. **How it is done:** With shell programming, the trainer will often take a clear plastic or glass mask and put it in front of the subject. They will be extremely traumatized, shocked, drugged, and told that they (the alter or alters in front) are the \"mask\" that they see. Their job will be to become a shell, or voice, to cover for the others behind. These parts will be so traumatized", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:62:204d9b30fe28", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14459, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "has the ability to dissociate to a great degree. **How it is done:** With shell programming, the trainer will often take a clear plastic or glass mask and put it in front of the subject. They will be extremely traumatized, shocked, drugged, and told that they (the alter or alters in front) are the \"mask\" that they see. Their job will be to become a shell, or voice, to cover for the others behind. These parts will be so traumatized that they literally see themselves as only a shell, with no real substance or body. Other alters inside will then be directed to come next to the \"shell\" alters and use their voice to cover their own. This allows greater fragmentation of the person while being able to hide it from outside view since the internal alters will learn to present through the shell. Shell alters always see themselves as \"clear\", and will have no color if color coding is present in other systems. **Suggestions** It is important to realize that what the system is actually doing is co-presenting, although not co-consciously. For a shell program to work, the shell alters have been taught to allow co-presentation with the other alters in the systems. Other alters in the back may not always be aware that this is what is happening, and the front shell especially will not know that they are being \"gone through\" for co-presentation. Recognizing the trauma that occurred and finding out where the shell fragments came from will help. Allowing both the shell alters and the other alters to recognize that this is how they have been presenting and why will be an important step. Back alters may then begin presenting without going through the shell, and the person may look \"more multiple\" than they ever have for a period, with accents or young voices coming through. What is actually happening is that the back is presenting without masking who they are through the shell. Meanwhile, the shell alters may decide to coalesce for greater strength, and may decide to change jobs. Each system will decide what is best for them. **Internal Councils ** **Survivors of Illuminati programming will always have some type of hierarchy inside. This is because the cult itself is very hierarchical and programs this hierarchy inside each member.** What better way to inspire loyalty to leadership than to put the leadership inside the person's head? Trainers are also very hierarchy conscious themselves. They know that a system without hierarchy and head honchos inside to direct things will be a system in chaos. They will not leave the person's system leaderless inside. Many trainers will program themselves into the person in a hierarchy over the internal programmers or trainers. This is because they are egotistical, but also because it uses a well known phenomenon of human nature: **people tend to internalize their abusers.** The", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:63:e63f3e0d1c82", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14460, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 64, "text": "person's head?

This is because they are egotistical, but also because it uses a well known phenomenon of human nature: **people tend to internalize their abusers.** The survivor may be horrified to find a representative of one of their worst perpetrators inside, but this was a survival mechanism. One tenet of human behavior is that often people will punish less those who mimic them. A brutal Nazi will be less likely to punish another brutal Nazi, but will look down upon and punish a weak, crying person. So the survivor will internalize the rough Nazi inside to avoid being hurt. The survivor may mimic accents, mannerisms, and even claim the perpetrator's life history as their own. The ultimate form of internalization comes with internalizing hierarchical councils. The person, under pain, hypnosis, and drugs, will be taught to incorporate a highly dissociated group inside to lead the others. These will often be created from core splits, because the trainers want them to be extremely strong, stable alters in the system. **Triads of three elders may be seen. Platinum's may have a head council of three. **Jewels will have a triad made up of ruby, emerald,and diamond in many systems to rule over the others. And, of course, an internal \"leadership council\", \"System Above\", \"Ascended Masters\", \"supreme council\", regional council, world council, etc. may be found. The councils found will vary with each survivor. High priests and priestesses may also sit on ruling councils inside. **These internal groups will correlate roughly to the outside group. **Often the child or youth at age twelve will be presented to these groups in a formal coming of age ceremony. This ceremony is considered quite an honor and will involve the child being traumatized and accepting the leadership of the council for the rest of their life. Undying loyalty is promised. There may be other occasions where the person will be forced to come before the councils throughout their lifespan either for judgment, to pass tests, for punishment, or for elevation (promotion). These councils will be seen as holding the power of life or death, and the child or youth will do anything to gain their favor. The child will internalize them. The trainer will help with the internalization using photographs or holographic images of the people to \"burn them in\". Each member of the group will be given different leadership tasks. It is not uncommon for the survivor to incorporate one parent, or both parents or grandparents, into their internal leadership hierarchy in a generational survivor. **Suggestions** Internal leadership councils will often", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:64:c6b0db5ec6ba", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14461, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 65, "text": "or death, and the child or youth will do anything to gain their favor.

It is not uncommon for the survivor to incorporate one parent, or both parents or grandparents, into their internal leadership hierarchy in a generational survivor. **Suggestions** Internal leadership councils will often be some of the most resistant to and hostile towards therapy, especially in the early stages. They will verbally banter with or refuse to speak to the therapist as being \"beneath their notice.\" They are mimicking the haughty, hierarchical attitudes they have been exposed to all their lives. They also have the most to lose if the survivor leaves the cult, and may fight this decision tooth and nail. They will often be the alters with an \"attitude\". **Both the survivor and therapist need to recognize that these parts had powerful needs that were met in the cult setting. To ignore this and argue with them will only entrench their belief that therapists are stupid and unknowing people.** Acknowledge their internal role while gently pointing out reality. Try to enlist their aid in helping the survivor strengthen. Discuss honestly the pros and cons of leaving the cult. These are highly intellectual alters. They need to express their concerns and doubts. Setting good boundaries and not allowing verbal abuse of the therapist is important. These alters are used to pushing people around verbally and have been rewarded for it prior to therapy. Now, they need to learn new coping skills and behaviors, and the process may take time. Allow them to vent their anger, displeasure, and fears about the decision to leave the cult. Offer them new jobs of leadership over safety committees or even decision making committees inside the person. Sometimes, a system that has broken free from the cult and has no external hierarchy that they are accountable to will go through a short period of chaos as word gets out: we're free and don't have to do what the cult tells us to do any more! Hundreds of internal arguments may break out as to: what do we do for a living? Where do we live? What do we eat? What hobbies will we have? Everybody wants to come out, see the daytime, and live this new, free life. But the freedom may cause imbalance with all of the switching going on inside.

Things will settle down after a period as the systems learn to listen to each other, vote on ideas, and begin moving together in the same direction. **Human Experimentation ** This is one of the most grievous things that still occurs in the Illuminati today. **The Illuminati were famed for deciding years ago to \"go scientific\" and incorporate scientific experimentation into their training principles. This is one area where they broke with other, more traditional groups, who still followed \"spiritual principles\". ** The Illuminati decided to use scientific data, especially in the psychiatric and behavioral sciences, to drive their training practices. This became known openly during WWII, when the world heard about the experimentation on Jews and other groups in the concentration camps, but human experimentation had been quietly going on for years before underground. It also did not stop at the end of the war. German trainers and scientists were [scattered around the world and hidden](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/trf14b), where they continued teaching others the principles they had learned and continued with ongoing experimentation. Some of this experimentation occurred [with government funding](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol) through groups such as the CIA and NSA. The Illuminati had people infiltrated throughout these groups who used the principles discovered and shared them with their own trainers. Experimentation is [going on even to this day](https://www.WantToKnow.info/humanguineapigs). It is done secretly. Its purpose is to help improve and create more sophisticated training techniques. To prevent \"programming failures\", or \"PFs\" as they are called in the cult. **Many, many survivors, if not all, will have been told that they are only an experiment. This may or may not be true.** Trainers like to tell their subjects that they are experiments, even if they aren't, for several reasons: It creates immense fear and helplessness in the subject (the thought is, if this is an experiment, I will have to work really hard to survive this) . It devalues the person immensely. They will feel that they have no real value as a human being, that all they are is an experiment. Someone who feels devalued doesn't care, and will be willing to do things they wouldn't if they felt some value, some humanization. It gives the trainer added power, as they are the one who can begin or stop the \"experiment\". Almost always, when the person is told they are an experiment, it isn't really true. **When trainers and cult members really do experiments, the subjects are never told, because it could", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:66:1fbe1e2d5e91", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14463, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "human being, that all they are is an experiment.

Almost always, when the person is told they are an experiment, it isn't really true. **When trainers and cult members really do experiments, the subjects are never told, because it could bias results. **The fear could interfere with drug effects and skew the results. Most recent cult experimentation has been in the area of drug effects, using a variety of drugs, both alone and in new combinations and dosages, to induce trance states and open the person to training. Drugs are sought which will shorten the time interval needed to induce trance state, which are quickly metabolized, and which leave no detectable residues the next day. Here are some of the areas which are explored in human experimentation: **Behavioral science:** Watching and recording data on different environmental parameters on human behavior. Modifying the environment. **Isolation techniques:** Recording data both physiological and psychological from different isolation methods. Removing, adding, and combining different methods of sensory isolation, and the effect of each. **Praise and punishment as motivators.** **Effectiveness of virtual reality in implanting programming.** ** Effectiveness of new disks created to put programming in:** Cult graphics and computer experts will work to create better and more effective VR disks, which are tested on cult subjects for their effectiveness. The cult wants more and more standardization and less room for human error and weakness in its training techniques, which is why it is going more and more to high-tech equipment and videos. They explore means to break programming and cause program failure, recording what is effective and what isn't, and develop new sequences to prevent PF. Subjects under hypnosis are ordered to try and break certain internal programming sequences. The ways they go about this and the methods which are deemed effective, are shared with the trainers, who then create new programs to prevent degradation of programming from occurring. **Harmonics, light and sensory deprivation and over stimulation, and the effects of these neurologically and physically:** New combinations of sensory input are always being tested to see which achieve the most lasting results and can be done most rapidly. The cult is always trying to find new, better, faster methods to break down subjects, put programming in, and prevent the programming from failing. This has been the emphasis in most research it has carried out. The results of this research are shared worldwide by internet, phone calls, and international trainer conferences where trainers worldwide share the results of what they are finding. New techniques are incorporated by other groups which are eager to find out what is being discovered. **Suggestions** If you have experimental programming,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:67:2e4239bcc341", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14464, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 68, "text": "find new, better, faster methods to break down subjects, put programming in, and prevent the programming from failing.

New techniques are incorporated by other groups which are eager to find out what is being discovered. **Suggestions** If you have experimental programming, realize that the alters who were used in it are heavily traumatized. They also will feel devalued and less than human. This was reinforced heavily by the trainers who worked with them. They probably weren't used in initial experiments, as described above, but may have been used in secondary level experimentation. I will explain what those terms mean. Top trainers and leaders will initiate an experiment with a new drug. They will learn to titrate dosages and record all observable facts on hundreds of subjects. After enough data is obtained, they will then clear it for use by trainers in local groups. It will then still be considered experimental, but will be at a secondary level, instead of primary level experimentation. At this point, all trainers in local groups will be told to record and report any adverse reactions to the drug, any usual dosages needed, etc. **This data is collected in databanks (yes, the cult is now in the computer age) inside of encrypted files, which will then be sent to a central base in Langley, Virginia.** Alters used in experiments, or told that they were experiments, need to realize that they are valuable. **They will need to realize that they went through intense programming and be allowed to vent and discuss their experiences.** The fear related to believing they were an experiment needs to be vented appropriately. They will be angry at the dehumanization, intentionality, and coldness of what they went through, and quite rightly so. They may rail against the effects in their life now from the experiments and procedures they went through, and need to grieve over loss of body image, loss of trust in people, and the sense of betrayal and helplessness that they felt during the procedures. They may want to journal, or draw pictures of their experiences. A warm, empathetic therapist who listens, believes, and does not discount what they went through is invaluable at this point. Allowing internal cognitives and helpers to ground parts who went through bizarre sensory experiences and creating \"grounding committees\" inside will also help. Extra support may be needed while dealing with experiences and feelings of this intensity. **Function Codes** Trainers will place within the subject's systems a special way to organize the fragments that are related to the job they were trained to do. These are called function codes, and there are three main types: **Command Codes:**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:68:c24cf3e341cd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14465, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 69, "text": "invaluable at this point.

These are called function codes, and there are three main types: **Command Codes:** These are irreversible commands put in at the limbic level of conditioning. The first code always put in is the \"halt \" command, which stops the person in their tracks, and is the first code any new trainer learns. This will stop the subject from assassinating their trainer, if they have [MK ULTRA](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050626mkultra) or other assassin training in place. **Other command codes include: system destruct codes (suicide); shatter codes; erasure codes; and antisuicide codes.** **Access Codes:** These are specialized codes, often coded into short messages or numerical codes that allow access to the person's system. **A trainer will always begin a session by repeating the person's personal complete access code, which will allow authorized entry into the system without setting off booby traps and internal protectors. These codes may also depend and be set up on sight recognition and voice recognition of the person giving the codes.** In other words, the system will respond to the codes only if the person giving them appears to be an authorized person, such as the person's trainer. This is to prevent unauthorized access or using of the person by others outside of the person's local cult group. **Function codes:** These are the \"job codes\" or work codes within the system. Often several will be coded to link together to perform a task. These are usually a letter, such as a Greek alphabet letter, combined with a numeric sequence that corresponds to their place on the internal grid or landscape. **Suggestions** **If the survivor has function codes or the other codes internally, it will help if the different system controllers can share these with the person.** The person can then get to know the fragments, hear their history, and help them begin coalescing with other parts internally. It may help to find the template these codes were fragmented from, and help the template realize how they were traumatized to create these fragments. **About deprogrammers ** Often people who call themselves deprogrammers will attempt to find these codes and help the person who wants to be deprogrammed. This is an individual decision to be made by each survivor and therapist. There may be excellent deprogrammers out there, but I have always felt extreme caution and never used one myself for two reasons: I would never ever give away the locus of control to an outside person again.

It would remind me to much of my own abuse. And I believe the survivor should be self empowered in therapy as much as possible. There are no quick cures, miracles, or short cuts in the process of undoing the extensive amount of abuse that has occurred with Illuminati programming. **Even the best deprogrammers will admit that after they are done, the person deprogammed will usually have some idea of what was put in them, but must finish with years of therapy dealing with how they *feel* about the programming that was done. Illuminati programming takes *years* to put in, years filled with extensive, methodical abuse. A realistic therapist must be aware that it will take years of patience, support, and hard work by both therapist and survivor to undo a lifetime of conditioning and pain.** This is not to say that deprogrammers don't help people; good, reputable, safe ones have been reported to be of great help. But the person can also undertake the process themselves of undoing their own programming, and often the survivor is the best \"internal deprogrammer\" of all. They know their inside people and what motivates them better than anyone else. **Chapter Fourteen** **Spiritual Programming** **Note:** This chapter includes discussion of both cult and Christian spirituality. Do not read if these themes are triggering. Any discussion of Illuminati programming would be lacking if it did not address spiritual programming. **Most of the previous chapters have dealt with scientifically based, organized, structured programming. ****But the Illuminati are first and foremost not scientists, but spiritual. The very foundation of the group is based on the occult. And they go to great lengths to grind these occult beliefs into their people's systems. ** The amount of spiritual programming in a person's systems will vary and depends on the group with which they are involved, their religious heritage, the leader's beliefs, and the trainers in the group. All children go to rituals where they are dedicated from before birth and at intervals throughout their lives. In these rituals, demonic entities are invoked to coerce the person into servant hood, loyalty, and secrecy, as well as to reinforce the programming being done. **Trainers will invoke demonic layering during programming sessions. This is done after acute trauma. The person is asked if they want more pain. They will always say \"no\".

The trainer then offers them a way out: if they will accept a \"protector\" or \"protectors\" they won't be hurt any more.** The trainers will want this, knowing that with these \"protectors'\", they can shorten the training sessions. These protectors or guardians will reinforce the programming internally without outside help. This concept will seem controversial to people who do not believe in spiritual realities, but I am only describing what the Illuminists believe, and what their trainers practice. Spiritual programming will also include being forced to memorize rituals, *The Book of Illumination*, and other books which contain cult beliefs. In classes and training sessions, the person will be saturated from infancy on with cult beliefs. They will go to rituals where the adults participate in spiritual worship wearing robes and giving obeisance to the group's particular guardian deity. Moloch, Ashtaroth, Baal, and Enokkim are demons who are commonly worshipped. The child may see a sacrifice, either real or a set-up, to these deities. Animal sacrifices are common. The child will be forced to participate in the sacrifices and will have to go through blood baptism. **They will be forced to take the heart or other internal organs out of an animal that has been sacrificed and eat them.** The adults, and leaders of the group will place their hands on the child's head while it is drugged and invoke demonic entities. **One ritual which is actually part of programming is the \"resuscitation ritual\". In this ritual, the child may be heavily drugged, shocked or tortured to the point that his heart may stop. The head priest will then \"resuscitate \" the child, using drugs, CPR, and incantations. When the child comes back and is awake, he or she will be told that they were \"brought back to life\" by the demonic entity that the particular group worships, and that now the child owes it their life. They are told that if they ever tell, or try to get the demon to leave, they will return to the lifeless state they were in prior to resuscitation. ** Spiritual \"healings\" due to the demonic are also common. Injuries caused during torture, programming sessions, or even military exercises will be healed almost instantaneously during invocations. Those with jewel programming will often have demons loyal to the generational family spirits layered in. These are called the \"family jewels\". The demons \"guard them\" and help protect the programming surrounding them.

The demons \"guard them\" and help protect the programming surrounding them. In a sense, every ritual that a young child is part of is an intense programming experience, as the child observes the adults around them and imitates their behavior. The child will be severely punished if it falls asleep, and will be told that demons will kill it if it goes to sleep again during a ritual. Children are taught to be completely silent, no matter what they witness during the rituals. The child will witness things that seem utterly unbelievable, including faces appearing transformed by the demonic, channeling, other voices coming out of a leader's mouth, psychic reading of members, and telling the future. Group guidance will often be given through channeling of a strong spirit. Members who can channel powerful spirits and survive are respected, and their guidance will be looked for. **Some groups will use scriptures negatively or program the child to hate Christian symbols and theology. Other groups will encourage the amnesic front to embrace a Christian lifestyle, while forcing the back alters to renounce and blaspheme the choices the front has made, to separate the two alter groups even further.** The cult alters will be told that since they renounced Christianity, they have committed the \"unpardonable sin\" and can never be forgiven. They will be shown scriptures that supposedly back this up. In moments of despair during intense torture or isolation, a person will often cry out to God for help. The trainers or other cult members will often mock the person, telling the person that God has forgotten them, or ask \"where is God now? He must hate you.....\" **Any negative experience the person undergoes, will be used to reinforce the concept that they have been abandoned by God. The cult will gleefully point out the contradictions between what the person experiences and what Christianity teaches should happen to them. **They may distort or use false scriptures. They may distort Christian hymns, or use them in programming. A favorite hymn is \"may the circle be unbroken\", since it can have two meanings. **Suggestions** Spiritual programming can be some of the most damaging programming within a person's systems, since it attempts to cut them off from the source of real healing.

Many survivors are unable to hear Christian terms or are intensely triggered by any religious discussion. The survivor and therapist need to realize that these negative reactions are the result of years of false teaching, pain, punishment, distortion and set-ups. It is important not to judge the parts of the person that are negative towards spirituality, or come out proclaiming the power and benefits of cult spirituality. The survivor's front may be horrified to hear or learn about parts that have these feelings, especially if they are a strong Christian. These parts inside are sharing the only reality they have ever known. They need time and patience to ground and experience reality outside of the cult setting. Demonic oppression may need to be dealt with, and even deliverance, to bring relief to a system that is being terrorized by the demonic. Each therapist and survivor will need to come to terms with their own spiritual beliefs. I personally believe that a therapist needs to consider the possibility of the demonic, since this is what the survivor has been exposed to all their life. The cult certainly does believe it is real, and anyone who has been involved in a cult setting will have had experiences that cannot be explained by normal, rational scientific principles. **The survivor needs hope, and healing. A positive spirituality based on love, gentleness and forgiveness that is the opposite of the coercing, punitive, negative spirituality the survivor has known, will help immensely in the healing process. A spiritual belief system that offers hope, healing, grace, mercy, and affirmation will often give the survivor the support they need to go on during the often difficult process of healing. ** **Chapter Fifteen** **Virtual Reality and Denial Programming, Core Splits, the Last Six Steps of Discipline ** **Virtual Reality Programming ** Virtual reality programming (VR) is a form of programming that has become more and more widely used in the past few decades. It involves the person being placed in VR headsets and suit while a cult created VR disk is used to run the program. It can be used to create 3D and holographic images, and is especially useful in scripted programming and target practice sequences for assassin training. **Under hypnosis, the person will believe that the scene they are seeing and experiencing is actual reality. ** Virtually any scenario can be recreated. Images to be \"burned in\" will be shown on the VR disk and reinforced repetitively during the programming sequence.

Images to be \"burned in\" will be shown on the VR disk and reinforced repetitively during the programming sequence. Some trainers feel it removes the element of \"human error\" in training and use it quite extensively. Undoing VR programming, like any other deprogramming, involves going inside and finding out the distortions that were placed in the parts that went through the programming, allowing them to see how they were deceived, and dealing with the trauma associated with the programming. **Denial Programming ** Denial programming begins with the first experiences the infant goes through in life. The child has been horrendously wounded and traumatized, yet the next morning, the adults around him are acting normally, as if nothing had happened. They are modeling a lifestyle of denial for the infant and young child. This is reinforced later by the child being told things like \"It was just a bad dream\" or \"It's just your imagination. It isn't really happening\" Oh, how the child wants to believe these lies! It makes the pain less to think it didn't really happen, so these comments are embraced as an escape from the horror. Denial will also be fed by the adults around the child telling them that they will never be believed if they disclose. There will be set ups to teach the child what they see and hear, and to teach the child to trust outside adults to tell them their reality. A typical set up will go like this: **The adult will hold an object such as an orange in their hand and ask a young child at about age two or three, \"what is this?\". The child will quickly respond, \"oh, an orange!\" The child will be shocked, and told, \"no, it's an apple.\" The child will be confused, because what they are looking at is obviously an orange. It is the color orange, smells like an orange, and looks like an orange. The question will be repeated. The child may answer again, \"an orange,\" and will be shocked again. Finally, the child, unsure and not wanting to be punished, will say, \"an apple,\" and then be praised. ** The purpose of this exercise is to teach the child to not trust their own reality, and look to outside adults or leaders to tell them what reality really is. That is the basis of denial. **The person learns to not trust their own reality, because of punishment and fear when they have spoken the truth. ** Alters will be created as the child grows whose purpose is to deny the cult abuse. If any leakage", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:74:71ce05dc280a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14471, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 75, "text": "then be praised. ** The purpose of this exercise is to teach the child to not trust their own reality, and look to outside adults or leaders to tell them what reality really is. That is the basis of denial. **The person learns to not trust their own reality, because of punishment and fear when they have spoken the truth. ** Alters will be created as the child grows whose purpose is to deny the cult abuse. If any leakage or breakthrough occurs, the denial alter's job is to create a plausible explanation: it was a nightmare, a book the person read, a movie they saw, etc. These alters will read and quote literature that refutes SRA. These alters often believe that they are saving the life of the survivor. They have been told that if the survivor remembers and believes the abuse, the survivor will be killed, or the denial alter will be severely punished or shattered for not doing their job. These parts have a vested interest in their job. They believe their very existence and they body's survival depend upon them. **Suggestions** Arguing with a denial alter will not work, since they are motivated not by logic, but by fear. A better approach is to **ask them what they fear if the person remembers. This will open up the deception and lies that were ground in.** They may be protecting the survivor from suicidal alters behind them, who are programmed to kick in if denial is broken through. Allowing them to vent their concerns and enlisting the aid of helpers or cognitives who do not have suicidal or denial programming will help. Showing them reality in a gentle way and allowing them to \"listen in\" on others who share will go a long way. Not all denial is programming. Some denial is the natural consequence of self protection from the horrors of abuse. But if denial is constantly blocking therapy and causing it to come to a complete standstill, or if the person becomes highly suicidal every time denial is set aside briefly, then the possibility needs to be considered. Safety, inner cooperation, and patience will go a long way in decreasing denial. As denial backs down, you can expect an immense amount of grieving as the truth is realized. Denial protected the survivor from the horrendous pain of the truth and should only be let go of extremely slowly and cautiously with plenty of support during the grieving stage. **Core splits ** Core splits are intentional traumatic splits created from the core personality. The core may be literally \"splintered\" by overwhelming psychological and physical/spiritual trauma. The trauma needed to create a core split must be very early and psychologically devastating. Fetal splits may occur, but these rarely cause a core split, as the core simply splinters off an alter. **Core splits are done between the ages", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:75:03b5865f1511", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14472, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 76, "text": "of extremely slowly and cautiously with plenty of support during the grieving stage. **Core splits ** Core splits are intentional traumatic splits created from the core personality. The core may be literally \"splintered\" by overwhelming psychological and physical/spiritual trauma. The trauma needed to create a core split must be very early and psychologically devastating. Fetal splits may occur, but these rarely cause a core split, as the core simply splinters off an alter. **Core splits are done between the ages of 18 months and three years. Usually at least one parent or main caretaker is involved in the trauma, because this creates the psychological devastation necessary to split the core. Physical trauma alone rarely causes core splits.** The torture is intense and prolonged. It continues until the child collapses. It may be shocking, stretching, being hung in a high place, or a combination of several techniques. Being placed in \"shock boxes\" or near drowning are also used. The techniques that create core splits are also dangerous, since they can also cause autism if the child cannot endure the programming. When I was in the cult, I fought to stop core splitting because occasionally children were lost or the foundational personality was too weakened. The core may split into two, three, or up to eight splits internally. Each split will be a piece of the \"core child\". The original core will not resurface after splitting. These splits are used by cult trainers to be used as templates to create systems within the child. A core split will be a strong alter. It can be re-split many times in the programming process to create a multifaceted and diverse system within. **Suggestions ** Core splits represent intense foundational trauma. They will be the basis for later systems, which may be completely dissociated from the split as time goes on. **Work on core splits should go very slowly and only late in the therapy process when there is immense intrasystem cooperation. The survivor will need every internal resource to deal with these traumas and plenty of outside therapeutic support. **It may mean hospitalization, unless the survivor can keep the trauma from emerging too quickly, and the therapist and survivor can go extremely slow. Other, less dissociated systems and fragments should be integrated first. Acknowledging the abuse cognitively will be the first step in dealing with core trauma. Letting more dissociated parts grieve after learning about what happened may come next. Allowing feelings near the core to come close, a little at a time, with helpers and internal nurturers offering support will help. These feelings should be titrated, looked at a little at a time. Splits may be different ages, and may need to express themselves in different ways. There may be dream programming, a \"fantasy world\", or other flight from reality surrounding the core splits that protects them from contact with the outside world,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt:76:1aa37aeedffa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14473, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_book_svali_speaks", "chunk_index": 77, "text": "about what happened may come next.

There may be dream programming, a \"fantasy world\", or other flight from reality surrounding the core splits that protects them from contact with the outside world, which is perceived as brutal and cold. Parts may be completely disconnected from outside reality in an effort to buffer pain. Slow, patient nurturing and reality orientation will help these tremendously traumatized parts begin to join outer reality. Some parts will always have been aware of what happened, but won't care to join the outside world. Patience, allowing them to vent, will help most. **The Last Six Steps of Discipline** **Step seven: Not caring ** This step will take the child further into a perpetrator role. The child will be forced to hurt others and prove their ability to not care during the process. **Step eight: Time travel ** The child will be taught spiritual principles of \"traveling\" both internally and externally with set ups, role playing, and guided exercises reinforced with trauma. The goal will be to reach \"enlightenment\", an ecstatic state of dissociation reached after severe trauma. **Steps nine, ten, & eleven** These will involve programming that will vary according to the child's future role in the cult. Sexual trauma, learning to dissociate and increase cognition, and learning to decrease feeling will be emphasized in these steps. **Step twelve: \"Coming of age\" ** Around age twelve to thirteen, the child will be formally inducted into the cult and their adult role there in a \"coming of age\" ceremony. They will prove their worthiness by performing the role/job they have been training for to the satisfaction of the trainer and leaders present, after which they will undergo a special induction ceremony. The ritual and ceremony will be held with other children of the same age, who are dressed in white and given a prize as acknowledgement that they have completed the basics of their training successfully. **Those who have completed this ceremony will continue to be abused even as adults, but the major traumatization and creation of system templates will have occurred by this age.** Future training will refine what was already placed in the child by this age or build upon the foundation already will in place. **Suggestions** Grieving the abuse and acknowledging the feelings associated with undergoing the trauma will be important.

This can be difficult to do, since perpetration will horrify the survivor when they remember this. Supporting the survivor, remaining non judgmental, and encouraging acceptance of these parts is important. **Pointing out that they saw no other options available at the time they became perpetrators will help. The therapist can point out that perpetrator alters saved the child's life, and that they had no other way to act, especially when all this first happened.** The survivor may feel hostile towards or reviled by perpetrator alters, but they are the expression of the abuse and limited choices they were allowed. Grieving being a perpetrator will take time and caring support by others. **Important Note:** For an excellent, concise article filled with valuable tips on deprogramming survivors of ritual abuse and mind control, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/pammonday).

According to Svali, Illuminati bloodline children are heavily conditioned to be obedient, self-controlled, and totally loyal to \"the family.\" In special activities carried out under extreme secrecy, they are subjected from a very young age to intense sessions using drugs, hypnosis, and shock-reward conditioning which turn them into [Manchurian Candidates](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse) with alter personalities. **In their normal lives, they remember nothing of what is done to them in these sessions.** Some of these Illuminati children are groomed for the military or politics, while others are prepared to take on key business positions. Throughout their lives, most family members in these Illuminati bloodlines have no conscious awareness of their dual lifestyle. To themselves, their neighbors, and others, they appear to be normal, upstanding citizens. Yet unknown to their own normal identity, their alter personalities are regularly accessed using code words and ordered to attend secret activities at designated times where they are programmed to forward the Illuminati's hidden agenda. **Svali alleges that higher level political positions in all Western countries are heavily occupied or controlled by members of the Illuminati bloodlines.** She also says it is quite rare that Illuminati members ever leave the fold. The pressures against this are great, including the need to abandon spouse, children, house, money, and more. Svali was only able to leave after it dawned on her that, because in her role as an Illuminati trainer she was telling lies to the young Illuminati children, she must have been lied to herself from the time she was quite young. Svali has an abundance of intriguing information on the Illuminati and ritual abuse available on a website at [this link](http://web.archive.org/web/20110519192605/http://www.suite101.com/articles.cfm/ritual_abuse).

I'm your host, Greg Szymanski. Two hours. Two hours with great interviews all the time. We get into the news behind the scenes that the mainstream media refuses to cover. What a shame. Let me just update some things before I tell you who my guest is today. I've been promo-ing it all week, and we're going to get deep inside the Family, the Order, the Illuminati today, for two hours. And you've got to stay with us from the beginning to the end of this interview. [commercial break - resume 8:30] GS: Okay, we're back. It's eight minutes after the hour, and we're going to get deep inside the Illuminati, the Family, the Order. We have a guest that was involved with this group, born into it, for over thirty years. Her name is Svali. Svali, are you with us? Svali: Uh, yes I am. GS: Well, it's nice to have you here. I know you don't give radio interviews. And I really want to thank you, because I think it really does help the American people understand about this secret organization that you were born into. So I guess we can just start from the beginning. Tell us. Right from the beginning you were born into this from wealthy parents. Tell us about your training in this group when you were a young child and then up until your orientation at the Vatican. Go ahead. Svali: (surprised, laughing) Well, that's a pretty broad area, Greg! That could take hours, if you know what I mean. GS: Yes, but do it. You know, if you could just outline it for us. Svali: Yeah. I mean, I was born in the group. I was born in Germany and came to the US very young. I basically went through all the training that the group ... all members of the group do undergo training to different degrees, depending on the role. By the time I was a teenager, I was a youth leader. And by the time I was 22, I became the youngest member of the Leadership Council in San Diego County. At that time I was a head trainer. I was the sixth trainer. I eventually moved up to the second position. GS: Mm hm. Svali: When I was twelve, I had mentioned with you the ceremony at the Vatican... GS: Right. Svali: ...that they", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_interview.txt:1:623ba1c6d4ac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14478, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_interview.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_interview", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "depending on the role.

Svali: ...that they really do make all leadership in the group undergo at some point. GS: Now basically when you were growing up, I remember you told me that you were instilled at a young age. You were born to a very wealthy, well-to-do family. Svali: Yes. GS: You moved back to the States. You were told at a very young age you were special, you were chosen. Correct? Svali: Well, they tell everyone in the group that they are special and chosen. And in fact, that's one of the things that made me very cynical when I was older. You will never meet a person who is an Illuminati who has not been told and programmed for years that they're special, they're the only one that can do things for \"Family\". But I was told, yes, I would do great things for Family one day. The reason why I can filter some of this with an objective view is I know what my role in the group was. It was over quite a significant number of other people. So I don't evaluate my role or specialness within the group so much by what I was told, but by what I did. GS: So you reached the age of 12, and then you're told by your parents you're going to an induction ceremony in the Vatican. Svali: Yes. GS: Can you tell us how that happened and what occurred at that ceremony when you went there? Svali: Okay. Um, this isn't easy to talk about, as you know. When I was twelve, I was flown over to Germany. And I was at, I'll call them the German Fathers' house over there. And there was some preparation for a few days beforehand. And I was told that there would be a very important ceremony. And it was considered a sealing ceremony at that point. And basically I was told a little bit about what I was expected to do during the ceremony. When we got there, we went through the Vatican. Underneath the Vatican there is a large room that I described to you when we talked before. It has 13 catacomb chambers leading into it. And what they do is as you go down these steps into the room, you can see that it's circular, so they're all rounded. They bring out the mummies from the catacombs. And they set them beside each", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_interview.txt:2:4600829d0d33", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14479, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_interview.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_interview", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "I was expected to do during the ceremony.

And they set them beside each one [each of the 13 catacomb chambers], and they say, \"That's the spirit of the Fathers watching over the ceremony.\" During the ceremony, there was a large table in the center of the room. It was on top of a huge golden pentagram. They had a ceremony there. GS: So how many kids, how many other children were with you being inducted into the Family or the Order, as they call it? Svali: There were two other children at that point. But there were several adults, too. GS: Okay. Svali: See, the Church also brings in adults to swear their allegiance, too, just so you know. I was told, and I don't know if this is true, that if you want to rise to a certain position within the Catholic Church hierarchy, you do have to go through that ceremony as well. GS: Okay, so you're down in this room. Your parents weren't present. Svali: No. No. The German Father and the French Father were. GS: Okay, and at that point tell our listeners what you witnessed. Svali: Well, there was a table. It looked like dark glass in the center of the room. It was made out of a stone, but it was very shiny and dark and black. It may have been something like obsidian or onyx. I'm not sure. This was the only time I've seen stone like that. Around the corners it had these gold channels that, you know, collect fluids. A little boy was placed in the center of the table and drugged. I think he was drugged, because he was very quiet. He didn't move or say anything. GS: This was a little three or four-year-old boy, right? Svali: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. GS: Then they continued to do a child sacrifice. Svali: Yes, they did. Yes. I told you about that before. Yeah. GS: Now afterwards ... what an unbelievable experience for a youth, a 12-year-old. What went through your mind when that happened? Svali: I was terrified! I mean, I was absolutely horrified. I... I... I... I can't describe the terror you feel when you go through something like that. GS: And do you remember the words they were saying as this was going on? Svali: The man was in scarlet. He was speaking in Latin. And basically he was saying, \"Please accept the sacrifice on this day.\" And then he said, \"This", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_interview.txt:3:c068563ec9e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14480, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_interview.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_interview", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "a 12-year-old.

He was speaking in Latin. And basically he was saying, \"Please accept the sacrifice on this day.\" And then he said, \"This sacrifice will seal the ceremony.\" And then he did it. Again, I was so terrified that... (sighs) Have you ever been in a situation where your heart's racing, but you can't do anything? You're just kind of sitting there, and you're kind of fading in and out? GS: Well, I can remember as a youth being frightened, but I don't think I've ever... Svali: (cross talk) No. All right. GS:... had anything quite like what you've had. Svali: Imagine your heart rate going up to about 220. You can't move. You're kind of shaking, but you're trying not to show it. GS: Mm hm. Svali: It was horrible. Actually, I keep thinking inside, \"I can't wait 'till it's over. I can't wait.\" You don't say this, but inside you're just saying over and over, \"I can't wait 'till this is over. I can't wait 'till this is over. I can't wait 'till it's over.\" GS: Mm hm. Svali: Afterwards, the man in scarlet, he had a huge golden ring on his hand. He came over to the center of the room. He had each of the people that were swearing that day go forward and kneel before him and kiss his ring, and [I had to ] swear my allegiance to the New Order, to the New World Order for all ... until my death. GS: Hm. Now at that point you were escorted out. Svali: Yes. Yeah. After the ceremony was all over. I mean, the other people also did theirs as well. They had to swear their allegiance, too. GS: And they were the same age as you? Svali: The two children were. But there were also three adults that went forward and did the same. And afterwards, we were told, \"May the same to you or worse occur should you ever break this oath.\" GS: Hm. So it's basically... Whew! Imagine at that age, what [this would do]. And you weren't really prepped for this, were you? You were told there was a ceremony, but you didn't expect anything like this, from what I've gathered talking to you. Svali: It was very difficult to go through, just because the sense of horrific oppression down there was the worst I've [ever felt.] I've gone through some ceremonies in my life in the Illuminati.

You do go through them. But I have to say that in my experience this was the worst, just because... I can't explain the amount of darkness in a room like that. It was just pure evil. And unless you've ever been in a... seen a person... it was just horrible. It wasn't just what happened, but just... I mean, the oppression. And I'm a Christian now, and I know the difference now between when there is evil present - oppression - or when God's love is present, [which] is joy and peace. That's the exact opposite of what there was in that room. GS: Now you know what I find quite interesting about this? About 25 years ago, I was a reporter and a freelance writer in Rome, and I spent six years there. I walked through the Vatican many, many times - hundreds of times. I covered the papal addresses, things like that. During that time I was there during a Vatican scandal, which involved the Church bank and other things - members of the Illuminati, the Freemasons. I was approached by a woman, Maria Vendital (ph), and I'll never forget this. Rome's a small town. People knew I was covering stories about the secret societies, things like that. I had to ask people. Well, this woman came up to me and told me similar stories. She wasn't quite as specific because she couldn't handle it. She would break out crying, and tried to commit suicide twice because she couldn't get out of the Illuminati. She was a member, born into it from a very wealthy northern Italian family. She told me basically the same ceremony took place with her. And so, when I started talking to you, I wanted to relay that to you, and also to relay to my listeners that I also heard about this 25 years ago from a woman by the name of Maria and several other people in Italy that I talked to. I was never able to locate or really, probably for my own safety, ever find out what happened. But again, Svali's corroborating this story that I heard about 25 years ago. We'll get back after the break with this incredible story of a member who is now out of the Illuminati, out of the group and safe, on the Republic Broadcasting Network.

[commercial break - Resume at 23:15] GS: Okay, we're back on the Investigative Journal. I'm your host, Greg Szymanski. We're talking to Svali, a member of the Family, the Order, the Illuminati, for over thirty years. Svali, you leave the induction ceremony. You walk out into the Vatican courtyard. You leave with one of the fathers, I believe. What did he tell you then? Svali: At that point he just told me to never forget. He told me that I had performed well during the ceremony because I didn't scream or pass out or anything like that. He said, \"You did very well,\" and he was pleased. Then we stayed at a home nearby. It must have been a local person. I didn't know them. We spent the night there before we went back to Germany. GS: Okay, and what about the other people during the ceremony. How did they handle themselves? Do you remember? Svali: (sighs) I'm going to say, unfortunately, I am so... When you're in that kind of situation, the last thing you're thinking about sometimes is what the other people are doing. I was just so trying not to lose it myself. I do know that no one screamed or shouted or anything like that. Everyone was quiet. I think to say 'dead silence,' is, unless the person was spoken to, true - or unless they had to go forward and kiss the ring. GS: All right, let's move on. I think we've, uh... Svali: Yeah. GS: A question I've wanted to ask you, and this is such a wide subject. I've had a chance to talk to you for a number of days, and I've done some stories about it. You go back home, you're twelve years old. You said you were schooled in the twelve disciplines. Svali: Yes. [12 disciplines, from Svali's online book: 1. To not need. 2. To not want. 3. To not wish. 4. Survival of the fittest. 5. The code of silence. 6. Betrayal is the greatest good. 7. Not caring. 8. Time travel: \"The child will be taught spiritual principles of \"traveling\" both internally and externally, with set ups, role playing, and guided exercises reinforced with trauma. The goal will be to reach \"enlightenment\", an ecstatic state of dissociation reached after severe trauma.\" 9,10,11: \"Sexual trauma, learning to dissociate and increase cognition, decrease feeling.\" (Details of these 3 steps vary according to child's future role in the cult.

Coming of age ceremony (Vatican underground sacrifice).] GS: So your life begins, and you know now you're in some type of organization that is very different than what most people experience. Tell us... I guess what I want to do is leave it open to you to begin. You've written so in-depth on this story. I'm just going to give you the microphone and let you begin. Tell the listeners what you think is important about your original training, about the group and about many things that I know people want to know about the Illuminati. Go ahead. Svali: Okay. Well Greg, first I want to say that my purpose in talking about this is not to glorify evil. There are very wicked people out there, very powerful people. I don't want to at all magnify their power, but I do want people to know that this is real. These people exist. People who say there are people out there that are involved in these activities... it really happens. I also, because I know that there are children being hurt in the group every day, and that's my motivation for coming forward. I don't like giving interviews for obvious reasons. I am willing this one time to lay aside my privacy and personal safety because these people need to be stopped. They need to be stopped. GS: Okay. Svali: Okay? GS: Go ahead. Svali: Normally children in the group are born into it. The Illuminati very rarely does outside recruitment. That's not their main method. It's just passed down generally, generationally from father to son, and mother to daughters to children. And so the whole family line has been in it. Throughout the centuries people have tried to escape, but a lot of times they were either poisoned, murdered or set up to look like a suicide. They don't like it when people leave, and they try to make it very difficult - simply because it looks bad. (slight laugh) They go through an enormous amount of training, from the time they are an infant. You undergo indoctrination. And when I say indoctrination, I don't just mean like cult programming so much as watching your parents and seeing what they do. My parents modeled their behavior.

To them the group was very important for growing up. I saw that three times a week, everything was dropped to tend to the activities. Okay? GS: Okay. Svali: Basically the training process is designed to help you take on your adult role in the group. The Illuminati cover so many levels there too. It goes all the way from what most people think of as a satanic coven type thing, at the very low local level, all the way through... it's a huge, enormous business corporation. At the mid-levels, you have people overseeing finances and administration, who are overseeing... I mean, these people are making a LOT of money through gun running, through white slavery, prostitution, pornography. They have links and ties to the Mafia, left and right. And, in fact the mafia are afraid of them. (Laughs) GS: Hmm. Svali: Yeah. (Laughs): Well, think about it! Because they know that you don't cross the members of the group. They have a very spiritual orientation. They are not satanic, though; they are Luciferian, which is different. The ultimate goal of their spiritual philosophy and their sense of discipline is they believe that should you complete all of your training, you become a god. That is their actual end goal. They believe in the achievement of Godhood - of Illuminist philosophy - through what they call Enlightenment, or Illumination, which is how they got their name. GS: Mm hm. Svali: They are international. In Europe there are twelve fathers who sit, who represent the different nations of Europe. They are very expectantly awaiting He Who Is To Come, and during that ceremony in the Vatican, (bumper music starts) on my knees I had to swear my allegiance to serve He Who Is To Come. They believe that the coven... GS: Svali, can you, uh, I have to take a break. Svali: Sure. GS: We'll continue with the massive organization, your role as a mid-level person in the Illuminati on the Republic Broadcasting Network. [commercial break - resume 33:27] GS: Okay, we're back on the Investigative Journal, and I'm talking with Svali. Svali, why don't we just pick it right up where we left off at the break. You were telling us about this hierarchy that starts with twelve fathers. Can you just run that down for us so people know exactly how this group is organized? Svali: Sure.

You were telling us about this hierarchy that starts with twelve fathers. Can you just run that down for us so people know exactly how this group is organized? Svali: Sure. At the top levels, it's in Rome. That's the power center or the heart of the Illuminati, where the power base is. And that's why all leadership must swear fealty in Rome, because that's considered the core of, the spiritual center of the Universe. That's how they view it. From there, in Europe there are twelve fathers - one for each country in Europe. When I was younger I had to also meet with the fathers at one point and kiss the ring, and go through another ceremony of allegiance to them as well. In the Illuminati, the European Fathers rule over what are called the different houses. For instance, if you are from Germany then you belong to the German House, if you are from France you belong to the French House - they call them Houses. UK, Russia, Poland, Belgium, Spain, Italy and others. From there, America was considered a mission field for them. In the 17, actually in the 1600s, Pittsburgh became the first port of entry for them. That's where they first settled. That's why it's still considered a spiritual power base for the group on the East Coast in the US. GS: You know, I did want to mention one thing. A caller / listener / reader of your stories sent me an email, and said, \"Greg, check into the reason why President Bush, right after being elected, went into and talked to a Masonic group there.\" I found that quite interesting. Svali: Oh yeah. GS: Go ahead. Svali: It's the spiritual power base for the group. From there, it spread out across the Atlantic seaboard, and then throughout the nation. The nation is divided into many regions, multiple regions but seven main regions. The East Coast region has its spiritual power base in Pittsburgh, but the administrative power base is in Alexandria, Virginia. That's where they administer the finances during the day to day operations. The West Coast, or the West region, west of the Mississippi, has its power base in the San Diego area. GS: And that's where you spent a lot of time, correct? Svali: Yeah. Yes. I was sent from, the Alexandria Council sent me to San Diego to help them out. GS: Okay, go ahead.

Svali: Those are the two, of course, main regions. And then each of those regions are divided into sub-regions. So then you have your Regional Councils sitting over those, and overseeing activities. If you can think of the structure of a large multinational corporation, that's really how the Illuminati is structured. Then beneath each of the regional councils are your local councils. They call them sister groups or sisters, or your local councils. Then you have your local groups under those as well, or what they call the sister groups. Any major metropolitan city could have anywhere from five to fifteen groups, depending on the size of the population base. Or more. GS: Now you were saying that, how many people are in this group in America now, from your estimate, of knowing a lot of this stuff? Go ahead... Svali: Pure Illuminati, I would say about one percent, give or take, based on population. GS: So it's a fairly huge... big organization, correct? Svali: Yes. GS: Now their goal, basically. Just give us the broad overview goal, and then I want to get into some of these, you know, your role in it, and some of these ways that the Illuminati makes money that you learned about. Svali: Yeah. GS: Go ahead. Svali: You know, when you say \"To rule the world,\" it almost sounds laughable - like \"yeah, right\", you know. I think people get ideas of thinking or wanting to rule the world. But really, that is their goal. They believe that they are the intelligent leaders, and they believe that the rest of the world are sheep that need wise... They see themselves as wise leadership. So they believe that their goal is to rule the world. GS: Mm hm. Svali: But at the same time, they have occult ways of doing that. Their main way of doing that is behind the scenes. They believe in infiltration of the media, of education and of government - those are the three areas - and of the financial system. And they have successfully done quite a bit of all four throughout Europe and the US, as well as other countries. GS: Now you said that they, basically the Illuminati is divided into about six or seven groups, and everyone is born into a group. Could you outline what those groups are? Svali: Well no, it's all one group, there are just different levels. GS: Yeah, that's what I mean. Like the Sciences, the Government, or... Svali: Oh. Oh. Okay.

The Illuminati is divided into different branches of learning. These branches include Sciences, Military, Government, Leadership, Scholarship and Spiritual. Those are the six branches of learning. And while all children need to undergo some training or teaching in each area, as they get older... They begin profiling you from infancy, and they know where your activities and abilities are. Then you're, you really go into... Most people specialize in one branch or possibly two branches of learning. GS: And you were involved in what branch? Svali: I was heavily involved in Sciences, and also to some degree I did some Spiritual as well - but mainly Sciences. GS: Just to backtrack one minute, these twelve disciplines. As a child, you were rigorously trained in this, correct? Svali: Yes. GS: Okay. And what were those disciplines? [1. To not need. 2. To not want. 3. To not wish. 4. Survival of the fittest. 5. The code of silence. 6. Betrayal is the greatest good. 7. Not caring. 8. Time travel. 9,10,11: Sexual trauma, learning to dissociate and increase cognition, decrease feeling - details of these 3 steps vary according to child's future role in the cult. 12. Coming of age ceremony (Vatican underground sacrifice).] GS: I mean, if... You don't have to go through each one of them, but what primarily were you taught? Svali: (pause) I think the best way would be to give you an example of just one type of training that they do. GS: Okay. Svali: I was two years old. I was left in a room for probably a 24-hour period. When you are that age it is hard to estimate, but it was a long time. I know that the sun did go around (laughs) at least once, and it wasn't just like a few hours. At that age, when you are two and you are left alone without food and water, you are terrified. And at the end of the time, I was just dying of thirst. My morale was just... I have never been so thirsty in my entire life. My mother walked into the room. A lot of times they have the children, you know, or the parents train the children at these early ages. There was a table in the middle of the room and I was sitting at it.

I want a drink of water,\" and she slapped me out of the chair. (pause) GS: Hm. Svali: And I remember crying! And as I'm crying, she's drinking the water in front of me, and she leaves! She takes the pitcher of water. And a couple of hours later, she came back in and did the same thing. And I said, \"Mom, Mom, I want water!\" And she slapped me! I mean, across the room. After this had happened about three times, luckily I was bright enough that by the third time she came in, I mean, I remember crying silently, but I just looked at her. I didn't ask. After she got up and left with the pitcher, a man came into the room. He said, \"You did very well that time.\" And then he gave me a drink of water. GS: Hm. Svali: That was part of the \"learning not to want\" stage. Looking back on it, I realize now as an adult that the part of that training was to teach me not to recognize my own physiological needs and respond to them, but to look to outside people to tell me what I wanted or needed. Which is what... GS: Now you basically, you told me you led a dual life in the Illuminati. That's basically how they function. Svali: Oh yeah! GS: You have a day job, and then at nighttime you're quite busy sometimes with the cult activities, correct? Svali: Yes. GS: Okay. What I wanted to get into... you were talking about these groups. I remember I mentioned to you, you said you had these meetings three times a week. I said, \"Well, what about if I wanted to go and visit, and maybe do a story about them?\" What would happen, or how could... would I be able to find one of these meetings that were going on, in your area of Escondido? Svali: Well no, because of the security measures. And A), you really don't want to show up unannounced at a meeting if you could get through their security, because the chances are you would never make it out alive. Let's just say that a certain auto accident would occur, and be reported in the papers: \"Unfortunate accident - man accidentally runs into tree.\" (Laughs) I mean, I'm serious!

The security that they have during group meetings is so intense that it would be very difficult. They have security at the one-mile perimeter, the three-mile perimeter and the five-mile perimeter. They have three people assigned. Usually one is up in a tree where you can't see him at the five-mile perimeter. GS: Mm hm. Svali: And then you have one person who is standing, looks like a security guard for the estate, because these are often large, wealthy estates, which is appropriate. He is dressed in a uniform. The third person is standing hidden behind a tree. As cars come through, and they come through the gates - remember these are gated estates. GS: Mm hm. Svali: So if it's not someone on their approved license checklist, they will stop the car. It's just like at a military installation. They will say, \"Can I help you? Are you lost?\" Their goal is to delay the person. Now if a person is saying, \"Oh, this is blah blah blah,\" and they are just asking for directions, they will give them directions, be very pleasant and send them on their way, to where they are supposed to be going. But if they are acting as if they want to go further into the estate, and this is not an okay person, then they will say, \"Uh, all right, well HE'S NOT EXPECTING YOU.\" That's a code word. That tells the person either behind, up in the tree, or hidden further back - they radio ahead and they say \"UNEXPECTED VISITOR.\" At that point, everyone has been trained to pick up and leave immediately, within five minutes - with no traces of the activity. GS: So this is some of the methods they go through so you don't get caught. I know that you wrote an article about why the cult doesn't get caught. Svali: Oh yeah. GS: It's pretty specific. You have so much stuff here, and we can't get into it all in two hours, so please pick and choose what you think is most important. But I find that to be interesting - why the cult doesn't get caught. Is there anything in just a brief time you could explain to us... that? Svali: Well, their security, their money, their influence.

That's the first thing people ask. Then my next question is, \"Well, how many child pornographers are there out there, that the police have been chasing for years, and have never found or caught?\" GS: Correct. Svali: And they're not even members of a secret organization. They're just trying to hide, you know. So when you consider that... GS: Now you... Svali: Okay. GS: Yeah. You were a mid-level person in this organization, a head trainer. We're going to get into those specifics in the next hour. But you know, what did you learn about the infiltration of this group into all our different areas of government and media? They are basically at the high levels of most of our financial institutions also, correct? Svali: Yes. GS: And that is a great way to pursue their goal. I guess I've got to ask you this. How come things are moving a little bit faster in America now? I remember back in the 80s when I was confronted with this, when I came back home I didn't really see this kind of New World Order movement... all this different symbolism that you see now. What is going on, just for our listeners, right now? Why are things stepped up since 9-11? Svali: I believe it's because they can see the fulfillment of their goal... See, I'm going to sound very cynical now, and please forgive me for this, okay? Their goal is to rule the world, and personally I believe that they do - it's just not open yet. GS: Mm hm. Svali: And they say they're now preparing people for when they disclose themselves openly. Does that mean that they can't be stopped? I believe they could. I believe it would take a miracle, because of the amount of infiltration I see at all levels of society, and the world. These guys, these people have a lot of money. They have a lot of influence. And your average person has no idea of how much is going on behind the scenes that no one understands. But, with that said, I think that they're already there, they just aren't open. These people just don't know where they're going! (Laughs) If they did, I think the average person would be horrified to know how much is going on behind the scenes that people really don't know.

GS: Yeah, and the point of this interview, one, I had two goals... Svali: But... But you see, I don't want to sound disparaging, because I am also a strong Christian. I have faith in God, and I believe through prayer, and through people knowing... I mean, I would like them to be stopped. I just don't know, at this point, how do you take on the financial institutions of the world, the major oil enterprises of the world, you know? (Laughs) That's the question! (Laughs) You know? GS: Yeah! You know, it is a difficult question. Now you're in the mid-level of this group. You worked your way up to a head trainer, correct? Svali: Yeah... Yeah. GS: Now what did you learn... Before we get into specifics, you outline some in of your writings, the big money-making... the ways this group makes its money. Can you go over and outline some of those methods? Svali: Again, if you can think of an illegal activity, they're probably involved at some point. Maybe not overtly, at the point of where the actual money is first shaking hands - but when you have child pornography, prostitution, white slavery, gun running, gambling, then at some point where the money is changing hands, buffered by about four layers of people, there's going to probably be someone from the Illuminati involved at that point. These guys have their fingers in everything. GS: Now... Svali: Uh... GS: Go ahead. Svali: But they also use legitimate means. They launder their money. When you have a lot of money, you have to do something with it. And so, these men don't come in and say, \"Hi! I'm a member of the Illuminati and I want to run your bank.\" What they'll do is they'll quietly come in and become a quiet investor, start buying up shares. And over a period of maybe, almost a lifetime, they will get a controlling interest in the bank, or become a very... you know. Or maybe in their son's lifetime. That's the other thing about the Illuminati. The Illuminati do not see it as \"This is what must happen now, in my lifetime.\" These people have goals that last for centuries, for two centuries. They are very, very patient. GS: And that's why the specific training of the children is so important, correct? Svali: Yes. It's to teach you PATIENCE.

Everyone knows, growing up in the group, we may not see the coming order disclosed or open or revealed in our lifetime, but our children or our grandchildren may. So they will spend their entire life trying to bring about the goals of the organization. GS: (Chuckles) Hm. Incredible. So now you're in the mid-level. I can see now where they used these programming techniques, the different mind control techniques. We have a minute before the break. Just kind of whet our interests about how you... what your specific role was. Svali: Well, they did a lot of what you might call human experimentation. And they had a lot of research protocols going on. So one thing I did was to supervise the research going on. I was teaching the younger trainers and head trainers how to do things more efficiently, how to do their job well, but also reviewing their research reports for errors or problems. Eventually I became kind of a consultant. If a problem occurred, or they didn't know how to install something, or if they needed assistance, I would help them with problem solving as well. GS: Okay, Svali, I'm going to have to take a break. We'll be back in three minutes. We'll continue, on Republic Broadcasting Network. [commercial break - resume 54:24] GS: Okay, we're back on the Investigative Journal. I've got a short four minute segment here, then we'll take a break and come back with Svali for a whole [additional] hour. We're talking about jobs in the Illuminati, the practical daily jobs that these members of this group, who are infiltrated in America heavily... what they do. Now one thing I find interesting, Svali, knowing the media... I'm not going to name names or anything, because I don't have any specific information. But I find it interesting. Doing some background checks on a lot of the top media people in our country, they all come from these very wealthy families. (Laughs) Now that's not the typical MO for a journalist. A journalist is somebody who grows up on the street, wants to talk to people, I can think of Jimmy Breslin, guys who never went to college, didn't know how to type, and just got in there, took their tie off and started writing stories. But you know, as you look at the media now, there are all these silver spoon kids - growing up with silver spoons. I find that quite interesting.

But you know, as you look at the media now, there are all these silver spoon kids - growing up with silver spoons. I find that quite interesting. How deeply infiltrated, from your knowledge, are they in our media? Svali: Wow. Pretty... I do know, uh, fairly deeply. I remember that when I was in San Diego on Leadership Council during meetings, they would laugh about how people had no idea of how much they were being influenced and didn't even know it. They found that kind of amusing, which is... I mean, that's the mind set of people in the group, though. They're like, \"The sheep have no idea that they're being led by the hand.\" And they find it amusing, because they show it as evidence of... I mean, I'm just describing what they say, I don't agree with it now, but they saw as evidence of the stupidity of the ... of the average person - that they have no idea. I'm not saying that every news story or every newscaster is a member of the group... by no means. But, they specifically do teach and train and educate children that show an aptitude for the media, because they want that. And if the person has a bright, charismatic personality, and presents well, then that child will go into that, if they have their verbal communication and other skills required. GS: Well, you know, that could explain why a lot of our stories really never get covered, outside of the influence they have financially and the ownership of the media. Svali: (cross talk) That's absolutely not by coincidence. GS: What's that? Svali: Not at all a coincidence. GS: Yes. That's a good idea, folks, why you're not getting the news from those outlets. Not only in our government. It explains a lot of things. Look at the war in Iraq. Look at the evidence there that shows what is wrong. Look at what they're doing in Iran right now. I mean, it's incredible. All this stuff is pretty obvious, people. There's something behind it. Svali is here trying to explain this organization from her knowledge, and it is quite, quite a story. I know this idea. You were involved as a trainer of mind programming? I mean, this is just, I'm looking at some of the chapters in a book you have yet to publish [in paper book form].

In just a minute here before our break, can you kind of break down what you learned about the importance, well, oh! We've got to take a break, Svali, sorry. We're going to do that quickly, then we'll get back to you. We're talking to Svali, regarding her role as a head trainer in the Illuminati, the American Illuminati. We'll be back, on the Republic Broadcasting Network, in two minutes. [END OF FIRST HOUR] GS: Okay, we're back on the Republic Broadcasting Network. One more hour. We're talking to Svali, and she was a head trainer in the Illuminati. Svali, what type of programming do they actually teach you, and how do you learn these different techniques? Svali: Well, you're taught from childhood on. My training in how to be a programmer started very young. I was mentored by another programmer at the age of 5, by a doctor at George Washington University. Not only did he do the programming on me, but also taught me how to do it to others. The types of programming... again, that could be a whole ten-hour segment to go into depth. From the time a child is an infant, all through their life basically, they are tested, they are profiled. Trainers can create a psychological profile, and then they update it frequently. Basically, they are trying to install in this child the ability to obey, loyalty to the group, and the ability to do their job within the group. Now those jobs vary in complexity. You may have on one side a child trained to be a prostitute. On the other end you may have a child trained to become a governmental figure, which is a lot more complex programming. But as long as the loyalty to the group is instilled, and that is the first and foremost programming always installed, then no matter what their eventual role is, they will remain loyal. And that becomes their first loyalty. Whatever nation, whatever their public role in life is, their first and foremost loyalty will be to the group, and to serve its goals - whether they know. A lot of times, the goal is [also] to be able to help the child create that complete division between their day role and their night role. So a pleasant, charming, wonderful, kind person in the daytime could be an absolutely cold, ruthless person at night - or during the day, you know, it's also during the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_interview.txt:18:533983d08797", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14495, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_interview.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_interview", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "role in life is, their first and foremost loyalty will be to the group, and to serve its goals - whether they know.

So a pleasant, charming, wonderful, kind person in the daytime could be an absolutely cold, ruthless person at night - or during the day, you know, it's also during the day they do it. Then you may have a housewife with children who goes out and completes a courier job for the group. And no one would ever suspect her. Who is going to suspect [that] this lovely-looking little housewife with a baby in a car seat is actually carrying some valuable documents? Again, the first and foremost other thing was to instill loyalty, and they want to discourage people from questioning orders. They really don't want you questioning that, and they want you to obey their directives. Should people show signs of not doing that, then they go on for tune-ups. Actually people are being programmed all through their life. We used to call them tune-ups. It's a lifelong process for members of the group. GS: We have a minute here before our break, and we'll get back and get in depth into some of these areas. But what went wrong with you? I mean, the dropout rate probably is very low... Svali: Extremely low. (laughs) GS: ...considering the number of, considering the training. But what went wrong with you? They somehow missed something. Svali: When I was very young I absolutely believed in the goals of [the group]. You never saw a more loyal group member. I thought that they were saving the world. I thought that we were doing a wonderful thing. But the older I got, I started to see the methods that were being used for so long, and that the ends do not justify the means. I became increasingly cynical, partly because I saw what I was doing to people. I was lying to them. I was manipulating them. I was telling them things that weren't true. I remember questioning this, thinking, \"I was told lies as a child too, then. I was manipulated.\" GS: Wow. Svali: And finally you start to question, as an adult, the things you were taught. (bumper music starts) GS: Okay. We're going to take a break, Svali, we'll be back in three minutes on the Republic Broadcasting Network.

You wrote an article that is very interesting - A Day in the Life of a Trainer for the Illuminati. Tell us what you went through in a normal day in your role at the Illuminati. Go ahead. Svali: Okay. Basically I would get up. At the time that I described in that article, I was teaching at a Christian school. And so I would get up, I would get my two children dressed and ready for school. Just like a normal mom, you know, go through the day, come home. We'd have little friends over and play, and stuff like that. Then, you know, have dinner. I was a good mom. I was your average American housewife - on the surface. But underneath the surface, then my husband and I would remind each other on nights when there was a meeting. And then what we would do is when we would go to sleep, I had programming in place that would allow me to wake up within ten minutes of the specified time. If I knew there was a meeting that night, I would wake up ten minutes before it was time to get ready and go. A lot of times we would even go to bed with our clothes on. And I never really thought that was abnormal, you know? GS: Mm hm. Svali: I thought everyone went to bed with their clothes on. I didn't even question it, you know, on nights when we had meetings. I thought, \"Oh, it's warmer.\" (Laughs) GS: Okay. Svali: And then we'd get up and go, and drive to the meeting. I was also very involved in Military in San Diego. In fact the group has a lot of military orientation. So on top I would take the kids to their area, there was an area where the kids would go and change. They had a room and we would have like baskets of clothes, and we would change our clothing. You'd pick out your clothing, it had your name on it, and put on your uniform. Or whatever you wore that night. The kids would wear these little miniature military uniforms. Then they would go out and do their training exercises. They were learning how to march, how to shoot. All kids in the Illuminati, at least in that area, know how to take apart a gun, put it together and shoot with deadly accuracy by the age of eight years old. Martial arts, there's a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_interview.txt:20:27070084a620", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14497, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_interview.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_interview", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "had your name on it, and put on your uniform.

All kids in the Illuminati, at least in that area, know how to take apart a gun, put it together and shoot with deadly accuracy by the age of eight years old. Martial arts, there's a lot of martial arts training. Sometimes I'd help supervise that, or fill in if there's a military trainer [who] was [absent]. Everyone had to be - there was a lot of cross training. But most of the time I supervised the training. I would be working on implementing programming, or what we'd call tuning up - reinforcing previously installed programming in adults. At that point I was normally supervising the younger trainers. They would be doing it, and I would be there watching and making sure they did it correctly. Or I would be also evaluating whether - sometimes every once in a while we'd be working on something that was somewhat experimental, and then I would be taking a more active role, assessing the person's responses to the new protocol, recording it and if there was any difference between established parameters for that protocol or expected responses, I would be flagging that. GS: Give me an example of someone you were working on. What... how would they be introduced, what would be the reason? Would they be military, what is, how does someone get sent to you? Svali: No, these were all members of the group! GS: Oh, okay. Svali: Oh! I can tell you that in San Diego, twenty percent of the active members of the group were active military. GS: Okay. Svali: Okay? And think of military intelligence. Think high-ranking officials, colonels, (laughs), commanders. My ex-husband was a lieutenant commander in the Navy, getting ready to become a commander, okay? GS: All right. Svali: These are not stupid people. GS: So you were basically working on the programming of the members involved. Svali: (cross talk) Yes. Oh yeah. Yeah. No, we didn't program people who were not members of the group. You CANNOT install significantly traumatic mind-control programming in a person who is not a member of the group. GS: (cross talk) Good. Svali: Now there are certain... what you can do is what we call passive programming, which is basically through media means. If someone's watching a television program, they go immediately into alpha state. Everyone in the group, even a baby in the group knows that, because these people are very much into behavioral psychology. That's a trance state, almost, a very relaxed state where messages can be implemented.

That's a trance state, almost, a very relaxed state where messages can be implemented. And that's why I very strongly suggest people be very careful about the TV shows they watch! That's all I will say about that. But no, you cannot take an adult who is not a member of the group and do what we did to them. They would go psychotic, or they wouldn't survive it, probably. They wouldn't be able to psychologically handle it. GS: Tell us some examples of what you were doing. Program techniques. Svali: (sighs) Sometimes, (sigh) it would involve, normally we would start with a hypnotic induction or even sometimes we would inject a medication. A lot of times especially young children have a lot of fear when they are going into programming, but adults do too. We want them to relax. We give them a very short-acting medication to relax them. We would then invoke a hypnotic state in them. If it was an older person I would be checking that the codes are already installed. If I was getting ready to install programming in like a young child, I would tell them, explain to them very patiently exactly the behavior expected. I'd say, \"I want you to do this, and this, and this.\" I break it up into steps. Then I'd say, \"First we're going to practice this.\" I would show the child what I want them to do - I would model it. I would then tell the child, \"DO IT.\" The child would then do it, okay? But, normally they won't do it well the first time, so she would... she or he would get shocked. That was called, because the group very much uses what they call positive and negative reinforcement. Okay? If a child did not do it perfectly the first time, they are shocked. That's the negative reinforcement. Then I would say, \"DO IT AGAIN.\" They would show me the behavior. Now at this point we start associating the behavior with an external stimulus or cue, too. Now a lot of times a child... If this is a behavior, though, that we want associated with a specific code, the child will often then traumatize very heavily first, to create a fragmentation in their personality. Then the behavior and the associated cue are given. You might hear a tone, like \"ding ding ding.\" [I say,] \"All right, I want you to do this.\" Ding ding ding. The child hears the tone, they get up and they do the behavior. Once they can perform it perfectly, they", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_interview.txt:22:2d00fc470b92", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14499, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_interview.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_interview", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "this is a behavior, though, that we want associated with a specific code, the child will often then traumatize very heavily first, to create a fragmentation in their personality.

The child hears the tone, they get up and they do the behavior. Once they can perform it perfectly, they are rewarded with praise. Good job, or a hug. Children like hugs, or something like that. Then you do it over, and over, and over. That's why trainers have to be very patient people. Because then maybe after the child has done it fifty times, then they hear the cue, they get up, [and] they do it. It's not even a conscious [decision]... it's reflexive. At that point it's considered installed. For very, very important programming, I'm talking about like end-level assassin programming, because we did train people how to assassinate people, and that's a whole other topic I don't want to go into here... GS: Okay. Svali: We would then do a ritual to seal the programming afterwards. GS: (Final-sounding) Okay. Svali: Okay? GS: Just something, I was looking at some of your articles. One was \"Christmas in the Cult.\" Just to get off on a different subject here... Svali: Sure. GS: You say this is quite different for you, when you were growing up, than it is for most children. Can you just kind of briefly tell us what you meant by that? Svali: Yeah, um... (sighs) I mean, we had trees and presents and things like that. But for most children, Christmas is just happy time, you know, lots of presents. But in the group, there are some very high ceremonies that are celebrated. Several times, in fact many times, I flew into Germany. And there, there wasn't a Santa Claus. They had a figure called Father Yule... GS: (cross talk) Mm hm. Svali: ...who represents Christmas there. But he is not the kind of benevolent Santa that you see here. This is a man with a golden scepter dressed in a white robe and a golden sash around. I was once at the German Father's house, where there was a gathering with children and adults, and Father Yule was present. He raises the scepter and basically strikes down a child in front of everyone. GS: (laughs in disbelief) Oh my God! Svali: I know! GS: (shocked) He strikes down a CHILD? I just... Svali: I know. Yes. He struck down the child with his, his scepter. And that... that is not what you call a happy Christmas, you know? GS: No. (sighs) Svali: And at the same time, yes, we did have a tree, you know, and fruitcake and all that, and decorate the house, but", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_interview.txt:23:71d8936cba41", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14500, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_interview.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_interview", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "strikes down a child in front of everyone.

GS: No. (sighs) Svali: And at the same time, yes, we did have a tree, you know, and fruitcake and all that, and decorate the house, but there is another side to Christmas. It's, it's... GS: (in shock) You know, I'm just listening and I just can't believe, you know, we're, you know, we have leaders in our country that have probably gone through this kind of stuff. I mean, uh, it's just incredible, this group. I know they've been around for a long, long time, thousands of years, and gone through it, came here. George Washington was a 33 rd degree Mason... Svali: (cross talk,) Oh, YEAH! GS: ...and we go on. Uh, the quest... you know, I just, I want you to understand, just from my point of view, I just wonder how... you know, you write a story, \"The End of the Illuminati.\" How do we get rid of these people? I know, you're out of it. You couldn't take it any more. You think we can inspire more mid-level people to just LEAVE, like you, so they have no one to DO this kind of INSIDIOUS... CRAZY... PROGRAMMING and lifestyle! What do you - what do you think? Svali: Well, I believe that, as strongly as a Christian, that it's a spiritual warfare as well as an emotional and psychological warfare. I believe that, by the grace of God. But I will also say that when I was in the group, a lot of the members are not happy. You have people in the group that are there because they love it, because they believe in our goals, they are totally dedicated. But to be honest, a lot... I often knew as many people who would have left in a minute if they thought that they could get out, and make it. GS: You know, about your husband, uh, just to break in and then go back into that. Do they marry you to somebody in the group, or is that forced on you? Svali: (cross talk) Yeah. Yeah. No. In the group, the marriages are always arranged, in my experience. In my 38 years in the group, I never knew of a couple, in the Illuminati, that did not have an arranged marriage. It can't be... GS: (cross talk) You just mentioned a couple that I, I suspect. Clinton and uh, Bill and Hillary. Svali: Oh, well, YEAH! (Laughs) GS: (Laughs) Svali: YES! Definite. Definite. GS: Yes. Bill? Svali: Yeah. GS: Go ahead. Svali: Yeah.

A lot of times, these marriages are arranged for compatibility, but also for bloodlines - to bring the right bloodlines together. GS: Okay, good. We're going to be back in three minutes. I want to continue this, and then we're going to get into Svali's life after the Illuminati, on the Republic Broadcasting Network. [commercial break - resume 23:17] GS: Okay, we're back on the Investigative Journal. I'm your host, Greg Szymanski. And let me tell you, as an interviewer, and someone who has researched the Illuminati for a long time... it started way back when, when I was a young reporter in Rome... It's a whole different ball game when you're actually talking to someone with experiences like this. It takes it out of that realm of what is quasi-fiction fact, into the realm of reality. It's - it's really shocking. And, uh, I'll be honest with you. This is a story, uh, that folks, you have to listen to - because this is going on in our country. All the things you're seeing regarding our rights being taken away, the police state, the war in Iraq, 9/11 - all these things have to do with this powerful group. Svali, you know, we're talking about mid-level people. Now we're going to talk about some of the lower-level people. I'm interested in who they are. But you said they weren't happy, but a lot of them probably stay because it's very... I mean, this is a... it's a very lucrative way to live, I imagine. Svali: Oh, yeah! GS: ...families? Svali: Oh, yeah! That's the main thing, that's one of the factors that keeps people in. The reason more people don't leave is because leaving means giving up your husband, your children, your entire family on both sides, your money. And basically, for a lot of people, leaving the group means giving up everything, and starting out penniless and alone. Not only that, but you're combating child programming to recontact, to go back, to be loyal, to be a good member. GS: Mm hm. Svali: And I know many people have tried to leave and went back, because they just couldn't take it. GS: Do you, uh, do you want to take a phone call right now? Break it up? Svali: Sure! GS: Okay. Marilyn, in California. You're on the Investigative Journal. Marilyn? Marilyn (ML): Yes, I've been a part of this.

GS: Okay. Marilyn, in California. You're on the Investigative Journal. Marilyn? Marilyn (ML): Yes, I've been a part of this. I lost part of it, I've been listening on the Internet. I didn't quite catch it. How did this woman become involved in this Illuminati training? GS: Uh, go ahead, can you explain that, Svali? Svali: I was taught it from early childhood. I was mentored into it. Trainers in the group are mentored. You wok with older adults and they show you, and you are given increasing responsibility. And so by the time you are in your teens, you are basically doing adult training responsibilities. You've been taught for years. ML: Your parents put you in it, or... ? Svali: Yes, they were members. ML: Oh, I see, so it comes down through the parents - one parent to another. Svali: Yeah. Or from both. ML: (shocked) Are they private SCHOOLS? Svali: Through what? ML: Are these private SCHOOLS? Svali: Well, my children were schooled at private Christian schools. They were all Illuminati. (Laughs) Okay? ML: (surprised, \"Now I get it\" voice tone) Oh, you're saying that the CHRISTIAN schools are Illuminati!! Svali: SOME of them are. Not all - but some. ML: Yeah, obviously. Svali: No, no. The ones that my children in were, specifically. But no, there's a lot of good Christian schools that have nothing to do with the group, but some can be. Now I went to a public school, but what's interesting is, out of three public schools I went to as a young child, two burned down. (sadly): So there's no access to any school records. ML: (completely shocked) I'll be DARNED. GS: Marilyn, just to get you up to speed. You're born into this, then you're trained as a young child. You go through an induction ceremony in the Vatican. And this is going on with one to two percent of our population, according to Svali. Very serious, in all levels. Government, and everything else. Go ahead, Marilyn, do you have another question? ML: Yeah. When you said the Vatican, now that is not a Christian religion, okay? Now I'm a Christian. Catholics is a Christian religion, we look at them as the precursor of the New World Religion. So... GS: Well, you know, if I may just break in. I grew up a Catholic. I don't get involved in the splicing of the religions.

I don't get involved in the splicing of the religions. I'm basically stating that when I started researching the Illuminati as a reporter in Rome, and I realized there was a bad portion of the Church, I looked at it. I had to deal with the evil and the good. So that's the way I reconciled it. The evil WITHIN the Catholic Church, at the high level of the Vatican , which seeps down into many, many areas. Go ahead. ML: Okay, well I won't argue that point. Svali: (cross talk) Now... Now... Now... ML: I won't agree with it, but it sounds like you have become possibly Born AGAIN to get out of this? Would I be correct in that? Svali: Yes. Yes. Now I very much... Now first, I do want to say I am not slamming the Catholic Church or the average Catholic. I have many good friends that are Catholics, that are strong Christians. I became a Christian, and that was the only way I could get out. But just so you know, too, a lot of card-carrying Illuminists, well we don't really carry cards, but I'm using that term... ML: Yes. Svali: ...are members of the Baptist church, are members of Pentecostal churches. It... This... I was on a worship team for a Wesleyan church in San Diego ... in my day life. Okay? ML: Oo-kay. Uh, yeah. Very, very confused. I mean, I, uh, I think this is interesting. Many people say that the Catholic Church will be the forerunner of the New World Religion. There's some very good books out. In fact, I think you may have interviewed one of these men - the Grand Plan Design by John Daniels? GS: Uh huh. ML: You remember that? GS: Uh... Svali: But, but... GS: Go ahead. Svali: The average Catholic has no idea of what's going on in the Vatican. ML: Yeah, yeah. I think that's interesting that, that the average Catholic would not know what's going on. That's just my take on it. (laughs) GS: Well, I'll tell you something. As an average Catholic going to Rome my first time in 1980, I didn't know what was going on, and I grew up as a Catholic, went to Notre Dame High School. It was quite a learning experience for me.

There are many Catholics who aren't actively practicing. ML: Yeah. Thank you! GS: But anyway, we'll leave that for another time. Thanks, Marilyn. We'll be back on the Investigative Journal in three minutes, with Svali. [commercial break - resume 33:20] GS: Okay! Uh, you know, they're not going to get me. That's for sure. My house is anti-Illuminated. It's not going to happen, folks. Just to end that, Svali, before I get back to you, just to end that conversation we had with Marilyn about Catholicism. I look back at it, and I really thank my dad. And I do it in kind of a way, I'm just thinking about it now. I didn't know what the Church was about. But you know, something strange did happen when I was young. My mom died, and I was ten years old. My brother was six months old at the time she died of leukemia. It was a very, very tragic affair - left my dad and me and my brother alone. And I remember my dad literally took a priest, a head Monsignor in our parish. And I won't even tell you where. Saint John Rebove (ph), right outside of Chicago. This man came into our house, I'll never forget it. He said that he was going to put ME and my little BROTHER in an ORPHANAGE. My dad literally picked him up and threw him out the door! Literally. Svali: Wow. GS: And from that point on, my dad never went back to church again. My brother never went to a Catholic school. I of course asked if I could finish, only because I had friends there. But you know, who knows what would have happened, you know, looking back on the craziness that goes on in the Church. But anyway, Svali, you were talking about, uh, you know something? These people that are too... that do not want to get out because of the financial ties. But let's go back to when you were in the Illuminati. How did this happen? How did you finally leave? Tell us this whole story about you leaving the Illuminati. We haven't touched on that yet. Svali: Sure. Well, I do want to say one thing that I agree with Marilyn on.

Tell us this whole story about you leaving the Illuminati. We haven't touched on that yet. Svali: Sure. Well, I do want to say one thing that I agree with Marilyn on. Without faith in God, I couldn't have done it. I became a Christian, and that was for me revolutionary. It made me question again more of what I was being taught, or had believed all my life. I, for the... I began to realize that what I was doing was wrong. I became increasingly cynical. I also then started standing up to the head trainer in the county who despised me. He would do things that were just blatantly cruel for no reason whatsoever. I'd say, \"You're wrong\". Well, people don't like that. (Laughs) He took it out on me in a lot of horrible ways. I finally made the decision to run. I ran to this... to another state, because I knew that my chances of getting out while still staying in that area with people I knew, surrounded by people who were in the group, was not going to be very good. So I went to another state. GS: You had to leave your family and everything, right? Svali: Everything. Well, my children were with their grandparents. At that point I thought that was better than them being with my husband. I was going to go get my kids. But my husband then called and he said, \"I want to reunite with you.\" And I said, \"Okay, that's wonderful.\" And I said, \"But you have to get help. You have to get some treatment, because we can't go on. You've got to get out of the group.\" He said, \"Okay. Help me get the kids and I'll meet you in a week.\" So the day before, he called and said, \"I'll be there tomorrow,\" blah blah blah. And so I was excited, thinking, \"Oh, he's getting out, he's getting out, that's wonderful!\" Instead, he went... he had gotten the kids several days before. He was lying to me, and I didn't know it. He had gone to a judge. And the day that he was supposed to arrive, there was a knock on my door. It was a policeman serving me DIVORCE papers, and also a restraining order, saying that I could not come within a hundred yards of my husband or my children. And at that point, I felt slightly punished (sigh) for leaving the group. I fought that, and it...

(sighs) I fought for four years with a court system that said things like this didn't occur, because my husband would go into court and say, \"This woman is psychotic. She's making it all up. There's no way. Ha, ha, ha. This stuff doesn't happen in this day and age.\" And the judge would say, \"You're right.\" Slam. Full custody to their father. And I had to have supervised visitation for four years with my own children, so that... because I was considered a kidnap risk. Through a lot of prayer, I had my whole church praying for me here in Texas, and through Lambley Research and miracles, my children were finally allowed unsupervised visitation with me, after four years. During that time, I said to my daughter, who was fourteen, I said, \"I want so badly for you to get out\". And she looks at me, and she starts going... (hyperventilating, extremely terrified): \"Oh! You shouldn't have said that, Mom! You shouldn't have said that, Mom!\" You know? She just... she just freaked out. She just totally lost it. GS: Mm hm. And I realized that it was her programming cycling, because she was just terrified. You know, she's like, (terrified, very rapid): \"Why did you say that, why did you say that\", and I said, \"It's okay, it's okay, honey, calm down, calm.\" And the following... she was just shaking and shaking. And then finally she said, \"Well, I don't want to go back and get hurt.\" And then I said, \"YOU DON'T HAVE TO.\" And at that point I faced several prison sentences, but I called my ex and I said, \"I will face... I will not let those children go back and get hurt again.\" GS: Okay. Svali: And he flew out to get them, and he could have put me in prison at that time, because I was breaking the custody visitation. And you know how strong the courts are on that! GS: Mm hm. Svali: And I said to him, \"Please... Look.\" Because it was so nice. My daughter and son both said, \"We don't want to go back, Dad. We don't want to get hurt. We don't want to do this anymore.\" He looked at them, and he said, \"I want to go think about it.\" He went home, and I was praying for him at the time. And then that night he called me, and he said, (delirious, hyperventilating): \"Oh my God. Oh my God.\" I said, \"What is it?\" He", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_interview.txt:30:164455ecba5b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14507, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_interview.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_interview", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "it was so nice.

He gave me... he did a legal case document giving me full custody of my children. And then he said he was so sorry for, he put me through, the H, E, L, L he had put me through for years. GS: Now, have you had any reprisals from people in the group since you were leaving, or any warnings? Svali: Yes. GS: To keep quiet, or anything like that? Svali: (cross talk) Yes. Oh, yeah! Oh... yeah, of course! There's one time when I did write one article that named some specific dates and times. I got hurt afterwards, and it made me very cautious. That's why I don't give a lot of radio interviews, and why I don't do a lot of this. That's one reason why... GS: Well, I appreciate this, because you know, the number of people you're going to help, by... maybe, maybe waking up the American people to what is really going on. Sometimes you can wake up many more people by a person like you, than talking about a hundred million different generalities. Let me take a call. Chris, in Washington, you're on the Investigative Journal. CH: (calm, relaxed cadence): Hi. Svali, I just want to say how much I appreciate your bravery, in presenting this information in the way that you are. I've read your website recently. And my question is very simple. Based on the information that you're presenting, I'm wondering what timeline the organization of the larger Family that you're describing has for implementing the New World Order? Svali: Okay. I was told it would occur during my generation. I was told that by the year 2050 that they would be revealed. Now again, their timelines change, though. In fact, I jokingly referred to them as being like the Soviet Union, because you know how they had their five and ten year plans, and then things always got changed? In my own lifetime I saw several different timelines for things that were supposed to occur and change. But as Greg noted, I've also heard of, from different people, that actually there is a HUGE push in the last few years.

But as Greg noted, I've also heard of, from different people, that actually there is a HUGE push in the last few years. It's like, \"It's CLOSE. It's CLOSE. Let's make things happen more quickly.\" CH: Mm hm. Svali: So I couldn't begin to guess whether that's an accurate timeline or not. I know what I was told. CH: I have a follow up question and that's it... GS: Go ahead. CH: ...and this will be it for me. I have recently, against my own resistance to doing so, investigated, started to investigate fringe matters, if you will. Among them, the upcoming date on the Mayan Calendar of 2012. Svali: Uh huh. CH: And as I've done this research, I've allowed myself just to be open to this information without believing anything I'm reading. One of the ideas that is presenting itself is that around 2012, not just according to the Mayan Calendar but many other theories out there, that we will be undergoing, as a planet, a revolutionary shift, if you will, of some kind or another. And I'm wondering in the back of my mind if there might be any kind of race against the clock on THAT scale, if you will - especially if we're talking about a potential spiritual warfare... Svali: Oh, yeah. CH: ...using your words in play here. Do you see a possible relation there? Svali: Yes, I do. And, 2012 IS an important year. But again, I was not told that the final Revealing would occur then. But I believe that probably... what will happen is that there will be events taking place that will help to set the stage. CH: Okay. Svali: But it's going to be... I was told... again, I'm telling you what I was told while a member of the group, so please take it with a grain of salt. As I know, these people aren't always honest or trustworthy - they are deceptive. But I was told that there would be an enormous economic collapse prior to the Revealing. That basically the stock market would destabilize. CH: Well, that appears to be already happening. Svali: Yeah. Yeah. And I was told it would make the Great Depression look like Sunday school. And at that time, it's going to... they're going to really be manipulating finances to bring about chaos, confusion, warfare, and then... But see, I don't like to be so negative.

Svali: Well, thank you! I appreciate that very much. But out of this chaos they said would come order. You see, the group believes that out of chaos comes order. CH: Well, I don't want to take any more time... GS: (cross talk) Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'd rather, you know, let things... Svali, these guys want to bring down this country financially, in whatever way possible. And right now, your voice is important in that. And Chris, I really appreciate you saying that, because we want to stop these guys! I mean, come on! Let's get the American people to get together and just put an end to this. We have a powerful group in numbers. We may not have the money, but we can take it back. And I don't want to be bullied by these kind of people. That's my feeling. Svali: Yeah. GS: Let me take another call. Uh, Harper in Canada. Harper? Go ahead. HP: Great, thanks Greg. And Svali, I read your expose when it came out on Suite101.com a few years ago, and I always wondered what happened to you, because you vanished from Suite 101. So it's great to hear about you. A couple quick questions, I'll make them real fast. First is the term Moriah Conquering Wind. I'd never heard that before or since I read it in your expose. I wondered if you could elaborate on that term a little bit. I also wanted to ask you if this cult, as far as you know, claims to or believes to derive any of its heritage from Atlantis or any other lost civilization. Okay? Svali: I'm not sure about the reference to Moriah (pronounced like \"Mariah\" Carey) you're describing, because Moriah is... is our name. But I certainly can address the second question. The Illuminati completely believe that Atlantis is real. They teach it to their children as part of the oral history. They believe that it was one of the greatest civilizations that ever existed, and one of the most advanced. What they teach... their take on it is that Atlantis was a great race of highly intelligent people who had a highly advanced faith, and who were highly enlightened. But what they teach the Illuminati children is that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_interview.txt:33:bc9fa526b4af", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14510, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_interview.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_interview", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "the second question.

They believe that it was one of the greatest civilizations that ever existed, and one of the most advanced. What they teach... their take on it is that Atlantis was a great race of highly intelligent people who had a highly advanced faith, and who were highly enlightened. But what they teach the Illuminati children is that then this prophet of the enemy, who was a prophet of God, came and foretold their destruction if they didn't change their ways. They were definitely Occultists. They were Luciferians on Atlantis. That was the religion. And in fact, a lot of the advances that Atlantis enjoyed was passed down to them through supernatural means... that is what I will say. So they laughed at the prophet. In fact they killed him. And, he... I guess sometime afterward, we were taught that a few inhabitants escaped, but that tragically the great city was lost. The Illuminati to this day mourn the loss of Atlantis, because they feel that these were... that the few survivors that left were among the great people who helped found the Free... what you would call the precursors of Illuminism. HP: One more quick question, if I may. GS: Go ahead. HP: And I wanted to ask you if you have any reason to believe that people, men and/or women at the top of the pyramid, so to speak, practice a kind of magic where they are kind of skipping through time, in other words... Svali: (excited cross talk) Oh! Oh! YES! Oh, without even being at the top... Oh, yes! HP: ...their body leaving, their soul or spirit leaving one body and coming and being born into another one, and therefore, you know, living through time. Svali: (excited cross talk) Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh, yes! Yes, All the time. In fact, see, now this, now I didn't go there in this interview. You start telling wackos, you start discussing things like that. But in the spiritual side, they very much teach things like time travel, traveling out of body, you know, psychic battling, things like that - things that cannot be explained by logic. And I saw things that I cannot explain through human intellect or reasoning, that were highly supernatural, and involved all of that... and more. HP: Okay, great. Pleasure to speak with you, Ma'am, and God bless you. Svali: Okay, God bless you too. GS: Okay, I think we have [Dave Wilcock](http://divinecosmos.com/about-david-wilcock) calling in.

It's good to talk with you. Yeah. DW: Yeah, I feel like you're an old friend. I've been reading your stuff for so long, and you share so willingly and openly about yourself. It's a real honor to be able to speak with you in person like this. Svali: Well, thank you! GS: All right, well Dave, you may have something you want to say to Svali. Go ahead. You have a question? DW: Sure. I think one of the things I'd really like to have covered here is [this]. You shared with me in an email recently about these stages of enlightenment that they try to guide people through? Svali: Yes. DW: I would like you to try to sketch out for people how the behavioral conditioning that's coming through the media, the movies and so forth might have affected them. In other words, what personality characteristics would you see in a person when they have been influenced by these teachings? How would the average person, who is not really a bad person, start to be leaning, if the Illuminati teachings were actually having an effect on them? What would they be like? What would start happening? Svali: Well, again, as I said, the average person is not going to be a member of the group... DW: Right. Svali: ...so the influence would be much less. But the media, I believe that... well, I KNOW. I don't believe, I KNOW that some of the media that we're seeing nowadays is specifically targeted towards teaching people their philosophy or goals. All you have to do is watch the children's cartoons on Saturday morning, and almost across the board you'll see morphing, power battles, occult. And that's intentional. Movies coming out. Basically, if a person is being influenced by their teaching, that person will learn to not trust their own instincts, their own feelings, their own body, their own perceptions. They will be looking outside for guidance. Second of all, they will be moving towards a heavily occultic worldview - that leaning upon the occult is heavily encouraged. All you have to do is watch Harry Potter! (Pause - laughs) You know? DW: Yeah, I mean, the whole idea that... Svali: (cross talk) I mean, not to slam one of those Potter movies, or the Matrix.

Right down with Morpheus being broken down with the injections, and they said that it's like hacking a computer. (bumper music starts) Svali: Yeah! That's an excellent [example...] GS: (cross talk) Okay, let's take a break. We'll come back with our final segment. A big finish on the Investigative Journal, with Svali, on the Republic Broadcasting Network. [commercial break - resume 54:21] GS: Okay, we're back with our final segment with Svali. She's telling us about her experiences... thirty years with this insidious group called the Illuminati, how deeply penetrated and infiltrated they are in our culture and our country. Svali, we talked about the higher levels, the mid-levels you were involved in as a head trainer. How low do they go? I said all along they're involved in gang stalking, the MK-Ultra program, infiltrating truth organizations, infiltrating groups that are trying to do good. How far down DO they go? Svali: Well, they go down to the sister group levels I mentioned. The sister groups have anywhere from, usually roughly around 30 members. And those are what a lot of people would consider the... what you would consider the satanic cults, with a high priest and priestess. That would be the local level, the lower level. But those people are also very active in their community. And so, they WILL be involved in intricate infiltrating activities when possible. Because to them, it's not infiltrating... it's helping. They think they're helping the group, or helping people by becoming a member and spreading the influence. GS: Let me squeeze in one more caller, Roger, a faithful listener. Roger, you're on the Investigative Journal. RG: Uh, yes. Thanks. I had so a big question and so little time that maybe I'll just squeeze it in... GS: We've got a couple minutes. Really try to work it in, Roger. RG: Yeah, uh, well, you will enjoy this first, and that is that I recall when Charlotte Izerbie (ph) was here on the local Clear Channel radio show. The host was, of course, dismissive of an Illumi-Nazi agenda. It was great to hear Charlotte say, \"You're telling me? My own father was a high-level\"... and she, of course, was a first or second-fiddle secretary at the department of Ed. And she said, \"You're telling me my own father on his deathbed", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:secret_societies__svali_interview.txt:36:affdcd33aa5a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14513, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "secret_societies__svali_interview.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "secret_societies__svali_interview", "chunk_index": 37, "text": "Yeah, uh, well, you will enjoy this first, and that is that I recall when Charlotte Izerbie (ph) was here on the local Clear Channel radio show.

And she said, \"You're telling me my own father on his deathbed was telling me, \"You go get 'em, girl,\" and he was one of 'em.\" GS: (Laughs) RG: So that was great. Anyway, my question was towards the philosophical / religious motivators, if you will, which you have been dwelling on. I've been trying to form it up into a more cohesive, integrated... GS: Try to make it quick, we're running out of time. Go ahead. RG: Yeah. To expose the ethos of the, you know, it's like the Neocons serve as the pseudo-intellectual rationale for the Illumi-Nazi agenda. And I don't presume that it turns on such fine distinctions, so much as it is a bare-knuckled lust for power. But, everybody has sort of a worldview that they use to justify their actions. And of course, it's a most un-conservative, humanistic social engineering agenda on a far larger scale. Now you mentioned about these people, basically, and it's as rare as hen teeth... GS: Quick, Roger... RG: ...yeah, to find somebody that's not oxymoronically both a spiritualist and an occultist, and also a, what do you call, a hardcore rationalist. Or maybe that's just [a] Republican assumption, right? Svali: (sighs) GS: (slight laughing in delivery): I know there was a question in there somewhere, Roger... RG: Yeah. GS: But anyway, thanks for calling. Let me, I've only got a minute. I've got to finish with Svali. Svali, tell us in your own words, you've got about a minute or two left here. You went forward, you came forward, (bumper music begins) you're now living a life completely away from them. What's your hopes of the future in our country right now? Svali: My hope is that people will realize that this is happening, and that they will start doing something about it - that they will start looking at it. Now again, we're talking about people who are mentally wealthy, but it won't be easy. But if people could rise up in prayer, and just say, \"THIS ISN'T OKAY\"... If people would become informed enough to want to learn more about it, be aware they exist... and then, possibly, PRAY. Pray that people will take action against the things that are happening. Because these people... GS: Okay, Svali, I'm... Svali: Okay. All right. GS: We're all out of time. We're going to end on that prayer. I really thank you for coming forward. You're very courageous.

This is the realization that the wisdom of the Divine can be discovered deep within you. There is a wide range of means that can facilitate the self-enlightenment experience. Though the means may vary, the intent behind the means is quite narrowly defined as the intent to expand into a state of integration whereby all aspects of your conscious self become increasingly aligned with your divine essence. There are three particular life principles that help to align your perspective with the perspective of divine essence and thus inspire the self-enlightenment experience. They are: 1) seeing the Divine in all; 2) nurturance of life; and 3) gratitude. When you apply these principles, a deeper meaning will be revealed to the seemingly random events of your life experience. **Seeing the Divine in All** This is the principle that the Divine is present and can be seen everywhere and in all manifestations of life. It is interwoven in all things like an intricate mosaic whose pieces adhere to the same wall, and are thus unified. However, it is not the picture that unifies the mosaic, but the wall upon which its pieces adhere. Similarly, the Divine paints a picture so diverse and seemingly unrelated that there appears to be no unification. Yet it is not the outward manifestations that unify. It is the inward center of divine energy that unifies all life. Seeing the Divine in all is the principle that all manifestations of life convey an expression of All That Is. It does not matter how far the unifying energy has been distorted; the Divine can be observed. It is the action of perceiving unification even when the outward manifestations appear random, distorted, or chaotic. The principle of seeing the Divine in all is the perception that life is perfect in its expression because it flows from perfection, and that no matter how divergent its manifestations are, all life is an extension of the Divine. In light of the obvious turmoil and intense destruction that are apparent on Earth, this is an outlook or perception that may seem naive. How can life in all its forms and expressions be perceived as optimal or perfect? This is the great paradox of life, and it cannot be reconciled with your mental or emotional capabilities. It can only be understood in the context of the soul, which is deathless, timeless, limitless, and sovereign. **Calling forth the divine perceptions of the soul is actualized through looking for both the inward and outward manifestations of the Divine.** It is not only that the Divine is found within you and every manifestation of life; it is also in itself the wholeness of all life. Thus, this principle of self-enlightenment calls for seeing the Divine in all", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:self-enlightenment.txt:0:a21648cfd981", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14516, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "self-enlightenment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "self-enlightenment", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "emotional capabilities. It can only be understood in the context of the soul, which is deathless, timeless, limitless, and sovereign. **Calling forth the divine perceptions of the soul is actualized through looking for both the inward and outward manifestations of the Divine.** It is not only that the Divine is found within you and every manifestation of life; it is also in itself the wholeness of all life. Thus, this principle of self-enlightenment calls for seeing the Divine in all its diverse forms of manifestation, as well as in the wholeness of life itself. **Nurturance of Life** Life, in this definition, is an individual's sovereign reality. It is subjective and impressionable. Life is the wholeness of experience flowing past the individual's field of perception in the present moment. Nurturance of life is the principle whereby an individual is in alignment with the natural expansion of intelligence inherent within all life. This alignment enhances the life energy that flows past the individual with the clear intent of gentle support. **It is the action of opening to the highest motive in all people and in all life and supporting the flow of this highest intention towards its ultimate expression.** In so doing, the action is performed without judgment, analysis, or attachment to outcome. It involves simply nurturing the highest energy that flows from all people and thus supporting the fullest expression of their deepest essence. This is a departure from the normal perception that nurturing support can only be granted when others are in alignment with your personal will and desires. When, instead, you view everything in your life as an integrated energy flowing as an expression of ever-expanding divine intelligence, all life is honored as an extension of the Divine. All people and all forms of life can be nurtured and supported to their highest expression. Energy is an element of life that is so subtly interwoven with form that it is one, in much the same manner as space and time are inextricably linked in union. Life energy is always in a state of becoming. It is never static or regressive in its natural state. You are very capable of nurturing this natural expansion of energy to forge new channels of expression and experience. There are many specific actions that can be taken to nurture life. Each soul can transform energy through a wide variety of means. Working through your body, your soul is able to collect and store energy and redirect its purpose or application. This transformation of energy can occur on both personal and universal levels of expression. That is, within an individual's field of awareness at any time, energy can be transformed to conform more to a vision of personal welfare or aligned with a vision of universal welfare and goodwill. One of the best methods to transform energy is through exploring one's belief system. **All beliefs", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:self-enlightenment.txt:1:0f3047251f8f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14517, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "self-enlightenment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "self-enlightenment", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "body, your soul is able to collect and store energy and redirect its purpose or application.

That is, within an individual's field of awareness at any time, energy can be transformed to conform more to a vision of personal welfare or aligned with a vision of universal welfare and goodwill. One of the best methods to transform energy is through exploring one's belief system. **All beliefs have energy systems that act like birthing chambers for the manifestation of your perceived reality.** Within these energy systems are currents that direct life experience. Your soul is aware of these currents either consciously or unconsciously and allows them to carry you into the realm of experience that exemplifies your core belief system. By cultivating beliefs that expand and transform energy, you are able to engage energy systems that are nurturing to life in all its myriad forms. When your beliefs are clearly defined as intentions, your life energy engages fully in the present moment. [Clarity of intention](https://www.weboflove.org/lifepurposeintentions) is essential to engaging the energy system of your core beliefs, and to allowing the nurturance of life to prevail in all activities. **Gratitude** If you are aware - or at least interested in having the awareness - of how perfectly the Divine supports your sovereign reality, there is a powerful and natural sense of gratitude that flows from you to the Divine. It is this wellspring of gratitude that opens the channel of support from the Divine to the individual and establishes a collaboration of purpose to transform the individual soul into a pure expression of divine essence. It is principally gratitude that opens you to connection and alignment with your divine essence. When you project gratitude, regardless of circumstance or condition, life becomes increasingly supportive. This feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. **Gratitude is an essential facet of love that opens you to redefine your purpose as a supportive extension of the Divine, rather than the whimsical outreach of fate or the exacting reaction of a mechanical, detached universe.** Establishing a relationship with the universe through the outflow of gratitude also attracts life experience that is deeply transformative - experience that is richly devoted to uncovering life's deepest meaning and most formative purpose. When you choose to align with divine essence and to live from this perspective as part of an ever-unfolding reality, you attract a natural state of harmony. This does not mean that your life is without problems or discomforts; rather it signifies a perception that there is an integral purpose in what life reveals. Life experience becomes meaningful to the extent that you choose to live in natural harmony with divine essence. When your personal reality flows in alignment with", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:self-enlightenment.txt:2:69f9e5127532", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14518, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "self-enlightenment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "self-enlightenment", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "When you choose to align with divine essence and to live from this perspective as part of an ever-unfolding reality, you attract a natural state of harmony. This does not mean that your life is without problems or discomforts; rather it signifies a perception that there is an integral purpose in what life reveals. Life experience becomes meaningful to the extent that you choose to live in natural harmony with divine essence. When your personal reality flows in alignment with divine essence, you create lasting joy and inner peace. It is the perspective of divine essence that all life is pure love in its fullest expression, and that in this single concept, all life is conceived and forever exists. This becomes the core belief from which all other beliefs arise. And as these beliefs expand outward, this core belief system emerges with a clear intent of supporting a fundamental perspective of seeing, nurturing, and appreciating the universe as the divine cradle from which all life is created and evolves. **These life principles are merely symbols represented in words and served to you as a potential recipe to stir awake the embers of light that tirelessly burn within.** There are no specific techniques or rituals that are required to invoke their power. They are simply perspectives. In a real sense, they are sacred intentions that attract experience that expands consciousness. They do not provide quick fixes or instant realizations. They are amplifiers of personal will and intention that clarify how one lives. Their profound transformative power is contained exclusively in the intent of their application. Through these principles of self-enlightenment, you can become a master of empowering your deeper self. When you apply these principles with clear intent, you have the tools to accelerate the emergence of divine essence. You can awaken the perspective, insights, and empowered abilities of your divine essence to create new realms of possibility and shape them as learning adventures that expand and transform consciousness. This is the underlying purpose of these principles, and perhaps the best reason to explore them. **For the full seven-page text of this writing on self-enlightenment, [click here](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers1) For a two-page summary of the second of this two-part essay, [click here](https://www.weboflove.org/divinewisdomunderstanding) For a free, inspiring online course and community based on these principles, [click here](https://www.insightcourse.net)** Principles of Self-Enlightenment - by [Wingmakers](https://www.weboflove.org/wingmakers#wingmakers)", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:self-enlightenment.txt:3:152d74f9b216", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14519, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network-all-media.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network-all-media", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Australian Pedophile Network Media Articles **Australian Pedophile Network Media Coverage Media Articles Reveal Destructive Pedophile Network** This list of media articles exposes the Australian pedophile network described in detail at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/sexabuse/australian-network).

Dr Reina Michaelson of The Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program (CSAPP) and Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnston today said they had been told by child sex abuse victims that former Victorian elected politicians and police members were involved in child pornography and prostitution.

The description covers events from 1995 until the time of this writing (2005). **Names have been changed.** [Graham Kennedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Kennedy) (The King of Comedy/The King of Television) is the person referred to by the pseudonym \"Gerald Oanasis\". * **Department of Education Protects Pedophile Teacher** In 1995 I started running Australia's first [child sexual abuse prevention program](http://home.vicnet.net.au/~csapp/about.html) in schools. This school-based program teaches children how to protect themselves from sexual abuse and what to do if someone tries to sexually abuse them. The program also teaches adults how they can best protect children under their care from sexual abuse. My assistant and I were at a particular high school in the northern region working with Year 9 boys. We received a note written anonymously by one of the boys asking \"What do you do if you get raped by a teacher and no one will believe you? What happens if you get raped and you enjoy it?\" Later during that day we were asked exactly the same question by a boy who was flushed red with embarrassment. I replied \"Talk to the Student Welfare Coordinator\", to which he replied \"What if he is the one who won't believe you?\" I emphasized that it is important to keep telling until someone believes you. During the day my assistant and I noticed the strange behaviour of a particular teacher, called Dick Newman. Later that afternoon I learnt that the car I had been driving had been rammed in the school's car-park. Witnesses reported that the car had been rammed deliberately by a man who then drove off very quickly. The local police were called and ran a licence check on the car and discovered that the number-plate was fake. They then took photos of the crime scene using the school's camera. Later, **when it was revealed that a teacher was under suspicion of sexually abusing the children at the school and then organising the ramming of my car to intimidate me, the photos went \"missing\", and no further action was taken.** **Dick Newman was the only person at the school who knew my car, as he had taken it upon himself to show me to my car to give me directions to the shops during a break in classes.** It was organised that the boys in Year 9 would be interviewed in order to find the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:1:88f8289fec44", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14526, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "children at the school and then organising the ramming of my car to intimidate me, the photos went \"missing\", and no further action was taken.** **Dick Newman was the only person at the school who knew my car, as he had taken it upon himself to show me to my car to give me directions to the shops during a break in classes.** It was organised that the boys in Year 9 would be interviewed in order to find the victims and give them appropriate support. Three people (including myself, my assistant and a counsellor from a sexual assault centre) were responsible for conducting the interviews. At the completion of the interviews, there were concerns for approximately 12 of the boys. These concerns related specifically to sexual assault by a teacher at the school. However, by this stage (over a week had passed since the initial program) it was clear that the boys had been threatened. For example, when I interviewed the boy who had asked the questions about sexual abuse by a teacher and not being believed, he huddled into a foetal position, started crying, and said he could not tell me what happened. When I asked him why he couldn't tell me, he replied that he had been threatened with his life. His best friend told me he would never tell what had happened. Some time after this, we organised a theatre company performance for the students (on the topic of sexual abuse). While the children were seated and waiting for the play to begin, Dick Newman made an unscheduled visit to the hall. He proceeded to stand in front of each of the boys we had identified as potential victims and stare them down. The boys, who had been happy and laughing in the excitement of waiting for the play to begin, went grey with fear. Finally, I stood in front of Dick Newman so that he could not intimidate the boys any further. I was then told no further action would be taken as the boys had not named the offender. **Program Infiltrated** I was the recipient of a very prestigious national award for Community Service. One of the judges was a well-connected government official (Ron Snide), and another was the General Manager (Bob Sisterly) of one of the major Australian television networks (Network X). After winning this award, Bob Sisterly approached me and said that he had never heard of this terrible crime (child sexual abuse) before meeting me. He said wanted to help me get my program into every school in Victoria within five years and said he had the money and the connections to do this. He said he would raise half a million dollars in six-weeks and have it matched within 6-months. He said that he and Ron Snide would set my program up as an independent organisation and that they would", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:2:a0b32f454a40", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14527, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "he had never heard of this terrible crime (child sexual abuse) before meeting me.

He said he would raise half a million dollars in six-weeks and have it matched within 6-months. He said that he and Ron Snide would set my program up as an independent organisation and that they would establish a Board of Management consisting of all of their powerful and influential friends. Ron Snide would become President of the organisation and Bob Sisterly, Vice-President. I agreed to Bob Sisterly's proposal as it sounded as if he would enable the program to receive substantial funding and therefore be able to reach many more children within Victoria, and across Australia. **I did not consider for a second that Bob Sisterly and Ron Snide could have been deceiving me in order to get control of, and ultimately, to destroy the child sexual abuse prevention program that I had developed.** The Board members and supporters that they brought to the organisation were very powerful and from the highest echelons of society. These included the Editor-in Chief of a major Australian newspaper, the former head of a child-focussed service club, the head of the largest agricultural society in Victoria, the partner from a well-known law firm, an extremely wealthy businessman and former Network X board member, the head of a well-known accounting firm, the head of a successful advertising company, and others. **Despite having such wealth and powerful connections, in the two-year period that they served on the Board they organised only one donation of $25,000. The board members subsequently despised the donor and ostracised him from their community** (which at the time I thought was incredibly ungrateful!). This is compared with over $200,000 my family and I raised doing the fundraising ourselves in the same time period! Furthermore, my efforts to secure funding were being actively sabotaged. For example, after an interview on the Channel 9 'Today' show (not Network X), I was contacted by a well-known multi-national company who said that they would like to fund my program. This well-known company was located in Sydney, and as Bob Sisterly frequently went to Sydney, I asked if he would have a meeting with them on behalf of our organisation. He agreed. However, when he returned from the meeting, he said for me not to have much hope and not to contact them for six months while they sorted out a new tax issue. I found this very odd, as they had been so keen to fund the organisation when I had spoken to them. I phoned the woman whom I had spoken to, and she confirmed my suspicions.

She had been at the meeting and Bob Sisterly had told the company not to bother funding us, as \"the organisation won't be around in six months\". Needless to say, we did not receive the funding. During this time period, I was without any income for four months. Many other people would have quit and sought other employment, however, I believed passionately in my cause and did not give up, much to the chagrin of Bob Sisterly. On one occasion he said to me \"You have given so much to this cause in your life, why don't you just give up? You have achieved more good in your short life than many do in a long life-time. Why don't you retire down in the country (I was 28 years old). Go on, just give up\". When I replied that I would never give up, he stormed away! I was confused by this behaviour, but as I trusted him I did not think too much more about it at the time. The Board members achieved one other \"in-kind\" donation. It was the use of a Honda CRV vehicle. I appreciated the use of the vehicle while I had it (approximately 18 months). However, I later discovered that the head of the company that donated it, a close friend of Ron Snide, had just been convicted of child sex offences. These offences included the production of child pornography. **Ron Snide organised a meeting with Tom Fatsky, the CEO of a major charitable trust and personal friend of his and other members of the Board. At that meeting I was amazed when Tom asked me \"Do you ever think that by preventing children from having sexual relationships with adults that you are actually HARMING them?\" ** I replied by citing the research that strongly indicates adult-child sexual relationships are harmful to children, but he had switched his mind off to my argument. He then stated that in 100 years or so it will be revealed that such relationships are not harmful but that what I was doing was harmful to children. I was certainly taken aback and Ron said \"Don't worry, Tom just thinks on a very high intellectual plane. High above yours\". Needless to say, we didn't get funding from Ron Snide's very good friend after all. **Meeting with Very Powerful Politician** After winning the award, I had a meeting with a very powerful state politician, Greg Neckett.

I was certainly taken aback and Ron said \"Don't worry, Tom just thinks on a very high intellectual plane. High above yours\". Needless to say, we didn't get funding from Ron Snide's very good friend after all. **Meeting with Very Powerful Politician** After winning the award, I had a meeting with a very powerful state politician, Greg Neckett. At that time, Greg Neckett was the most powerful person in the state. As well as being politically powerful he also had key business interests, including in the media. When I was first introduced to him, he was staring at me quite sleazily. After he asked what work I do, and my response \"child abuse prevention\", he would not make eye contact at all and sought to exclude me from the meeting in a very bullying manner. It was well-known that Greg Neckett was a serious domestic violence offender, and that his wife was frequently being admitted to shelters in secret. However, given the power and status of Mr. Neckett, the issue was never raised in the mainstream media. **I was later to be informed by a very reliable and trusted source from the child welfare field that there is a file containing serious child sex offences (against boys) by Greg Neckett, but because of his enormous power in Victoria, the police would not act on it.** I also discovered from a former sex worker that Greg Neckett frequently paid St. Kilda boy sex workers for sex, and that one of these boys \"talked too much to the wrong people and ended up dead with an 'accidental' heroin overdose\". It was also alleged that Greg Neckett intentionally abused the boys in unusual situations (for example, in a helicopter) so that if it ever got out, the boys' testimonies would seem unbelievable. This of-course, is exactly the same strategy used by offenders in the U.S child-care centre cases. Interestingly, Greg Neckett has recently commissioned a statue of himself - as a gargoyle. Later I met with another politician (from the same political party) who told me that \"Greg Neckett is *really* into that (child sex abuse)\". This same politician told me that in the late 1980's and early 1990's, the police were \"getting too close to the truth, too close to people in high positions of power who are also pedophiles\" and so the unit that had been established to investigate organised pedophilia was shut down. (Soon after a pedophile police officer was put in charge of investigating these offences to ensure that the truth never got out and that this high-ranking network of offenders would never get caught). **Network X Produces Pornography** One day I was working on a computer at Network X. As I was working, Bob Sisterly approached my computer and put a floppy disk in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:5:00cfafddf69b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14530, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "also pedophiles\" and so the unit that had been established to investigate organised pedophilia was shut down. (Soon after a pedophile police officer was put in charge of investigating these offences to ensure that the truth never got out and that this high-ranking network of offenders would never get caught). **Network X Produces Pornography** One day I was working on a computer at Network X. As I was working, Bob Sisterly approached my computer and put a floppy disk in the machine. He said \"Look at this\" and proceeded to bring up images of pornography involving humans and Sesame Street characters. I was very embarrassed and did not know how to react. I asked \"Where did you get that?\" and he replied \"Oh, someone put it together here\", indicating that Network X was producing pornography. I was later to discover that Network X is also producing child pornography and is, in fact, a cult-owned and run television station. I was also later to discover that Bob Sisterly is a passionate member of a cult. **Bob Sisterly introduces me to Mr. Television** After winning the abovementioned award, I was invited to go on one of the morning television shows on Network X. (This was before my association with Bob Sisterly. Ironically, after my association with Bob Sisterly, Network X did not do any promotion of my work at all!) It is hosted by one of the most famous and longest serving television personalities in Australia, Ernie Old. I was asked to prepare a number of questions that Ernie would ask me. I prepared very straight-forward questions that focussed on the work, so I was quite shocked when he glared at me and said \"Are you doing this because it happened to you?\". I was also stunned when he refused to allow the phone number of my organisation to be presented on the air for donations. When I later became closely associated with Network X Bob Sisterly would often say to me \"You know, Ernie Old really likes you. He *really* likes you!\" This surprised me because my experience of Ernie Old had been the exact opposite of that. (Interestingly, Bob Sisterly also frequently said to me \"Greg Neckett (the very powerful politician) really likes me since I started helping you. He has me sit next to him at all of the formal functions we attend now\". This was indeed true, Greg Neckett, Bob Sisterly and Ron Snide were all the best of friends.) **After my experience with Network X, I subsequently discovered that in the late 1980's Ernie Old was frozen out of the television industry due to allegations of his involvement in the production of child pornography. Although his alleged involvement in this activity was well-publicisized at the time, he was never charged and about a year later he joined Network X. ** Since then he has continued to play", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:6:bf331177b96c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14531, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "Neckett, Bob Sisterly and Ron Snide were all the best of friends.) **After my experience with Network X, I subsequently discovered that in the late 1980's Ernie Old was frozen out of the television industry due to allegations of his involvement in the production of child pornography. Although his alleged involvement in this activity was well-publicisized at the time, he was never charged and about a year later he joined Network X. ** Since then he has continued to play a significant role in the production of child pornography in Australia. One contact who works on the set of the morning program hosted by Ernie Old finds the work to be very distressing as other on-air talent are very open about their pedophilia. This contact is disgusted, as his sister is a victim of child sex offences, however he does not want to publicly disclose the information as he will lose his job. In addition to the above, I am now in contact with a boy who was paid $2000 a night to have sex with Ernie Old, from the ages of 15 - 18 years. **Introduction to the Pedophile Police Unit** There is a specialised police unit in Victoria that, since the early 1990's, is responsible for investigating all child sex offences involving multiple-victims, offences committed by teachers, as well as child pornography offences. I had a meeting with the head of this unit, Detective Senior Sergeant Nick Flanagan, and was very surprised when the first thing he said to me was \"Does Greg Neckett know about your program? Greg Neckett should know about your program\". I found this a very odd thing for him to say as an opening statement, and especially so, given the information known about Greg Neckett's alleged sexual abuse of boys. I thought it impossible for this police officer not to know of these things, given his specialist role. **Relationship between Nick Flanagan and Bob Sisterly** I subsequently became aware of the \"unusual\" relationship between Nick Flanagan (police) and Bob Sisterly (Network X). I invited Nick Flanagan to do a presentation for the board members. Ron Snide was \"so impressed\" by Nick Flanagan that he wanted to invite him onto the Board of Management (along with all the other pedophile members). I later discovered that Nick Flanagan and Bob Sisterly, although pretending not to know each other at the Board meeting, have a very cosy relationship indeed. Specifically, a couple of years ago, a senior staff member at Network X was charged with procuring children for prostitution. At the time, **the wife of a detective working in Nick Flanagan's unit (Jan Pummell) received a very sudden and significant promotion to become Bob Sisterly's Personal Assistant.

It was a clear conflict of interest and deeply comprising to the investigation. ** Jan Pummell's husband should not have been involved in investigating Network X staff for their involvement in procuring children for prostitution or any other child sex offences connected to Network X. However, with the appointment of the detective's wife to Personal Assistant of the General Manager of Network X, it was guaranteed that no other information pertaining to Network X's illegal activities involving sex offences against children would be pursued by Nick Flanagan or his unit. And Jan Pummell enjoyed her unexpected and incredibly well-paid, new position at Network X. **Pedophile Police Called in to Investigate Pedophile Teacher and Other Offences** In 1999 fresh allegations were made against Pedophile Teacher, Dick Newman. This time, teenage girls reported that Dick Newman approaches students and asks them to meet him after school to meet 'Winston the Baseball Bat'. They indicated that 'Winston' was Dick Newman's penis. They reported that other students were very affected by this behaviour, and some had taken to writing warnings to each-other on the desks, such as \"If Newman asks you to meet Winston, don't do it - its his dick!!\". At last, Newman had been named and the victims were prepared to come forward. Newman admitted to these offences and received 5 sessions of counselling. I then discovered that Newman had conveniently taken up a temporary position in a country school (like a priest being moved from parish to parish when things get too hot). The principal at the original school had not told the new school the circumstances surrounding his transfer and had instead said \"Poor Dick, he's had a difficult time lately\". I later discovered that this Principal was an expert liar and had gone over and above the call of duty in protecting this pedophile teacher. At this new country school it was not long before further allegations of child abuse by Newman came out. Incidents of verbal abuse, such as calling students \"f--king stupid\" were revealed, as well as physical assaults, such as dragging students out of the classroom and throwing them on the floor. In another physical assault, Newman grabbed the 12-year-old boy by the neck and held him by his neck against a wall. Newman admitted to the latter assault, wrote a letter of apology and provided financial compensation for the loss of the necklace. **With Newman being named and various offences being admitted to, I reported his behaviour for criminal investigation to Nick Flanagan's unit.

It also provided the opportunity for the 1995 offences to be re-investigated. However, Nick Flanagan interviewed only 2 of the 12 boys on the list from 1995, and reported to me that as the first two boys did not disclose anything, the others would not be interviewed. ** **In relation to the offences against the teenage girls, Flanagan said that, at 15 years of age, the girls were \"too young\", and he did not want to distress the girls' families by bringing up the topic of child sexual abuse.** Therefore, these offences by Newman would not be investigated either. I could not believe what I was hearing! Child sex offences are offences because they happen against children! And at 15, the victims were hardly at the young end of the age-spectrum! It was a completely nonsensical reason for not investigating Dick Newman. As for the physical assaults, Flanagan said that he was not responsible for such investigations, so those cases would not be pursued either. He said \"You do understand, don't you!\" (it was not a question) and I replied that I did not. However, Nick Flanagan was not prepared to discuss the situation amicably and Dick Newman evaded investigation, by both the police in the unit established to investigate such offences, and by the Department of Education. **Further Dealings with the Pedophile Police** Whilst at the country school (Goldtown), disclosures of child sexual abuse by other offenders were made by many children. The disclosures centred on two offenders in the town. The specialised unit arrived to \"investigate\". However, the main victim of the sexual abuse, Sammy, a 12-year-old girl, did not attend school that day. Sammy did arrive after school that day on her bike, and her face was visibly disfigured. I was told by her best friend that she had been bashed, but her friend would not tell me who did this to Sammy. Her smashed-in face was warning enough for all of the children. **The police later went to her house, where she fainted upon seeing them. She did not disclose any abuse at all. Despite the fact that her face was visibly disfigured and swollen from a recent assault, the police did not pursue the matter further.** **The specialised police unit totally destroyed any chance of the truth being revealed and the victims receiving the justice they deserved.** For example, they left children waiting all day to be interviewed and did not end up interviewing many", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:9:8ca62e562244", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14534, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "went to her house, where she fainted upon seeing them. She did not disclose any abuse at all. Despite the fact that her face was visibly disfigured and swollen from a recent assault, the police did not pursue the matter further.** **The specialised police unit totally destroyed any chance of the truth being revealed and the victims receiving the justice they deserved.** For example, they left children waiting all day to be interviewed and did not end up interviewing many of them, including witnesses to attempted child-rapes. They did interview one 12-year-old victim (Lucy) and totally intimidated her. When the girl indicated that the police didn't believe her the first time she told them what had happened to her, one officer lent right over the top of her, pointed his finger directly in her face and hissed \"Don't say that! You don't know that!\". I was shaking, and I was an adult sitting next to the girl! As she walked out of the interview room, the officer said in voice loud enough for the girl to hear, \"We have serious concerns about the truth of what this girl is saying\". It had the desired effect, Lucy burst into tears and said \"The police don't believe me. I don't want to keep going\". The Welfare Co-ordinator, who was also in the room during the interview, and who is also an experienced sexual assault counsellor and child protection officer, said to me \"That wasn't an interview. That was designed to stop a child from talking\". The police did not pursue the case any further on the following grounds: No-one would believe Sammy if she disclosed the abuse in the future, as she hadn't disclosed the first time. (The fact that she had been bashed would not be seen as relevant to her hesitancy to disclose?!) Lucy had led all the children on (to make up \"stories\" of sexual abuse for fun, even though the children were visibly traumatised). **In relation to the sexual abuse of a boy, they said, \"men try to touch other men's penises after football matches all the time\" so it was not worthy of pursuing. ** And finally, the police claimed that there was not enough evidence - this is despite the fact that there were witnesses to the attempted rapes of the children, and the testimonies of many victims provided significant corroboration. Also, many adults reported having been sexually abused by the same offenders when they were children, but the police refused to interview these adults. **The Case is Stonewalled by the Pedophile Police** The police recommended that the Welfare Co-ordinator make reports to the Child Protection Department as they stated it was a \"protective issue, not a criminal one\". The Welfare Co-ordinator did this, but weeks passed and the children were not interviewed, and she inquired as to why. She was informed that the Child Protection", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:10:253e10829223", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14535, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "been sexually abused by the same offenders when they were children, but the police refused to interview these adults. **The Case is Stonewalled by the Pedophile Police** The police recommended that the Welfare Co-ordinator make reports to the Child Protection Department as they stated it was a \"protective issue, not a criminal one\". The Welfare Co-ordinator did this, but weeks passed and the children were not interviewed, and she inquired as to why. She was informed that the Child Protection Department would not be taking any further action \"on the advice of the police\". So, **after telling the Welfare Co-ordinator to take the case to Child Protection for investigation, the Police effectively stone-walled the investigation by advising Child Protection not to investigate.** **Relationship between Bob Sisterly and Nick Flanagan** During the two-year association I had with Bob Sisterly, Don Snide and the Board of Management that they had established, I trusted them implicitly. Although incidents occurred that often left me confused, and often baffled, and of-course, frequently without funding, I continued to trust them. Bob Snide always said to me \"I'm here to help\". It was his favourite saying. I therefore reported all of the events that had occurred at the northern secondary school and the Goldtown school, to Bob Sisterly. Sisterly then told me that he knew Detective Senior Sergeant Nick Flanagan (in contrast to his earlier pretence of not knowing him at all!). He stated that Nick Flanagan is a \"really good bloke\". However, when I spelt out the stonewalling of the Goldtown case, Bob Sisterly's face twitched and he became visibly uncomfortable. I had never seen Bob Sisterly react in this way. It was soon after this that very strange events began to occur. On one occasion Bob Sisterly was on the phone to his \"boss\" (of Network X). When his boss realized that I was present he began to speak aggressively, not knowing that I could hear him. He was saying \"put her on the phone to me, I'll sort her out!\". Of course, I found this all to be very strange as I had never even met this man before. However, when Bob Sisterly apologised on behalf of his boss, I accepted it and put it out of my mind - again, because at that time I trusted him. I had recently purchased a very cheap country property that I planned to use as a retreat for abused children. I invited the board members to view the site. None attended, however Bob Sisterly said that he wanted to go - alone with me. He said he had set aside the whole day for it and was putting me under enormous pressure to go with him. I felt very uncomfortable about it as he had insisted on a number of details. **First, it had to be a complete secret. I wasn't even allowed to tell my", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:11:b317c4480b9e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14536, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "retreat for abused children.

I felt very uncomfortable about it as he had insisted on a number of details. **First, it had to be a complete secret. I wasn't even allowed to tell my parents that I was going, let alone where I was going.** Second, he had to drive. I wasn't even allowed to drive my car to the station and for us to drive together from there (my car had to stay at my unit car-park). And third, Bob Sisterly insisted on picking me up from my unit before day-break. This was unnecessary as the trip only takes two-hours. Of course, all of these bizarre \"conditions\" and the huge pressure that Bob Sisterly was putting me under made me feel extremely wary. With my parents' help I made up an excuse at the very last minute and did not go. However, if I had done as Bob Sisterly had wanted and if anything had happened to me that day, I could have gone missing without a trace. **Sammy's relationship to Network X** Sammy, the 12-year-old-girl from Goldtown, was a main victim of the sexual abuse being perpetrated against children in the town. She referred to the offender (a man in his 60's) as her \"boyfriend\", and her close friends knew of the sexual activities between her and the man. The offender also happened to be the best friend of her father. **I was asked to provide support to Sammy, and in one session it became apparent that Sammy's personality had been totally fragmented.** In her words, she was like \"a house with mirrors everywhere, smashed into broken bits\". It was later that I learned about the use by [powerful secret societies](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) of [trauma-based mind control](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse), sexual abuse and satanic ritual to force children to create \"alter personalities\". Other information from Sammy has led me to believe that she has been subjected to all these forms of abuse. Sammy also told me that her relative takes her to Queensland (Australia) \"whenever I want\" and that she can get \"whatever I want, too\". It was only later that I learned of the immense significance of what Sammy was telling me. Sammy's relative is a Board member of Network X, who is based in Queensland. It is my belief that Sammy was being used in Network X's production of child pornography, both in Victoria and Queensland. Here is another example of the police's failure to investigate a case with ominous connections to Network X.

In particular, the police unit that has been established specifically and exclusively to investigate such cases well and truly ensured that this case would go nowhere. **After two sessions with Sammy I was told that the school had \"received complaints\" that I had \"brainwashed the children\" and the support sessions were terminated.** **More Connections - the Cult in Goldtown** I was to learn later that there is a Satanic cult operating in Goldtown. I learned this from two independent sources. One was from a Christian woman who was raised in the town and who since had moved elsewhere. The other was from an adult survivor of the cult, Mick. The Satanic cult is very powerful within the town, and was headed up by the most powerful and influential families of the town. One of the members owned and operated the photographic studio in the town. Furthermore, Greg Neckett, the powerful politician mentioned previously, has significant \"business operations\" extremely close to Goldtown, and he was driven (by his driver) to this location every week. **Mick's Experiences** Mick was introduced to the satanic cult as a very young child by an extended relative. Mick informed me of many experiences he was subjected to as a child in this cult. From everything that I have been told by Mick, the cult appears to be the Ordo Templis Orientus (Illuminati), operating in Australia. Mick now suffers from MPD/DID but has survived his experiences remarkably well considering the traumas he has been through. As a child Mick was forced to attend blood-rituals, where animals and small children were sacrificed and their blood and organs consumed. Mick was required to clean up the blood after these rituals. The children and babies were street children or were taken from orphanages, so that they could not be traced and no-one would know, or care, if they went missing. The rituals were spoken in Latin and were clearly satanic. The rituals took place at various locations, including Goldtown. Mick and other children would be driven to the rituals in the boots of cars. The members of the cult were extremely powerful members of society. There were numerous politicians (mainly from the conservative party). These people would often speak of important events before they would actually occur. Mick was also sexually abused by Gerald Oanasis, the famous television personality and professional partner of Ernie Old. Mick was one of the many children who were used to \"host\" parties of the cult members.** At these parties the children acted as waiters and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:13:52741270735c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14538, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "boots of cars.

These people would often speak of important events before they would actually occur. Mick was also sexually abused by Gerald Oanasis, the famous television personality and professional partner of Ernie Old. Mick was one of the many children who were used to \"host\" parties of the cult members.** At these parties the children acted as waiters and were naked. Many of the adults, but not all, would wear masks at these parties. After the food was served the adults would have sex with the children. **Children who tried to escape were killed, often in front of the other children in order to control the children through fear. Once Mick and another child had tried to escape but were caught. The other child was murdered by having her head smashed open with a rock. Her body was then dumped in a nearby mineshaft. Mick was spared the same fate, as he was told that he was the \"chosen one\", selected to carry on the traditions of the group. Mick was forced to participate in the production of child pornography, including movies as well as still photographs. This involved sexual activity with other children as well as adults. He would get paid a small amount for his sexual \"services\", while the relative who brought him to the events would get paid a large amount of money. As he got older, Mick was no longer used for sexual purposes by the group but was required to recruit new younger children. When he was old enough (in his 20's), Mick was able to escape the group but they continue to contact him with threats. **Bob Sisterly's \"Religion\"** During my association with Bob Sisterly I got to know him quite well. One day he informed me of his \"religious\" beliefs. These were the opposite of mine (as I am a Christian). I was also informed by one of his colleagues in the media industry that Bob's \"religion\" is \"weird s--t\". At the time I had not heard of the [Illuminati](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali) and it is only now that I realise that Bob Sisterly is an active and dedicated member of the Australian Illuminati. **The symbolism used in Network X promotional material is totally consistent with that of the Illuminati (Order Templis Orientus), such as the key colours - blue and gold, and key imagery involving flames.** **Telephone Interference and Intimidation Begins ** **It was after reporting the events at Goldtown to Bob Sisterly that unusual events began to occur.** My phone line began clicking, and the voice-mail service recorded the sounds of a tape clicking over (note that voice-mail does not use tapes for recording so the tape was from another source).

Two of my organisations' staff members had their cars broken into on the same night. In one car, the book \"The Clocks\" by Agatha Christie was on the front seat. The book is the story of a series of murders where the only evidence left at each murder scene is a clock. On the front seat of the other staff member's car was a broken clock. Nothing was stolen from either car. On one occasion I purposely said over the phone that I kept all of my files in the backyard shed (this was not true, I just wanted to test the security of the telephone line). Soon after, the back shed was broken into. **Board Members Propose a Name-Change ** At one board meeting, Harry Napkin, the head of the Agricultural Society, proposed to launch the organisation, despite the fact that it had been operating for nearly two years. He had three ideas. The first was that a rodeo would be organised, and whenever a rider fell from their horse or bull, money would be donated. Thus, it would be \"money for every bruised butt\". The second proposal was to organise a \"beauty pageant\" for 12-year-old girls. There would be an award given for \"the prettiest girl on the shiniest pony\". A photo of her on her horse would be used as a centre-page-spread in the leading newspaper (courtesy of the Editor-In-Chief contact). The third proposal was to have a photo of sexually abused children in an \"animal birthing centre\". This photo would also be published in the leading newspaper. Harry Napkin also proposed a name-change. He proposed to change the name of the organisation to 'Shine'. I did not want to do this, and the members of the Board put me under incredible pressure to adopt this name-change. **It was only later that I learnt about the Illuminati connections and the significance of their symbolism and language. 'Shine' is a very significant Illuminati term.** **Realisation Dawns** It was at this point that I realised that something was dreadfully wrong. I rejected all of the proposed ideas (very politely, but firmly). I also called for all outstanding Criminal Records Checks to be undertaken immediately. **The Criminal Records Check had been designed only to identify whether a person had committed any sexual assaults against children or had any involvement in related offences, such as child pornography. **Therefore, if a person had smoked marijuana in their university days, this would not be revealed", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:15:698cab214480", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14540, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "point that I realised that something was dreadfully wrong.

This was a policy that I had insisted on right from the start (nearly two years ago), however Bob Sisterly had given numerous excuses every time I had requested his. He even went so far as to suggest that he would organise it \"on the sly\" using his \"contacts in the force\". I did not pursue that option and instead gave the Board members two weeks to complete their forms and submit them. **Bob Sisterly, while initially embracing the policy at the start, ultimately refused to submit a Criminal Records Check.** **The Significance of Shine ** I discovered that there is an Australian Internet-based group called 'Shine'. The site includes a membership section where members are able to exchange photos etc, including \"S&M\" and \"hard-core Ernie Old style\". It is a child pornography club that operates similar to the notorious Wonderland club. I noted the code-names used by the operators of the Shine site, one of which was Natas (Satan backwards). I went to the Network X site and entered a secret section on the site (which members of the public would never know about). It asked for the password, so I typed in Natas, which took me to another level. It then asked for the next level password, which I didn't have. The computer then went berserk and was almost impossible to turn off. I managed to do so only by pulling out all of the connections. Soon after this, the Internet site for Network X was shut down and remained shut down for a number of months, which is rather unusual given that Network X is such a large company. Later that year, the Department of Education put on a concert involving thousands of children. They chose to call it 'Shine'. This was an interesting choice of title, given my experience and other people's experiences of the Department of Education protecting pedophile teachers. A further interesting connection was that Bob Sisterly and Ron Snide organised a meeting between us and the senior managers of the Department of Education. When we all met, the men acted as if they did not know each other and were meeting for the first time (exchanging business cards, etc). However, when the men thought I was gone (I was in fact standing just out of their sight), it was very clear that they not only knew each other,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:16:5f7e22949151", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14541, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "A further interesting connection was that Bob Sisterly and Ron Snide organised a meeting between us and the senior managers of the Department of Education.

They were saying things such as \"Great to see you again, mate!\" and slapping each other on the back! **Escape from Bob Sisterly and the Pedophile Board** After I discovered what was going on (at least, I started to discover what was going on) I knew I had to break away from Bob Sisterly, Ron Snide and the people they had put on the Board of Management. The AGM was coming up and I organised for my family to attend. We did this secretly, as we knew that the phone lines were being monitored. On the night of the AGM, the board members were visibly shocked when they saw that members of my family were attending. **It transpired that, rather than undertake a Criminal Records Check, the members of the Board had planned to resign on the spot. This served two purposes. One, they avoided having to undergo the Criminal Records Check. Two, the organisation would effectively fold as there would be no-one to take up the Board member positions. This is exactly what Bob Sisterly had wanted from the beginning, but especially since I had begun to uncover the corrupt pedophile police activities and the crimes in Goldtown.** However, as my family had attended the meeting, they were able to take up the positions on the Board, and the organisation did not fold. On the surface, the meeting was very amicable and civilized, Bob Sisterly tried to remain calm, but he ended up storming out of the meeting half-an-hour early. **Mother Receives Death Threat from Bob Sisterly** My family and I all waited for half-an-hour after the meeting had closed (to recover!) before leaving. We had all come in different cars, and my mother had parked her car in a nearby car park. She walked to her car by herself. We had not learnt to be security-conscious at that stage. As she approached her car she was surprised to see Bob Sisterly there (he had left the meeting half an hour early). He then approached her and said **\"You had better watch yourself. If you don't, someone might just run over you\". **He then drove off very suddenly and another board member followed in a different car. My mother and father told me about this incident, which had left my mother very shaken.

My mother and father told me about this incident, which had left my mother very shaken. Soon after I received a message from Bob Sisterly saying \"I only want to help\". I was infuriated at this man, so I phoned his office and left a message with his Personal Assistant, Jan Pummell (I didn't know the significance of her husband's relationship with Bob Sisterly and Network X at this time) saying \"Bob has said he just wants to help me. Could you please tell him that it would be helpful if he could undertake the Criminal Records Check that he has avoided for so long. After all, it is designed to only reveal if the person has committed sex offences against children or related offences, like the production of child pornography. Oh, could you also tell him it would be very helpful if he did not threaten members of my family. Death threats against my family really aren't helpful. If you could pass this message on, that would be great. Thanks\". Soon after leaving this message, my mother received a letter from Bob Sisterly. In the letter he stated that he was only joking when he told her to watch out or she'd end up being run over. Yeah, real funny joke. **Report to Department of Education - Complaints and Investigation Unit** After these experiences I made a complaint to the Complaints and Investigations Unit of the Department of Education. My complaint related to the conduct of teacher Dick Newman, which amounted to repeated acts of misconduct against students, and the police investigation at Goldtown. Interestingly, the head of the Department of Education Complaints and Investigations Unit, Paul Gibbins, was at the very first meeting I had to outline my complaint. It was after this meeting that the material, which I had been assured by Peter Gibbins would remain strictly confidential, was given to Nick Flanagan and Edith Ireland (who subsequently paid a visit to the new President of the Board in an effort to pressure me to drop the complaint). Paul Gibbins then left that posting, but \"coincidentally\" was brought back to it to finish off the case involving Dick Newman. **Paul Gibbins wrote a letter to me exonerating Dick Newman on all counts \"because the witnesses (which I had provided) cannot substantiate your claims\". As you know, of the eight witnesses that I had provided to corroborate the case, only one had been contacted - and she re-confirmed the concerns about Dick Newman.** In fact, she stated that she was amazed that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:18:046e990bedf6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14543, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "left that posting, but \"coincidentally\" was brought back to it to finish off the case involving Dick Newman. **Paul Gibbins wrote a letter to me exonerating Dick Newman on all counts \"because the witnesses (which I had provided) cannot substantiate your claims\".

She was shocked to discover that Dick Newman had been exonerated and that the Department of Education had LIED about her testimony! After I did the telephone round of the witnesses I had listed and learnt that only one had been contacted, I phoned Paul Gibbins to ask how many of the witnesses had in fact been contacted. He said that he didn't know but that he would call me back \"within 24 hours\". Needless to say, I did not receive a return phone call from pedophile-protecting Paul Gibbins. I truly believe that if the parents of children attending Victorian schools knew the extent to which pedophile-teachers are being protected by the Department of Education, they would boycott the education system altogether. And if they knew the suffering that some children and families have had to endure as a result of the pedophile-protecting actions of the Department of Education, they would boycott the system on those grounds too. I am convinced if the parents of children attending the northern region secondary college knew of the abhorrent behavior of the man teaching their children, and his shocking and extensive history of abusing students, there would not be a single child enrolled in that school in the future! **Leaked Document** After numerous meetings concerning the complaint (which I was told would be kept strictly confidential, particularly from Nick Flanagan and his unit), a document was leaked to me form within the Department of Education. This document revealed that the Department planned to absolve Dick Newman from all complaints. The investigation had been totally and completely corrupted in order to absolve Newman. The grounds for this were that \"no complaints of a sexual nature have been made against Dick Newman since 1995\". This was unbelievable! So Newman's invitations for students to meet his penis after school were not considered to be sexual! Also, it was stated that as the schools had taken action in relation to each case, there was nothing more to be done. So, it was therefore acceptable for a teacher to commit repeated acts of serious misconduct, against multiple students, at different schools. It was very clear that this teacher was being actively protected. **Theft of Department of Education Files** **I left a message with the Minister for Education to inform her that I had received information to indicate", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:19:e7095de86a70", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14544, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "Also, it was stated that as the schools had taken action in relation to each case, there was nothing more to be done.

Soon after, the unit that I lived in was broken into and files containing information about the Department of Education's protection of pedophile teachers were stolen.** (See news article covering this at [this link](http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/04/1081017036346.html)) This included a letter from a mother pleading for help as her son had been sexually assaulted by a teacher and was now suicidal. She wanted my help as the Department of Education was covering up for this pedophile teacher. Nothing else was stolen from the unit. **Visit to the New President of the Board** A new President was appointed to the Board, along with other new members. One day, the new President of the Board received a visit from one of the workers in the child protection field. This woman, Enid Ireland, approached the new President and told him that Detective Senior Sergeant Nick Flanagan knew about the complaint I had made to the Department of Education (indicating a significant breach of confidentiality). **She told the new President to cease any association with me and my organisation \"for the sake of your professional reputation\". ** **The incident spooked the new President enough for him to telephone me in an effort to get me to drop my complaint against Flanagan and his unit, which I refused to do.** Thankfully, the new President had the integrity and courage to stick with our organisation despite the pressure he was being put under. **Anonymous reports to Crime Stoppers** Approximately 12 months had passed when I decided I would make an anonymous call to Crime Stoppers, a phone-in service where people can give anonymous tips to police about crimes. I telephoned Crime Stoppers from a public phone and informed the woman, Katie, of the pedophile network that was operating in Melbourne. She asked me to call back again with further information and I did so. I told Katie that the network was operating under police protection and at that stage had not given her the police officers' names who were implicated. She then asked me to provide the names of the police officers who were involved. I told her that I was very nervous to do this, as my family and I had suffered very negative repercussions as a result of this group and I didn't want us to have to go through any more traumas. She spoke to her boss and he", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:20:6663e285fbb2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14545, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "under police protection and at that stage had not given her the police officers' names who were implicated.

She spoke to her boss and he promised me that the information I provided would not go to the police officers of concern, and that the information would go straight to the Ethical Standards Division (ESD), which is the same as Internal Investigations. As she and her boss had promised that the information would go straight to ESD, I gave her the names of the officers. **When I called back again to find out how the case was proceeding I was shocked when Katie told me that her boss had forced her to send the information to Nick Flanagan's unit!** The information had gone directly to Nick Flanagan!! Katie apologised and appeared to be genuinely distressed at what had happened. **I asked to speak to her boss and I told him that he had promised that the material would go to ESD, and he exclaimed \"Do you realise how serious your allegations are?\" I replied that of-course I did - that's why I wanted the information to go to ESD, and not to the police officers of concern!** He said \"We don't pass on information to ESD\". Katie then got back on the phone and was clearly very upset. She implored me to contact ESD and give them the information myself. **Intimidation and Harassment Begins Again** Soon after this, my family and I were subjected to harassment and surveillance. For example, nearly every day there would be a car out the front of my parent's home (where I had now moved to, for safety reasons), with two men just sitting there. The men often had large walkie-talkies. The cars often had large, thick aerials. Whenever a member of the family walked out of the house the people in the cars would speed off. However, sometimes we were followed by the people in the cars. The cars were usually very flashy, like large four-wheel-drives or dark shiny sedans. I was often followed by men in white shiny cars with the number plates beginning with VHA and was to later learn that these cars were often used as government vehicles. Sometimes I would come out of a location, say a friend's house, and there would be a man in one of the flashy vehicles just waiting there. It was very menacing and very stressful for my family and I. **We also received unusual phone-calls at that time, clicking noises over the phone and sometimes the phone-calls were actively intercepted", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:21:34369bd775d7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14546, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "with the number plates beginning with VHA and was to later learn that these cars were often used as government vehicles.

It was very menacing and very stressful for my family and I. **We also received unusual phone-calls at that time, clicking noises over the phone and sometimes the phone-calls were actively intercepted with heavy breathing or laughter or shuddering screams.** My incoming mail was very clearly being interfered with. **Visits from the Mormons** One day my mother and I came out from my parent's house and there was a group of men waiting in a car out the front of our house again. They sped off when we came out, but this time I got in my car and followed them. As I drove towards them (they had turned their car around and were facing me) they flashed their lights at me. I drove around the cul-de-sac, and was shocked when I got to my parent's house again. The men were talking to my mother from in their car. I called for her to get away from the men and she replied \"Its OK dear, they're Mormons\". I did not believe they were Mormons and I held my hand on the car horn and chased them out of the street. A licence check on their car however, seemed to indicate that they really were Mormons, or were using a Mormon-registered car. I did not think they would ever return (especially if they really were Mormons!). However, two weeks later I was getting into my car and saying goodbye to my mother. The same men approached my mother, not realising I was in the car. They asked if they could ask her a few questions about me. I then stuck my head out of the car window and said \"If you've got any questions you can ask me!\" They were very surprised that I was there and asked \"Why did you chase us out of the street that day. We are just Mormons\". I replied \"Because some of your behaviour is most un-Mormon-like!\" The man the said \"Like what?\" and I replied \"Like flashing your lights at me\". He then said \"Oh, you mean when we were taking photos of you? You didn't like us taking photos of you?\". The 'Mormons' had just admitted to taking photos of me, without my knowledge or consent. I told them to stay away from me and my family. Soon after this I saw the same men in a different car. It was a dark, flashy sedan, similar to those that were often sitting in our street. I got the licence plate of this car and gave it to a trusted police office. He told me that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__australian-network.txt:22:6afc60988aa1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14547, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__australian-network.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__australian-network", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "like us taking photos of you?\".

It was a dark, flashy sedan, similar to those that were often sitting in our street. I got the licence plate of this car and gave it to a trusted police office. He told me that the car was owned by a debt-collecting agency, or more likely, a surveillance company as they often used debt-collecting as a front. The owner of the car, however not one of the men who had been seen in the car, was a Mormon. **The Mormons were very clearly conducting surveillance on my family and me.** **Reports to Deputy Ombudsman** After the problems with Crime Stoppers, I decided to call the Ombudsman's office and pass on the information I had to them, including the incident with Crime Stoppers. The Deputy Ombudsman, Ian Softman, put me under a great deal of pressure to meet with him and hand over all of my information to him for investigation. I said that I wanted to meet with the new Chief Commissioner of Police, Angela Franklin, as she was dedicated to flushing out bent police. Ian Softman told me that he would try to arrange this. However, he reported that it was not possible and again put me under great pressure to give all of my information to him for investigation. I finally did succeed in getting an appointment with the Chief Commissioner. Contrary to Ian Softman's claim that she could not meet with me, she had never been informed that I had tried to get a meeting with her through him. She was extremely annoyed when she had been left out of the loop in this way, and the incident just added to my suspicions about the motives of Softman. **Thefts of Evidence** While I was reporting information to Softman over the phone anonymously, two thefts of evidence occurred. On the first occasion, the file was stolen from the boot of the car. I had left it there for two hours while I attended to a matter at a school. When I returned I discovered that it had been taken. I rushed home to check that the copy left at my parent's house was still there. I discovered that my parent's house had been broken into, the dogs drugged, and the file stolen from a hiding place. Much was taken, including the letter of admission from Bob Sisterly (of the threat to my mother). Luckily, I had kept a third copy with somebody else. **Fires at Network X Studio, Melbourne GPO and Celebrities Home ** At this time a number of significant fires occurred.

One was at a studio used by Network X. Interestingly, the copy of the network's recent multi-million dollar production had \"coincidentally' been removed from the studio two days before the fire. All that survived the fire was a Sesame Street character, which took centre place in a photo of the scene in the leading newspaper's report. Within a week there was another fire, this time at the Melbourne General Post Office. All of the post offices boxes (and their contents) were destroyed, though little else was affected. Finally, again within a week, a suspicious house fire occurred in he home of a well-known television celebrity. This celebrity is a member of the same secret society as Ron Snide. **All that was destroyed in the fire was a collection of videos and photographs. Interestingly, the comment of the celebrity was \"It can all be put to bed now\". A strange thing to say after your house has just gone up in smoke?** A further interesting incident occurred at Melbourne's largest brothel. An armed intruder stole a relatively small amount of cash from the brothel, but was led to the safe where videotapes of clients engaging in sexual activities were kept. Video tapes of clients were \"stolen\", including those of Greg Neckett, a frequent client of this establishment. A reliable contact informed me that the theft was actually an \"inside job\". Within a two-week period, thousands of videos had gone up in smoke or destroyed. These events occurred at the time of the reports being made to Ian Snow. It is also very interesting to note that at that time, the British section of Interpol was in Victoria conducting a \"secret\" investigation into child pornography. **Children Tortured or Die in Mysterious Circumstances** **It was also around this time that a number of children connected to the child pornography industry were either killed in suspicious circumstances, or tortured. I was working with a young girl and was very concerned for her safety at this time. I told a trusted police officer of my concerns for this girl. A week later she had been rushed to hospital. An unregistered \"tank\" (her word, meaning a very solidly built car) had come out of nowhere and slammed into the car in which she was a passenger.

Thankfully, she survived.** **Fears for My Life** I had managed to arrange a meeting with the Chief Commissioner of Police (this was no small feat, as there had been many stumbling blocks, and it appeared that there were people actively trying to prevent such a meeting). In the weeks leading up to the meeting I was in real fear for my life. On one occasion I came home late at night and saw two men sitting in a car just up from my parent's house. As no-one was home at my parent's house, I drove to the top of the hill to stay with my friends. They did not hear the door-bell, and while I was standing in the street wondering where I would go, the men in the car drove up the hill very slowly, looking for me. **I had all of the evidence with me (since the thefts I did not let it out of my sight) and had to quickly hide in the bushes. The men drove up and down the street no less than five times looking for me.** I had to cut through the backs of homes in order to get to another friend's house, where I stayed the night. They also witnessed the men driving up and down the street looking for me. The next evening I heard and saw the same car drive up the hill. As no-one was going to be home that evening, I quickly got in my car and drove to another friend's house where I stayed the night. The next morning the friends discovered that their front light had been smashed in. No other houses in the street had been affected. However, the neighbours did report hearing strange cars driving up and down the quiet street late that night. It was after this that I wondered if I would live to be able to hand over all the information I had to the Chief Commissioner. **Meeting with the Chief Commissioner of Police** I attended the meeting with the Chief Commissioner of Police along with the trusted police officer who had investigated the house break in and thefts of the files. The Chief Commissioner believed me and was very concerned. She organised for the matter to be thoroughly investigated. The Chief Commissioner asked me if I wanted police protection for my family, which I declined (sometimes that results in more trouble). She told me I could contact her office whenever necessary.

Soon after this my unit was broken into and one of my collectable dolls had the eyes painted over. I phoned the Chief Commissioner's Personal Assistant and let her know that I would be sending the Chief a letter via registered mail. At the start of the conversation the line was clearly intercepted, which the Personal Assistant heard. She told me to call her back from a public phone. Interestingly, after letting her know that a letter was coming to her via registered mail, the Chief Commissioner did not receive it. I called some weeks later after having received no response, and was told that the letter had somehow been intercepted! All letters to the Chief are signed for, and the person who had signed for the registered letter I had sent was not known in the police force. However, **after two days of the Chief Commissioner demanding to know where the letter went, it turned up with a post-it note attached 'Sorry, didn't know where to send this'.** Well, to the person it is addressed to might be a start!

It was clear that the officer appointed to the case did not believe what I had to report. While he went to have a smoke, he (accidentally) left me with the report that had been written by another police officer in response to my own report (that had been submitted to the Chief). I could see why the police officer I was dealing with was so dismissive of what I had to say. The report discredited everything that I had reported. It made a mockery of my claim that Ernie Old and other high-profile individuals were involved in pedophilia and stated that there was nothing to support my claims of intimidation and harassment. This was despite the fact that there were numerous witnesses to these events. The author went on to say that an investigation must be seen to be conducted, however, because if the information was to be made public there would be a public outcry. That is, make it look like it is being investigated, but don't do anything! Even more disturbing was the specific recommendation that a Detective Alex Mock be appointed to conduct the investigation.

Detective Mock was a close friend and colleague of Nick Flanagan's, and had in fact worked with him in his unit for many years. Indeed, Detective Mock had only left Nick Flanagan's unit three months ago to be transferred to ESD. **It was very interesting timing. At the same time Nick Flanagan receives information that someone is dobbing him in for misconduct, his close friend and colleague gets a transfer to ESD, and ends up with the job of investigating his best mate! How very convenient.** **The Deputy Ombudsman Gets the Investigation** After this turn of events (I reported it all to the Chief Commissioner), the Deputy Ombudsman, Ian Softman, was given the investigation. **Child Care Centre, Pedophile Network, Police Pedophiles and Network X** Ian Softman informed me briefly about a case in the early 1990's. I did my own research into this case and discovered that it involved a creche in the Mornington Peninsula region. **A high-profile group of men were sexually abusing, torturing and hypnotising the children. The owner and his wife took the children out of the centre during the day to the homes of the rich and powerful, where the children would be sexually abused, tortured and filmed.** The children were also subjected to satanic ritual abuse. This case was almost identical to those in the U.S (Little Rascals, McMartin and others). The offenders were wealthy and powerful men in the community and included police officers. Video copies of the children being abused were obtained by Network X (how interesting it is that Network X should be involved). However, when the story went public, the video tapes went \"missing\" and the police claimed that they never received them. **Ultimately, the police did not take any action against the owner of the creche, on the grounds that the children were too young to be viewed as credible witnesses. While there was conclusive evidence that four of the children had been raped or sexually abused while at the day care centre, the owner was never charged.** (For a media article revealing police corruption on this case, [click here](http://home.vicnet.net.au/~csapp/archive/the_age020305.html)) A concerned parent with links to the underworld offered the head of a bikie group $10,000 to inflict enough damage so as to ensure that the owner of the creche could never sexually abuse another child again. The head of the bikie group said that they knew about the owner of the creche, and what he was up to, however, they could not do the job.

The head of the bikie group said that they knew about the owner of the creche, and what he was up to, however, they could not do the job. Much as they would like to, the owner had protection from the very highest levels. He was untouchable. When the Mornington Peninsula child-care-centre case broke, an investigative journalist infiltrated an elite child-pornography and pedophile club based in Melbourne. Its members were all wealthy and elite members of Melbourne society. It was chaired by the CEO of a major Melbourne Charitable Trust. This article included information on their use of telephone monitoring, courtesy of the group's contacts within Telecom. The children from the Mornington Peninsula child-care-centre reported being taken to a \"pink\" room with a spa and other significant decor. It was in a house where the children were sexually abused, tortured and filmed (amongst other locations). Three children independently identified to the investigators the house that they had been taken to. (For a media article on this case,[click here](http://home.vicnet.net.au/~csapp/archive/mpl_250105_page01_05.html)) **Sure enough, the room had been painted a dusty-pink color, and it had a spa and the other decor items described by the children. However, as you now know, no further action was taken against the owner of the child-care-centre, nor others suspected of being involved in the ring. What is most significant however, is that the pink house WAS REGISTERED TO THE VICTORIA POLICE!!** I am now working with some of the young survivors of the child-care centre and their families. It is clear that a cover-up of the highest order occurred in 1992, and the children and their families are still suffering from it. **Present Days ** All of this material is currently being investigated by the Deputy Ombudsman. However, the investigation has been marred by suspicious activity. Perhaps the most significant example is the conduct of the police officer Ian Soft appointed to head the investigation, Detective Jock Westland. **My colleague, a counsellor who worked on the 1992 Mornington Peninsula Creche case, provided Jock Westland with information pertaining to a video tape that depicted police actively involved in the satanic-ritual-sexual abuse of children from the creche. This is highly significant information. However, I discovered from one of the other investigators that Jock Westland had decided not to pass this information on for further investigation. In fact, his notes read \"This witness (my colleague) has no information of significance\".** In addition to this, Jock Westland refused to investigate my claims of intimidation and harassment on the grounds that I was \"paranoid\".

Jock Westland has been under \"investigation\" for these actions for two months now, and I am yet to find out whether he will continue to be involved in this investigation. If he remains on the case we can be sure that this so-called investigation is just another example of high-level white-wash and cover-up of organised pedophilia and child pornography in Australia. **A final note on the Department of Education investigation. I received a letter stating that Dick Newman had been cleared of all charges, as the witnesses could not substantiate my claims. However, of the pool of eight witnesses I had provided ONLY ONE HAD BEEN CONTACTED and she clearly re-affirmed the concerns about Dick Newman.

Sorenson gave a stunning report to a Christian television channel which aired in Nebraska in 1989, based on her experiences with over 30 abused foster children who spent months or years in her home.** It provides an eye-opening introduction to a shocking phenomenon known as ritual abuse. The claims without further documentation certainly seem to be fantastical, so I urge the reader to suspend their disbelief until after the empirical evidence of extreme abuse has been fully discussed: \"We got involved and learned about this subject because we were foster parents and worked with a number of children. And several years back, several of the children began, after a period of time and building up trust, to talk about some very bizarre events that had happened in their past, and they were frightening and very confusing. I really didn't know what to think. We went to the police, and we went to social services, and there was really nothing anyone could do. These children we worked with are now adopted in safe homes and probably would never have talked had they not felt able to trust the people they were living with. There are certain things that are in common in the children's stories when we talk about devil worship... There are things that come up in every single story, such as candles. They all talk about sex. **Sex is without a doubt a part of every area of this - all sorts of perverted sex. **That is what you will first hear, about the sex, about the incest, and it is so hard to believe.

But once we get that, we have learned that we can go on and ask and find out... and it will involve pornography; that is always part of it. Part of the reason is that they can use that to threaten the children. \"We have pictures. We will show the police if you talk.\" It makes the children feel that they are in great danger, and they are all very frightened of the law. They talk about the garish makeup that the people in the group wear. They talk about singing that they didn't understand. Obviously that is chanting, and that has come up in every one of these stories, and none of them call it chanting. There will be dancing. Most often that will involve sexual acts. There will always be a leader and they will be very frightened of the leader. **These children, from a very young age, and I am talking about children who came out of birth homes, the family they were born to, worshiped the devil. ...** **The children I have talked to have all had to murder before the age of two. That is something beyond anything I could comprehend.** But in some way, whether with the help of an adult's hand over theirs, by having them practice, by getting them excited to be part of the adult scene, they do murder. And the evil thing that happens is, that they really believe that they want to. They want to do what the older people are doing, and they are praised for that. And that becomes their goal, to be like the adults... They are told they will never get out, no one will ever believe them, that there is no freedom, that \"the law will get you.\" They are hopeless before they get someone willing to listen. They are threatened with death. **Every time a child is killed in their group, they are told, \"If you tell, this will happen to you.\" **They have every reason to believe that. So even when they are into the [foster care] system, and with another family and begin to feel somewhat safe, they still expect these people to show up on the doorstep.

It would be one of them and she wouldn't know it ahead of time. They set them up to fail in every area. It is very prevalent in the Midwest, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri. Some people have speculated recently that these states are headquarters .... As you listen to us talk about these things, there will be a natural part of you which will deny much of what you hear, and believe me, we did too. I would like to share this with you, partly in the children's words, so that you can hear the things that they said that nobody could make up, that no child could know. That's what eventually convinced me, along with the deep emotion. The grieving, screeching damage and hurt that they cry out with as they talk. The children I will be talking about, these are all children that I personally talked to. They are today between the ages of five and 17. When they talked they were between the ages of five and 15. When these things occurred to them, they were between the ages of, well birth, but of when memory enters in, I would say a year and a half to eight. So we are talking about very small children.... We are talking about children forming consciences at that time, learning right from wrong. These children do not know. They come out and do not know what is right. They are confused. What they did before, that they were rewarded for, is such a horror to anybody else, that they are shunned. And most often they have been in multiple placements. They will go to a home, they will steal, they will lie, they will hurt animals. One little guy would sharpen pencils and try to stab people. I don't mean poke, I mean stab. People don't like that in their homes. They don't have any idea what it is, they just think, \"We have a weird kid.\" Many are sent to psychiatric hospitals where they are labeled psychotics, schizophrenics, and who would want them in? I will begin with the first stories that we heard, which will seem horrible to you, but are very mild to me, because we have progressed and heard far worse things. The first story is about two little boys who were 7 and 9 when they talked, and they told about sexual abuse at one point, and were very", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__child-sex-abuse-testimony.txt:2:b29ceae458eb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14558, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__child-sex-abuse-testimony.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__child-sex-abuse-testimony", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "a weird kid.\" Many are sent to psychiatric hospitals where they are labeled psychotics, schizophrenics, and who would want them in? I will begin with the first stories that we heard, which will seem horrible to you, but are very mild to me, because we have progressed and heard far worse things. The first story is about two little boys who were 7 and 9 when they talked, and they told about sexual abuse at one point, and were very grieved. We talked about good and bad touching and we thought we really had gotten to the bottom of it, and then** that afternoon the little one began to cry, and when we couldn't get the answer from him, the older brother said, \"He is probably crying because he was in the room when they killed his friend.\"** That was the first one we know about. And as they described that, they talked about that particular victim being brought into a room, hands and arms tied, mouth taped, and how there had been x's marked on his body, on his vital organs. That was bad enough. Within a very few weeks we learned that it was not the adults who had killed that child. It was this oldest boy, who was talking. The next person that we talked to was a little boy, who was very borderline mentally. He had language problems, it was very hard for him to explain himself. And when he began to come out of it, everyone was startled the way he talked. We were real sure ... he had not been around these other children and heard anything, but we began to question ourselves, \"Are we asking strange questions. Is there something odd about us which makes children come and dump these things on us?\" The part which made me believe this child's story, he talked about different babies being killed, but this particular one being stabbed, he curled up in a fetal position, he was 9 years old when he was telling the story. He curled up in a fetal position, and his eyes got real glazed, and he said, \"They cooked that baby on the grill.\" And I thought, he has really flipped out. I mean, I didn't know. And he said, \"Oh, gross, it smelled like rotten chicken, or rotten deer.\" He then went on to tell us how they would cut out the heart, or cut off the sex organs, and save them in the refrigerator. A very typical thing that these kids talk about. They *worship *the sex organs.... They kept it for another ceremony. I asked him where the bodies went. I did not get any answers from that child about what happened to the bodies, but the other two boys, who I spoke about first, eventually, they talked about throwing the babies in the fire. And I asked", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__child-sex-abuse-testimony.txt:3:ad6aec19b03f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14559, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__child-sex-abuse-testimony.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__child-sex-abuse-testimony", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "out the heart, or cut off the sex organs, and save them in the refrigerator.

And I asked about that, \"You mean they were dead when they threw them in the fire?\" And the littlest one said, \"No, no. Them was alive and them threw them.\" And by this time we were really getting freaked out. What were we going to do? How can you help these kids? Where do you find a therapist who can deal with this? ... But God set up a support system. Other families were helping us, and that really helped. The next child I will share about, and I am going sort of by categories here, how we learned, and the types of killings, this little girl is 11 today, she was nine when she first talked. It was a very painful thing when she first started to share the sex things. The sex things are so harmful to the children and they are so embarrassed and it is so personal to the children, and they know that they enjoyed that. They know that. We had been through all that. She began to draw pictures of cats, and the cats all had tails that were on the other side of the page, or their leg was someplace else. As we began to work with her and talk, she said that she had had to kill a pregnant cat. She first said that they had killed a pregnant cat. We said how did you know it was pregnant. Well, she could not explain that, but as we got into it, she confessed that she had had to kill the cat. And I asked her. And her description was, \"With a knife, I put it in her bottom, and twisted it.\" Now you tell me, does a kid know that? If I ask a kid how do you kill a cat, do you think they will say that? Those are the kinds of details these children tell us. Later, and they eventually cut the cat open, and that was how they knew the cat was pregnant. And they eat parts of the cat, and the feces and the blood. And again, this was just the beginning. It progressed, and the next time she had to kill a baby, the same way - put the knife in the bottom and twist. The baby was alive and he was screaming. And that child hears that, to this day, and has nightmares and flashbacks. And they cut", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__child-sex-abuse-testimony.txt:4:f47c63ca890f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14560, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__child-sex-abuse-testimony.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__child-sex-abuse-testimony", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "cat open, and that was how they knew the cat was pregnant.

And that child hears that, to this day, and has nightmares and flashbacks. And they cut the baby open, and they ate the baby. They do this, so there are no bodies left, and they bum what is left and grind up the bones. And she talked about that, pouring gasoline on the bodies and burning them in the back yard. And I used to think that was nuts, but I have heard it enough times now that I know it must be so.... We know there are mortuaries involved to cremate the bodies, and that makes sense.... The most horrible story about fire that I have to tell, and this is extremely, extremely disturbing, it was a little girl, she was a teenager when she was telling me. And she was describing a barn where they used to go to have their meetings and they used to gather outside the barn, and there would be chanting. And then as they went inside the barn they would be split into different groups. And she was never with any of her family, they all went to different places. And I asked her where she had to go and she said \"I was always in the burning room.\" And as she went on to describe the burning room, I thought, how she came out of this, with any sanity at all, I don't know. She was a very small child. They would take in children, probably pre-schoolers, and they would hang them from the rafters in this barn, and there would be as many as five or ten hung in a row. They would be fully clothed, which is unusual, because frequently they are naked. The children, like this girl, were all given candles. And you can picture the ceremony as she described it. And the candles were lit. Then the adults would go forward and would pour liquid from a cup on each of the children's clothing, which was obviously gasoline or kerosene. And then they would give a signal and the others would have to go forward and set the children on fire. When they were done they would cut them down. The first child that this girl had to kill was a cousin, a little cousin. What does that do to you? But you couldn't object, because the children that objected were killed. This child, about two years ago, just fell to the ground at Christmas time, everyone thinks that Christmas is such a wonderful", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__child-sex-abuse-testimony.txt:5:79083bd44155", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14561, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__child-sex-abuse-testimony.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__child-sex-abuse-testimony", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "give a signal and the others would have to go forward and set the children on fire.

This child, about two years ago, just fell to the ground at Christmas time, everyone thinks that Christmas is such a wonderful time. And she confessed that she hated Christmas. She couldn't wait until everything was put away because all she could hear was babies crying. Christmas is the time when the most babies die. And she covered her ears and cried for hours, and screamed, \"Stop it, stop it, stop it! Talk to God and make him stop it!\" All she could hear is the screams and the babies crying.... Christmas for the children I have talked to has been one of the worst times. I have had three children tell me about a very similar ceremony. I will kind of merge that and tell you how it went. They were taken to a church, and all the children, it is a very festive occasion, and they are taken to the front of the church, and a small child is now brought in, two of them talked about babies and they put them on a platform. The adults are all celebrating and dancing and singing, and the children are getting into the spirit of it. What they are doing is forming a circle around the child, and of course the child represents the child Jesus, and they begin mocking, and spitting, and calling names, and then they encourage the children to begin doing it. You can imagine how it gets out of control. And at some point they hand all of the children knives and then they are all hacking and slashing until the baby is dead. And then they all celebrate because the child Jesus is dead.\" **Kathleen Sorenson died in October 1989, shortly after this report was aired. On a long rural road returning to her home, a car heading in the opposite direction crossed lanes and caused a head-on collision. Both the young woman driver who hit her and her husband had police records for cruelty to animals.** **Note:** Timothy Silver found this long quote/testimony of severe cult child sex abuse in Nebraska Senator John DeCamp's book, \"[The Franklin Coverup](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/franklin-cover-up.pdf),\" where you can find it on pages 204 - 211.

Cults and Child Abuse **By Timothy Silver** * * * * Presidio **On November 16, 1987, a [*New York Times*article](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/16/us/army-will-close-child-care-center.html) glibly revealed a shocking statistic: in a three year period from 1984 to 1987, over 30 different military bases were rocked by child abuse scandals, including West Point and Fort Dix.459 This statement came on the heels of a massive scandal that was taking place in San Francisco, at a military base named Presidio.** **\"A Federal grand jury in San Francisco spent 10 months investigating abuse allegations surrounding the Presidio center, and almost 100 children were examined for physical or psychological signs of sexual abuse. At least four children were discovered to have chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease.\" - *New York Times***** The *San Jose Mercury *described the West Point scandal and its relation to ritual abuse in chilling detail: \"There had been sex abuse cases involving day care centers at several other Army bases.

The child told the doctor who examined her that a teacher at the West Point day care center was the one who hurt her... Children at West Point told stories that would become horrifyingly familiar. They said they had been ritually abused. They said they had had excrement smeared on their bodies and been forced to eat feces and drink urine. They said they were taken away from the day care center and photographed.\" - *San Jose Mercury News*460 The Presidio that the *San Jose Mercury News *and *New York Times *mentioned is a military base located in San Francisco. It became the subject of one of the strangest and sickening child abuse scandals in American history. In 1987, some parents whose children attended the Presidio day care center began to notice signs of abuse in their children, who began acting strangely, using sexually provocative language and sexually inappropriate behavior. **Upon taking their children to the hospital, it was revealed that they also suffered an array of physical symptoms showing clear cases of sexual abuse. When authorities would not act, the parents directly contacted the parents of other kids at the center and the result was shocking: 60 children had clear physical signs of abuse and 4 had contracted Chlamydia. Some were only infants.** The *American Journal of Orthopsychiatry *wrote an extensive analysis of the victims of the Presidio. They stated: \"The severity of the trauma for children at the Presidio was immediately manifest in clear cut symptoms. Before the abuse was exposed, parents had already noticed the following changes in their children: vaginal discharge, genital soreness, rashes, fear of the dark, sleep disturbances, nightmares, sexually provocative language, and sexually inappropriate behavior. In addition, the children were exhibiting other radical changes in behavior, including temper outbursts, sudden mood shifts, and poor impulse control. All these behavioral symptoms are to be expected in preschool children who have been molested.\"461 **The U.S. Army was in no hurry to investigate the claims of child abuse.** It took them 12 days to form a strategy group, and nearly a month passed before they notified other parents of the day care that child abuse allegations had been made.

Although it is normal procedure to shut down a government daycare after such allegations, the Presidio Daycare Center remained open for nearly a year. By then, 59 other victims between the ages of three and seven were identified.462 Reports of a satanic cult being housed within the military base had apparently surfaced many years earlier. Military Police had investigated some buildings after reports of a man dressed all in black holding a little girl's hand had been reported. An MP was recorded as saying: \"We kicked the door open and here's this nice little bedroom. In a corner was a mannequin with a gun aimed at the door. On the left side there was a bunk against the wall. There was a pentagram on the floor, a huge one. There were dolls' heads all over the ceiling, just off-the-wall stuff... We were sitting there, we've got a cult on the Presidio of San Francisco and nobody cares about it. We were told by the provost marshal to just forget about it.\"463 **On the Autumnal equinox of 1987, an occult day of importance, fire would strike a building adjacent to the day care, destroying many records relating to the center. A month later, fire would destroy the day care center itself. The ATF found that the causes of both fires had been arson, contrary to the Armies own investigation which claimed faulty wiring.464** Only one man would ever have charges brought against him: Gary Hambright, a civilian employee who oversaw the daycare center. However, the prosecution bungled the case, bringing to trial only the children who 'would make the best witnesses' and leaving out the most prolific examples of physical abuse, such as those with rectal lesions and missing hymens. The judge presiding over the case deemed the charges as 'too vague' and Hambright walked free. **No other persons were charged and the US government quietly closed the case against Presidio itself.465 The lawyer for the Presidio was Joseph Russoniello, who also defended the United States government during the Iran/Contra trials.466** **At one point in the investigation, it was revealed that another man was being investigated by the police: Lieutenant Colonel Michael Aquino, military intelligence specialist. Army documents and child testimony showed that children from the day care center regularly took trips outside of the center, and many children were able to accurately identify what the inside of Aquino's house looked like.

Investigators searched Aquino's house and retrieved thousands of videos and photographs, and found what appeared to be a soundproof room, but charges were never brought against him.467** **Who exactly is Michael Aquino? It turns out he is an important piece of the puzzle. Aquino is openly a Satanist, who founded his own church called the Temple of Set. He coauthored the highly controversial document \"[Mindwar](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/mindwar-michael-aquino.pdf)\" in 1980, which would define the strategy and importance of Psychological Operations, aka PSYOPS, for the Department of Defense from that point forward.** In 'Mindwar', Aquino argues that the reason for the failure in Vietnam was not tactical, but rather the United States simply lost the war of information, being unable to turn the Vietnamese to their cause and unable to convince the domestic public of the importance of the war.468 Aquino proposes a new look at PSYOPS, claiming that it ought to be at the very forefront of the war effort, the very first and the most important technique employed as soon as conflict is deemed inevitable. No longer would 'tactical propaganda' such as leaflets and loudspeakers on the battlefield suffice, instead a vast array of propaganda and coercion techniques are needed. This goes beyond what we traditionally think of propaganda, such as planted news stories or front organizations like those in the infamous [Operation Mockingbird](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#7). He also advocates 'Mindwar' on American citizens. \"MindWar must target all participants if it is to be effective. It must not only weaken the enemy; it must strengthen the United States.\" Immediately afterwards is a disturbing justification on the use of PSYOPS on Americans: \"Under existing United States law, PSYOP units may not target American citizens. That prohibition is based upon the presumption that \"propaganda\" is necessarily a lie or at least a misleading half-truth, and that the government has no right to lie to the people. The Propaganda Ministry of Goebbels must not be a part of the American way of life. Quite right, and so it must be axiomatic of MindWar that it always speaks the truth. Its power lies in its ability to focus recipients' attention on the truth of the future as well as that of the present. MindWar thus involves the stated promise of the truth that the United States has resolved to make real if it is not already so.\" So there is virtually no law barring the use of 'Mindwar' on Americans, because if it is not yet the truth, the Department of Defense will make it the 'truth'. Perhaps most", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__cults-child-sex-abuse.txt:3:39a33050f309", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14567, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__cults-child-sex-abuse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__cults-child-sex-abuse", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "truth.

Perhaps most terrifying is Aquino's insistence that: **\"There are some purely natural conditions under which minds may become more or less receptive to ideas, and MindWar should take full advantage of such phenomena as atmospheric electromagnetic activity, air ionization, and extremely low frequency waves.\"** Consider the magnitude of this statement, imagine the Department of Defense manipulating domestic and foreign persons with Extremely Low Frequency waves to alter their political and moral dispositions to align with the interests of the United States. It sheds light on a statement Aquino makes in the beginning of the document: **\"Psychotronic research is in its infancy, but the U.S. Army already possesses an operational weapons systems designed to do what [Lieutenant Colonel John] Alexander would like ESP to do - except that this weapons system uses existing communications media. It seeks to map the minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then to change them in accordance with U.S. national interests. It does this on a wide scale, embracing military units, regions, nations, and blocs.\" ** Psychotronics, as defined by Aquino himself, is 'intelligence and operational use of ESP.' In the simplest terms, the Department of Defense has the capability to map a persons brain waves, and then use techniques such as ELF (Extremely Low Frequency Waves) to alter that persons brainwaves to a pattern more conducive to United States interests. This is the technique that Aquino is advocating to be used on domestic citizens, in the most defining thesis in PSYOPs history. And remember this paper was published 34 years ago. Where is the technology today? **As an important side note, Franklin victim Paul Bonacci (see section below) once identified Michael Aquino as an associate of convicted felon Larry King.469 Rusty Nelson at one point identified Michael Aquino as the man to whom he had seen Larry King once turn over a suitcase full of cash and bonds.470** In addition, Michael Aquino has been implicated in various other daycare and military installation child abuse scandals. One important example is the abuse case at the Jubilation Day Care Center at Fort Bragg, where multiple children positively identified Aquino as an abuser out of a video lineup of men dressed exactly like him.471 ***Editor's Note:** Watch [this revealing video](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/mind_control/satanic_cults_geraldo_aquino_gunderson) of Col.

According to the girl, she became involved in a cult where older male members sexually molested her and killed infants and children to establish their dominance over other cult members.\" Both Smith and Paul Bonacci claimed to have seen Larry King present at some rituals. Paul Bonacci wrote in his written history that King picked him up after school one day: \"...and took me to the Triangle which is in a wooded area in Sarpy County. I witnessed a sacrifice of a human baby boy. Everyone was chanting and it was a yearly ritual around the time of Christ's birth to pervert the blood of Christ.

Realm of darkness come now empower us your slaves.' Then they all began to chant some weird sounds and I got scared and was threatened I'd become the next sacrifice if I told anyone about it.\" **One of the names on the 'suspicious death list' surrounding the Franklin Scandal is Kathleen Sorenson, who took in the children who fled from the Webb family among many other abused children. Sorenson gave a stunning report to a Christian television channel which aired in Nebraska in 1989, based on her experiences with over 30 abused foster children who spent months or years in her home.** It provides an eye-opening introduction to a shocking phenomenon known as ritual abuse. The claims without further documentation certainly seem to be fantastical, so I urge the reader to suspend their disbelief until after the empirical evidence of extreme abuse has been fully discussed: \"We got involved and learned about this subject because we were foster parents and worked with a number of children. And several years back, several of the children began, after a period of time and building up trust, to talk about some very bizarre events that had happened in their past, and they were frightening and very confusing. I really didn't know what to think. We went to the police, and we went to social services, and there was really nothing anyone could do. These children we worked with are now adopted in safe homes and probably would never have talked had they not felt able to trust the people they were living with. There are certain things that are in common in the children's stories when we talk about devil worship... There are things that come up in every single story, such as candles. They all talk about sex. **Sex is without a doubt a part of every area of this - all sorts of perverted sex. **That is what you will first hear, about the sex, about the incest, and it is so hard to believe. But once we get that, we have learned that we can go on and ask and find out... and it will involve pornography; that is always part of it. Part of the reason is that they can use that to threaten the children. \"We have pictures.

We will show the police if you talk.\" It makes the children feel that they are in great danger, and they are all very frightened of the law. They talk about the garish makeup that the people in the group wear. They talk about singing that they didn't understand. Obviously that is chanting, and that has come up in every one of these stories, and none of them call it chanting. There will be dancing. Most often that will involve sexual acts. There will always be a leader and they will be very frightened of the leader. **These children, from a very young age, and I am talking about children who came out of birth homes, the family they were born to, worshiped the devil. ...** ***Important Note: The remainder of this testimony is highly graphic and disturbing. Only if you feel you are ready for it, [click here](javascript:;).*** **The children I have talked to have all had to murder before the age of two. That is something beyond anything I could comprehend.** But in some way, whether with the help of an adult's hand over theirs, by having them practice, by getting them excited to be part of the adult scene, they do murder. And the evil thing that happens is, that they really believe that they want to. They want to do what the older people are doing, and they are praised for that. And that becomes their goal, to be like the adults... They are told they will never get out, no one will ever believe them, that there is no freedom, that \"the law will get you.\" They are hopeless before they get someone willing to listen. They are threatened with death. **Every time a child is killed in their group, they are told, \"If you tell, this will happen to you.\" **They have every reason to believe that. So even when they are into the [foster care] system, and with another family and begin to feel somewhat safe, they still expect these people to show up on the doorstep. They believe that these people know everything they are doing, everyone they're talking to. One teenager told me that she had been told that if she ever got married, that they would fool her. It would be one of them and she wouldn't know it ahead of time. They set them up to fail in every area. It is very prevalent in the Midwest, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri.

Some people have speculated recently that these states are headquarters .... As you listen to us talk about these things, there will be a natural part of you which will deny much of what you hear, and believe me, we did too. I would like to share this with you, partly in the children's words, so that you can hear the things that they said that nobody could make up, that no child could know. That's what eventually convinced me, along with the deep emotion. The grieving, screeching damage and hurt that they cry out with as they talk. The children I will be talking about, these are all children that I personally talked to. They are today between the ages of five and 17. When they talked they were between the ages of five and 15. When these things occurred to them, they were between the ages of, well birth, but of when memory enters in, I would say a year and a half to eight. So we are talking about very small children.... We are talking about children forming consciences at that time, learning right from wrong. These children do not know. They come out and do not know what is right. They are confused. What they did before, that they were rewarded for, is such a horror to anybody else, that they are shunned. And most often they have been in multiple placements. They will go to a home, they will steal, they will lie, they will hurt animals. One little guy would sharpen pencils and try to stab people. I don't mean poke, I mean stab. People don't like that in their homes. They don't have any idea what it is, they just think, \"We have a weird kid.\" Many are sent to psychiatric hospitals where they are labeled psychotics, schizophrenics, and who would want them in? I will begin with the first stories that we heard, which will seem horrible to you, but are very mild to me, because we have progressed and heard far worse things. The first story is about two little boys who were 7 and 9 when they talked, and they told about sexual abuse at one point, and were very grieved.

And as they described that, they talked about that particular victim being brought into a room, hands and arms tied, mouth taped, and how there had been x's marked on his body, on his vital organs. That was bad enough. Within a very few weeks we learned that it was not the adults who had killed that child. It was this oldest boy, who was talking. The next person that we talked to was a little boy, who was very borderline mentally. He had language problems, it was very hard for him to explain himself. And when he began to come out of it, everyone was startled the way he talked. We were real sure ... he had not been around these other children and heard anything, but we began to question ourselves, \"Are we asking strange questions. Is there something odd about us which makes children come and dump these things on us?\" The part which made me believe this child's story, he talked about different babies being killed, but this particular one being stabbed, he curled up in a fetal position, he was 9 years old when he was telling the story. He curled up in a fetal position, and his eyes got real glazed, and he said, \"They cooked that baby on the grill.\" And I thought, he has really flipped out. I mean, I didn't know. And he said, \"Oh, gross, it smelled like rotten chicken, or rotten deer.\" He then went on to tell us how they would cut out the heart, or cut off the sex organs, and save them in the refrigerator. A very typical thing that these kids talk about. They *worship *the sex organs.... They kept it for another ceremony. I asked him where the bodies went. I did not get any answers from that child about what happened to the bodies, but the other two boys, who I spoke about first, eventually, they talked about throwing the babies in the fire. And I asked about that, \"You mean they were dead when they threw them in the fire?\" And the littlest one said, \"No, no.

Where do you find a therapist who can deal with this? ... But God set up a support system. Other families were helping us, and that really helped. The next child I will share about, and I am going sort of by categories here, how we learned, and the types of killings, this little girl is 11 today, she was nine when she first talked. It was a very painful thing when she first started to share the sex things. The sex things are so harmful to the children and they are so embarrassed and it is so personal to the children, and they know that they enjoyed that. They know that. We had been through all that. She began to draw pictures of cats, and the cats all had tails that were on the other side of the page, or their leg was someplace else. As we began to work with her and talk, she said that she had had to kill a pregnant cat. She first said that they had killed a pregnant cat. We said how did you know it was pregnant. Well, she could not explain that, but as we got into it, she confessed that she had had to kill the cat. And I asked her. And her description was, \"With a knife, I put it in her bottom, and twisted it.\" Now you tell me, does a kid know that? If I ask a kid how do you kill a cat, do you think they will say that? Those are the kinds of details these children tell us. Later, and they eventually cut the cat open, and that was how they knew the cat was pregnant. And they eat parts of the cat, and the feces and the blood. And again, this was just the beginning. It progressed, and the next time she had to kill a baby, the same way - put the knife in the bottom and twist. The baby was alive and he was screaming. And that child hears that, to this day, and has nightmares and flashbacks. And they cut the baby open, and they ate the baby.

And I used to think that was nuts, but I have heard it enough times now that I know it must be so.... We know there are mortuaries involved to cremate the bodies, and that makes sense.... The most horrible story about fire that I have to tell, and this is extremely, extremely disturbing, it was a little girl, she was a teenager when she was telling me. And she was describing a barn where they used to go to have their meetings and they used to gather outside the barn, and there would be chanting. And then as they went inside the barn they would be split into different groups. And she was never with any of her family, they all went to different places. And I asked her where she had to go and she said \"I was always in the burning room.\" And as she went on to describe the burning room, I thought, how she came out of this, with any sanity at all, I don't know. She was a very small child. They would take in children, probably pre-schoolers, and they would hang them from the rafters in this barn, and there would be as many as five or ten hung in a row. They would be fully clothed, which is unusual, because frequently they are naked. The children, like this girl, were all given candles. And you can picture the ceremony as she described it. And the candles were lit. Then the adults would go forward and would pour liquid from a cup on each of the children's clothing, which was obviously gasoline or kerosene. And then they would give a signal and the others would have to go forward and set the children on fire. When they were done they would cut them down. The first child that this girl had to kill was a cousin, a little cousin. What does that do to you? But you couldn't object, because the children that objected were killed. This child, about two years ago, just fell to the ground at Christmas time, everyone thinks that Christmas is such a wonderful time. And she confessed that she hated Christmas.

And she covered her ears and cried for hours, and screamed, \"Stop it, stop it, stop it! Talk to God and make him stop it!\" All she could hear is the screams and the babies crying.... Christmas for the children I have talked to has been one of the worst times. I have had three children tell me about a very similar ceremony. I will kind of merge that and tell you how it went. They were taken to a church, and all the children, it is a very festive occasion, and they are taken to the front of the church, and a small child is now brought in, two of them talked about babies and they put them on a platform. The adults are all celebrating and dancing and singing, and the children are getting into the spirit of it. What they are doing is forming a circle around the child, and of course the child represents the child Jesus, and they begin mocking, and spitting, and calling names, and then they encourage the children to begin doing it. You can imagine how it gets out of control. And at some point they hand all of the children knives and then they are all hacking and slashing until the baby is dead. And then they all celebrate because the child Jesus is dead.\"473 **Kathleen Sorenson died in October 1989, shortly after this report was aired.

The animal should therefore be killed within the circle, or the triangle, as the case may be, so that its energy cannot escape.** An animal should be selected whose nature accords with that of the ceremony...

Of those who acknowledged seeing these cases, 93% of the clinical psychologists said that they believed the abuse did indeed occur. **The authors concluded that the psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers who responded to their survey \"overwhelmingly believed both the allegations of abuse and the allegations of ritual or religious elements of the abuse\". **Another study surveyed 810 members of the British Psychological Society who had patients who suffered from sexual abuse, and found that 15% had patients who reported satanic ritual abuse. Of these, 80% believed that their patient did indeed suffer from the reported abuse.477** One study examined 270 cases of substantiated sexual abuse involving day cares in England found that 13% of the cases included allegations of ritual abuse.478 One survey of the membership of the International Society for the Study of Multiple Personality and Dissociation concluded that 88% of 1185 respondents \"reported belief in ritual abuse, involving mind control and programming\".479 \"In 1992 alone, Childhelp USA logged 1,741 calls pertaining to ritual", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__cults-child-sex-abuse.txt:13:d28c1a7e6802", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14577, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__cults-child-sex-abuse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__cults-child-sex-abuse", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "believed that their patient did indeed suffer from the reported abuse.477** One study examined 270 cases of substantiated sexual abuse involving day cares in England found that 13% of the cases included allegations of ritual abuse.478 One survey of the membership of the International Society for the Study of Multiple Personality and Dissociation concluded that 88% of 1185 respondents \"reported belief in ritual abuse, involving mind control and programming\".479 \"In 1992 alone, Childhelp USA logged 1,741 calls pertaining to ritual abuse, Monarch Resources of Los Angeles logged approximately 5,000, Real Active Survivors tallied nearly 3,600, Justus Unlimited of Colorado received almost 7,000, and Looking Up of Maine handled around 6,000. Even allowing for some of these calls to have been made by people who assist survivors but are not themselves survivors, and for some survivors to have called more that one helpline or made multiple calls to the same helpline, these numbers suggest that at a minimum there must be tens of thousands of survivors of ritual abuse in the United States.\" - Catherine Gould, *The Journal of Psychohistory*480 In 2007, four researchers created an international online survey divided into three parts, available in English and German, called Extreme Abuse Surveys, in an effort to gather a large number of responses as preliminary data on the nature and prevalence of extreme abuse.481 The researchers were: Wanda Karricker, PhD, retired U.S. psychologist Bettina Overcamp, PhD., Thorsten Becker, the German social worker who won the \"German Child Protection Award\" in 1994 for his work with abused children, and [Carol Rutz](https://www.WantToKnow.info/nationbetrayed10pg), a survivor of extreme abuse and mind control. The surveys show repeated allegations of abuse used for the purposes of mind control.. **1,471 participants from 31 countries answered at least one question on the survey listed for 'Adult Survivors',** and 451 people from 20 countries responded to at least one question listed for 'Professionals' who have worked with at least one adult survivor of extreme abuse. Of the adult survivors, 257 people from 15 countries responded that they had been victims of 'Government Mind Control' experimentation as a child, and 71 professionals from 6 countries responded that they had worked with at least 1 adult survivor of extreme abuse who reported to have been a victim of government mind control experimentation as a child. 166 survivors reported being experimented on by doctors who spoke German or with a heavy German accent. **Of the adult survivors, 236 reported to have been drugged against their will, 236 reported to have been sexually abused by multiple perpetrators, 228 reported being threatened with death if they ever discussed their experiences, 222 reported sensory deprivation experiments, 217 reported electroshock experiments, 197 witnessed murder by their perpetrators, 196 witnessed animal mutilations, 184 reported the use of feces in their abuse, 183 reported being used in child pornography, 178 reported starvation, 171 reported hypnosis, and 169 reported child prostitution.**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__cults-child-sex-abuse.txt:14:74783e639869", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14578, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__cults-child-sex-abuse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__cults-child-sex-abuse", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "the adult survivors, 236 reported to have been drugged against their will, 236 reported to have been sexually abused by multiple perpetrators, 228 reported being threatened with death if they ever discussed their experiences, 222 reported sensory deprivation experiments, 217 reported electroshock experiments, 197 witnessed murder by their perpetrators, 196 witnessed animal mutilations, 184 reported the use of feces in their abuse, 183 reported being used in child pornography, 178 reported starvation, 171 reported hypnosis, and 169 reported child prostitution.** **Of the 257 EAS respondents who reported that secret mind control experiments were used on them as children, 69% (177) reported having been abused in a satanic cult. Of the 543 EAS respondents who reported that they had been abused in a satanic cult, 33% (179) reported having been used in secret mind control experiments as children.** 159 survivors had heard Greek letters being used during their abuse, and 160 experienced sexual mind control programming used for blackmail or personal use. 228 survivors answered 'yes' to the question: \"My perpetrator(s) deliberately created/programmed dissociative states of mind (such as alters, personalities, ego-states) in me.\" Research has consistently shown that false allegations of child sexual abuse by children are rare. One 1987 study examined 576 consecutive referrals of child sexual abuse to the Denver Department of Social Services, and categorized the reports as either reliable or fictitious. In only 8% of the total cases were children judged to have possibly advanced a fictitious allegation.482 In a more recent study, investigators reviewed case notes of all child sexual abuse reports to the Denver Department of Social Services over 12 months. Of the 551 cases reviewed, there were only 14 (2.5%) instances of erroneous concerns about abuse emanating from children. These consisted of three cases of allegations made in collusion with a parent, three cases where an innocent event was misinterpreted as sexual abuse and eight cases (1.5%) of false allegations of sexual abuse.483 Researchers into the phenomenon of Satanic Ritual Abuse have come to the conclusion that the phenomenon is widespread and transcends geographic boundaries.484 One such study, titled \"Multiple Personality Disorder and Satanic Ritual Abuse: The Issue of Credibility\" states: \"The comparability of both the child and adult accounts is said to transcend geographical and relationship boundaries, with descriptions emerging from both survivor groups revealing common themes, behaviors, symbols, and paraphernalia. Assuredly, the possibility of cross-contamination of accounts exists when, for example, a group of suspected or potential victims seems to be involved in a single day care case, or when adult contemporaries are aware of the details of others' reports. However, one can not discount the similarity of accounts given spontaneously and independently by individuals who are unrelated personally, geographically, or through shared knowledge.\" **The empirical evidence of ritual abuse for the purposes of mind control establishes that the phenomenon is widespread and international, and consistency between methods of abuse.

Furthermore, the methods of abuse correlate both with known experimentation under MK-ULTRA and the testimonies of child abuse case studies such as Franklin and Presidio. It also reveals a solid consensus that psychiatrists who have been exposed to patients who have suffered from ritual abuse believe that the abuse did indeed occur. Its interesting to note that such a widespread consensus is relatively rare in the field of psychology, let alone for such a controversial topic.** 476 Bottoms, Bette L.; Shaver, Phillip R.; Goodman, Gail S. \"[An analysis of ritualistic and religion-related child abuse allegations.](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/lhb/20/1/1/)\" Law and Human Behavior, Vol 20(1), Feb 1996 477 Andrews, B., Morton, J., Bekerian, D.A., Brewin, C.R., Davies, G.M., & Mollon, P.

Unfortunately, people rarely stop to ask the question, who exactly are the members of the FMSF, and how solid is their science?** Peter J. Freyd initiated the founding of the FMSF after being accused of sexual abuse by his daughter, Jennifer. His behavior has been particularly suspect, such as accusing his daughter of being brain damaged, despite the fact that she holds a PhD in Psychology, graduated magna cum laude from Penn and is currently a tenured professor of psychology at the University of Oregon. Speaking to *The Oregonian, *Jennifer Freyd stated that \"I'm sometimes flabbergasted that my memory is considered 'false' and my alcoholic father's memory is considered rational and sane.\"485 **Peter Freyd once stated that \"With the help of Harold Lief and Martin Orne, the FMSF quickly gathered a respectable appearing advisory board, giving the new syndrome an aura of scientific acceptance.\"486 Interestingly, Dr. Martin T. Orne has been heavily involved with MK-ULTRA experiments since the early '60s, where he undertook hypnosis studies at Harvard Medical School with a $30,000 grant from the CIA.487** CIA documents have confirmed that Orne had a 'top secret' clearance in MK-ULTRA.488 He has published many papers relevant to the creation of a 'Manchurian candidate', including one called \"Can a hypnotized subject be compelled to carry out otherwise unacceptable behavior?\", another called \"The significance of unwitting cues for experimental outcomes: Toward a pragmatic approach\", and lastly \"Restricted use of success cues in retrieval during post-hypnotic amnesia\".489 This is an interesting subject matter history given the FMSF's insistence that hypnotism is illegitimate. **Dr. Harold Lief was involved with brain electrode experiments at Tulane University, a notorious MK-ULTRA institution.490** Another prominent member, David Dinges, was a co-worker with Martin T. Orne and has been involved in research for Naval Intelligence, who oversaw the precursor mind control experiments to MK-ULTRA.491 **Founding member Ralph Underwager once proudly proclaimed to the pro-pedophilia publication *Paidika*:** \"What I have been struck by as I have come to know more about and understand people who choose paedophilia is that they let themselves be too much defined by other people.

I have to define my love as being in some way or other illicit.\" **What I think is that paedophiles can make the assertion that the pursuit of intimacy and love is what they choose.** **With boldness, they can say, \"I believe this is in fact part of God's will.\"**492 **Regarding the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, *Columbia Journalism Review *stated:** **\"Rarely has such a strange and little-understood organization had such a profound effect on media coverage of such a controversial matter. The [False Memory Syndrome] foundation is an aggressive, well-financed PR machine adept at manipulating the press, harassing its critics, and mobilizing a diverse army of psychiatrists, outspoken academics, expert defense witnesses, litigious lawyers, Freud bashers, critics of psychotherapy, and devastated parents.\"493** The FMSF has repeatedly cited a study presented at a Harvard conference where researchers were repeatedly able to implant the false memory of mundane tasks like grocery shopping, into their subjects using techniques such as hypnosis.494 It has been championed as proof that memories are easily manipulated. However, research has shown that memories of abuse function very differently than average memories. \"However, leading memory researchers such as Dr. Bessel van der Kolk of Harvard Medical School maintain that traumatic memories, which typically are engraved in the sensorimotor processes, are not subject to the same kinds of contamination that can affect normal memory. Traumatic amnesia, described in the DSM-III-R as psychogenic amnesia, is a phenomenon which has been known to mental health professionals for more than 100 years. The clinically observed characteristics of traumatic memory formation and retrieval match precisely the patterns of memory recovery exhibited by SRA [Satanic Ritual Abuse] survivors, and strongly confirm the reality of their cult abuse.\"495 **There is also the case of Paul and Shirley Eberle, who are famous for propagating the idea of a 'satanic panic', that the widespread reporting of ritual abuse is merely a social contagion.

Paul and Shirley Eberle edit a soft-core magazine in California called the L.A. Star that contains a mixture of nude photos, celebrity gossip, telephone sex ads, and promos for The Politics of Child Abuse. **In the 1970's, however, the Eberles were also publishing hard-core pornography. Their publication, Finger, depicted scenes of bondage, S & M, and sexual activities involving urination and defecation. A young girl portrayed with a wide smile on her face sits on top of a man whose penis is inside of her; a woman has oral sex with a young boy in a drawing entitled \"Memories of My Boyhood.\"** The Eberles were featured nude on one cover holding two life-size blow up dolls names \"Love Girl\" and \"Play Guy.\" No dates appear on the issues and the Eberles rarely attach their names, referring to themselves as \"The L.A. Star Family.\" **The Eberles were the distributors of Finger and several other underground magazines, says Donald Smith, a sergeant with the obscenity section of the Los Angeles Police Department's vice division** who followed the couple for years. LAPD was never able to prosecute for child pornography: \"There were a lot of photos of people who looked like they were under age but we could never prove it.\" The pictures of young children in Finger are illustrations, and child pornography laws were less rigid a decade ago than they are today. **\"Sexpot at Five,\" \"My First Rape, She Was Only Thirteen,\" and \"What Happens When Niggers Adopt White Children\" are some of the articles that appeared in Finger.** One letter states: \"I think it's really great that your mags have the courage to print articles & pixs [sic] on child sex... Too bad I didn't hear from more women who are into child sex... Since I'm single I'm not getting it on with my children, but I know of a few families that are.

In the context of psychopathy, the potential is at least recognizable. **Cults serve as a network for psychopaths who enjoy sadistic sexual practices and the potential for concealing knowledge.** The very concept of the occult is based in taking knowledge out of the circulation of the masses and reserving it for a select few.

In other words, the purpose is to keep knowledge for personal gain and to use this knowledge to wield power over others. **Former members of the Church of Satan and other similar cults have testified that the basic goal of 'occult knowledge' is to understand the human psyche, primary human motivations and how humanity functions. This knowledge is then used to exploit people. The worldview of these groups is extremely dark, and is based on controlling others, gaining knowledge to use as influence, and then partnering with like-minded individuals and groups to expand upon this knowledge and use it more effectively.** **The next step into the rabbit hole is that these groups act as 'psychopath filtration' centers. They deliberately target psychopaths for initiation and then use their resources to put them into positions of power in a variety of fields such as politics, law, business, education, science and more. Franklin, the Presidio and the Finders are all examples of psychopathic networks that have infiltrated institutions of power, and are each a small glimpse into the hierarchy of the Pathocracy.** The [next chapter](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#14) will explore the uses of extreme abuse for the purpose of mind control, and why so many men involved with MK-ULTRA would have a vested interest in hiding and marginalizing the existence of such abuse. * * * * Food for Thought: 1. How connected are occult groups with each other? 2. Is the CIA responsible for various cults as 'front groups' for MK-ULTRA and other projects? 3. Why is the discussion of the existence of cults marginalized from the mainstream? 4. Why were the Finders interested in terrorism and explosives? 5. How widespread are networks that abuse and sell children? 6. What are the profits from child pornography and prostitution earned by cults such as the Finders used for? 7. How much influence has Michael Aquino's 'MindWar' had on official Psychological Operation policy? 8. How much has technology discussed in 'MindWar' regarding the manipulation of the brain advanced in the more than 30 years of its publication? 9. Is it disturbing that Aquino's Temple of Set, and likely by extension other occult groups, have knowledge and access to this technology? 10.

Even after being convicted of sex crimes and losing their licenses, doctors are often able to reapply to practice again. The *Journal-Constitution* investigation began with a story about one Georgia doctor that led to efforts to document the problem nationwide. By combing through news reports, state medical board records and court files going back 16 years, the *Journal-Constitution*'s reporters compiled a list of physicians who were either convicted in criminal cases or disciplined by state medical boards. Many of the doctors were accused by large numbers of their patients, in most cases females being seen by male doctors. \"One thing we found that was shocking to us is **some of these doctors are the most prolific sex offenders in the country, with hundreds", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__doctors-sex-abuse.txt:0:3a04b0ae10fa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14587, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__doctors-sex-abuse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__doctors-sex-abuse", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "news reports, state medical board records and court files going back 16 years, the *Journal-Constitution*'s reporters compiled a list of physicians who were either convicted in criminal cases or disciplined by state medical boards.

In nearly half of those cases, the AJC found, the doctors remain licensed to practice medicine**, no matter whether the victims were patients or employees, adults or children. Even some doctors criminally convicted are back in practice, demonstrating that a system that forgives doctors - [first exposed by the AJC in 2016](http://doctors.ajc.com/table_of_contents/) - has not changed. Dr. Richard Martin Roberts is still allowed to see patients in Texas even though a medical board disciplinary panel in November 2017 found he repeatedly conducted unwarranted genital exams on young girls. \"Only doctors get to do this,\" he told one, a 7-year-old he was supposed to be examining for a learning disability. Doctors benefit from a system where victims are often not believed [and] criminal charges for physician sex abuse are rare. At a time when powerful men in business and politics are losing careers over sexual misconduct, America's doctors remain a baffling exception, impervious to the power of the #MeToo movement. The AJC's new investigation found that medical boards still routinely handle serious sexual misconduct as an illness or lapse in training that should be dealt with through therapy, education and watchful eyes in exam rooms. In 31 states, cases can be hidden from the public through private board actions. **Note:** Watch an excellent segment by Australia's \"60-Minutes\" team \"[Spies, Lords and Predators](http://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/pedophile-politicians-ring-uk)\" on a pedophile ring in the UK which leads to the highest levels of government.

Finally, the conversation is getting started because of Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar. He's the former team doctor for U.S.A. Gymnastics, and he was sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography (37,000 images!) charges. **I've heard story upon story about sexual misconduct from my patients, including inappropriate touching and sexual misconduct during their gynecologic exams when they were young women**. Experiences like these have a long-term negative effect on a woman and the way she takes care of her physical health during her lifetime.

As part of that focus, their websites provide information to the public about doctors. But in most states, patients will have a difficult time finding out if their doctors have been disciplined for sexual abuse or other violations. **No state provides complete and accurate information on every doctor. Some obstacles to that are intentional. They are the result of state laws that tie regulators' hands, agreements negotiated with doctors' attorneys, or concerns about harming a doctor's practice**. Maryland investigated Dr. Joshua R. Mitchell III in 2005 after a complaint that he had sexually violated a patient. The board learned that the Baltimore police sex-crimes unit had investigated a similar complaint from another patient. The medical board wrapped up its 2005 investigation with a private letter advising Mitchell to offer a chaperone during breast and pelvic exams. Then in January 2010, a patient reported Mitchell raped her. The board's website didn't provide any information to the public until May 2010. Illinois and Wyoming post only summaries of disciplinary actions, which may not detail violations. Arkansas and both of Oklahoma's boards require the public to file requests for disciplinary orders, and Oklahoma requires a fee. In contrast: Maine not only posts orders but provides a phone number for patients to find out if non-disciplinary action has been taken against a doctor. **Note:** For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on [sexual abuse scandals in many other professions](https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabusescandalsnewsarticles). **Doctors Keep Licenses Despite Sex Abuse** **2018-04-14, *US News and World Report*/Associated Press** [https://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2018-04-14/ap-investigatio...](https://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2018-04-14/ap-investigation-doctors-keep-licenses-despite-sex-abuse) [Robert] Rook was allowed to keep his family practice open, so long as he's chaperoned, despite facing multiple criminal charges for rape.

Even when doctors are disciplined, their punishment often consists of a short suspension paired with therapy** that treats sexually abusive behavior as a symptom of an illness or addiction. The investigation finds that decades of complaints that the physician disciplinary system is too lenient have led to little change in the practices of state medical boards. The #MeToo campaign and the push to increase accountability for sexual misconduct in workplaces don't appear to have sparked a movement toward changing how medical boards deal with physicians who act out sexually against patients or staffers. **AMA tackles sex abuse - of doctors, by doctors** **2017-06-05, *Atlanta Journal-Constitution* (Atlanta's leading newspaper)** [https://www.myajc.com/news/national/ama-tackles-sex-abuse-doctors-doctors/HQn...](https://www.myajc.com/news/national/ama-tackles-sex-abuse-doctors-doctors/HQnOVpM4JZt8obqEPP2usK/) The American Medical Association will no longer tolerate sexual misconduct by physicians - at least if their victims are other doctors, and if the abuse occurs at an AMA event. But the association is doing nothing to crack down on predators who violate other victims: their patients. **Almost a year after *The Atlanta Journal-Constitution* [revealed widespread sexual misconduct](http://doctors.ajc.com/doctors_sex_abuse/?ecmp=doctorssexabuse_microsite_nav) in the medical profession, the AMA has scheduled neither formal proposals nor public discussions on doctors who abuse their patients**. The organization's silence forfeits an opportunity to address a problem that has stirred public interest. \"They seem more likely to address someone else's problems than their own,\" said Lisa McGiffert, manager of the [Safe Patient Project](http://safepatientproject.org/). The newspaper identified more than 2,400 doctors who had been disciplined for sexual violations involving patients; half are still licensed to practice medicine. But the numbers fail to capture the scope of misconduct. Many state medical boards deal with sex cases in private and issue no public findings. Others use vague language or euphemisms to hide the true nature of disciplinary matters. **By some estimates, 7 percent of American doctors have engaged in sexual misconduct** - meaning that tens of thousands may have engaged in harassment, molestation, even rape. The AMA plays no direct role in licensing or disciplining doctors, a function of state medical authorities. But the association is a powerful voice for the medical profession. **System shields doctors' abuse nationwide, leaves patients in dark** **2016-09-22, *Atlanta Journal-Constitution* (Atlanta's leading newspaper)** [http://doctors.ajc.com/sex_abuse_secrecy/](http://doctors.ajc.com/sex_abuse_secrecy/) Dr. Mark Knight calls himself an artist, one whose \"gifted hands\" sculpt bodies to perfection.

He will be subject to restrictions on his practice and close monitoring until 2020. But when patients come to his office ... Knight doesn't have to tell them about his disciplinary status. And he doesn't have to explain why an extra person is supposed to always be in the room: to make sure Knight doesn't violate patients again. Knight's freedom to see patients without disclosing his tarnished record underscores the opaqueness of the physician discipline system across the United States, a [national investigation](http://doctors.ajc.com/table_of_contents/) by *The Atlanta Journal-Constitution* found. The [AJC identified](http://doctors.ajc.com/about_this_investigation/) more than 2,400 doctors disciplined for sexual misconduct involving patients since 1999. Half are still licensed.** No state routinely requires doctors to tell patients when they have faced disciplinary action. Four states post no disciplinary records online, and at least nine purge case files after as little as five years. Twenty-one states sometimes handle misconduct cases secretly** and allow doctors to continue practice with no public hearings or public scrutiny. In 2015, advocates working with the Safe Patient Project petitioned California's medical board to require ... a doctor on probation [to] give each patient a one-page form that briefly stated his offense. At a hearing in October, board members unanimously rejected the petition. **Note:** If you live in the US, see how well your state does in protecting patients from sexual abuse using [this chart](http://doctors.ajc.com/states/). **Doctors who sexually abuse patients go to therapy and then return to practice** **2016-08-24, *Atlanta Journal-Constitution* (Atlanta's leading newspaper)** [http://doctors.ajc.com/sex_abuse_treatment_over_punishment/](http://doctors.ajc.com/sex_abuse_treatment_over_punishment/) **After medical regulators said he fondled patients, exposed himself and traded drugs for sex, Dr. David Pavlakovic easily could have lost his license.

There is little pretense of the check and balance of public scrutiny. Even doctors with egregious violations are allowed to redeem themselves through education and treatment centers, which have quietly proliferated over the past two decades. These education and treatment programs are being used by regulators in virtually every state. The Catholic Church once secretly sent sex offender priests for psychiatric treatment, then returned them to service. The abuse, the church reasoned, was a spiritual failing requiring repentance and forgiveness. Most medical authorities have embraced a similar approach, but through the lens of sexual abuse as the sign of a mental disorder. Public board orders on regulators' websites reveal dozens of physicians who were found to have re-offended after taking part in education or treatment programs. **A broken system forgives sexually abusive doctors in every state** **2016-07-06, *Atlanta Journal-Constitution* (Atlanta's leading newspaper)** [http://doctors.ajc.com/doctors_sex_abuse/](http://doctors.ajc.com/doctors_sex_abuse/) In a national investigation, The *Atlanta Journal-Constitution* examined documents that described disturbing acts of physician sexual abuse in every state.

The AJC launched its national investigation a year ago after reaching a surprising finding in Georgia: two-thirds of the doctors disciplined in the state for sexual misconduct were permitted to practice again. Some states are apparently more forgiving than others when disciplining doctors in sexual misconduct cases. **Georgia and Kansas, for example, allowed two of every three doctors publicly disciplined for sexual misconduct to return to practice.

Not a single state met the highest bar in every category. **The *AJC*'s findings explain how it's possible for a doctor who has served time on felony charges, molested patients or demanded sex in exchange for prescription drugs to continue seeing patients: In most states, there's no law against it**.

In some states, where legislatures have enacted laws prohibiting doctors who commit certain crimes from practicing, Dekle's career would be over. But in Georgia, where the law gives the medical board the discretion to license anyone it sees fit, **he was back in practice two years after leaving prison**. The [*Atlanta Journal-Constitution*] found more than 450 cases in which doctors had sexual contact with patients while also prescribing controlled and addictive substances for them. In more than half, the physicians were allowed to continue practicing. Although it's rare for medical regulators to allow doctors convicted in drugs-for-sex cases to keep their licenses, the AJC found instances in Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky where physicians with convictions similar to Dekle's were allowed to remain in practice. **State lets doctors accused of sexual abuse on patients keep practicing** **2016-07-09, *Palm Beach Post*** [http://palmbeachhealthbeat.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2016/07/06/state-lets-docto...](http://palmbeachhealthbeat.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2016/07/06/state-lets-doctors-accused-of-sexual-abuse-on-patients-keep-practicing/) Dawn Marie Basham answers the phone in tears.

Dr. Donald Cline was given a one-year suspended sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice**. No other charges were filed ... because Indiana law doesn't specifically prohibit fertility doctors from using their own sperm. The charges stemmed from two confirmed cases of paternity. Matt White and his mother, Liz White, said Cline deserved far greater punishment. He said DNA tests showed that Cline was his biological father even though Cline told his mother decades ago that he used anonymous sperm donations. \"There's dozens of us,\" said Matt White. Some of the now-adult children of Cline's former patients filed a complaint with the Indiana Attorney General's Office in 2014, after they became suspicious while scouring online records to find biological relatives. Paternity tests performed the Marion County prosecutor's office determined Cline was likely the biological father of at least two of his patients' children. Cline, who retired in 2009, initially denied the allegations when he wrote to investigators, saying the women who filed the complaints were trying to slander him. On Thursday, he acknowledged that he had lied.

Now the police were coming. Bradley would say the mother - poor, young, unwed - must have been trying to extort money from him. It worked. A detective wrote that, compared to the doctor, the mother was \"not credible.\" A medical board investigator found that Bradley \"specialized in welfare ... patients,\" so a shakedown was \"a distinct possibility.\" The case was closed. And the doctor who would become one of the nation's most prolific sexual predators moved on. **For 15 more years, Earl Bradley raped, molested and sodomized a generation of his pediatric patients along the Delaware seashore. He recorded 13 hours of the assaults on video. Before he finally went to jail in 2009, he victimized 1,200 children, maybe more**. Reported cases of doctors sexually assaulting children are unusual; vulnerable victims are not. Most are adult women, especially those who are poor or dependent on narcotic painkillers or lacking the credibility or social standing to pursue legal action. Still ... Bradley's case underscores how American medicine so often puts doctors' interests ahead of patient protection. The *AJC* documented eight instances in which Bradley was the subject of accusations between 1994 and 2008. Each time, in ways that echo through hundreds of other cases [the newspaper examined](http://doctors.ajc.com/), Bradley avoided punishment. **Note:** Watch an excellent segment by Australia's \"60-Minutes\" team \"[Spies, Lords and Predators](http://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/pedophile-politicians-ring-uk)\" on a pedophile ring in the UK which leads to the highest levels of government. A second suppressed documentary, \"[Conspiracy of Silence](http://www.wanttoknow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence),\" goes even deeper into this topic in the US. **Important Note: **Explore our [full index](https://www.WantToKnow.info/indexnewsarticles) to revealing excerpts of key major media news articles on several dozen engaging topics.

This cannot help but lead to a healthier and happier way of living for all of us. **Please help by educating yourself and others so that we can stop the abuse and build a more caring and loving society.** Thanks for caring, and may we all work together to build a brighter future for our world.

Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a convicted pedophile who trafficked underage girls around the world, yet was chummy with the likes of Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, and Prince Andrew. **How is it that after being convicted as a pedophile Epstein only spent 15 months in a lavish jail and all court documents which further implicate him (and the many prominent leaders he served) have been sealed by the courts?** Yet mountains of incriminating evidence is publicly available showing that Epstein fed the appetites of high-level politicians and some of the most rich and famous people in the world. Read this undeniable evidence in the highly revealing summaries of major media articles below on Epstein and his friends in high places. From these reliable media sources, you may begin to understand how sex abuse and pedophilia have infected even the highest levels of government. Follow the links provided to verify yourself the hard evidence and to learn much more. By spreading the word to our friends and colleagues and demanding justice, we can expose this travesty of just and shake the very foundations of our world.

On Sept. 24, 2007, in a deal shrouded in secrecy that left alleged victims shocked at its leniency, Epstein agreed to a 30-month sentence, including 18 months of jail time and 12 months of house arrest and the agreement to pay dozens of young girls under a federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child sexual abuse.

Among those people [Sarah] Ransome claims she was directed to have sex with was Epstein's lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, who helped negotiate a controversial plea deal that gave the eccentric multimillionaire - and co-conspirators employed by Epstein - federal immunity in 2008. Epstein's lawyers ... secretly negotiated an unusual plea agreement that allowed him to escape federal sex trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for life. The agreement, by design, was kept from his victims so that they could not appear at his sentencing. **Last week, more than two dozen lawmakers in Washington demanded a federal investigation into that plea deal, which was negotiated, signed and sealed by former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, now President Donald Trump's secretary of labor.** The complaint alleges that this all occurred at the same time as Epstein's lawyers were negotiating with Acosta and other federal prosecutors for a deal to avoid federal sex trafficking charges in connection with a scheme in which he lured underprivileged girls, mostly 13 to 16, to his home in Palm Beach under the pretense that he would pay them $200 to $300 for massages. Instead, police in Palm Beach found that he had been molesting and sexually abusing dozens of girls between 2001 and 2007. **Note:** Learn about other major cover-ups in high places in deeply revealing [news articles on sexual abuse scandals](https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabusescandalsnewsarticles) from reliable major media sources. **Lawyers for Billionaire Sex Offender Linked to Prince Andrew Scandal Ask Judge to Keep Documents Sealed** **2015-01-27, ABC News** [https://abcnews.go.com/International/lawyers-billionaire-sex-offender...](https://abcnews.go.com/International/lawyers-billionaire-sex-offender-linked-prince-andrew-scandal/story?id=28524119) Attorneys for convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein claim in a new court filing that the billionaire financier will be \"irreparably harmed\" if emails and letters his lawyers sent to federal prosecutors ... are made public.

What did authorities do when they found out, back in 2005?

The investigation, more than a year in the making, described Epstein as running a sort of child molestation pyramid scheme, in which girls - some in middle school - would be recruited to give Epstein \"massages\" ... pressured into sex acts, then coerced into bringing him yet more girls. What's shocking is ... the way he was able to use his money to escape serious consequences, thanks in part to [Alexander] Acosta, then Miami's top federal prosecutor. **Acosta took extraordinary measures to let Epstein - and, crucially, other unnamed people - off the hook. The labor secretary, whose purview includes combating human trafficking, has done nothing so far to rebut The Herald's reporting.** In 2007, Epstein was facing a federal indictment that could have put him away for the rest of his life.

A second suppressed documentary, \"[Conspiracy of Silence](http://www.wanttoknow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence),\" goes even deeper into this topic in the US. **Jeffrey Epstein's plea deal is a travesty.

Acosta's representatives misled Epstein's young victims by telling them the FBI was hard at work on their cases and asking them to \"be patient.\" **Even when a handful of the victims - who may number in the hundreds - learned at the last minute that Epstein was entering a guilty plea and receiving a slap on the wrist, they still weren't told that the federal case was being dropped**. And because these victims were not informed, they were not present in court to oppose the deal and could not be heard by the sentencing judge protesting this disgraceful sham. Paul Cassell, perhaps the nation's foremost legal authority on victims' rights, has petitioned a federal judge in Florida to invalidate Epstein's arrangement on grounds that it violated the [Crime Victims' Rights Act](https://www.justice.gov/usao/resources/crime-victims-rights-ombudsman/victims-rights-act) (CVRA) of 2004.

He was also a pedophile, accused of recruiting dozens of underage girls into a sex-slave network, buying their silence and moving along, although he has been convicted of only one count of soliciting prostitution from a minor. Visitors to his private Caribbean island, known as \"Orgy Island,\" have included Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Stephen Hawking. Flight logs show that from 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's private plane, dubbed \"The Lolita Express\" by the press, 26 times. After Epstein's arrest in July 2006, federal tax records show Epstein donated $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation that year. Epstein was also a regular visitor to Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago, and the two were friends. In 2003, *New York magazine* reported that Trump also attended a dinner party at Epstein's honoring Bill Clinton. In a 2006 court filing, Palm Beach police noted that a search of Epstein's home uncovered two hidden cameras. *The Mirror* reported that in 2015, a 6-year-old civil lawsuit filed by \"Jane Doe No. 3\" ... alleged that **Epstein wired his mansion with hidden cameras, secretly recording orgies involving his prominent friends and underage girls. The ultimate purpose: blackmail, according to court papers**. \"Jane Doe No. 3\" also alleged that she had been forced to have sex with \"numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, a well-known prime minister, and other world leaders.\" **Note:** Read more about the [child sex trafficking ring](http://www.wanttoknow.info/a-lawyers-billionaire-sex-offender-linked-prince-andrew-scandal-ask-judge-keep-documents-sealed) Epstein allegedly operated.

In May last year, prosecutors surrendered 541 pages of correspondence with Epstein's lawyers leading up to a 2008 non-prosecution agreement. A letter [released by the court](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article4315989.ece) last year showed Brad Edwards, [alleged victim Virginia] Roberts's lawyer, telling the US attorney's office that Epstein \"may be the most dangerous sexual predator that the country has ever seen\". The letter continued: \"The evidence suggests that for at least four years he was sexually abusing as many as three to four girls a day. \"He uses his extraordinary wealth and power to lure in poor, underprivileged little girls and then also uses his wealth to shield himself from prosecution and liability.\" Lawyers for Virginia Roberts ... have said that **evidence against the billionaire was covered up after lobbying by his \"political and social\" connections**.

A decade after a secret plea agreement ... the victims - now women in their late 20s and early 30s - are still seeking an elusive justice. Brown first became interested in the topic of sex trafficking after completing a series on abuses at a Florida [women's prison](http://media.miamiherald.com/static/media/projects/2015/beyond-punishment/index.html). In her early research, the Jeffrey Epstein case came up repeatedly. Brown dug as deeply as possible into the behind-the-scenes machinations that characterized the Jeffrey Epstein prosecution. **She was able to identify 80 possible victims, labeled Jane Does in lawsuits to protect their identifies as minors. She reached out to 60 of the women and eight agreed to talk about the case. Four victims ... spoke on the record and on camera, three of them for the first time**. Efforts to keep details of the case secret ... are underscored not just by sealed court documents in various civil cases, but by emails between the prosecution and the defense, which talked about an \"avoid-the-press\" strategy and a deliberate campaign to keep the victims in the dark. **Note:** Video of Epstein's victims speaking out is available at the link above.

For Lefkowitz ... the meeting was critical. His client, Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein, 54, was accused of assembling a large, cult-like network of underage girls - with the help of young female recruiters - to [coerce into having sex acts](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article221404845.html) ... as often as three times a day. [Epstein] was also suspected of trafficking minor girls, often from overseas, for sex parties at his other homes in Manhattan, New Mexico and the Caribbean, FBI and court records show. But on the morning of the breakfast meeting, a deal was struck - an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein's crimes and the number of people involved.

For the vast majority of this time, it has been swept under the rug. Only in the last half century or so has it even been talked about in public forums. The prevalence of this tragic and damaging behavior has been and continues to be much more rampant than most would imagine. Yet **the good news is that in recent decades, the awareness of child sexual abuse and efforts to stop it have grown by leaps and bounds. **The #MeToo movement particularly has broken down the walls of shame so that many are now speaking out. The summaries of the major media news articles on child sexual abuse below may be very disturbing to read. Yet the fact that this is now being widely reported and exposed in the mainstream media shows that the times are changing. This increased awareness is giving children and other victims of sexual abuse the confidence to find support. And as it becomes increasingly harder to hide abuse, the abusers are realizing that there are serious consequences. With the growing public awareness of the severity of this key issue, the incidence of both adult and child sex abuse thankfully is decreasing. This cannot help but lead to a healthier and happier way of living for all of us. **Please help by educating yourself and others and spreading the word so that we can stop the abuse and build a more caring and loving society.** Together, we are making a big difference.

Federal Judge Thomas Durkin called Hastert, 74, a \"serial child molester\" and rejected a prosecutor's recommendation of six months in prison on a banking charge that carries a maximum five-year sentence. The court also fined Hastert $250,000 and sentenced him to two years of supervised release after leaving prison. Hastert must register as a sex offender. \"**Nothing is more disturbing than having 'serial child molester' and 'Speaker of the House' in the same sentence,\" Durkin said, [acknowledging] he could not sentence Hastert \"for being a child molester**\" and that his sentence would \"pale in comparison\" to what the former lawmaker would have faced had he been convicted of state charges for sexual abuse of a child. Under current Illinois law, Hastert would have faced between three and seven years in state prison if convicted of a single count of sexual misconduct with a minor. The sentencing completes the spectacular fall of a former small-town high school coach who rose to lead Congress. **Note:** Read [an article](http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/05/30/3664334/now-know-republican-speakers-helped-impeach-bill-clinton/) on how the men behind the impeachment of Bill Clinton, including Hastert, have all been caught having affairs.

Two states, Vermont and Maine ... appear to be running state protected child trafficking rings with evidence of cops, judges, lawyers, clergy and government employees covering for each other.** This kind of racketeering creates powerful, and extremely profitable, pedophile rings. Money drives the crime. It is estimated that a criminal willing to molest a child in front of a live webcam can earn $1,000 a night. In Kittery Maine, at the \"Danish Health Club,\" one bust yielded $6.1 million in \"door fees\" over a five year period with \"prostitutes\" earning $12 million. Pimps' earnings were not reported. The \"door man\" was a retired police officer whose wife worked in back. Half of all global child porn is produced in America. Ten new images of children are posted daily. Estimates of the global profits from child porn range from $3-20 billion. The Department of Justice (DOJ)'s Child Exploitation and Obscenities unit has been, by many accounts, totally disabled under US Attorney General Eric Holder. Mr. Holder even refused to prosecute his own Assistant United States Attorney caught doing child porn on DOJ computers. Child trafficking and porn are the fastest growing crimes in America. With billions being laundered in black money it makes solid economic sense for the IRS to focus on the child porn industry. Eric Holder's Department of Justice has demonstrated they have no interest in prosecuting pedophiles, not even their own. **Note:** The suppressed Discover Channel documentary, \"[Conspiracy of Silence](http://www.wanttoknow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence)\" exposes the depth and depravity of individuals at the highest levels of government and business in this child abuse \"business.\" **Number of paedophiles in Britain will shock public, warns Deputy Children's Commissioner for England** **2015-05-31, *The Telegraph* (One of the UK's leading newspapers)** [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/11641096/Number-of-paedophile...](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/11641096/Number-of-paedophiles-in-Britain-will-shock-public-warns-Deputy-Childrens-Commissioner-for-England.html) **Child sex abuse is so rife in Britain that there is not enough land in the country to build the number of prisons needed to house the perpetrators, the Deputy Children's Commissioner for England has warned**.

The past two weeks have brought three separate reports of alleged child sexual abuse in the entertainment industry. Martin Weiss, a 47-year-old Hollywood manager who represented child actors, was charged in Los Angeles on Dec. 1 with sexually abusing a former client. His accuser, who was under 12 years old during the time of the alleged abuse, reported to authorities that Weiss told him \"what they were doing was common practice in the entertainment industry.\" Weiss has pleaded not guilty. On Nov. 21, Fernando Rivas, 59, an award-winning composer for \"Sesame Street,\" was arraigned on charges of coercing a child \"to engage in sexually explicit conduct\" in South Carolina.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE] child pornography sting operation called Project Flicker produced payment records of about 5,200 people, many of whom provided Army or fleet zip codes or military e-mail addresses. Subsequently, the Pentagon's investigative branch, DCIS, began going through the ICE list to identify who actually was a DOD employee. The investigation, however, only ran for eight months, and only cross-checked some 3,500 names for Pentagon ties. According to DCIS documents revealed in a Freedom of Information Act request, out of that 3,500, investigators uncovered 264 employees or contractors, including staffers for the secretary of defense. Nine people had top security clearances. **But only about 20 percent of those 264 people were completely investigated. Fewer still were prosecuted. After about eight months, the entire probe was halted.** It left about 1,700 names totally unchecked, 1,700 alleged kiddie porn customers, an unknown number of whom may still work in some capacity for the Defense Department. Late last summer, after investigations by \"[The Boston Globe](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-pentagon-workers-child-porn)\" and [Yahoo! News](http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/upshot/pentagon-declined-investigate-hundreds-purchases-child-pornography.html) revealed the figures, a Pentagon spokesman promised to reopen the investigation, conceding that DCIS had stopped due to lack of resources. DCIS says it is now revisiting all 5,200 names.

The photo in the Roman Catholic newsletter showed him with a smile across his wrinkled face, near-naked Amazon Indian children in his arms and at his feet. The Rev. Mario Pezzotti was working with children and supervising other priests in Brazil. It's not an isolated example. In an investigation spanning 21 countries across six continents, The Associated Press found 30 cases of priests accused of abuse who were transferred or moved abroad. Some escaped police investigations. Many had access to children in another country, and some abused again. A priest who admitted to abuse in Los Angeles went to the Philippines, where U.S. church officials mailed him checks and advised him not to reveal their source. A priest in Canada was convicted of sexual abuse and then moved to France, where he was convicted of abuse again in 2005. Another priest was moved back and forth between Ireland and England, despite being diagnosed as a pederast, a man who commits sodomy with boys. **\"The pattern is if a priest gets into trouble and it's close to becoming a scandal or if the law might get involved, they send them to the missions abroad,\"** said Richard Sipe, a former Benedictine monk and critic of what he says is a practice of international transfers of accused and admitted priest child abusers. **\"Anything to avoid a scandal.\"** **Note:** This is only the tip of the iceberg.

They followed the investigation closely, updating one another along the way. The officials did nothing. No one so much as spoke to Mr. Sandusky. Last month, Mr. Sandusky, for three decades one of Joe Paterno's top coaching lieutenants, was convicted of sexually attacking 10 young boys, nine of them after the 1998 investigation, and several of them in the same football building showers. Louis J. Freeh, the former federal judge and director of the F.B.I. who spent the last seven months examining the Sandusky scandal at Penn State, issued a damning conclusion [on July 12]: **The most senior officials at Penn State had shown a \"total and consistent disregard\" for the welfare of children, had worked together to actively conceal Mr. Sandusky's assaults, and had done so for one central reason: fear of bad publicity.** That publicity, Mr. Freeh said, would have hurt the nationally ranked football program, Mr. Paterno's reputation as a coach of high principles, the Penn State \"brand\" and the university's ability to raise money as one of the most respected public institutions in the country. **Vatican Declined to Defrock U.S. Priest Who Abused Boys** **2010-03-24, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html) Top Vatican officials - including the future Pope Benedict XVI - did not defrock a priest who molested as many as 200 deaf boys, even though several American bishops repeatedly warned them that failure to act on the matter could embarrass the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__sexual_abuse_news_articles.txt:9:6c9263091966", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14631, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__sexual_abuse_news_articles.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__sexual_abuse_news_articles", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "high principles, the Penn State \"brand\" and the university's ability to raise money as one of the most respected public institutions in the country. **Vatican Declined to Defrock U.S. Priest Who Abused Boys** **2010-03-24, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html) Top Vatican officials - including the future Pope Benedict XVI - did not defrock a priest who molested as many as 200 deaf boys, even though several American bishops repeatedly warned them that failure to act on the matter could embarrass the church, according to church files newly unearthed as part of a lawsuit. **The internal correspondence from bishops in Wisconsin directly to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future pope, shows that while church officials tussled over whether the priest should be dismissed, their highest priority was protecting the church from scandal.** The documents emerge as Pope Benedict is facing other accusations that he and direct subordinates often did not alert civilian authorities or discipline priests involved in sexual abuse when he served as an archbishop in Germany and as the Vatican's chief doctrinal enforcer. The Wisconsin case involved an American priest, the Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy, who worked at a renowned school for deaf children from 1950 to 1974. But it is only one of thousands of cases forwarded over decades by bishops to the Vatican office called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, led from 1981 to 2005 by Cardinal Ratzinger. **Note:** If you want to know just how deep this goes, watch the powerfully revealing documentary \"Conspiracy of Silence,\" available at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence). **Report: Boy Scout files reveal repeat child abuse** **2012-08-05, *Boston Globe/*Associated Press** [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2012/08/05/report_boy_scout_files_reveal_repeat_child_abuse](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2012/08/05/report_boy_scout_files_reveal_repeat_child_abuse/) Internal documents from the Boy Scouts of America reveal more than 125 cases in which men suspected of molestation allegedly continued to abuse Scouts, despite a blacklist meant to protect boys from sexual predators. A [Los Angeles Times review](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-boyscouts-20120805-m,0,5822319.story) of more than 1,200 files from 1970 to 1991 found **suspected abusers regularly remained in the organization after officials were first presented with sexual misconduct allegations. Predators moved from troop to troop because of clerical errors, computer glitches or the Scouts' failure to check the blacklist,** known as the \"perversion files.\" In at least 50 cases, the Scouts expelled suspected abusers, only to discover they had re-entered the organization and were accused of molesting again. In other cases, officials failed to document reports of abuse in the first place, letting offenders stay in the program until new allegations came to light. One scoutmaster was expelled in 1970 for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old boy in Indiana. After being convicted of the crime, he went on to join two troops in Illinois between 1971 and 1988.

It asserted the church's right to hold its inquiries behind closed doors and keep the evidence confidential for up to 10 years after the victims reached adulthood. The letter was signed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who was elected as John Paul II's successor last week. Lawyers acting for abuse victims claim it was designed to prevent the allegations from becoming public knowledge or being investigated by the police. They accuse Ratzinger of committing a 'clear obstruction of justice'. 'Cases of this kind are subject to the pontifical secret,' Ratzinger's letter concludes. Breaching the pontifical secret at any time while the 10-year jurisdiction order is operating carries penalties, including the threat of excommunication. The letter is referred to in documents relating to a lawsuit filed earlier this year against a church in Texas and Ratzinger on behalf of two alleged abuse victims. By sending the letter, lawyers acting for the alleged victims claim the cardinal conspired to obstruct justice. **Retired FBI agent guilty of sex abuse** **2004-02-18, *Boston Globe*/Associated Press** [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/02/18/retired_fbi_agent_guilt...](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/02/18/retired_fbi_agent_guilty_of_sex_abuse/) **The former chief internal watchdog at the FBI has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 6-year-old girl and has admitted he had a history of molesting other children** before he joined the bureau for what became a two-decade career.

FBI officials said yesterday they had no information suggesting Conditt had any problems during his career and he was never the subject of an investigation. Assistant District Attorney Mitch Poe of Tarrant County, who prosecuted the case, said he wanted a longer prison sentence and was skeptical of Conditt's claim that his molestation of children subsided during his FBI career. **Note:** For powerful evidence in a Discovery Channel documentary that many top politicians are involved in sophisticated child sex abuse rings, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence). **South Florida's ex-ICE chief to plead guilty to Internet child-porn charges** **2012-06-25, *Miami Herald*** [http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/06/25/2867608/south-floridas-ex-ice-chief-to....](http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/06/25/2867608/south-floridas-ex-ice-chief-to.html) Anthony V. Mangione, the former chief of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in South Florida, plans to plead guilty rather than go to trial next month on Internet child-pornography charges, according to a federal court filing. It is customary for federal defendants who plead guilty to receive lower sentences after they accept responsibility and forego trial. Still, each of the charges accusing Mangione of transporting and receiving images of minors \"engaging in sexually explicit conduct\" carries a minimum-mandatory sentence of five years. **Mangione ... served as an agent with ICE for 27 years. During the past decade, ICE aggressively targeted child pornography, with Mangione frequently speaking out against \"predators\" who illegally share images through their computers.** As the special agent in charge of ICE's South Florida office between 2007 and 2011, **Mangione often praised the agency's efforts against child pornography in both the cyber and real worlds.** **Note: **To learn about documented sexual abuse in secret CIA mind control programs, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse). **Final Note:** You may be angry or upset after reading this information.

What happened next in the summer of 1984 helps to explain how shocking allegations of rape and murder against some of the country's most powerful men went unchecked for decades.** Less than 24 hours after starting to inquire about the dossier presented to him by a senior Labour Party politician, the editor was confronted in his office by a furious member of parliament who threatened him and demanded the documents. \"He was frothing at the mouth and really shouting and spitting in my face,\" Don Hale told The Daily Beast. \"He", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__uk-coverup-vip-pedophile-ring.txt:0:87c9ceb18b8e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14636, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__uk-coverup-vip-pedophile-ring.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__uk-coverup-vip-pedophile-ring", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "how shocking allegations of rape and murder against some of the country's most powerful men went unchecked for decades.** Less than 24 hours after starting to inquire about the dossier presented to him by a senior Labour Party politician, the editor was confronted in his office by a furious member of parliament who threatened him and demanded the documents. \"He was frothing at the mouth and really shouting and spitting in my face,\" Don Hale told The Daily Beast. \"He was straight at me like a raging lion; he was ready to knock me through the wall.\" Despite the MP's explosive intervention, Hale refused to hand over the papers which appeared to show that **Leon Brittan, Margaret Thatcher's Home Secretary, was fully aware of a pedophile network that included top politicians.** The editor's resistance was futile; the following morning, **police officers from the counter-terror and intelligence unit known as Special Branch burst into the newspaper office, seized the material and threatened to have Hale arrested if he ever reported what had been found.** More than 30 years later, an inquiry into allegations of child sex abuse rings, murder, and cover-ups has been launched by the British government after [Scotland Yard detectives said they believed statements by victims](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/18/victim-i-watched-british-mps-sexually-abuse-murder-young-boys.html) who claimed they were systematically abused as young boys at sex abuse parties attended by judges, politicians, intelligence officers, and staff at the royal palaces. In 1983, a controversial MP, Geoffrey Dickens, had made a series of incendiary claims about active pedophiles in the corridors of power. He handed a file containing the names of alleged perpetrators to Leon Brittan; publicly the authorities shrugged off the claims and no trial or prosecution would follow. The dossier mysteriously disappeared. Decades later, Brittan claimed he had simply handed the papers to his subordinates to investigate and heard no more about it. Last year, he was forced to clarify his statement when it emerged that he had later written to Dickens to say the initial investigation had been deemed \"worth pursuing\" by investigators. It is now claimed that confidential Home Office papers collated by Baroness Castle of Blackburn and passed to Don Hale, editor of her local newspaper, the *Bury Messenger*, claimed that Brittan had played an active role in overseeing the investigation into the pedophile network. **\"Leon Brittan was mentioned in everything you picked up, his fingerprints were over everything, he was the instigator,\" **Hale said. \"He really had his finger on the pulse, he wanted to know everything about it; all the documents were cc'd back to Leon Brittan or it was an instruction directly from Leon Brittan.\" **Brittan, a protégé of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, had been promoted to Home Secretary at the age of 43, making him the youngest person to preside over Britain's domestic law enforcement and national security apparatus since Winston Churchill before the First World War.** Brittan, who died", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sexabuse__uk-coverup-vip-pedophile-ring.txt:1:f04ddd07ff76", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14637, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sexabuse__uk-coverup-vip-pedophile-ring.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sexabuse__uk-coverup-vip-pedophile-ring", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "said. \"He really had his finger on the pulse, he wanted to know everything about it; all the documents were cc'd back to Leon Brittan or it was an instruction directly from Leon Brittan.\" **Brittan, a protégé of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, had been promoted to Home Secretary at the age of 43, making him the youngest person to preside over Britain's domestic law enforcement and national security apparatus since Winston Churchill before the First World War.** Brittan, who died in January, [has been accused of raping a woman and sexually abusing boys](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/23/pedophile-claims-against-leon-brittan-thatcher-s-prot-g.html). He denied the allegations and was never charged, although police investigations have continued after his death. Baroness Castle, then Barbara Castle, a Labour member of the European parliament, told Hale she did not trust Brittan to investigate the allegations thoroughly. \"Barbara never said he was a pedophile, she was just very, very hostile about him. 'He's the last person you want this to go to,' she said, which inferred that he was somehow involved,\" Hale explained. Worried about the integrity of the Home Office investigation, Castle had tried to interest the major newspapers in the classified documents but she turned to Hale when they rejected her overtures. \"She was saying, 'I've been everywhere else, I've been to the nationals, nobody would touch it with a barge pole, but what do you think?'\" Hale recalled. \"As a journalist of course I was interested.\" **Great Britain's notoriously tough libel laws insured that obviously he couldn't repeat the allegations included in the Home Office papers that about 16 MPs and members of the House of Lords, and 30 high-profile figures from the Church of England, private schools, and big business, were members of, and advocates for, the [Paedophile Information Exchange](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-how-paedophiles-infiltrated-left-hijacked-fight-civil-rights). The shadowy group, which operated partly in the open, campaigned for the age of consent to be abolished and incest to be legalized. It also allowed pedophiles to send each other secure mail and to meet in person.** Instead, Hale planned to run a story explaining that the Home Office was actively investigating these men and repeat some of the concerns voiced to him by Castle, who died in 2002. He set about contacting some of the men named in the papers, and the Home Office, for their response. The very next morning he was surprised to see the 400-pound figure of Cyril Smith, the Liberal Party MP for nearby Rochdale, arrive at the office. \"I'd interviewed him probably four times, and when he came in I was like, 'Oh, hello, Cyril.' And he was, 'Never mind all that.' And he was straight at me,\" Hale said. \"He said to me quite clearly, 'I know who's given you this, it's Barbara Castle.' I wouldn't say who it was, but it was pretty obvious he knew.

I wouldn't say who it was, but it was pretty obvious he knew. He's a hell of a sized guy, he's over six feet tall and he's huge; took up three seats. He's not a guy you could deal with easily, he was a horror.\" Hale managed to stonewall Smith but the following morning, he had more visitors. \"That's when Special Branch turned up,\" he said. Three vehicles pulled up to the newspaper offices and about 15 men barged inside. Two pushed him up against a wall and brandished a search warrant and something they described as a \"D-notice.\" **The D-notice system was established in 1912 and was supposed to be used on very rare occasions when national security could be threatened by a news story.** The rest of the men were searching for the files, which they described as stolen, confidential Home Office papers. \"These bully boys come storming in, they said, 'We're not here to negotiate. Hand them over or we'll arrest you now.' I couldn't argue, because as soon as you opened the files it had got 'Not to be removed', 'Confidential' and 'For your eyes only'-all these sort of things on them. I wouldn't have had a hope in hell legally. I would have ended up in prison and the story would have gone nowhere,\" he said. The story went nowhere for a generation. **A new breed of backbench politician began to reopen these issues in the last couple of years.** Simon Danczuk, MP for Rochdale since 2010, focused on one of his parliamentary predecessors. [In a book published last year](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Smile-For-The-Camera-Double/dp/1849546444), he revealed that Sir Cyril Smith, the man who \"had steam coming out of his ears\" as he remonstrated with Don Hale, was himself allegedly a predatory pedophile with more than 140 complaints filed against him. Throughout his life he had been protected from prosecution. Among the retired police officers Danczuk interviewed, one recalled the time Special Branch officers forbade them from asking a victim about Smith. Others remembered the day Smith was allowed to walk out of a police station without charge despite indecent images being found in his car after an unexplained telephone call from London.

It might be debt, it might be a scandal involving small boys, or any kind of scandal which a member seemed likely to be mixed up in, they'd come and ask if we could help. And if we could, we did. We would do everything we can because we would store up brownie points. That sounds a pretty nasty reason but one of the reasons is, if we can get a chap out of trouble, he'll do as we ask forever more.\"* Fortescue's callous words could have come directly from the script of [*House of Cards*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un5sLNT5-_c), the original British version of which was first broadcast in 1990. There is growing evidence that MI5 and MI6, Britain's security services, took a similar view. **MI5 is [alleged to have repeatedly blocked investigations](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/15/mi5-kincora-childrens-home-northwen-ireland-sexual-abuse) into a sex abuse ring at the Kincora children's home in Northern Ireland in order to protect its intelligence-gathering operation.** **The longtime deputy director of MI6, and former High Commissioner in Canada, Peter Hayman was himself allegedly a pedophile, and was ultimately named as such in parliament by Geoffrey Dickens.** Hayman had been caught with explicit material in 1978 but no charge was brought. Secret files discovered at the National Archives this year revealed that the attorney general at the time believed it wasn't in the public interest for Hayman to be prosecuted. **Prime Minister Thatcher [ordered his depravity to be concealed](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/thatcher-stopped-officials-publicly-naming-sir-peter-hayman-as-suspected-paedophile-10020852.html) from the public.** Thatcher must also have known about the allegations against her Home Secretary, Leon Brittan, because 1984's most explosive gossip had appeared on the pages of the scurrilous *Private Eye* newspaper. Her bodyguard Barry Strevens now says he [personally warned](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2707333/Thatcher-s-bodyguard-says-warned-underage-sex-rumours-close-aide-amid-claims-senior-ministers-named-dossier.html) her that another of her most trusted lieutenants, Sir Peter Morrison, had also abused underage boys.

Carl was abused by a pedophile ring from the age of 7, and the emotional and physical torture went on for nine years. Some of his attackers, he says, were men with influence and authority. \"The authority is not what stops people from speaking out, it's the fear that is instilled by these people,\" he said. \"It appears the cover-ups did happen and it makes survivors very wary because you don't know who you can have confidence in to report.\" One of the people who dedicated their lives to amplifying the voices of the victims, trying to ensure the powerful would be held to account, was Liz Davies. In the late '80s and early '90s, she was a social worker in Islington, North London, with an unusual problem: Teenage boys, usually so reluctant to seek help, would line up outside her office on Hornsey Road waiting to come inside. She would later discover that the international office of the Paedophile Information Exchange was just a few hundred yards from her desk, and her patch was home to a host of prolific child attackers linked into a network of powerful abuse rings that stretched from Westminster to Northern Ireland, Wales, and the island of Jersey in the Channel. In 1990, she raised concerns at a local council meeting that a large number of boys in the area were showing signs of abuse. She claimed that Margaret Hodge, then leader of Islington council and later the Minister for Children under Tony Blair, ignored her warnings. It was 2014 before Hodge would [apologize for her \"shameful naivety\"](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/10747257/Margaret-Hodge-sorry-as-council-she-led-told-to-investigate-Savile-abuse-allegations.html) in failing to properly investigate the claims of abuse. She is now chair of the Public Accounts Committee, which is responsible for oversight of all government spending. Determined to continue her own investigation into the abuse, Davies began working with a colleague in the police force to gather more evidence. \"We started interviewing a lot of the boys. With this being a small area, I knew them, I knew their families, I'd helped their parents, so I wasn't seen as a bad person,\" she told The Daily Beast. \"They didn't like the police because they were always nicking them for things but I would get them to speak to the police officer.\" They started putting maps up around the office, linking the boys, listing those affected and those suspected of abusing them. \"We were breaking a lot of ground,\" she said. **Then came a call from the regional headquarters.

Davies and her boss, and her police counterpart and his boss were summoned for a meeting. \"We were both told to drop all our investigations, that we had no evidence and we had no right to be interviewing the boys,\" she said.** It was a heartbreaking moment, but this mini-abuse fighting team vowed to continue their work. \"We made an agreement that we would carry on under the radar and that's what we did,\" she said. In 1991, their investigations led to [the conviction of a fire official called Roy Caterer](https://spotlightonabuse.wordpress.com/tag/roy-caterer/). When police officers raided his home they found exactly what her boys had described, along with albums and albums of indecent photos. Davies thought her work would finally be taken seriously by the authorities; she was wrong. **She had amassed evidence of abuse perpetrated against 61 victims, but she claims council officials continued to tell her to stop causing trouble. A year later she finally quit social services when she says she discovered that the boys she had been trying to save were being sent back into the Islington care home system only to suffer yet more sexual abuse.** \"I was networking these children into another network which was running within the care homes. I was handing over the most vulnerable, sexually exploited children to more pedophiles,\" she said. \"I have to live with that.\" **Davies took a suitcase stuffed with evidence, including graphic photographs, to the Metropolitan Police. She said the well-intentioned superintendent looked at her haul and mournfully confessed that powerful figures still controlled what might be exposed. \"I won't be able to investigate here at Scotland Yard,\" he said.** **Note:** The original of this article can be found on The Daily Beast website at [this link](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/06/britain-s-horrific-vip-pedophile-cover-up.html).

Boylan, Ph.D.** This is a summary report on those elements of that clandestine organizational network, (which we shall label the Shadow Government), which serves as a kind of \"parallel government\" to the official elected and appointed government of this country. It includes those elements known to the author with sufficient certainty that they can be positively identified, and their known or reliably reported functions described. It is distinctly possible that there are other elements, (particularly in the realms of the \"Black Budget\" and \"Special Operations\",) which have eluded our study, and are not named here. Just as with the official government, the Shadow Government has functional branches. However, unlike the official government, the purpose of the none-executive branches of the Shadow Government is simply to distribute various functions, but not to achieve a system of checks and balances, as was supposed to happen constitutionally between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the U.S. Government. That is because the Shadow Government is a creature of a powerful elite, who need not fear being dominated by an instrument of their own creation. In the Shadow Government five branches may be identified. These branches are: the Executive Branch, the Intelligence Branch, the War Department, the Weapons Industry Branch, and the Financial Department. The reporting lines of the Intelligence Branch and the War Department to the Executive Branch are straightforward and obvious. Intelligence exists to provide the Executive Branch with sufficient necessary information to make adequately informed policy decisions. The War Department exists to provide coercive force to carry out Executive policy decisions which could meet with public resistance. The Special Operations units within the Intelligence Branch and War Department exist to carry out policy directives requiring covert action and official deniability. The Weapons Industry Branch reports to the Executive Branch most often indirectly, through the War Department and/or the Intelligence Branch (for Black Budget weapons systems). The Financial Department theoretically reports to the Executive Branch for fiscal policy implementation, but de facto also reports directly to the international power brokers who have created the Shadow Government. The Financial Department serves at times directly as their instrument of fiscal policy implementation. An analysis of the overall purposes of these five branches suggests that the overall purpose of the Shadow Government is to exercise covert control by: 1) collecting comprehensive institutional and personal information, 2) by establishing national and international policy independently of the established Government, 3) by developing high-tech arms and equipment, and, with these, establishing small, specialized, highly-mobile, elite military units to effect these covert policies, when need arises, without having to rely on the official (and \"unreliable\") Armed Services, (whose subservience to the Shadow Government is reasonably suspect), 4) by developing an armed capability to repel any threat to the status quo, (including the uncertain ontological, social, and economic", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:shadowgovernment.txt:0:d4ffbf5425ec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14644, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "shadowgovernment.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "shadowgovernment", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "personal information, 2) by establishing national and international policy independently of the established Government, 3) by developing high-tech arms and equipment, and, with these, establishing small, specialized, highly-mobile, elite military units to effect these covert policies, when need arises, without having to rely on the official (and \"unreliable\") Armed Services, (whose subservience to the Shadow Government is reasonably suspect), 4) by developing an armed capability to repel any threat to the status quo, (including the uncertain ontological, social, and economic impacts of any revelation of the reality of UFO and extraterrestrial presence) through the development of a Star Wars/BMDO ground and space-based surveillance and SDI weapons network, 5) by denying information compromising to the Shadow Government from all those outside \"need-to-know\" policymaking levels, and 6) by exercising control on the money supply, availability of credit, and the worth of money, through policy decisions made outside of the official Government. All of these mechanisms of control serve to preserve or advance the agenda of an international group of pivotal power and influence brokers. That agenda is, according to Senator Barry Goldwater, that \"national boundaries should be obliterated and one world rule established.\" [With No Apologies, Berkley Books, New York [[date unknown]].] These power brokers' most visible unifying instrumentality is the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), (which promotes the transition of Earth from a cluster of Nation-States to one global government), [Chairman: Peter G. Peterson; headquarters: 58 E. 68th Street, New York, NY 10021]. [Cf. In Control, Kerrville, TX: Fund to Restore an Educated Electorate, 1993.] However, one must not underestimate the influence of the Trilateral Commission (TC), (which coordinates economic initiatives of the Group of Seven with other \"developed countries\" vis-a-vis the \"underdeveloped world\",) [Chairman: Paul Volcker; headquarters: 345 E. 46th Street, New York, NY 10017]. Neither should one misjudge the power of the secretive Bilderberg Group (BG), (which concentrates on the military and strategic considerations of powerful West European and North American power brokers), [chair rotates, former Chair: Prince Bernhard of Holland; headquarters unknown: annual meetings rotate, but originally were held at the Hotel de Bilderberg, Oosterbeck, Holland]. David Rockefeller is the Chairman Emeritus of both the CFR and the TC, and certainly influences, through proxy representatives (such as Lloyd Bentsen), the Bilderberg Group. [Cf. Holly Sklar, ed., Trilateralism: The Trilateral Commission and Elite Planning for World Management; Boston: South End Press, 1981.] What follows is a succinct identification and description of the constituent agencies in each of the five branches of the Shadow Government. **EXECUTIVE BRANCH ** (This branch contains the effective policymaking and controlling structures behind the veil of apparent, democratic governmental structures): a) Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) (includes George Bush, Bill Clinton, all modern CIA Directors, most modern Joint Chiefs of Staff, most modern Cabinet and top Executive Branch appointed officeholders, etc.); b) Tri-Lateral Commission (David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, John D.

What conclusions can be drawn from this preliminary analysis of the structure, functions and operations of the Shadow Government? Foremost, the Shadow Government is a very large, well-organized, skillfully camouflaged, parallel power structure. History suggests that it has served its masters well, and that its predilection for operating out of sight and notoriety, if not in an outright clandestine fashion, is exactly how its masters want it to function -- not drawing attention to itself, manipulating power behind the scenes, and accomplishing by covert operations what cannot lawfully or politically be accomplished out in the open. What should be the attitude of the informed citizen to the Shadow Government? Since it thrives in the dark, we should shine the light of full disclosure on it. Citizens can demand: the end of the Congressional practice of allowing \"Black Budget\" items; the end of unpublished secret Executive Orders and National Security Directives; the end of the practice of indefinitely- sustained Presidential Declarations of National Emergency (as is currently in place); the end of Federal Reserve Notes and the return to the gold standard to back the dollar; the end to governmental domestic spying on its own citizens; and extremely severe reduction (on the order of 90%) in the number, staffing and scope of the endlessly proliferating Intelligence agencies, which are an anachronism since the Cold War ended; and an end to CIA and DEA collusion in allowing a continuing stream of drugs to pour into this country.

You are now asking us to pledge our support for this report, its recommendations, and implementation of these recommendations, with our trust and backing, our tax money, our security, and our lives. Unfortunately, **I find your report seriously flawed in its failure to address serious intelligence issues that I am aware of, which have been confirmed, and which as a witness to the commission, I made you aware of. **Thus, I must assume that other serious issues that I am not aware of were in the same manner omitted from your report.

While FBI agents from various field offices were desperately seeking leads and suspects, and completely depending on FBI HQ and its language units to provide them with needed translated information, hundreds of translators were being told by their administrative supervisors not to translate and to let the work pile up *(please refer to the CBS-60 Minutes transcript dated October 2002, and provided to your investigators in January-February 2004).* **This issue has been confirmed by the Senate Judiciary Committee ***(Please refer to Senator Grassley and Senator Leahy's letters during the summer of 2002, provided to your investigators in January-February 2004).* This confirmed report has been reported to be substantiated by the Department of Justice Inspector General Report *(Please refer to DOJ-IG report Re: Sibel Edmonds and FBI Translation, provided to you prior to the completion of your report).* I provided your investigators with a detailed and specific", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sibeledmonds.txt:1:14894067feca", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14654, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sibeledmonds.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sibeledmonds", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "January-February 2004).* **This issue has been confirmed by the Senate Judiciary Committee ***(Please refer to Senator Grassley and Senator Leahy's letters during the summer of 2002, provided to your investigators in January-February 2004).* This confirmed report has been reported to be substantiated by the Department of Justice Inspector General Report *(Please refer to DOJ-IG report Re: Sibel Edmonds and FBI Translation, provided to you prior to the completion of your report).* I provided your investigators with a detailed and specific account of this issue and the names of other witnesses willing to corroborate this. *(Please refer to tape-recorded 3.5 hours testimony by Sibel Edmonds, provided to your investigators on February 11, 2004).* Today, almost three years after 9/11, and more than two years since this information has been confirmed and made available to our government, the administrators in charge of language departments of the FBI remain in their positions and in charge of the information front lines of the FBI's Counter terrorism and Counterintelligence efforts. **Your report has omitted any reference to this most serious issue, has foregone any accountability what so ever, and your recommendations have refrained from addressing this issue**, which when left un-addressed will have even more serious consequences.

Melek Can Dickerson used to work for a semi-legit organizations that were the FBI's targets of investigation.

Over three years ago, more than four months prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks, in April 2001, **a long-term FBI informant/asset who had been providing the bureau with information since 1990**, provided two FBI agents and a translator with specific information regarding a terrorist attack being planned by Osama Bin Laden. This asset/informant was previously a high-level intelligence officer in Iran in charge of intelligence from Afghanistan. Through his contacts in Afghanistan he **received information that: 1) Osama Bin Laden was planning a major terrorist attack in the United States targeting 4-5 major cities, 2) the attack was going to involve airplanes, 3) some of the individuals in charge of carrying out this attack were already in place in the United States, 4) the attack was going to be carried out soon, in a few months.** The agents who received this information reported it to their superior, Special Agent in Charge of Counterterrorism, Thomas Frields, at the FBI Washington Field Office, by filing \"302\" forms, and the translator translated and documented this information. **No action was taken by the Special Agent in Charge, and after 9/11, the agents and the translators were told to 'keep quiet' regarding this issue**. **The translator who was present during the session with the FBI informant, Mr. Behrooz Sarshar, reported this incident to Director Mueller in writing, and later to the Department of Justice Inspector General.** The press reported this incident, and in fact the report in the Chicago Tribune on July 21, 2004 stated that FBI officials had confirmed that this information was received in April 2001, and further, **the Chicago Tribune quoted an aide to Director Mueller that he (Mueller) was surprised that the Commission never raised this particular issue with him during the hearing** *(Please refer to Chicago Tribune article, dated July 21, 2004)*. **Mr. Sarshar reported this issue to your investigators on February 12, 2004, and provided them with specific dates, location, witness names, and the contact information **for that particular Iranian asset and the two special agents who received the information *(Please refer to the tape-recorded testimony provided to your investigators during a 2.5 hours testimony by Mr.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sibeledmonds.txt:4:268b64ac5177", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14657, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sibeledmonds.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sibeledmonds", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "surprised that the Commission never raised this particular issue with him during the hearing** *(Please refer to Chicago Tribune article, dated July 21, 2004)*. **Mr. Sarshar reported this issue to your investigators on February 12, 2004, and provided them with specific dates, location, witness names, and the contact information **for that particular Iranian asset and the two special agents who received the information *(Please refer to the tape-recorded testimony provided to your investigators during a 2.5 hours testimony by Mr. Sarshar on February 12, 2004). *I provided your investigators with a detailed and specific account of this issue, the names of other witnesses, and documents I had seen.* (Please refer to tape-recorded 3.5 hours testimony by Sibel Edmonds, provided to your investigators on February 11, 2004).* Mr. Sarshar also provided the Department of Justice Inspector General with specific information regarding this issue* ( Please refer to DOJ-IG report Re: Sibel Edmonds and FBI Translation, provided to you prior to the completion of your report).* After almost three years since September 11, many officials still refuse to admit to having specific information regarding the terrorists' plans to attack the United States. The Phoenix Memo, received months prior to the 9/11 attacks, specifically warned FBI HQ of pilot training and their possible link to terrorist activities against the United States. **Four months prior to the terrorist attacks, the Iranian asset provided the FBI with specific information regarding the** **'use of airplanes', 'major US cities as targets', and 'Osama Bin Laden issuing the order.'** Coleen Rowley likewise reported that specific information had been provided to FBI HQ. All this information went to the same place: FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC, and the FBI Washington Field Office, in Washington DC. Yet, your report claims that not having a central place where all intelligence could be gathered as one of the main factors in our intelligence failure. **Why did your report choose to exclude the information regarding the Iranian asset and Behrooz Sarshar** **from its timeline of missed opportunities? Why was this significant incident not mentioned; despite the public confirmation by the FBI, witnesses provided to your investigators, and briefings you received directly?** Why did you surprise even Director Mueller by refraining from asking him questions regarding this significant incident and lapse during your hearing *(Please remember that you ran out of questions during your hearings with Director Mueller and AG John Ashcroft, so please do not cite a 'time limit' excuse)*?

Over two years ago, and after two 'unclassified' sessions with FBI officials, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent letters to Director Mueller, Attorney General Ashcroft, and Inspector General Glenn Fine regarding the existence of unqualified translators in charge of translating high level sensitive intelligence. **The FBI confirmed at least one case: Kevin Taskesen, a Turkish translator, had been given a job as an FBI translator, despite the fact that he had failed all FBI language proficiency tests.** In fact, Kevin could not understand or speak even elementary level English. He had failed English proficiency tests and did not even score sufficiently in the target language. Still, Kevin Taskesen was hired, not due to lack of other qualified translator candidates, but because his wife worked in FBI Headquarters as a language proficiency exam administrator. Almost everybody in FBI Headquarters and the FBI Washington Field Office knew about Kevin. **Yet, Kevin was given the task of translating the most sensitive terrorist related information**, **and he was sent to Guantanamo Bay to translate the interrogation of and information for all Turkic language detainees** (Turkish, Uzbeks, Turkmen, etc.). The FBI was supposed to be trying to obtain information regarding possible future attack plans from these detainees, and yet, the FBI knowingly sent unqualified translators to gather and translate this information. Further, these detainees were either released or detained or prosecuted based on information received and translated by unqualified translators knowingly sent there by the FBI. Senator Grassley and Senator Leahy publicly confirmed Kevin Taskesen's case *(Please refer to Senate letters and documents provided to your investigators in January-February 2004)*. **CBS-60 Minutes showed Kevin's picture and stated his name as one of the unqualified translators sent to Guantanamo Bay, and as a case confirmed by the FBI** *(Please refer to CBS-60 Minutes transcript provided to your investigators)*. Department of Justice Inspector General had a detailed account of these problems *(Please refer to DOJ-IG report Re: Sibel Edmonds and FBI Translation, provided to you prior to the completion of your report)*.

Those individuals in the FBI's hiring department and those who facilitated the hiring of unqualified translators due to nepotism/cronyism are still in those departments and remain in their positions. **Yet, your report does not mention this case, or these chronic problems within the FBI translation departments, and within the FBI's hiring and screening departments.** The issue of accountability for those responsible for these practices that endangers our national security is not brought up even once in your report. This issue, as with others, is systemic and departmental. Why did your report choose to exclude this information and these serious issues despite the evidence and briefings you received? How can budget increases address and resolve the intentional continuation of ineptitude and incompetence by mid-level bureaucratic management? How can the addition of a new bureaucratic layer, *\"Intelligence Czar\"*, in its cocoon removed from the action lines, address and resolve this problem? In October 2001, approximately one month after the September 11 attack, an agent from a (city name omitted) field office, re-sent a certain document to the FBI Washington Field Office, so that it could be re-translated. This Special Agent, in light of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, rightfully believed that, considering his target of investigation (the suspect under surveillance), and the issues involved, the original translation might have missed certain information that could prove to be valuable in the investigation of terrorist activities. After this document was received by the FBI Washington Field Office and retranslated verbatim, the field agent's hunch appeared to be correct. The new translation revealed certain information regarding blueprints, pictures, and building material for skyscrapers being sent overseas. It also revealed certain illegal activities in obtaining visas from certain embassies in the Middle East, through network contacts and bribery. However, after the re-translation was completed and the new significant information was revealed, the unit supervisor in charge of certain Middle Eastern languages, Mike Feghali, decided NOT to send the re-translated information to the Special Agent who had requested it. Instead, this supervisor decided to send this agent a note stating that the translation was reviewed and that the original translation was accurate.

This information was also provided to the Department of Justice Inspector General *(Please refer to DOJ-IG report Re: Sibel Edmonds and FBI Translation, provided to you prior to the completion of your report).* Only one month after the catastrophic events of September 11; while many agents were working around the clock to obtain leads and information, and to investigate those responsible for the attacks, those with possible connections to the attack, and those who might be planning possible future attacks; the bureaucratic administrators in the FBI's largest and most important translation unit were covering up their past failures, blocking important leads and information, and jeopardizing on going terrorist investigations. The supervisor involved in this incident, Mike Feghali, was in charge of certain important Middle Eastern languages within the FBI Washington Field Office, and had a record of previous misconducts. **After this supervisor's several severe misconducts were reported to the FBI's higher-level management, after his conducts were reported to the Inspector General's Office, to the United States Congress, and to the 9/11 Commission, he was promoted to include the FBI's Arabic language unit under his supervision.** Today this supervisor, Mike Feghali, remains in the FBI Washington Field Office and is in charge of a language unit receiving those *chitchats* that our color-coded threat system is based upon. Yet **your report contains zero information regarding these systemic problems that led us to our failure in preventing the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In your report, there are no references to individuals responsible for hindering past and current investigations, or those who are willing to compromise our security and our lives for their career advancement and security.** This issue, as with others, is systemic and departmental.

How can budget increases address and resolve these intentional acts committed by self-serving career civil servants? How can the addition of a new bureaucratic layer, *\"Intelligence Czar\"*, in its cocoon removed from the action lines, address and resolve this problem? The latest buzz topic regarding intelligence is the problem of sharing information/intelligence within intelligence agencies and between intelligence agencies. **To this date the public has not been told of intentional blocking of intelligence**, and has not been told that certain information, despite its direct links, impacts and ties to terrorist related activities, is not given to or shared with Counterterrorism units, their investigations, and countering terrorism related activities. This was the case prior to 9/11, and remains in effect after 9/11. If Counterintelligence receives information that contains money laundering, illegal arms sale, and illegal drug activities, directly linked to terrorist activities; and if that information involves certain nations, certain semi-legit organizations, and ties to certain lucrative or political relations in this country, then, that information is not shared with Counterterrorism, regardless of the possible severe consequences. In certain cases, frustrated FBI agents cited *'direct pressure by the State Department,'* and in other cases 'sensitive diplomatic relations' is cited. The Department of Justice Inspector General received detailed and specific information and evidence regarding this issue *( Please refer to DOJ-IG report Re: Sibel Edmonds and FBI Translation, provided to you prior to the completion of your report)*. I provided your investigators with a detailed and specific account of this issue, the names of other witnesses willing to corroborate this, and the names of certain U.S. officials involved in these transactions and activities. *( Please refer to tape-recorded 3.5 hours testimony by Sibel Edmonds, provided to your investigators on February 11, 2004).* **After almost three years the American people still do not know that thousands of lives can be jeopardized under the unspoken policy of** **'protecting certain foreign business relations.'** **The victims' family members still do not realize that information and answers they have sought relentlessly for over two years has been blocked due to the unspoken decisions made and disguised under** **'safeguarding certain diplomatic relations.'** **Your report did not even attempt to address these unspoken practices, although, unlike me, you were not placed under any gag.** Your hearings did not include questions regarding these unspoken and unwritten policies and practices. **Despite your full awareness and understanding of certain criminal conduct that connects to certain terrorist related activities, committed by certain U.S. officials and high-level", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sibeledmonds.txt:9:804fb85d8f61", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14662, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sibeledmonds.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sibeledmonds", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "relentlessly for over two years has been blocked due to the unspoken decisions made and disguised under** **'safeguarding certain diplomatic relations.'** **Your report did not even attempt to address these unspoken practices, although, unlike me, you were not placed under any gag.** Your hearings did not include questions regarding these unspoken and unwritten policies and practices. **Despite your full awareness and understanding of certain criminal conduct that connects to certain terrorist related activities, committed by certain U.S. officials and high-level government employees,** **you have not proposed criminal investigations into this conduct, although under the laws of this country you are required to do so. **How can budget increases address and resolve these problems, when some of them are caused by unspoken practices and unwritten policies? How can a new bureaucratic layer, *\"Intelligence Czar\"*, in its cocoon removed from the action lines, override these unwritten policies and unspoken practices incompatible with our national security? I know for a fact that problems regarding intelligence translation cannot be brushed off as minor problems among many significant problems. Translation units are the frontline in gathering, translating, and disseminating intelligence. A warning in advance of the next terrorist attack may, and probably will, come in the form of a message or document in foreign language that will have to be translated. That message may be given to the translation unit headed and supervised by someone like Mike Feghali, who slows down, even stops, translations for the purpose of receiving budget increases for his department, who has participated in certain criminal activities and security breaches, and who has been engaged in covering up failures and criminal conducts within the department, so it may never be translated in time if ever. That message may go to Kevin Taskesen, or another unqualified translator; so it may never be translated correctly and be acted upon. That message may go to a sympathizer within the language department; so it may never be translated fully, if at all. That message may come to the attention of an agent of a foreign organization who works as a translator in the FBI translation department, who may choose to block it; so it may never get translated. If then an attack occurs, which could have been prevented by acting on information in that message, who will tell family members of the new terrorist attack victims that nothing more could have been done? There will be no excuse that we did not know, because we do know. I am writing this letter in light of my direct experience within the FBI's translation unit during the most crucial times after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in light of my first hand knowledge of certain problems and cases within the Bureau's language units, and in light of what has already been established as facts.

Fired after sounding the alarm, she's now fighting for the ideals that made her an American, and threatening some very powerful people.** **By David Rose Vanity Fair September 2005 **[Page 264-282] In Washington, D.C., and its suburbs, December 2, 2001 was fine but cool, the start of the slide into winter after a spell of unseasonable warmth. At 10 o'clock that morning, Sibel and Matthew Edmonds were still in their pajamas, sipping coffee in the kitchen of their waterfront town house in Alexandria, Virginia, and looking forward to a well-deserved lazy Sunday. Since mid-September, nine days after the 9/11 attacks, Sibel had been exploiting her fluency in Turkish, Farsi, and Azerbaijani as a translator at the F.B.I. It was arduous, demanding work, and Edmonds - who had two bachelor's degrees, was about to begin studying for her master's, and had plans for a doctorate - could have been considered overqualified. But as a naturalized Turkish-American, she saw the job as her patriotic duty. The Edmondses' thoughts were turning to brunch when Matthew answered the telephone. The caller was a woman he barely knew - Melek Can Dickerson, who worked with Sibel at the F.B.I. \"I'm in the area with my husband and I'd love you to meet him,\" Dickerson said. \"Is it O.K. if we come by?\" Taken by surprise, Sibel and Matthew hurried to shower and dress. Their guests arrived 30 minutes later. Matthew, a big man with a fuzz of gray beard, who at 60 was nearly twice the age of his petite, vivacious wife, showed them into the kitchen. They sat at a round, faux-marble table while Sibel brewed tea. Melek's husband, Douglas, a U.S. Air Force major who had spent several years as a military attaché in the Turkish capital of Ankara, did most of the talking, Matthew recalls. \"He was pretty outspoken, pretty outgoing about meeting his wife in Turkey, and about his job. He was in weapons procurement.\" Like Matthew, he was older than his wife, who had been born about a year before Sibel. According to Sibel, Douglas asked if she and Matthew were involved with the local Turkish community, and whether they were members of two of its organized groups - the American-Turkish Council (A.T.C.) and the Assembly of Turkish American Associations (A.T.A.A.). \"He said the A.T.C. was a good organization to belong to,\" Matthew says. \"It could help to ensure that we could retire early and live well, which was just what he and his wife planned to do.

I said I was aware of the organization, but I thought you had to be in a relevant business in order to join. \"Then he pointed at Sibel and said, 'All you have to do is tell them who you work for and what you do and you will get in very quickly.'\" Matthew could see that his wife was far from comfortable: \"She tried to change the conversation to the weather and such-like.\" But the Dickersons, says Matthew, steered it back to what they called their \"network of high-level friends.\" Some, they said, worked at the Turkish Embassy in Washington. \"They said they even went shopping weekly for [one of them] at a Mediterranean market,\" Matthew says. \"They used to take him special Turkish bread.\" Before long, the Dickersons left. At the time, Matthew says, he found it \"a strange conversation for the first time you meet a couple. Why would someone I'd never met say such things?\" Only Sibel knew just how strange.** A large part of her work at the F.B.I. involved listening to the wiretapped conversations of people who were the targets of counter-intelligence investigations. As she would later tell investigators from the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General (O.I.G.) and the U.S. Congress, some of those targets were Turkish officials the Dickersons had described as high-level friends. In Sibel's view, the Dickersons had asked the Edmondses to befriend F.B.I. suspects. (In August 2002, Melek Can Dickerson called Sibel's allegations \"preposterous, ludicrous and slanderous.\")** Sibel also recalled hearing wiretaps indicating that Turkish Embassy targets frequently spoke to staff members at the A.T.C., one of the organizations that Turkish Embassy targets frequently spoke to staff members at the A.T.C., one of the organizations that the Dickersons allegedly wanted her and her husband to join. **Sibel later told the O.I.G. she assumed that the A.T.C.'s board - which is chaired by Brent Scowcroft, President George H. W. Bush's national - security advisor - knew nothing of the use to which it was being put. But the wiretaps suggested to her that the Washington office of the A.T.C. was being used as a front for criminal activity.** Sibel and Matthew stood at the window of their oak-paneled hallway and watched the Dickersons leave. Sibel's Sunday has been ruined. Immediately and in the weeks that followed, Sibel Edmonds tried to persuade her bosses to investigate the Dickersons. There was more to her suspicions than their peculiar Sunday visit. According to the documents filed by Edmonds's lawyers,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sibeledmondsvanityfair.txt:1:13fe3e3761cd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14667, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sibeledmondsvanityfair.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sibeledmondsvanityfair", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "But the wiretaps suggested to her that the Washington office of the A.T.C. was being used as a front for criminal activity.** Sibel and Matthew stood at the window of their oak-paneled hallway and watched the Dickersons leave. Sibel's Sunday has been ruined. Immediately and in the weeks that followed, Sibel Edmonds tried to persuade her bosses to investigate the Dickersons. There was more to her suspicions than their peculiar Sunday visit. According to the documents filed by Edmonds's lawyers, Sibel believed Melek Can Dickerson had leaked information to one or more targets of an F.B.I. investigation, and had tried to prevent Edmonds from listening to wiretaps of F.B.I. targets herself.** But instead of carrying out a thorough investigation of her allegations, at the end of March 2002 the F.B.I. fired Edmonds.** Edmonds is not the first avowed national security whistle-blower to suffer retaliation at the hands of a government bureaucracy that feels threatened or embarrassed. But being fired is one thing. Edmonds has also been prevented from proceeding with her court challenge or even speaking with complete freedom about the case. **On top of the usual prohibition against disclosing classified information, the Bush administration has smothered her case beneath the all-encompassing blanket of the \"state-secrets privilege\" - a Draconian and rarely used legal weapon that allows the government, merely by asserting a risk to national security, to prevent the lawsuits Edmonds has filed contesting her treatment from being heard in court at all. According to the Department of Justice, to allow Edmonds her day in court, even at a closed hearing attended only by personnel with full security clearance, \"could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to the foreign policy and national security of the United States.\"** Using the state-secrets privilege in this fashion is unusual, says Edmonds's attorney Ann Beeson, of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"It also begs the question: Just what in the world is the government trying to hide?\" It may be more than another embarrassing security scandal. One counter-intelligence official familiar with Edmonds's case has told Vanity Fair that the F.B.I. opened an investigation into covert activities by Turkish nationals in the late 1990's. That inquiry found evidence, mainly via wiretaps, of attempts to corrupt senior American politicians in at least two major cities - Washington and Chicago. Toward the end of 2001, Edmonds was asked to translate some of the thousands of calls that had been recorded by this operation, some dating back to 1997. **Edmonds has given confidential testimony inside a secure Sensitive Compartmented Information facility on several occasions: to congressional staffers, to investigators from the O.I.G., and to the staff from the 9/11 commission.

Sources familiar with this testimony say that, in addition to her allegations about the Dickersons, she reported hearing Turkish wiretap targets boast that they had a covert relationship with a very senior politician indeed - Dennis Hastert, Republican congressman from Illinois and Speaker of the House since 1999. The targets reportedly discussed giving Hastert tens of thousands of dollars in surreptitious payments in exchange for political favors and information. \"The Dickersons,\" says one official familiar with the case, \"are only the tip of the iceberg.\"** It's safe to say that Edmonds inherited her fearless obstinacy from her father, Rasim Deniz, who died in 2000. Born in the Tabriz region of northwestern Iran, many of whose natives speak Farsi (Persian), Turkish, and Azerbaijani, he was one of the Middle East's leading reconstructive surgeons, but his forthright liberal and secular opinions brought him into a series of conflicts with the local regimes. One of Sibel's earliest memories is of a search of her family's house in Tehran by members of SAVAK, the Shah's secret police, who were looking for left-wing books. Later, in 1981, came a terrifying evening after the Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamist revolution, when Sibel was 11. She was waiting in the car while her father went into a restaurant for takeout. By the time Deniz returned, his vehicle had been boxed in by government S.U.V.'s and Sibel was surrounded by black-clad revolutionary guards, who announced they were taking her to jail because her headscarf was insufficiently modest. \"My father showed his ID and asked them, 'Do you know who I am?,'\" Sibel says. \"He had been doing pro bono work in the slums of south Tehran for years, and now it was the height of the Iran-Iraq war. He told them, 'I have treated so many of your brothers. If you take my daughter, next time I have one in my operating room who needs an amputation at the wrist, I will cut his arm off at the shoulder.' They let me go.\" It was time to get out. As soon as he could, Deniz abandoned his property and his post as head of the burn center at one of Tehran's most prestigious hospitals, and the family fled to Turkey. **When Sibel was 17, she wrote a paper for a high-school competition. Her chosen subject was Turkey's censorship laws, and why it was wrong to ban books and jail dissident writers. Her principal was outraged, she says, and asked her father to get her to write something else. Denis refused, but the incident caused a family crisis. \"My uncle was mayor of Istanbul, and suddenly my", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sibeledmondsvanityfair.txt:3:77aa81238843", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14669, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sibeledmondsvanityfair.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sibeledmondsvanityfair", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "center at one of Tehran's most prestigious hospitals, and the family fled to Turkey. **When Sibel was 17, she wrote a paper for a high-school competition.

Denis refused, but the incident caused a family crisis. \"My uncle was mayor of Istanbul, and suddenly my essay was being discussed in an emergency meeting of the whole Deniz tribe. My dad was the only one who supported what I'd done. That was the last straw for me. I decided to take a break and go to the United States. I came here and fell in love with a lot of things - freedom. Now I wonder: was it just an illusion?\"** Sibel enrolled at a college in Maryland, where she studied English and hotel management; later, she received bachelor's degrees at George Washington University in criminal justice and psychology, and worked with juvenile offenders. In 1992, at age 22, she had married Matthew Edmonds, a divorced retail-technology consultant who had lived in Virginia all his life. For a long time, they lived an idyllic, carefree life. They bought their house in Alexandria, and Sibel transformed it into an airy spacious haven, with marble floors, a library, and breathtaking views across the Potomac River to Washington. Matthew had always wanted to visit Russia, and at Sibel's suggestion they spent three months in St. Petersburg, working with a children's hospital charity run by the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Sibel's family visited America often, and she and Matthew spent their summers at a cottage they had bought in Bodrum, Turkey, on the Aegean coast. \"People said we wouldn't last two years,\" Sibel says, \"And here we still are, nearly 13 years on. A lot of people who go through the kind of experiences I've had find they put a huge strain on their marriage. Matthew is my rock. I couldn't have done it without him.\" In 1978, when Sibel was eight and the Islamists' violent prelude to the Iranian revolution was just beginning, a bomb went off in a movie theater next to her elementary school. \"I can remember sitting in the car, seeing the rescuers pulling charred bodies and stumps out of the fire. Then, on September 11, to see this thing happening here, across the ocean - it brought it all back.

Some 200 to 300 translators sat in this vast, open space, listening with headphones to digitally recorded wiretaps. The job carried heavy responsibilities. \"You are the front line,\" Edmonds says. \"You are the filter for every piece of intelligence which comes in foreign languages. It's down to you to decide what's important - 'pertinent,' as the F.B.I. calls it, and what's not. You decide what requires verbatim translation, what can be summarized, and what should be marked 'not pertinent' and left alone. By the time this material reaches the agents and analysts, you've already decided what they're going to get.\" To get this right requires a broad background of cultural and political knowledge: \"If you're simply a linguist, you won't be able to discern these differences.\" She was surprised to discover that until her arrival the F.B.I. had employed no Turkish-language specialists at all. In early October she was joined by a second Turkish translator, who had been hired despite his having failed language-proficiency tests. Several weeks later, a third Turkish speaker joined the department: Melek Can Dickerson. In her application for the job, she wrote that she had not previously worked in America. In fact, however, she had spent two years as an intern at an organization that figured in many of the wiretaps - the American-Turkish Council. **Much later, after Edmonds was fired, the F.B.I. gave briefings to the House and Senate. One source who was present says bureau officials admitted that Dickerson had concealed her history with the A.T.C., not only in writing but also when interviewed as part of her background security check. In addition, the officials conceded that Dickerson began a friendship at the A.T.C. with one of the F.B.I.'s targets. \"They confirmed that when she was supposed to be listening to his calls,\" says one congressional source. \"To me, that was like asking a friend of a mobster to listen to him ordering hits. **She might have an allegiance problem. But they seemed not to get it.They blew off their friendship as 'just a social thing.' They told us 'They had been colleagues at work, after all.'\" Shortly after the house visit from the Dickersons, Sibel conveyed her version of the event to her supervisor, Mike Feghali - first orally and then in writing. The \"supervisory language specialist\" responsible for linguists working in several Middle Eastern languages, Feghali is a Lebanese-American who had previously been an F.B.I.

The \"supervisory language specialist\" responsible for linguists working in several Middle Eastern languages, Feghali is a Lebanese-American who had previously been an F.B.I. Arabic translator for many years. Edmonds says he told her not to worry. To monitor every call on every line at a large institution such as the Turkish Embassy in Washington would not be feasible. Inevitably, the F.B.I. listens more carefully to phones used by its targets, such as the Dickersons' purported friend. In the past, the assignment of lines to each translator has always been random: Edmonds might have found herself listening to a potentially significant conversation by a counter-intelligence target one minute and an innocuous discussion about some diplomatic party the next. Now, however, according to Edmonds, Dickerson suggested changing this system, so that each Turkish speaker would be permanently responsible for certain lines. She produced a list of names and numbers, together with her proposals for dividing them up. As Edmonds would later tell her F.B.I. bosses and congressional investigators, Dickerson had assigned the American-Turkish Council and three other \"high-value\" diplomatic targets, including her friend, to herself. Edmonds found this arrangement very questionable. But she says that Dickerson spent a large part of that afternoon talking with Feghali inside his office. The next day he announced in an e-mail that he had decided to assign the Turkish wiretaps on exactly the basis recommended by Dickerson. Like all his translators, Edmonds was effectively working with two, parallel lines of management: Feghali and the senior translation-department bosses above him, on one hand, and, on the other, the investigators and agents who actually used the material she translated. Early in the new year, 2002, Edmonds says, she discovered that Dennis Saccher, the F.B.I.'s special agent in charge of Turkish counter-intelligence, had developed his own, quite separate concerns about Dickerson. **On the morning of January 14, Sibel says, Saccher asked Edmonds to come into his cramped cubicle on the fifth floor. On his desk were printouts from the F.B.I. language-department database. They showed that on numerous occasions Dickerson had marked calls involving her friend and other counter-intelligence targets as \"not pertinent,\" or had submitted only brief summaries stating that they contained nothing of interest. Some of these calls had a duration of more than 15 minutes. Saccher asked Edmonds why she was no longer working on these targets' conversations. She explained the new division of labor, and went on to tell him about the Dickersons' visit the previous month. Saccher was appalled, Edmonds says, telling her, \"It sounds like espionage to me.\"** Saccher asked Edmonds and a colleague, Kevin Taskasen, to go back into the F.B.I.'s digital wiretap archive and listen to some of the calls that Dickerson", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sibeledmondsvanityfair.txt:6:47472a9afb7c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14672, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sibeledmondsvanityfair.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sibeledmondsvanityfair", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "had a duration of more than 15 minutes.

Saccher suggested that they all meet with Feghali in a conference room on Friday, February 1. First, however, Edmonds and Taskasen should go to Saccher's office for a short pre-meeting - to review their findings and to discuss how to handle Feghali. Edmonds had time to listen to numerous calls before the Friday meeting, and some of them sounded important. According to her later secure testimony, in one conversation, recorded shortly after Dickerson reserved the targets' calls for herself, a Turkish official spoke directly to a U.S. State Department staffer. They suggested that the State Department staffer would send a representative at an appointed time to the American-Turkish Council office, at 1111 14th St. NW, where he would be given $7,000 in cash. \"She told us she'd heard mention of exchanges of information, dead drops - that kind of thing,\" a congressional source says. \"It was mostly money in exchange for secrets.\" (A spokesperson for the A.T.C. denies that the organization has ever been involved in espionage or illegal payments. And a spokesperson for the Assembly of Turkish American Associations said that to suggest the group was involved with espionage or illegal payments is \"ridiculous.\") **Another call allegedly discussed a payment to a Pentagon official, who seemed to be involved in weapons-procurement negotiations. Yet another implied that Turkish groups had been installing doctoral students at U.S. research institutions in order to acquire information about black market nuclear weapons. In fact, much of what Edmonds reportedly heard seemed to concern not state espionage but criminal activity. There was talk, she told investigators, of laundering the profits of large-scale drug deals and of selling classified military technologies to the highest bidder.** Before entering the F.B.I. building for their Friday meeting with Saccher, Edmonds and Taskasen stood for a while on the sidewalk, smoking cigarettes. \"Afterwards, we went directly to Saccher's office,\" Edmonds says. \"We talked for a little while, and he said he'd see us downstairs for the meeting with Feghali a few minutes later, at nine A.M.\" They were barely out of the elevator when Feghali intercepted them. He didn't know they had just come from Saccher's office. **\"Come on, we're going to start the meeting,\" he said. \"By the way, Dennis Saccher can't be there, He's been sent out somewhere in the field.\" Later, Edmonds says, she called", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sibeledmondsvanityfair.txt:7:cad31aae75d3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14673, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sibeledmondsvanityfair.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sibeledmondsvanityfair", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "office,\" Edmonds says. \"We talked for a little while, and he said he'd see us downstairs for the meeting with Feghali a few minutes later, at nine A.M.\" They were barely out of the elevator when Feghali intercepted them. He didn't know they had just come from Saccher's office. **\"Come on, we're going to start the meeting,\" he said. \"By the way, Dennis Saccher can't be there, He's been sent out somewhere in the field.\" Later, Edmonds says, she called Saccher on the internal phone. \"Why the hell did you cancel?\" she asked. Bewildered, he told her that immediately after she and Taskasen had left his office Feghali phoned him, saying that the conference room was already in use, and that the meeting would have to be postponed.** **Edmonds says Saccher also told her that he had been ordered not to touch the case by his own superiors, who called it a \"can of worms.\" Despite his role as special agent in charge of Turkish counter-intelligence, he had even been forbidden to obtain copies of her translations. Saccher had two small children and a settled life in Washington. If he dared to complain, Edmonds says, he risked being assigned \"to some fucked-up office in the land of tornadoes.\"** Instead, Edmonds was ushered into the windowless office of Feghali's colleague, translation-department supervisor Stephanie Bryan. Investigating possible espionage was not a task for which Bryan had been trained or equipped. Bryan heard Edmonds out and told her to set down her allegations in a confidential memo. Edmonds says that Bryan approved of her writing it at home. Edmonds gave the document to Bryan on Monday, February 11. Early the following afternoon, the supervisor summoned Edmonds. Waiting in a nearby office were two other people, Feghali and Melek Can Dickerson. In front of them were Edmonds's translations of the wiretaps and her memo. \"Stephanie said that she'd taken my memo to the supervisory special agent, Tom Frields,\" Edmonds says. \"He apparently wouldn't even look at it until Mike Feghali and Dickerson and seen it and been given a chance to comment. Stephanie said that, working for the government, there were certain things you didn't do, and criticizing your colleagues' work was one of them. She told me, 'Do you realize what this means? If you were right, the people who did the background checks would have to be investigated. The whole translation department could be shaken up!' Meanwhile, I was going to be investigated for a possible security breach - for putting classified information on my home computer. I was told to go the security department at three P.M.\" **Before Edmonds left, Dickerson had time to sidle over to her desk. According to Edmonds, she made what sounded like a threat: \"Why are you doing this, Sibel? Why don't you just drop it? You know there could be serious consequences.

According to Edmonds, she made what sounded like a threat: \"Why are you doing this, Sibel? Why don't you just drop it? You know there could be serious consequences. Why put your family in Turkey in danger over this?\"** **Edmonds says the F.B.I.'s response to her was beginning to shift from indifference to outright retaliation. On February 13, the day after her interview with the bureau security office, three agents came to her home and seized the computer she shared with her husband. \"I hadn't had time to back up the data, and I told them that most of my business was on that computer, Matthew Edmonds says.** \"An agent called the next morning,\" Matthew says. \"He told me, 'Everything on your computer is destroyed, and we didn't back it up.' They were playing games. When I got the computer back, they had wiped out everything. Four days later, I got a CD-ROM with it all backed up.\" A lifelong conservative Republican, Matthew was being shocked into changing his worldview. I was so naïve. I mean, what do you do if you think your colleague might be a spy? You go to the F.B.I.! I thought if Sibel's supervisor wasn't fixing this problem she should go to his superior, and so on up the chain. Someone would eventually fix it. I was never a cynical person. I am now.\" While the agents were examining the Edmondses' computer, Mike Feghali was writing a memo for his own managers, stating \"there was no basis\" for Sibel's allegations. A day earlier, an F.B.I. security officer had interviewed Dickerson. A report issued by the O.I.G. in January 2005 states, \"The Security Officer did not challenge the co-worker [Dickerson] with respect to any information the co-worker provided, although that information was not consistent with F.B.I. records. In addition.he did not review other crucial F.B.I. records, which would have supported some of Edmonds' allegations.\" Instead, he treated her claims as \"performance issues,\" and \"seemed not to appreciate or investigate the allegation that a co-worker may have been committing espionage. According to a congressional source, the fact that Edmonds was a mere contract linguist, rather than an agent, made her claims less palatable. \"They seemed to be saying, 'We don't need someone like this making trouble,'\" the source says. \"Yet, to her credit, she really did go up through the chain of command: to her boss, his boss, and so on.\" **Edmonds reached the top of the language-section management on February 22, when she met with supervisory special agent Tom Frields, a gray-haired veteran who was approaching the end", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sibeledmondsvanityfair.txt:9:7096416e39a5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14675, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sibeledmondsvanityfair.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sibeledmondsvanityfair", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "was a mere contract linguist, rather than an agent, made her claims less palatable. \"They seemed to be saying, 'We don't need someone like this making trouble,'\" the source says. \"Yet, to her credit, she really did go up through the chain of command: to her boss, his boss, and so on.\" **Edmonds reached the top of the language-section management on February 22, when she met with supervisory special agent Tom Frields, a gray-haired veteran who was approaching the end of a long bureau career. At first it seemed he was trying to set her mind at rest: \"He told me, I just want to assure you that everything is fine, and as far as you're concerned, your work on this matter is done,'\" Edmonds says. \"I told him, 'No, it's not fine. My family is worried about possible threats to their safety in Turkey.' His face went through a transformation. He warned me that these issues were classified at the highest level and must not be disclosed to anyone. He started to interrogate me: Who had I told? He said if it was anyone unauthorized he could have me arrested.\"** Edmonds's meeting with Frields on the 22nd was probably her last chance to save her job. The inspector general's 2005 report disclosed, \"Immediately after the meeting, [Frields] began to explore whether the F.B.I. had the option to cease using Edmonds as a contract linguist.\" Four days later the bureau's contracting unit told him, \"If it was determined that [she] was unsuitable, the F.B.I. would have sufficient reason to terminate her contract.\" Stymied by Frields, Edmonds tried to go still higher, and on March 7 she was granted an audience with James Caruso, the F.B.I.'s deputy assistant director for counterterrorism and counter-intelligence. Edmonds says he listened politely for more than an hour but took no notes and asked no questions. Afterward, Matthew picked her up and they drove to the Capital Grille for an early lunch. It was only 11:30 and the restaurant was still empty, but as the Edmondses began to study their menus, they saw two men in suits pull up outside in an F.B.I.-issue S.U.V. They came inside and sat down at the next table. \"They just sat and stared at Sibel,\" Matthew says. \"They took out their cell phones, opened them, and put them on the table. They didn't eat or drink - just sat, staring at Sibel, the whole time we were there.\" Modified cell phones, Sibel knew, are commonly used by bureau agents as a means of making covert recordings. That afternoon, Sibel wrote to two official bodies with powers to investigate the F.B.I. - the Justice Department's internal affairs division, known as the Office of Professional Responsibility, and its independent watchdog, the O.IG. She went on to send faxes to the Senate Intelligence Committee and Senators Charles Grassley, Republican from Iowa, and Patrick", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:sibeledmondsvanityfair.txt:10:baa07c422601", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14676, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "sibeledmondsvanityfair.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "sibeledmondsvanityfair", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "at Sibel, the whole time we were there.\" Modified cell phones, Sibel knew, are commonly used by bureau agents as a means of making covert recordings.

She went on to send faxes to the Senate Intelligence Committee and Senators Charles Grassley, Republican from Iowa, and Patrick Leahy, Democrat from Vermont, both of whom sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, to say that she had found evidence of possible national-security breaches. **On March 8, Sibel appeared at a dingy little office in Washington's China Town, where she was polygraphed. According to the 2005 inspector general's report, the purpose of this examination was to discover whether she had made unauthorized disclosures of classified information. \"She was not deceptive in her answers,\" the O.I.G. reported.** **Dickerson was polygraphed two weeks later, on March 21, and she too was deemed to have passed. But, according to an official cited in the report, the questions she was asked were vague and unspecific. \"The polygraph unit chief admitted that questions directly on point could have been asked but were not.\" Nevertheless, then and for a long time afterward, \"the FBI continued to rely on the [Dickerson] polygraph as support for its position that Edmonds' allegations were unfounded.\"** Dickerson's polygraph test, however unsatisfactory, seems to have sealed Edmonds' fate at the FBI. The following afternoon, she was asked to wait in Stephanie Bryan's office. \"Feghali saw me sitting there and leaned across the doorway,\" Edmonds says. \"He tapped his watch and said, 'In less than an hour you will be fired, you whore.'\" A few minutes later, she was summoned to a meeting with Frields. They were joined by Bryan and George Stukenbroeker, the chief of personal security and the man in charge of investigating her case. Edmonds had violated every security rule in the book, Stukenbroeker said. A hulking security guard arrived to help escort her from the building. Edmonds asked if she could return to her desk to retrieve some photos, including shots of her late father of which she had no copies. Bryan refused, saying, \"You'll never set foot in the FBI again.\" Bryan promised to forward them, says Edmonds, who never got the photos back. Edmonds looked at Frields. \"You are only making your wrongdoing worse, and my case stronger. I will see you very soon,\" she told him. According to Edmonds, Frields replied, \"Soon maybe, but it will be in jail. I'll see you in jail.\" (When interviewed by the O.I.G., Frields and another witness denied making this comment.) Matthew was waiting outside. \"I'm not a crybaby,\" Sibel says. \"But as I got into my husband's car that afternoon, I was in floods, shaking.

As soon as she returned home from the February meeting where Dickerson allegedly cautioned her not to endanger her family in Turkey, Sibel called her mother and sister in Istanbul, even though it was the middle of the night there. Sibel is the oldest of three sisters. The youngest was studying in America and living with the Edmondses in Alexandria, but the middle sister - whose name Edmonds wishes to protect - was enjoying a successful career at an international travel company based in Istanbul. The 29-year-old was also engaged to be married. Within days of receiving Sibel's call, she flew with her mother to Washington. Early in April, Sibel and Matthew were having lunch in their favorite Thai restaurant in Old Town Alexandria - a precious chance, with their house now fully occupied with Sibel's family, to share a private moment together. \"My phone rang,\" Sibel says. \"It was my middle sister. She said something really bad had happened and I must come back at once.\" The sister's Istanbul neighbor had just phoned, saying that two policemen had knocked on her door, asking for the sister's whereabouts. They would not disclose the reason, saying only that it was an \"intelligence matter.\" They also left a document. Sent by Tevfik Asici of the Atakoy Branch Police Station and dated April 11, it was addressed to Sibel's sister and read, \"For an important issue your deposition/interrogation is required. If you do not report to the station within 5 days, between 09:00 and 17:00, as is required by Turkish law CMK.132, you will be taken/arrested by force.\" In July 2002, with a written recommendation from Senator Grassley, Sibel's sister requested political asylum in the United States. Her application statement cited the threat allegedly made by Dickerson, adding that Sibel would be considered \"a spy and a traitor to Turkey under Turkish law, and the Turkish police will use me to get at her. Turkish police are known for using cruelty and torture during interrogation; subjects are kept without advice to family members and often disappear with no trace.\" Estranged from Sibel, the sister remains in America, unable to go home. **Edmonds did what numerous avowed whistleblowers had done before: she appealed to congress, and she got a lawyer - David Colapinto of the Washington firm of Kohn, Kohn and Calapinto, which advertises itself on its Web site as specializing in cases of this kind.

He filed suit under the Freedom of Information Act for full disclosure of what happened inside the bureau, and submitted a claim for damages for the violation of Edmonds's constitutional rights. By August he was ready to depose Douglas Can Dickerson. But before their scheduled deposition, the couple abruptly left the country. Douglas had been assigned to an air-force job in Belgium. Virgil Magee, a U.S. Air Force spokesman in Belgium, confirms that Dickerson remains on active duty in Europe, but refuses to say exactly where.** **That fall, Attorney General John Ashcroft tried to wipe out Edmonds's legal action by invoking the state secrets privilege. This recourse, derived form English common law, has never been the subject of any congressional vote or statute. Normally, says Ann Beeson of the A.C.L.U., it is used be the government when it wants to resist the legal \"discovery\" in court of a specific piece of evidence that it fears might harm national security if publicized. But in Edmonds case Ashcroft argued that the very subject of her lawsuit was a state secret. To air her claims in front of federal judges would jeopardize national security.** This, Beeson says, had distinct advantages for the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice: it meant they did not have to contest the merits of her claims. Moreover, the substance of the arguments they used to justify this level of secrecy was and is secret itself. The full version of Ashcroft's declaration invoking the privilege, filed on October 18, 2002, was classified, and in the public case for blocking Edmonds's action rested on the mere assertion that it would be damaging to proceed. Later, in 2004, the law firm of Motley Rice sought to depose her for a pending case on behalf of the families of 9/11 victims. Immediately, Ashcroft asserted the privilege again. Motley Rice submitted a list of questions it wanted to ask Edmonds, almost all of which were prohibited. Among them: \"When and where were you born?,\" \"What languages do you speak?,\" and \"Where did you go to school?\" Edmonds still wanted to fight, and to challenge Ashcroft in court. But over the next few months, the relationship with her lawyers began to suffer. \"Let's face it, taking on the D.O.J. is no joke, especially in Washington,\" Edmonds says.

They fired her and, interestingly, they continued my contract.\" In September 2002, Colonel James Worth of the Office of the Air Force Inspector General said that, in response to a letter from Edmonds, there had been a \"complete and thorough review of Major [Douglas] Dickerson's relationship with the American-Turkish Council\" that found \"no evidence of any deviation from the scope of his duties.\" Edmonds says she was not interviewed by those conducting the review. **Edmonds' treatment by the F.B.I. seems to fit two baleful patterns: the first is the bureau's refusal to address potentially disastrous internal-security flaws; the second is a general tendency among national-security agencies to retaliate against whistle-blowers.** Amid the lush greenery of his parents' garden in Plattsmouth, Nebraska; former F.B.I. senior intelligence-operations specialist John Cole describes how these institutional inclinations combined to destroy his career. Now 44, Cole joined the F.B.I. in 1985. By the late 1990's, he was running undercover operations in the Washington area, focusing on counter-terrorism and counter-intelligence. Later, while playing a key role in the 9/11 investigation, he became the F.B.I.'s national counter-intelligence program manager for India, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Early in the fall of 2001, Cole was asked to assess whether a woman who had applied to work as a translator of Urdu, Pakistan's national language, might pose a risk to security. \"The personnel security officer said she thought there was something that didn't seem right,\" Cole says. \"I went through the file, and it stuck out a mile: she was the daughter of a retired Pakistani general who had been their military attaché in Washington.\" He adds that, to his knowledge, \"Every single military attaché they've ever assigned has been a known intelligence officer.\" After September 11, this association looked especially risky. The Pakistani intelligence service had trained and supported the Taliban in Afghanistan, and still contained elements who were far from happy with President Pervez Musharraf's pro-American policies.

Cole gave his findings to the security officer. \"Well done,\" she said. \"You've found it.\" A week later, she called Cole again, to say that the woman had started work that morning with a top-secret security clearance. F.B.I. director Robert Mueller had promised Congress that the bureau would hire lots of new Middle Eastern linguists, and normal procedures had been short-circuited as a result. As of July 2005, the woman was still a bureau translator. Sibel Edmonds said she remembers her well - as the leader of a group that pressed for separate restrooms for Muslims. Cole says the incident was only one of several that caused him to doubt the quality and security of the FBI's counterterrorism efforts, and, like Edmonds, he says he tried to fix the problems he saw by going up the chain of command. Getting rid of an agent of his stature was a lot more difficult than firing a contract linguist. Cole says the retaliation began when, after years of glowing reports, his annual appraisal found his work in one area to be \"minimally acceptable.\" Next, he was placed under investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility, first on a charge that he lied on a routine background check, and then, after he had disclosed classified information without authorization. Finally, he was demoted to menial roles: \"They literally had me doing the Xeroxing\" Bitterly disillusioned, he says, he resigned in March 2004. \"According to the terms of our employment, whistle-blowing is an obligation,\" Cole says, \"We sign a piece of paper every year saying we will report any mismanagement or evidence of a possible crime. But the management's schtick is that if you draw attention to the bureau's shortcomings you're disgracing it. **Cole is one of about 50 current and former members of the FBI, C.I.A., National Security Agency, and other bodies who have made contact recently with Sibel Edmonds. Another is Mike German, one of the bravest and most successful counterterrorism agents in the bureau's history, who penetrated a neo-Nazi gang in Los Angeles and a militia group in Seattle and brought them to justice.** German made his bed of nails in 2002 when he was asked to get involved in an investigation into a suspected cell of Islamist terrorists. \"I came down and reviewed the case, and it was a complete mess,\" he says. \"There were violations of FBI policy and violations of the law.

As someone who had been through successful terrorism prosecutions, I knew you couldn't afford to make mistakes.\" **Like Cole, German says he thought himself obliged to report what was going wrong, not to penalize other agents but in the hope of putting it right. \"I though the bureau would do the right thing: that the case would get back on track, and we'd get the opportunity to take action against the bad guys involved.\" Instead, he says, he faced the familiar litany of escalating retaliation - including an internal investigation of his own work on the terrorist cell case. \"Bear in mind that only a handful of people have ever infiltrated terrorist groups,\" German says. \"You'd think that after 9/11 they might have been interested in that. But word came back to me that I'd never get a counterterrorism case again.\" He resigned from the bureau in June 2004.** As I talked to whistle-blowers, I had the impression that those treated the worst were among the brightest and best. There could be no clearer example than Russ Tice, and 18-year intelligence veteran who has worked for the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency (D.I.A.) and American's eavesdroppers, the National Security Agency. \"I dealt with super-sensitive stuff,\" he says. \"I obviously can't talk about it, but I had operational roles in both Afghanistan and Iraq.\" It was at D.I.A. in the spring of 2001 that he wrote a report setting down his suspicions about a junior collage, a Chinese-American who Tice says was living a lavish lifestyle beyond her apparent means. Although she was supposed to be working on a doctorate, he noticed her repeatedly in the office, late at night, reading classified material on an agency computer. \"It's not like I obsessed over the issue,\" Tice says. \"I did my job, and then 9/11 happened, and I was a very busy boy.\" He moved to the N.S.A. toward the end of 2002. The trigger for his downfall the following April was the arrest of Katrina Leung; the F.B.I. informant accused of spying for China while having an affair with a bureau agent. It prompted Tice to send a classified e-mail to the D.I.A. security section, commenting that the Leung case showed that the F.B.I. was \"incompetent.\" The implication was that the D.I.A. could prove it's competence by fully investigating the junior colleague.

Tice, a big, powerful man with a forthright manner, has to pause to control his emotions when he describes what happened as a consequence. \"I was sent for an emergency psychiatric evaluation. I took all the computer tests and passed them with flying colors. But then the shrink says he believes I'm unbalanced. Later he said I'm suffering from \"paranoid ideation.\" He was examined by an independent psychiatrist, who \"found no evidence of mental disorder.\" But he had already been denied access to secure places at N.S.A. As a result, this highly commended technical-espionage expert was put to work in the N.S.A.'s motor pool, \"wiping snow off cars, vacuuming them, and driving people around. People looked at me like I had bubonic plague.\" (The D.I.A. did not respond to a request for comment, and an agency spokesperson said the agency does not discuss personnel matters.) After about eight months of this purgatory, apparently an attempt to persuade him to resign, he was placed on \"administrative leave.\" Like other whistle-blowers, he tried to redress his treatment. In August 2004, Tice wrote letters to members of the House and Senate. Six days later, the N.S.A. began the formal process which would lead to his getting fired, and to having his clearance revoked permanently. \"What happened to me was total Stalin-era tactics,\" he says. \"Everyone I know or ever worked with says I'm perfectly sane. Yet I just don't know what to do next. I've been in intelligence all my life, but without a security clearance, I can't practice my trade.\" Echoing Cole and German, one of the congressional staffers who heard Edmonds's secure testimony likens the FBI to a family, \"and you don't take your problems outside it. They think they're the best law enforcement agency in the world, that they're beyond criticism and beyond reproach.\" To an outside observer that ethos alone might explain the use of the state secrets privilege against Edmonds. But, the staffer adds, some of the wiretaps she said she translated \"mentioned government officials.\" Here may lie an entirely different dimension to her case. **Vanity Fair has established that around the time the Dickersons visited the Edmondses, in December 2001, Joel Robertz, an F.B.I. special agent in Chicago, contacted Sibel and asked her to review some wiretaps.

Some were several years old, others more recent; all had been generated by a counter-intelligence that had its start in 1997. \"It became apparent that Chicago was actually the center of what was going on.\" ** **Its subject was explosive; what sounded like attempts to bribe elected members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican. \"There was pressure within the bureau for a special prosecutor to be appointed and take the case on, \"the official says. Instead, his colleagues were told to alter the thrust of their investigation - away from elected politicians and toward appointed officials. \"This is the reason why Ashcroft reacted to Sibel in such an extreme fashion,\" he says \"It was to keep this from coming out.\"** In her secure testimony, Edmonds disclosed some of what she recalled hearing. In all, says a source who was present, she managed to listen to more than 40 of the Chicago recordings supplied by Robertz. Many involved an F.B.I. target at the city's large Turkish Consulate, as well as members of the American-Turkish Consulate, as well as members of the American-Turkish Council and the Assembly of Turkish American Associates. **Some of the calls reportedly contained what sounded like references to large scale drug shipments and other crimes. To a person who knew nothing about their context, the details were confusing and it wasn't always clear what might be significant. One name, however, apparently stood out - a man the Turkish callers often referred to by the nickname \"Denny boy.\" It was the Republican congressman from Illinois and Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert. According to some of the wiretaps, the F.B.I.'s targets had arranged for tens of thousands of dollars to be paid to Hastert's campaign funds in small checks.** Under Federal Election Commission rules, donations of less than $200 are not required to be itemized in public filings. Hastert himself was never heard in the recordings, Edmonds told investigators, and it is possible that the claims of covert payments were hollow boasts. Nevertheless, an examination of Hastert's federal filings shows that the level of un-itemized payments his campaigns received over many years was relatively high. Between April 1996 and December 2002, un-itemized personal donations to the Hastert for Congress Committee amounted to $483,000. In contrast, un-itemized contributions in the same period to the committee run on behalf of the House majority leader, Tom Delay, Republican of Texas, were only $99,000. An analysis of the filings of four other senior Republicans shows that only one, Clay Shaw of Florida, declared a higher total in un-itemized donations than Hastert over the same period: $552,000.

An analysis of the filings of four other senior Republicans shows that only one, Clay Shaw of Florida, declared a higher total in un-itemized donations than Hastert over the same period: $552,000. The other three declared far less. Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Joe Barton, of Texas, claimed $265,000; Armed Services Committee chairman Duncan Hunter, of California, got $212,000; and Ways and Means Committee chairman Bill Thomas, of California, recorded $110,000. Edmonds reportedly added that the recordings also contained repeated references to Hastert's flip-flop, in the fall of 2000, over an issue which remains of intense concern to the Turkish government - the continuing campaign to have Congress designate the killings of Armenians in Turkey between 1915 and 1923 a genocide. For many years, attempts had been made to get the house to pass a genocide resolution, but they never got anywhere until August 2000, when Hastert, as Speaker, announced that he would give it his backing and see that it received a full house vote. He had a clear political reason, as analysts noted at the time: a California Republican incumbent, locked in a tight congressional race, was looking to win over his district's large Armenian community. Thanks to Hastert, the resolution, vehemently opposed by the Turks, passed the International Relations Committee by a large majority. Then, on October 19, minutes before the full House vote, Hastert withdrew it. At the time, he explained his decision by saying that he had received a letter from President Clinton arguing that the genocide resolution, if passed, would harm U.S. interests. Again, the reported content of the Chicago wiretaps may well have been sheer bravado, and there is no evidence that any payment was ever made to Hastert or his campaign. Nevertheless, a senior official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording that the price for Hastert to withdraw the resolution would have been at least $500,000. Hastert's spokesman says the congressman withdrew the genocide resolution only because of the approach from Clinton, \"and to insinuate anything else just doesn't make any sense.\" He adds that Hastert has no affiliation with the A.T.C. or other groups reportedly mentioned in the wiretaps: \"He does not know these organizations.\" Hastert is \"unaware of Turkish interests making donations,\" the spokesman says, and his staff has \"not seen any pattern of donors with foreign names.\" **For more than years after Edmonds was fired, the Office of the Inspector General's inquiry ground on.

At last, in July 2004, its report was completed - and promptly labeled classified at the behest of the F.B.I. It took months of further pressure before a redacted, unclassified version was finally issued, in January 2005. It seemed to provide stunning vindication of Edmond's credibility.** **\"Many of Edmonds' core allegations relating to the co-worker [Melek Can Dickerson] were supported by either documentary evidence or witnesses,\" the report said. \"We believe that the F.B.I. should have investigated the allegations more thoroughly.\"** **The F.B.I. had justified firing Edmonds on the grounds that she had a \"disruptive effect,\" the report went on. However, \"this disruption related primarily to Edmonds' aggressive pursuit of her allegations of misconduct, which the F.B.I. did not believe were supported and which it did not adequately investigate. In fact, as we described throughout our report, many of her allegations had basis in fact,\" the report read. \"We believe . that the F.B.I. did not take them seriously enough, and that her allegations were, in fact, the most significant factor in the F.B.I.'s decision to terminate her services.\"** Meanwhile, Edmonds had new lawyers: the A.C.L.U.'s Ann Beeson, who is leading the challenge to the state-secrets privilege, and Mark Zaid, a private attorney who specializes in national-security issues. Zaid has filed a $10 million tort suit, citing the threats to Edmonds's family, her inability to look after her real-estate and business interests in Turkey, and a series of articles in the Turkish press that have vilified her. **In July 2004, a federal district court had ruled in favor of the government's use of the state-secrets privilege. Like Ashcroft's declaration, its opinion contained no specific facts. Next came a bizarre hearing in the D.C. appeals court in April 2005. The room was cleared of reporters while Beeson spoke for 15 minutes. Then Beeson and Edmonds were also expelled to make way for the Department of Justice lawyers, who addressed the judges in secret. Two weeks later, the court rejected Edmond's appeal, without expanding on the district court's opinion.** At press time, she was set to file a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court. If the court agrees to take the case, the government's reasons for its actions may finally be forced into the open; legal experts say the Supreme Court has never allowed secret arguments. A week after the April appeal hearing, Edmonds gathered more than 30 whistle-blowers from the F.B.I., C.I.A., National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies to brief staffers from the House and Senate.

Among the whistle-blowers were Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times in 1971, and Coleen Rowley, the F.B.I. agent from Minneapolis who complained that Washington ignored local agents who in August 2001 had raised concerns about a flight student named Zacharias Moussoui, who has since admitted being an al-Qaeda terrorist. Many of those present had unearthed apparent breaches of national security; many aid their careers had been wrecked as a result. At a press conference after the briefings, Congressman Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, praised Edmonds and her colleagues as \"national heroes,\" pledging that he would introduce a bill to make it a crime for any agency manager to retaliate against such individuals. Afterward, the whistle-blowers mingled over hors d'oeuvres and explored their common ground and experiences. By July, they are working to formalize their not-for-profit campaign group, the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition. \"When they took on Sibel,\" says Mike German, who is now the coalition's congressional liaison, \"they made the wrong woman mad.\" **\"I'm going to keep pushing this as long as I can, but I'm not going to get obsessional,\" Edmonds says. \"There are other things I want to do with my life. But the day the Iranians tried to arrest me, my father told me, \"Sibel, you only live your life once. How do you choose to live? According to your principles, or in fear?\" I have never forgotten those words.\"** Copyright Vanity Fair. Reprinted for Fair Use educational purposes only.

The abstract for the patent reads: \"A silent communications system in which nonaural carriers, in the very low or very high audio-frequency range or in the adjacent ultrasonic frequency spectrum are amplitude- or frequency-modulated with the desired intelligence and propagated acoustically or vibrationally, for inducement into the brain, typically through the use of loudspeakers, earphones, or piezoelectric transducers. The modulated carriers may be transmitted directly in real time or may be conveniently recorded and stored on mechanical, magnetic, or optical media for delayed or repeated transmission to the listener.\" According to literature by Silent Sounds, Inc., it is now possible, using supercomputers, to analyse human emotional EEG patterns and replicate them, then store these \"emotion signature clusters\" on another computer and, at will, \"silently induce and change the emotional state in a human being\". Silent Sounds, Inc. states that it is interested only in positive emotions, but the military is not so limited. That this is a US Department of Defense project is obvious. Edward Tilton, President of Silent Sounds, Inc., says this about S-quad in a letter dated December 13, 1996: \"All schematics, however, have been classified by the US Government and we are not allowed to reveal the exact details... ... we make tapes and CDs for the German Government, even the former Soviet Union countries!

It has a gain capability of 200,000, as compared to other EEG machines in use which have gain capability of approximately 50,000. It is software-driven by the \"fastest of computers\" using a noisenulling technology similar to that used by nuclear submarines for detecting small objects underwater at extreme range. The purpose of all this high technology is to plot and display a moving cluster of periodic brainwave signals.

It is not, at heart, to those who pay you, or to your editor, or to your sources, or to your friends, or to the advancement of your career. It is to the public.\"** Today, we celebrate the life of Bill Moyers (June 5, 1934 - June 26, 2025), whose courageous journalism exemplified this quote. Moyers was an American journalist and political commentator for major news outlets including NBC, CBS, and PBS News. He also served as the eleventh White House Press Secretary from 1965 to 1967 and the director of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1967 to 1974. After working within top levels of the political establishment, a deep sense of moral responsibility drove him to expose the fear, greed, and secrecy he found guiding the decisions of the powerful and influencing the machinery of mass media. Yet he also was a thoughtful visionary seeking to awaken a sense of shared humanity and civility to transform the darkness in the world. Consider his reflections in an article he wrote, \"*[The Oligarchy vs. The People](https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/bill-moyers-on-oligarchy-democracy)*,\" where he draws on his [PBS series with mythologist Joseph Campbell](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): *One day, two policemen were driving up that road when, just beyond the railing, they saw a young man about to jump. One of the policemen bolted from the car and grabbed the fellow just as he was stepping off the ledge. His momentum threatened to carry both of them over the cliff, but the policeman refused to let go. Somehow he held on long enough for his partner to arrive and pull the two of them to safety. When a newspaper reporter asked, \"Why didn't you let go? You would have been killed,\" he answered: \"I couldn't... I couldn't let go. If I had, I couldn't have lived another day of my life.\"* Campbell then added: \"Do you realize what had suddenly happened to that policeman? He had given himself over to death to save a stranger.\" How can this be, Campbell asked? [German philosopher Arthur] Schopenhauer's answer ... represents the breakthrough of a metaphysical reality, which is that you and the other are two aspects of one life, and your apparent separateness is but an effect of the way we experience forms under the conditions of space and time. **Our true reality is our identity and unity with all life.** The truth of our country isn't actually so complicated.

There is something more essential - more profound - in the American experience than the hyena's appetite. Once we recognize and nurture this, once we honor it, we can reboot democracy and get on with the work of liberating the country we carry in our hearts.** So who is advancing this religion of inequality - of money and power? Below, we explore some of the most revealing investigations by Bill Moyers, revealing the corruption and deception operating at the highest levels. **What Moyers Revealed to the World** *One reason I'm in hot water is because [I] didn't play by the conventional rules of journalism. Those rules divide the world into Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, and allow journalists to pretend they have done their job if instead of reporting the truth behind the news, they merely give each side an opportunity to spin the news.* - Bill Moyers Much of the media fixates on political personalities and partisan talking points, preventing people from understanding the deeper machinery operating regardless of who holds office. **Moyers consistently pointed to the existence of a \"secret government.\" This system of power consists of corporate and government interests that have the resources and influences to shape the direction of their world to their benefit.** While different factions of this \"secret government\" are often at odds with each other, their interests converge around war, secrecy, and the protection of corporate power. In a 2001 report, [Trade Secrets](https://www.pbs.org/tradesecrets/program/overview.html), Moyers [exposed](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2001/04/pbs-a06.html) one of the most far-reaching corporate deceptions in American history.

Drawing from tens of thousands of internal documents uncovered through a widow's lawsuit, **the report reveals how the chemical industry knew for decades that vinyl chloride and other toxic substances were linked to cancer, neurological damage, and birth defects.** Vinyl chloride is a toxic gas used to make PVC plastic, an essential component in pipes, flooring, packaging, children's toys, and countless everyday products. During World War I, [it was used as a lethal chemical weapon](https://scholarworks.uttyler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&context=biology_fac#:~:text=This%20mono%2D%20mer%20is%20used,World%20War%20I%20%5B2%5D.). A 1966 BF Goodrich memo revealed that vinyl chloride exposure could cause the bones in the hands of their workers to dissolve. In the early 1970s, when European studies revealed that low-level exposure to vinyl chloride caused liver and brain cancers in rats, **US chemical companies (Conoco, BF Goodrich, Dow, Shell, Ethyl, Union Carbide) [signed a secrecy pact](https://www.ewg.org/research/dirty-secrets-vinyl-chloride?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to block this evidence from being disclosed to workers, doctors, and regulators.** CBS News [reported](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vinyl-chloride-ohio-train-derailment-thousands-pounds-released-annually-plastics/) that in 2021 alone, US plastic plants released over 428,000 pounds of vinyl chloride in the air-half of which came from just five facilities. Moyers himself underwent a chemical body burden test and was found to carry 84 industrial chemicals in his blood despite never having worked near a plant. In a [2010 report](https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04162010/watch.html), he posed a question most major news outlets wouldn't touch: **how did Big Finance grow so powerful that its hijinks nearly brought down the global economy - and what hope is there for real reform with Washington politicians on Wall Street's payroll?** Moyers lifted the veil on the hidden crimes of the 2008 financial collapse, revealing a political cover-up of corporate fraud, blocked prosecutions, and secret deals that funneled billions in public money to the very banks that caused the crisis. **In his highly revealing PBS documentary [*The Secret Government*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/050423secretgovernment), Moyers exposed the unchecked power operating within the military-intelligence world.** Bringing together firsthand testimony from CIA operatives, military generals, and insiders, this documentary revealed the extent of secret CIA assassination programs, disinformation campaigns, media deception, covert collaboration with Nazis and the Mafia, and global suffering at the hands of the US war machine. *War, except in self-defense, is a failure of moral imagination.* - Bill Moyers Across Iran, Guatemala, Chile, Vietnam and beyond, US foreign policy consistently prioritized corporate interests and destroyed global democracies in the name of national security.

[During his rule](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/10/1193755188/chile-coup-50-years-pinochet-kissinger-human-rights-allende), some 38,000 would become political prisoners - most of them victims of some of the most [egregious](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20230909-50-years-later-wounds-of-pinochet-regime-are-still-raw) and [horrifying](https://sfonline.barnard.edu/ps/printjra.htm) forms of torture.

Suppose they decided on their own to assassinate Gorbachev or the leader of white South Africa. Could a President control them and what if he became the enterprise's public enemy Number One? Who would know? Who would say no? * *This remains for me the heart of the matter. The men who wrote our Constitution, our basic book of rules, were concerned that power be held accountable. No party of government and no person in government, not even the President, was to pick or choose among the laws to be obeyed. But how does one branch of government blow the whistle on another? Or how do the people cry foul when their liberties are imperiled, if public officials can break the rules, lie to us about it, and then wave the wand of national security to silence us?* - Bill Moyers Bill Moyers reminded us time and again: the real story isn't just the personalities on stage, but the power structures behind the curtain. The question isn't simply who's running for office, but who they serve. What corporate interests fund them? What unelected power brokers influence their decisions? What voices or narratives are being excluded from public discourse? \"Trust the science\" sounds noble-until you realize that even [top editors of world-renowned journals have warned](https://www.wanttoknow.info/h/coronavirus/science-not-to-be-trusted-medicine-leaders) that much of published medical research is unreliable, distorted by fraud, corporate influence, and conflicts of interest. Here's what Moyers' work taught me: don't just react. Get curious. Peel back the layers. Seek out narratives that bring us all together across our political differences. That's the kind of journalism and civic courage Bill Moyers modeled for all of us.

The first stop: UFO/UAP Technology!** Before you scroll down to the video, we want to explain our intentions for this video series. We live in a time when trust in journalism is low, and the mainstream media rarely tells us the full story. Going deeper, the future of humanity seems deeply uncertain. Yet Albert Einstein once said, \"You cannot solve a problem with the same mind that created it.\" Opening to new ways of seeing the world's problems can be a powerful remedy to the sense of overwhelm, burnout, and cynicism that many of us feel. I once heard that the opposite of love isn't hate-it's being right and certain about our position. **What would it be like if we suspend certainty?** The world is vast, mysterious, and complex. There's so much we don't know, and we need each other to create a more free, informed, and caring society. **That's why we launched Speculation Station.** Healthy speculation and credible inquiry into society's most controversial issues allows us to think creatively and openly about real possibilities. It invites **diversity of thought**, bringing people together across differences to think holistically and unconventionally about the complex challenges we face. And it fosters **healthy skepticism of authority**, and the status quo norms shaping media and society. Yet most importantly, **healthy speculation has fun. Since when did controversial issues have to be so boring and serious?** Growth lies outside of our comfort zone. Let's open our hearts and minds! On today's Speculation Station, WTK news editor [Mark Bailey](https://freemindgazette.substack.com/) joins me for a discussion on the most relevant and intriguing parts of current discussion about UFO/UAP technology. It's important that the mainstream media is further normalizing UFO discussion. Yet still to this day, government narratives claim that no secret ET programs have existed. **In this 33-min video, we look at specific UFO technologies that have allegedly been recovered from crashes to how these other-worldly technologies might have helped accelerate the development of some human technologies.** We also explore the long-standing history of UFO secrecy and cover-ups that have prevented any real, holistic understanding of this issue. **Factions within the government and defense contractor industry likely possess significant and possibly revolutionary UFO knowledge.** **01:18** What's at the heart of the matter for us?

Feeling relatively secure and content in their personal lives, they choose to avoid matters which might disturb their contentment.

In fact, they will likely grow in magnitude until people are finally forced to open their eyes and deal with the consequences. The sooner each of us decides that we do want to know, and that we are willing to invite others to open their eyes, the more easily we will be able to build a world that supports the good of all of us.

His placement counselor assured me that he would be a good, reliable busboy. But I had never had a mentally handicapped employee and wasn't sure I wanted one. I wasn't sure how my customers would react. Stevie was short, a little dumpy, with the smooth facial features and thick-tongued speech of Down syndrome. I wasn't worried about most of my trucker customers. Truckers don't generally care who buses tables as long as the food is good and the pies are homemade. The ones who concerned me were the mouthy college kids traveling to school; the yuppie snobs who secretly polish their silverware with their napkins for fear of catching some dreaded \"truckstop germ;\" and the pairs of white-shirted business men on expense accounts who think every truckstop waitress wants to be flirted with. I knew those people would be uncomfortable around Stevie, so I closely watched him for the first few weeks. I shouldn't have worried. After the first week, Stevie had my staff wrapped around his stubby little finger. Within a month my truck regulars had adopted him as their official truckstop mascot. After that I really didn't care what the rest of the customers thought. He was a 21-year-old in blue jeans and Nikes, eager to laugh and eager to please, but fierce in his attention to his duties. Every salt and pepper shaker was exactly in its place, not a bread crumb or coffee spill was visible when Stevie got done with the table. Our only problem was convincing him to wait to clean a table until after the customers were finished. He would hover in the background, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, scanning the dining room until a table was empty. Then he would scurry to the empty table and carefully bus the dishes and glasses onto the cart and meticulously wipe the table with a practiced flourish of his rag. If he thought a customer was watching, his brow would pucker with added concentration. He took pride in doing his job exactly right, and you had to love how hard he tried to please each and every person he met. Over time, we learned that he lived with his mother, a widow who was disabled after repeated surgeries for cancer. They lived on their Social Security benefits in public housing two miles from the truckstop. Their social worker, who stopped to check on him every so often, admitted they had fallen between the cracks. Money was tight, and what I paid him was probably the difference between them being able to live together and Stevie being sent to a group home.

Money was tight, and what I paid him was probably the difference between them being able to live together and Stevie being sent to a group home. That's why the restaurant was a gloomy place that morning last August, the first morning in three years that Stevie missed work. He was at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester getting a new valve or something put in his heart. His social worker said that people with Down syndrome often have heart problems at an early age, so this wasn't unexpected. There was a good chance he would come through the surgery in good shape and be back at work in a few months. A ripple of excitement ran through the staff later that morning when word came that he was out of surgery, in recovery and doing fine. Frannie, my head waitress, let out a war whoop and did a little dance the aisle when she heard the good news. Belle Ringer, one of our regular trucker customers, grinned. \"Okay, Frannie, what was that all about?\" he asked. \"We just got word that Stevie is out of surgery and going to be okay,\" she responded. \"I was wondering where he was,\" said Belle. Frannie quickly told him and the other two drivers sitting at his booth about Stevie's surgery, then sighed. \"Yeah, I m glad he is going to be okay,\" she said, \"but I don't know how he and his mom are going to handle all the bills. From what I hear, they're barely getting by as it is.\" Belle Ringer nodded thoughtfully, and Frannie hurried off to wait on the rest of her tables. After the morning rush, Frannie walked into my office. She had a couple of paper napkins in her hand a funny look on her face. \"What's up?\" I asked. \"That table where Belle Ringer and his friends were sitting,\" she said, \"this was folded and tucked under a coffee cup.\" She handed the napkin to me, and three $20 bills fell onto my desk when I opened it. On the outside, in big, bold letters, was printed \"Something For Stevie.\" \"Pony Pete also asked me what that dance was all about,\" she said, \"so I told him about Stevie and his mom and everything, and Pete looked at Tony and Tony looked at Pete, and they ended up giving me this.\" She handed me another paper napkin that had \"Something For Stevie\" scrawled on its outside.

Two $50 bills were tucked within its folds. Frannie looked at me with wet, shiny eyes, shook her head and said simply, \"Truckers.\" That was three months ago. Today is Thanksgiving, the first day Stevie is supposed to be back to work. His placement worker said he's been counting the days until the doctor said he could work, and it didn't matter at all that it was a holiday. He called 10 times in the past week, making sure we knew he was coming, fearful that we had forgotten him or that his job was in jeopardy. I arranged to have his mother bring him to work. We met them in the parking lot and invited them both to celebrate his day back. Stevie was thinner and paler, but couldn't stop grinning as he pushed through the doors and headed for the back room where his apron and busing cart were waiting. \"Hold up there, Stevie, not so fast, \"I said. I took him and his mother by their arms. \"Work can wait for a minute. To celebrate you coming back, breakfast for you two is on me. I led them toward a large corner booth at the rear of the room. I could feel and hear the rest of the staff following behind as we marched through the dining room. Glancing over my shoulder, I saw booth after booth of grinning truckers empty and join the procession. We stopped in front of the big table; its surface covered with a mess of coffee cups, saucers and dinner plates, all sitting crooked on dozens of folded paper napkins. \"First thing you have to do, Stevie, is clean up this mess,\" I said, trying to sound stern. Stevie looked at me, and then at his mother, then pulled out one of the napkins. It had \"Something for Stevie\" printed on the outside. As he picked it up, two $10 bills fell onto the table. Stevie stared at the money, then at dozens of napkins peeking from beneath the tableware, each with his name printed or scrawled on it. I turned to his mother. \"There's over $10,000 in cash and checks on that table, all from truckers and trucking companies that heard about your problems.

Incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in January 2006, PEERS holds a clear vision of reducing social conflict and economic inequalities, educating the public to the little-known forces underlying the political and economic structures that shape our world, and inspiring a sense of global community based on love and cooperation. The greatest part of our current work involves the ongoing development of several empowering websites dedicated to these goals. Through both our popular educational and inspirational websites and their related email lists (with more than 4,000 subscribers from over 75 countries), PEERS provides important but often overlooked news from reliable sources, as well as inspirational stories, exercises, and community-building ideas designed to help reduce social conflict and inspire people to join in transforming our world into a better place for all in the human family. The most popular PEERS website, [www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info), specializes in revealing critical information about important cover-ups of which few are aware. Using reliable, verifiable sources such as key news articles from the major media and revealing government documents, this highly educational website exposes the hidden forces and agendas which too often lead to increased conflict, war, and injustice in our world. All information provided on this website is taken from the most reliable sources available, and most can be verified with minimal research using links provided. **WantToKnow.info has received over two million visits from around the world, and is very user-friendly with its easy-to-navigate dropdown menus, information centers, and revealing news summaries.** Our inspiring Moment of Love website at [www.momentoflove.org](https://www.momentoflove.org) is a powerful reminder that every person in the world has a heart and that every heart has a place within that wants only to love and be loved.

Several simple exercises give empowering ideas on deepening our connection with ourselves and with all around us. Both of these websites also have information ideas on how to form a local Circle of Love for any group which is interested in joining in this powerful work. Another website, [Global Community for All](https://www.inspiringcommunity.org), provides inspiring ideas and information for community building based on the principle that we all benefit when we celebrate and learn from our diversity, and when we join in choosing what's best for all people as we invite ever-greater love, healing, and empowerment into all of our lives. **PEERS provides all of the information compiled on our websites and email lists free of charge and without advertising.** We are focused entirely on creating opportunities for people to educate themselves and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:supportingtransformation.txt:0:00e58feae789", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14705, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "supportingtransformation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "supportingtransformation", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "provides inspiring ideas and information for community building based on the principle that we all benefit when we celebrate and learn from our diversity, and when we join in choosing what's best for all people as we invite ever-greater love, healing, and empowerment into all of our lives. **PEERS provides all of the information compiled on our websites and email lists free of charge and without advertising.** We are focused entirely on creating opportunities for people to educate themselves and others, and to inspire one another to strengthen democracy and to join in working together for the good of all who share our world. We recognize that our planet is currently facing a wide spectrum of complex problems. Social injustice, permanent war and grave environmental dangers are only likely to be transformed when people across the planet educate themselves about what is occurring and why. The magnitude of these problems, however, often causes people to feel an overwhelming sense of frustration, disempowerment, and even cynicism. PEERS seeks to address the deepest, underlying causes of these problems and their impacts on people's well-being by providing reliable facts and empowering guidance and inspiration to overcome any feelings of inadequacy. We start with the understanding that every one of us makes a difference in our world. By reminding people of this, and inspiring them to take action both in their personal lives and in the greater society, PEERS is making a big difference in building a more just, cooperative world. The large number of supportive and [grateful emails](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspiringmessages) we receive demonstrate that our efforts are greatly appreciated by an ever-growing number of the people. PEERS is involved through dialogue, information exchange, and mutual support with numerous like-minded nonprofit organizations supporting various aspects of personal and global transformation, including Challenge Day ([www.challengeday.org](http://www.challengeday.org)), The Love Foundation ([www.thelovefoundation.com](http://www.thelovefoundation.com)), Information Clearing House ([www.informationclearinghouse.info](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info)), and NewHeavenNewEarth ([www.nhne.org](http://www.nhne.org)). PEERS is a key part of a growing movement to rebuild global social harmony and community. Most of the hard work of creating and maintaining the websites, compiling critical information and writing inspirational guides has fallen on me as the Executive Director of PEERS and only full-time volunteer. With the capable assistance of numerous dedicated volunteers, we have brought the organization to its current, widely praised position almost entirely through the volunteering of our own time and energy. We have had amazing success on a shoestring budget. In our first year (2006), visitors to the websites and loyal subscribers to the email lists sent in donations which totaled just over $10,000. **Thanks largely to three generous donors, we have surpassed last year's total donations in 2007.

One valuable addition to the WantToKnow.info website we would like to develop is a special section on analysis of each of the topics we cover. Building upon our trademark reliable, verifiable information and relying on our respected team of experts, this analysis section would provide essays which take our current information to a deeper level by placing it within a larger context. Further, because we have archived such an abundance of critical information, we also would like to start work on a series of new websites. Each of these websites would focus on one of the major cover-ups we have helped to expose. We have plenty of solid information to build a highly revealing website for each of these vital topics. Another major new project about which we are excited is the development of a website for what we are calling the Transformation Team, at [www.transformationteam.net](https://www.transformationteam.net). We would like to focus a significant portion of our efforts in the coming year on this important community-building website. We envision this website becoming a key portal of conscious community in action, where deeply committed participants come together and use a variety of empowering networking tools available on the website to help further transform our planet to a new way of living based on love and empowerment. In order that we can focus more time and energies on developing the Transformation Team website, we have hired our first wonderful, capable employee, Tod Fletcher. In order to pay Tod's salary, we will be depending on dedicated people like you to support us. Furthermore, to continue to expand the coverage and quality of the content of the established websites, and to begin to develop the new websites we envision, it is highly desirable that other employees be hired as well. Finally, the complexity and challenges of developing, maintaining and growing multiple, complex, state-of-the-art websites and email lists will require that PEERS have ongoing technical support available from one or more skilled technical consultants. **To support our bold vision for the future, we invite you to contribute to PEERS.

It leads to the historical art of analyzing and evaluating thinking with a view to improving it.

It includes, but is not limited to, a process of reflecting upon the meaning of statements, examining the offered evidence and reasoning, and forming judgments about the facts.\" - Wikipedia entry on Critical Thinking \"The critical habit of thought, if usual in society, will pervade all its mores, because it is a way of taking up the problems of life. Men educated in it cannot be stampeded by stump orators ... They are slow to believe. They can hold things as possible or probable in all degrees, without certainty and without pain. They can wait for evidence and weigh evidence, uninfluenced by the emphasis or confidence with which assertions are made on one side or the other. They can resist appeals to their dearest prejudices and all kinds of cajolery. Education in the critical faculty is the only education of which it can be truly said that it makes good citizens.\" - William Sumner, former Chair of the Political and Social Science Department, Yale University **\"This Framework proposes that critical thinking skills be taught at every grade level.** Students should learn to detect bias in print and visual media; to recognize illogical thinking; to guard against propaganda; to avoid stereotyping of group members; to reach conclusions based on solid evidence; and to think critically, creatively and rationally.

Students are encouraged to discover logical and factual errors in each other's analyses. Above all, students are directed to focus on the point of the lesson: to demonstrate three skills in conversations and assessments: **Discern fact from spin.** Facts are measurable, independently verifiable, and consistent with principles of science. Spin is an opinion that may or may not closely conform to factual analysis. **Participate in civil conversations based on facts.** Social studies skills will be referenced from the art of argumentation on civil procedure and how students can identify and destroy spin that is not based on fact. In order for students to disagree with a position, they must first accurately state it as a prerequisite to disagree. **Engage in policy decisions.** From whatever conclusions people make, conversation leads towards what people should do about issues. As always, students are encouraged to participate with issues that are important to them. What is \"important\" is an individual choice. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Parents and students are welcome to participate in the presentation of information.

Some 14 years ago, I stood watching my university students file into the classroom for our opening session in the theology of faith. That was the day I first saw Tommy. He was combing his hair, which hung six inches below his shoulders. My quick judgment wrote him off as strange -- very strange. Tommy turned out to be my biggest challenge. He constantly objected to, or smirked at the possibility of an unconditionally loving God. When he turned in his final exam at the end of the course, he asked in a slightly cynical tone, \"Do you think I'll ever find God?\" \"No,\" I said emphatically. \"Oh,\" he responded. \"I thought that was the product you were pushing.\" I let him get five steps from the door and then called out. \"I don't think you'll ever find him, but I am certain he will find you.\" Tommy shrugged and left. I felt slightly disappointed that he had missed my clever line. Later I heard that Tommy had graduated, and I was grateful for that. Then came a sad report: Tommy had terminal cancer. Before I could search him out, he came to me. When he walked into my office, his body was badly wasted, and his long hair had fallen out because of the chemotherapy. But, his eyes were bright and his voice, for the first time, was firm. \"Tommy! I've thought about you so often. I heard you were very sick,\" I blurted out. \"Oh, yes, very sick. I have cancer. It's a matter of weeks.\" \"Can you talk about it?\" \"Sure. What would you like to know?\" \"What's it like to be only 24 and know that you're dying?\" \"It could be worse,\" he told me, \"like being 50 and thinking that drinking booze, seducing women and making money are the real 'biggies' in life.\" Then, he told me why he had come. \"It was something you said to me on the last day of class. I asked if you thought I would ever find God and you said no, which surprised me. Then you said, 'But, he will find you.' I thought about that a lot, even though my search for God was hardly intense at that time.\" \"But, when the doctors removed a lump from my body and told me that it was malignant, I got serious about locating God.

And when the malignancy spread into my vital organs, I really began banging against the bronze doors of heaven. But, nothing happened. Well, one day I woke up, and instead of my desperate attempts to get some kind of message, I just quit. I decided I didn't really care about God, an afterlife, or anything like that.\" \"I decided to spend what time I had left doing something more important. I thought about you and something else you had said: 'The essential sadness is to go through life without loving. But, it would be almost equally sad to leave this world without ever telling those you loved that you loved them.' So, I began with the hardest one...my Dad.\" Tommy's father had been reading the newspaper when his son approached him. \"Dad, I would like to talk with you.\" \"Well, talk.\" \"I mean, it's really important.\" The newspaper came down three slow inches. \"What is it?\" \"Dad, I love you. I just wanted you to know that.\" Tommy smiled at me as he recounted the moment. \"The newspaper fluttered to the floor. Then, my father did two things I couldn't remember him doing before. He cried and he hugged me. And then, we talked all night, even though he had to go to work the next morning.\" \"It was easier with my mother and little brother,\" Tommy continued. \"They cried with me, and we hugged one another, and shared the thing we had been keeping secret for so many years. I was only sorry that I had waited so long. Here I was, in the shadow of death, and I was just beginning to open up to all the people I had actually been close to.\" \"Then one day, I turned around and God was there. He didn't come to me when I pleaded with him. Apparently he does things in his own way and at his own hour. The important thing is that you were right. He found me even after I stopped looking for him.\" \"Tommy,\" I practically gasped, \"I think you are saying something much more universal than you realize. You are saying that the surest way to find God is not by making him a private possession or an instant consolation in time of need, but rather by opening to love.\" \"Tommy,\" I added, \"could I ask you a favor?

Would you come to my theology-of-faith course and tell my students what you just told me?\" Though we scheduled a date, he never made it. Of course, his life was not really ended by his death, only changed. He made the great step from faith into vision. He found a life far more beautiful than the eye of humanity has ever seen, or the mind ever imagined. Before he died, we talked one last time. \"I'm not going to make it to your class,\" he said. \"I know, Tommy.\" \"Will you tell them for me? Will you . . . tell the whole world for me?\" \"I will, Tommy.

But has the danger been exaggerated? A major new TV documentary claims that the perceived threat is a politically driven fantasy - and al-Qaida a dark illusion. Andy Beckett reports **Friday October 15, 2004 [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/)** Since the attacks on the United States in September 2001, there have been more than a thousand references in British national newspapers, working out at almost one every single day, to the phrase \"dirty bomb\". There have been articles about how such a device can use ordinary explosives to spread lethal radiation; about how London would be evacuated in the event of such a detonation; about the Home Secretary David Blunkett's statement on terrorism in November 2002 that specifically raised the possibility of a dirty bomb being planted in Britain; and about the arrests of several groups of people, the latest only last month, for allegedly plotting exactly that. Starting next Wednesday, BBC2 is to broadcast a three-part documentary series that will add further to what could be called the dirty bomb genre. But, as its title suggests, The Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear takes a different view of the weapon's potential. \"I don't think it would kill anybody,\" says Dr Theodore Rockwell, an authority on radiation, in an interview for the series. \"You'll have trouble finding a serious report that would claim otherwise.\" The American department of energy, Rockwell continues, has simulated a dirty bomb explosion, \"and they calculated that the most exposed individual would get a fairly high dose [of radiation], not life-threatening.\" And even this minor threat is open to question. The test assumed that no one fled the explosion for one year. During the three years in which the \"war on terror\" has been waged, high-profile challenges to its assumptions have been rare.

The test assumed that no one fled the explosion for one year. During the three years in which the \"war on terror\" has been waged, high-profile challenges to its assumptions have been rare. The sheer number of incidents and warnings connected or attributed to the war has left little room, it seems, for heretical thoughts. In this context, the central theme of The Power of Nightmares is riskily counter-intuitive and provocative. Much of the currently perceived threat from international terrorism, the series argues, \"is a fantasy that has been exaggerated and distorted by politicians. It is a dark illusion that has spread unquestioned through governments around the world, the security services, and the international media.\" The series' explanation for this is even bolder: \"In an age when all the grand ideas have lost credibility, fear of a phantom enemy is all the politicians have left to maintain their power.\" Adam Curtis, who wrote and produced the series, acknowledges the difficulty of saying such things now. \"If a bomb goes off, the fear I have is that everyone will say, 'You're completely wrong,' even if the incident doesn't touch my argument. This shows the way we have all become trapped, the way even I have become trapped by a fear that is completely irrational.\" So controversial is the tone of his series, that trailers for it were not broadcast last weekend because of the killing of Kenneth Bigley. At the BBC, Curtis freely admits, there are \"anxieties\". But there is also enthusiasm for the programmes, in part thanks to his reputation. Over the past dozen years, via similarly ambitious documentary series such as Pandora's Box, The Mayfair Set and The Century of the Self, Curtis has established himself as perhaps the most acclaimed maker of serious television programmes in Britain. His trademarks are long research, the revelatory use of archive footage, telling interviews, and smooth, insistent voiceovers concerned with the unnoticed deeper currents of recent history, narrated by Curtis himself in tones that combine traditional BBC authority with something more modern and sceptical: \"I want to try to make people look at things they think they know about in a new way.\" The Power of Nightmares seeks to overturn much of what is widely believed about Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. The latter, it argues, is not an organised international network. It does not have members or a leader. It does not have \"sleeper cells\". It does not have an overall strategy. In fact, it barely exists at all, except as an idea about cleansing a corrupt world through religious violence. Curtis' evidence for these assertions is not easily dismissed.

In fact, it barely exists at all, except as an idea about cleansing a corrupt world through religious violence. Curtis' evidence for these assertions is not easily dismissed. He tells the story of Islamism, or the desire to establish Islam as an unbreakable political framework, as half a century of mostly failed, short-lived revolutions and spectacular but politically ineffective terrorism. Curtis points out that al-Qaida did not even have a name until early 2001, when the American government decided to prosecute Bin Laden in his absence and had to use anti-Mafia laws that required the existence of a named criminal organisation. Curtis also cites the Home Office's own statistics for arrests and convictions of suspected terrorists since September 11 2001. Of the 664 people detained up to the end of last month, only 17 have been found guilty. Of these, the majority were Irish Republicans, Sikh militants or members of other groups with no connection to Islamist terrorism. Nobody has been convicted who is a proven member of al-Qaida. In fact, Curtis is not alone in wondering about all this. Quietly but increasingly, other observers of the war on terror have been having similar doubts. \"The grand concept of the war has not succeeded,\" says Jonathan Eyal, director of the British military thinktank the Royal United Services Institute. \"In purely military terms, it has been an inconclusive war ... a rather haphazard operation. Al-Qaida managed the most spectacular attack, but clearly it is also being sustained by the way that we rather cavalierly stick the name al-Qaida on Iraq, Indonesia, the Philippines. There is a long tradition that if you divert all your resources to a threat, then you exaggerate it.\" Bill Durodie, director of the international centre for security analysis at King's College London, says: \"The reality [of the al-Qaida threat to the west] has been essentially a one-off. There has been one incident in the developed world since 9/11 [the Madrid bombings]. There's no real evidence that all these groups are connected.\" Crispin Black, a senior government intelligence analyst until 2002, is more cautious but admits the terrorist threat presented by politicians and the media is \"out of date and too one-dimensional. We think there is a bit of a gulf between the terrorists' ambition and their ability to pull it off.\" Terrorism, by definition, depends on an element of bluff. Yet ever since terrorists in the modern sense of the term (the word terrorism was actually coined to describe the strategy of a government, the authoritarian French revolutionary regime of the 1790s) began to assassinate politicians and then members of the public", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:terrormyth.txt:2:234103e2f6e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14723, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "terrormyth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "terrormyth", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "the media is \"out of date and too one-dimensional.

Yet ever since terrorists in the modern sense of the term (the word terrorism was actually coined to describe the strategy of a government, the authoritarian French revolutionary regime of the 1790s) began to assassinate politicians and then members of the public during the 19th century, states have habitually overreacted. Adam Roberts, professor of international relations at Oxford, says that governments often believe struggles with terrorists \"to be of absolute cosmic significance\", and that therefore \"anything goes\" when it comes to winning. The historian Linda Colley adds: \"States and their rulers expect to monopolise violence, and that is why they react so virulently to terrorism.\" Britain may also be particularly sensitive to foreign infiltrators, fifth columnists and related menaces. In spite, or perhaps because of, the absence of an actual invasion for many centuries, British history is marked by frequent panics about the arrival of Spanish raiding parties, French revolutionary agitators, anarchists, bolsheviks and Irish terrorists. \"These kind of panics rarely happen without some sort of cause,\" says Colley. \"But politicians make the most of them.\" They are not the only ones who find opportunities. \"Almost no one questions this myth about al-Qaida because so many people have got an interest in keeping it alive,\" says Curtis. He cites the suspiciously circular relationship between the security services and much of the media since September 2001: the way in which official briefings about terrorism, often unverified or unverifiable by journalists, have become dramatic press stories which - in a jittery media-driven democracy - have prompted further briefings and further stories. Few of these ominous announcements are retracted if they turn out to be baseless: \"There is no fact-checking about al-Qaida.\" In one sense, of course, Curtis himself is part of the al-Qaida industry. The Power of Nightmares began as an investigation of something else, the rise of modern American conservatism. Curtis was interested in Leo Strauss, a political philosopher at the university of Chicago in the 50s who rejected the liberalism of postwar America as amoral and who thought that the country could be rescued by a revived belief in America's unique role to battle evil in the world. Strauss's certainty and his emphasis on the use of grand myths as a higher form of political propaganda created a group of influential disciples such as Paul Wolfowitz, now the US deputy defence secretary. They came to prominence by talking up the Russian threat during the cold war and have applied a similar strategy in the war on terror. As Curtis traced the rise of the \"Straussians\", he came to a conclusion that would form the basis for The Power of Nightmares. Straussian conservatism", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:terrormyth.txt:3:d6601153105a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14724, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "terrormyth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "terrormyth", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "emphasis on the use of grand myths as a higher form of political propaganda created a group of influential disciples such as Paul Wolfowitz, now the US deputy defence secretary.

As Curtis traced the rise of the \"Straussians\", he came to a conclusion that would form the basis for The Power of Nightmares. Straussian conservatism had a previously unsuspected amount in common with Islamism: from origins in the 50s, to a formative belief that liberalism was the enemy, to an actual period of Islamist-Straussian collaboration against the Soviet Union during the war in Afghanistan in the 80s (both movements have proved adept at finding new foes to keep them going). Although the Islamists and the Straussians have fallen out since then, as the attacks on America in 2001 graphically demonstrated, they are in another way, Curtis concludes, collaborating still: in sustaining the \"fantasy\" of the war on terror. Some may find all this difficult to swallow. But Curtis insists,\"There is no way that I'm trying to be controversial just for the sake of it.\" Neither is he trying to be an anti-conservative polemicist like Michael Moore: \"[Moore's] purpose is avowedly political. My hope is that you won't be able to tell what my politics are.\" For all the dizzying ideas and visual jolts and black jokes in his programmes, Curtis describes his intentions in sober, civic-minded terms. \"If you go back into history and plod through it, the myth falls away. You see that these aren't terrifying new monsters. It's drawing the poison of the fear.\" But whatever the reception of the series, this fear could be around for a while. It took the British government decades to dismantle the draconian laws it passed against French revolutionary infiltrators; the cold war was sustained for almost half a century without Russia invading the west, or even conclusive evidence that it ever intended to. \"The archives have been opened,\" says the cold war historian David Caute, \"but they don't bring evidence to bear on this.\" And the danger from Islamist terrorists, whatever its scale, is concrete. A sceptical observer of the war on terror in the British security services says: \"All they need is a big bomb every 18 months to keep this going.\" The war on terror already has a hold on western political culture. \"After a 300-year debate between freedom of the individual and protection of society, the protection of society seems to be the only priority,\" says Eyal. Black agrees: \"We are probably moving to a point in the UK where national security becomes the electoral question.\" Some critics of this situation see our striking susceptibility during the 90s to other anxieties - the millennium bug, MMR, genetically modified food - as a sort", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:terrormyth.txt:4:f20b48c96e2c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14725, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "terrormyth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "terrormyth", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "terror already has a hold on western political culture. \"After a 300-year debate between freedom of the individual and protection of society, the protection of society seems to be the only priority,\" says Eyal. Black agrees: \"We are probably moving to a point in the UK where national security becomes the electoral question.\" Some critics of this situation see our striking susceptibility during the 90s to other anxieties - the millennium bug, MMR, genetically modified food - as a sort of dress rehearsal for the war on terror. The press became accustomed to publishing scare stories and not retracting them; politicians became accustomed to responding to supposed threats rather than questioning them; the public became accustomed to the idea that some sort of apocalypse might be just around the corner. \"Insecurity is the key driving concept of our times,\" says Durodie. \"Politicians have packaged themselves as risk managers. There is also a demand from below for protection.\" The real reason for this insecurity, he argues, is the decay of the 20th century's political belief systems and social structures: people have been left \"disconnected\" and \"fearful\". Yet the notion that \"security politics\" is the perfect instrument for every ambitious politician from Blunkett to Wolfowitz also has its weaknesses. The fears of the public, in Britain at least, are actually quite erratic: when the opinion pollsters Mori asked people what they felt was the most important political issue, the figure for \"defence and foreign affairs\" leapt from 2% to 60% after the attacks of September 2001, yet by January 2002 had fallen back almost to its earlier level. And then there are the twin risks that the terrors politicians warn of will either not materialise or will materialise all too brutally, and in both cases the politicians will be blamed. \"This is a very rickety platform from which to build up a political career,\" says Eyal. He sees the war on terror as a hurried improvisation rather than some grand Straussian strategy: \"In democracies, in order to galvanize the public for war, you have to make the enemy bigger, uglier and more menacing.\" Afterwards, I look at a website for a well-connected American foreign policy lobbying group called the Committee on the Present Danger. The committee features in The Power of Nightmares as a vehicle for alarmist Straussian propaganda during the cold war. After the Soviet collapse, as the website puts it, \"The mission of the committee was considered complete.\" But then the website goes on: \"Today radical Islamists threaten the safety of the American people.

It's the story of a secret prison where torture methods, both subtle and overt, force information out of prisoners who have no legal recourse. The prison never would have been known to exist had it not been for a footnote in a historical paper. Let us not forget that each of us has a part within that wants to be able to control and manipulate others. By acknowledging and working on that part of ourselves, we are choosing to be a part of the solution, rather than a part of the problem. Take care and have a good day.

Gad Kroizer, an Israeli historian, was researching old British police buildings when he stumbled on a 70-year-old map drawn by a government architect. The map showed the location of 62 police compounds built by the British in Palestine in the late 1930s and early 1940s where both Arabs and Jews who agitated against Britain's occupation were interrogated. What caught Kroizer's eye was a camp called Meretz, which he had not seen on any contemporary Israeli map or read about in any modern writing on security compounds in the Jewish state. \"There was a discrepancy between the map I had and the lists I'd been looking at,\" says Kroizer, who lives in Jerusalem and teaches at Bar-Ilan University. \"I started putting two and two together.\" What Kroizer had discovered and later footnoted in an academic paper (published in the March 2004 issue of Cathedra, circulation: 1,500) was the location of an ultrasecret jail where Israel has held Arabs in total seclusion for years, barred visits by the Red Cross and allegedly tortured inmates. Known as 1391, the facility is used as an interrogation center by a storied unit of Israel's military intelligence, whose members-all Arabic speakers-are trained to wring confessions from the toughest militants. According to Arabs who've been imprisoned in 1391, some of the methods are reminiscent of Abu Ghraib: nudity as a humiliation tactic, compromising photographs, sleep deprivation. In a few cases, at least, interrogators at 1391 appear to have gone beyond Israel's own hair-splitting distinction between torture and what a state commission referred to in 1987 as \"moderate physical pressure.\" But the nightmare for those in 1391 is the isolation and the fear that no one knows where you are, say Arabs who've been held there as well as an Israeli who's been inside the prison.

The location of the compound is so hush-hush that a court this year banned a visit by an Israeli legislator. Prisoners describe being hooded everywhere at the facility except in their cells. Jailers often tell them they're on the moon or in another country (in fact, the compound is less than an hour's drive from Tel Aviv). \"This can be devastating emotionally,\" says Dalia Kerstein, whose Israeli human-rights group, HaMoked, has petitioned the High Court of Justice to close down 1391. \"We've seen that psychological pressure in certain instances can be even harder on inmates than physical pressure.\" Hassan Rawajbeh would be the first to agree. A member of the nearly disbanded Palestinian Preventive Security force suspected of taking part in a shooting attack on Israelis, Rawajbeh was picked up by soldiers in Nablus 18 months ago. After stops at two other detention centers, he was hooded, handcuffed and thrown on the floor of a van. When the hood was removed, he was in a tiny, windowless cell with black walls and almost no light. The chamber contained no toilet, only a bucket in the corner, which the 39-year-old Rawajbeh says his jailers would empty once every few weeks. A low buzzing droned constantly. Rawajbeh, who denies shooting at Israelis, was never beaten, but he says he was on the verge of a breakdown. \"I was jailed six times before,\" he said earlier this month at his office in Nablus, where other Palestinians, some armed with pistols, smoke cigarettes and drink coffee. \"But those experiences were like five-star hotels compared to 1391.\" For nearly four months, Rawajbeh saw no one but his interrogators, who kept him naked for days at a time and prevented him from going to the bathroom. \"You begin to feel like the jail exists only for you, that no one else is there,\" he says. Israeli officials deny torturing inmates at 1391 or any other facility. But Gideon Ezra, the former deputy head of Israel's Shabak security service, says psychological pressure is one of the most effective tools interrogators have in the war against terrorism. Ezra, now a member of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Likud Party and his cabinet, says 1391 was actually set up as an interrogation center for non-Palestinian Arabs who entered Israel illegally. (Ezra says the number 1391 corresponds to the adjacent military base and has no particular significance.) \"In cases like that, you need to find out very quickly who this person is", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:topsecretjail.txt:1:ae65a23d1f59", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14737, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "topsecretjail.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "topsecretjail", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "service, says psychological pressure is one of the most effective tools interrogators have in the war against terrorism.

(Ezra says the number 1391 corresponds to the adjacent military base and has no particular significance.) \"In cases like that, you need to find out very quickly who this person is and how he might harm you.\" But at least one former inmate at 1391 says the comparison to Abu Ghraib is fitting. Mustapha Dirani was brought to the facility after being abducted by Israeli commandos from his home in Lebanon in 1994. Israel believed Dirani knew the whereabouts of a missing airman, Ron Arad, and wanted to glean information quickly, while he was still stunned from the kidnapping. Dirani, who returned to Lebanon five months ago in a prisoner swap, said in a phone interview that he was raped by a soldier in those first days at 1391 and sodomized by an interrogator he identified as George. His civil suit against the state for more than $1 million in damages is scheduled to start in January. \"It's the same style as in Abu Ghraib. They take advantage of the fact that Arabs and Muslims are culturally conservative,\" says Dirani, who spent eight years at 1391 but was never tried for a crime. In what might look to some people like a foreshadowing of Abu Ghraib, Dirani said in an affidavit four years ago that he was interrogated naked for days and photographed repeatedly. George has since left the intelligence unit that operates at 1391, according to Kerstein of HaMoked. She believes the Army might be worried the interrogator will divulge other scandals if the Dirani case ever goes to trial. In an interview with Israel's Channel Two television four months ago, George said Dirani invented the rape story to avoid retribution back in Lebanon for information he divulged to the Israelis. Kroizer, the academic who stumbled on 1391, is still surprised by the attention his footnote received. Days after his paper was published, his editor got a call from Israel's military censor, who wanted to know why the article had not been submitted for inspection. \"We publish an historical journal. We usually deal with issues that are at least 30 years old,\" says the editor, Benjamin Zeev Wexler. \"But I thought it was interesting to note that this old British interrogation center was still operating today.\" For a few hundred Arabs held there over the years, it was no news at all.

Whether or not anyone chooses to believe the scenario portrayed is entirely up to him or her.

In presenting this alternative interpretation of our world, I have simply gone straight into the \"conspiracy theory\" version of history with scant regard for quite viable alternative explanations for much of what has happened in recent years.

This piece is split into four sections. The first section consists of a basic overview of our recent history and possible destiny from the perspective of an increasingly popular \"conspiracy theory.\" The second looks at the means by which such a plan might be being kept from our awareness. The third examines some basic concepts that are used in the manipulation of large population groups. And the fourth looks at what concerned citizens might do to transform this process. People from a wide variety of backgrounds are increasingly willing to take seriously the notion that much of what we are taught of our history is some distance from the truth. In accordance with classic \"conspiracy theory\" beliefs, they believe that the degree of randomness ascribed to much of what has happened in the last few centuries is excessive, and that, behind the scenes, a coherent negative force may be manipulating the events of our lives for its own ends. **It is believed that there exists an \"elite cabal\" at the apex of banking and industry, operating through government and the media, and controlling our political, social and personal lives to ever-increasing degrees.** This elite group has been pursuing its ambitions for centuries and is operating an agenda entirely not in our interest. It has ruthlessly manipulated the political landscape via the strategic destabilization and reorganization of nation states; and its ultimate objective is to take the incredibly diverse range of human cultures once existing on Earth and slowly mould them into a single, homogenized trading and consuming block under their centralized control. The principal means by which it is believed this group is seeking to do this is via the expansion of their own developmental prototype for world culture - America; a set of cultural values that is systematically being expanded across the world, progressively eliminating a wealth of ancient peoples and beliefs, and leaving in their place a standardized, consumerist stereotype. **The ultimate goal of this proposed elite group is to bring about a single global marketplace, controlled by a world government, policed by a world army, financially regulated by a world bank via a single global currency, and populated by a microchipped population connected to a global computer**, a computer that both monitors and updates our personal location and financial status, and regulates our emotional state via transmitted electrical signals - technology that already exists.

This ambition of thus rendering the Earth a planet under complete control - a self-contained, interactive social structure under total centralized control - is chiefly being pursued via activities in two areas - commerce and culture. In \"commerce,\" the elite group have created the corporations, the vehicles for total control of the planet, and in \"culture,\" the elite group have created both the drivers and passengers of those vehicles - us. The historical roots of this \"elite group\" stretch back into the mists of time. But the development of the modern banking system in Middle Ages Europe provides a useful starting point for a look at their activities. The reader should note that, in describing the activities of this proposed elite cabal, I have had to give them a name, that name usually being simply \"the elite.\" ** Part One - The World Outside** **A Brief History of Banking** *Let me issue and control a nation's money and I care not who writes the laws - [Amschel Rothschild](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayer_Amschel_Rothschild)* In the recent era, the story of \"the elite\" commences with the development of the modern banking system in Middle Ages Europe. At that time, disposable wealth was usually held in the form of gold or silver bullion. For safety, such assets were kept in the safe of the local goldsmith, he usually being the only individual who had a vault on his premises. The goldsmith would issue a receipt for the deposit and, to undertake financial transactions, the buyer would withdraw his gold and give it to the seller, who would then deposit it again, frequently with the same goldsmith. As this was a time-consuming process, it became common practice for people to simply exchange smiths' receipts when conducting financial transactions. As time passed, the goldsmiths began to issue receipts for specific values of gold, making buying and selling easier still. The smiths' receipts thus became the first banknotes. The goldsmiths, now fledgling bankers, noticed that at any one time only a small proportion of the gold held with them was being withdrawn. So they hit upon the idea of issuing more of the receipt notes themselves, notes that did not refer to any actual deposited wealth. By giving these receipts to people seeking capital, in the form of loans, the goldsmiths could use the money deposited with them by others to make money for themselves. It was found that, for every unit of gold held by the goldsmith, ten times the sum could be safely issued as notes without anyone usually becoming any the wiser. If a goldsmith held, say,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:2:403af8f3b01f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14742, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "more of the receipt notes themselves, notes that did not refer to any actual deposited wealth.

It was found that, for every unit of gold held by the goldsmith, ten times the sum could be safely issued as notes without anyone usually becoming any the wiser. If a goldsmith held, say, 100 pounds of other people's gold in his vaults, he could issue banknotes to the value of 1000 pounds. As long as no more than 10 percent of the holders of those notes wanted their gold at any one time, no one would realize the fraud being perpetrated. **This practice, known as \"[fractional reserve banking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking),\" continues to this day and is actually the backbone of the modern banking industry. Banks typically loan ten times their actual financial holdings, meaning 90% of the money they lend does not now, never has, and never will exist. ** Loans issued by the goldsmiths had to be paid back to them with interest, meaning non-existent money slowly became converted to tangible assets in the form of goods and labor. Should the loan be defaulted upon, the banker had the right to seize the defaulter's property. As time passed, therefore, the goldsmiths became wealthier and wealthier. They had devised a scheme to create money out of thin air and then convert this money into real goods, labor, or property. **A customer deposit of $10 was thus used to create a loan of $100, which at an interest rate of say 15% would bring the banker a nifty profit, a practice which continues to be the standard in banking to this day. ** As the industrial era began, so the potential for furthering this scheme increased exponentially. The goldsmiths were now fully-fledged bankers, and their ability to create money out of thin air and then convert it into tangible assets enabled them to begin to control whole industries to the point where the worlds of banking and industry became, to all intents and purposes, seamless entities. Extended family banking structures, such as [the Rothschilds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family), acquired so much power in this manner that the various monarchies and fledgling governments of the time soon began to seem quite feeble by comparison. To increase their power and influence still further, these elite banking families would subtly buy influence within governments or monarchies and utilize this influence to strategically stir up unrest between nations. When the inevitable disputes broke out, they would then lend vast sums of money, usually to both sides, so that war could be waged. Any armaments purchased would be those manufactured by the industrial wing of the banking-industrial cartel, and by regulating the loan of money and the timing of the delivery of weapons, the outcome", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:3:2f1d4719d1cc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14743, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "further, these elite banking families would subtly buy influence within governments or monarchies and utilize this influence to strategically stir up unrest between nations.

Any armaments purchased would be those manufactured by the industrial wing of the banking-industrial cartel, and by regulating the loan of money and the timing of the delivery of weapons, the outcome of any conflict could effectively be controlled. If deemed necessary, monarchies and governments could further be destabilized by generating poverty through regulating the money supply, and by using agent-provocateur tactics to fuel any latent desire for revolution. With such power it was easy to control the fledgling governments of Europe and ensure that only those politicians who would do the will of the banking families came to power. **As the twentieth century dawned, the banking families hit upon a new means to consolidate and increase their gains. They discovered that by periodically restricting the money supply, crashes within the emergent stock exchanges of the world could easily be engineered.** The most notable example of this was the famous Wall Street Crash of 1929. What the history books usually fail to record is that, in a crash, wealth is not actually destroyed, but merely transferred. The \"Crash of '29\" allowed the most powerful of the banking and industrial families to absorb the weaker elements, generating even greater levels of centralized control. As the technological revolution progressed, so the buying up of TV stations and newspapers allowed the creation and [control of the mass media](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediacorruption). This served to ensure that only a portrayal of events that suited the interests of the elite banking families would get to public attention - invariably one that all but denied their very existence. **A Closer Look at Government** The vision we're usually given of how political power is manifest in our society typically runs something like this: government at the top, banking, industry, media and military, beneath, and the people beneath this. However, an independent examination of the development of modern political power is more likely to reveal the following arrangement: extended family banking groups at the top, government beneath, facilitating the wishes of this hierarchy, and the media beneath portraying the work of the government to the people as \"democracy in action.\" It can thus be seen that, in truth, **most governments are little more than front organizations for the elite banking cartels.** They interface with the public via the media, acting to facilitate social change in a manner that maintains relative social stability, while ensuring that our culture stays in line with any course the elite wish it to pursue. Western governments do not usually allow the public to actually pick who becomes their political representative, merely to choose between individuals selected by the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:4:da11a5f4dffa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14744, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "be seen that, in truth, **most governments are little more than front organizations for the elite banking cartels.** They interface with the public via the media, acting to facilitate social change in a manner that maintains relative social stability, while ensuring that our culture stays in line with any course the elite wish it to pursue. Western governments do not usually allow the public to actually pick who becomes their political representative, merely to choose between individuals selected by the party hierarchy. Neither do the public get to pick the policies the representative will pursue, this is also under the control of the party. To say that this system is open to abuse is a considerable understatement. **America** The creation of the United States of America represents the pinnacle of the elite's ambitions for world domination. **America is, in essence, a prototype for world consumer culture.** By encouraging a broad base of racial groups to settle and develop under their constant control, the banking families have been able to slowly direct the natural evolution of a form of social order that humans from any background can adapt to, without a significant number of them becoming sufficiently dissociated to actually take up arms and overthrow the system. This is aided by a highly repressive justice system and backed by the [largest prison population](http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/wireStory?id=4359509) on the planet. Now that the technological revolution has facilitated the expression of American cultural values across the world, America is, in effect, expanding until the 50 states actually encompass the whole globe in all but name. Our planet is slowly becoming America. America is the ultimate control fantasy - consensual incarceration - whole groups of people slowly driven to believe that there exists no way of securely living together other than by the giving up of personal freedom bit by bit. **World War II** The Second World War, a conflict which cost the lives of tens of millions of people, was entirely manipulated into being by the elite banking and industrial cartels. Hitler rose to power in a country so economically crippled by the reparations imposed after the previous war that going into another should have been inconceivable. But the banking elite agreed to the [loan of billions of dollars](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,100474,00.html), and furthermore set up a vast industrial complex within Germany, (much of it the Standard Oil subsidiary, I.G. Farben), to manufacture the tanks, planes, arms and munitions necessary to wage another European war. Oil pipelines and factories were built, lines of credit extended and the war machine spent nearly a whole decade churning out weaponry while the rest of the country remained in abject poverty thus fueling the desire for war. The whole thing was a set up from start to finish, as even a cursory independent examination will confirm. **The millions of deaths that resulted were looked upon by the banking families as being simply a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:5:f3eb726561c3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14745, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "necessary to wage another European war.

The first is to ruin them, the second for the conqueror to go and reside there in person and the third is to allow them to continue to live under their own laws, subject to a regular tribute, and to create in them a government of the few who will keep the country friendly to the conqueror. - *Niccolo Machiavelli in * [The Prince](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince) * I will now look at the banking families' ambitions in the Southern Hemisphere, or so-called \"Third World.\" All across Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America, the elite banking families have again pursued unrelentingly the ambition of destabilizing a multitude of traditional cultures and creating in their place a series of homogenized trading blocks. In recent years this task has been undertaken chiefly by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But the story commences many years before. Colonization by the European empire builders from the sixteenth century onwards and the later granting of \"independence\" to conquered territories led slowly to the forging of individual nation states with monarchies and governments. **To ensure that these institutions remained subservient to the elite, agent provocateurs and dubious Western government agencies worked behind the scenes to displace any leaders who showed democratic tendencies and replace them with elite puppets from local communities and their extended families. ** To maintain these hated and corrupt regimes in power, the Western banking institutions lent vast sums of money to these \"governments\" and monarchies to enable them to form armies, frequently with foreign troops, and thus prevent the people of the country from wresting power. Loans were further granted for the purchase of weapons, to wage various regional conflicts stirred up by elite agent provocateurs, and to build palatial homes in which the puppet monarchs and their officials might reside. In the early 1970s, the elite-manipulated Yom Kippur war resulted in a massive rise in oil prices.

In the early 1970s, the elite-manipulated Yom Kippur war resulted in a massive rise in oil prices.

Relying on the ever-popular tactic of loaning at least ten times their reserves, the banks now had insane sums of money to lend. With the \"Third World\" countries compelled to pay vastly increased sums for their oil, as well as service the debts already incurred by their puppet leaders, further massive loans were advanced to them in a banking strategy that came to be known as \"petrodollar recycling.\" The Western banks would send [youthful reps across the world offering gigantic loans](https://www.WantToKnow.info/johnperkinseconomichitman) to anyone in power who wanted them. These loans were, of course, created out of thin air and tied to the recipient buying weapons, machinery or goods from the industrial or military clients of the banking cartel offering the money. In the 1980s, the bubbles began to burst, with the Mexican debt crisis becoming the first of many \"days of reckoning.\" The World Bank and the IMF, elite-manufactured organizations created in the 1940s to \"stimulate the conditions of world trade,\" stepped in. They offered \"adjustments\" - strategies for repayment that involved the countries concerned adopting economic \"austerity\" programmes and commencing industrial production of Western goods and consumer products. To commence industrial production, the countries had to take out further loans and buy plant from - the industrial clients of the banking cartels. To generate sufficient power for the new industries, they had to hire companies to build hydroelectric power plants or nuclear reactors - companies that were again the heavy industry clients of the banking cartels. The IMF debt-rescheduling practices enforced on the countries experiencing major problems paying back their loans (problems entirely generated by the elite via their control of world interest rates and oil prices) compelled the \"Third World\" nations, one after another, to commence manufacturing goods, not for themselves but for sale on the world markets. Here, in the emergent global marketplace, they had to compete with each other in a highly competitive market over which they had no control. The only factor in the IMF equation that the Southern Hemisphere countries could control was the cost of labor. The result was cheaper goods for Western consumers and greater poverty for workers in the \"Third World.\" All across the Southern Hemisphere, small farmers were driven away from planting crops for themselves and compelled to plant crops for export, hoping they'd get paid enough to survive.

In the 1980s, runaway inflation stimulated by Reaganomics in America (the arrangement of vast loans for US government spending on military and space projects that sent world interest rates skyrocketing) began to force many local people out of the countryside altogether. They were driven into the newly created cities where they vied with each other for work in the newly built factories. This led to the destruction of traditional ways of life for millions upon millions. **Emergent drug cartels, invariably under the direction of government agencies such as the CIA, began to flood the cities and industrial areas with cheap drugs, hooking those with jobs deeper into a life of wage slavery, and those without into lifelong street-level delinquency.** In addition, grain crops, previously used for bread, were diverted into producing of alcohol for the relocated populations. Problems unheard of a generation before - alcoholism, drug addiction, crime, unemployment, poverty and malnutrition - became epidemic in proportion all across Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. In Brazil, one of the biggest food exporters in the world, approaching half a million children die annually from malnutrition or hunger-related diseases. In the early 1990s, the specter of capitalist greed proved increasingly disturbing for the people buying the goods created in this manner. So the elite came up with \"green-washing\" - the media-driven means by which images of change within the Southern Hemisphere are bombarded upon the Western viewer, convincing them that \"the system\" is adapting to moral pressure from Western citizens. News broadcasts accepted that previous practices had been exploitative but that, post Live Aid and similar, things were changing and any residual problems were entirely the fault of the poorer nations themselves or the weather. The previous \"evil capitalists,\" the Reagans and Thatchers, were removed from power and replaced by consumer-friendly mouthpieces of the elite - the Clintons and the Blairs. On UK TV at the time of this writing (originally Spring 2000), one BBC programme features former Spice Girl, Geri Halliwell, entering the world's shanty towns and meeting crowds of poor but happy-looking children jumping up and down, thus generally promoting the image of gradual change and improvement.

The population of the world is currently estimated at six billion. Three billion of these are existing in poverty, one third of them at near-starvation level. For the majority of the world's citizens, life is now demonstrably worse than at any time in recorded history. **The Future - Chips with Everything?** In the passages above, I've looked at a few aspects of our recent history with the intention of demonstrating that there may be a pattern of organization in the background that could give many people grounds for concern. At this point, I would now like to address the question: \"If there really was a coherent body organizing all of this, what would their motivation be, and where might all this be leading?\" The primary motivation behind all elite activities is the desire to acquire control. It is the base desire to control everything, to take a vast and dynamic planet full of people and drive them into a single cultural structure under their central control. It is the fulfillment of this desire that truly motivates the elite. In their attempt to bring about this highly negative state of affairs, the elite need to be active on two fronts simultaneously - the world outside and the world inside, the planet and the mind. **In the \"world outside,\" the objective the banking families are working towards is globalization - the creation of three vast interlocked markets centered on America, Europe and Asia, followed by their full integration into a single trading block**. A global marketplace peopled with consumer-workers and serviced at the lower end via \"Third World\" debt. **In the \"world inside,\" the plan is to [get all humanity microchipped](https://www.WantToKnow.info/microchipsimplantsnewsarticles).** For, despite a multiplicity of control tactics currently being imposed upon us - mortgages, credit cards, street surveillance systems and antidepressants among them - people still have a basic level of personal freedom. Although it's getting harder to do so, we can still walk out of consumerism and embark on a new life. But if we are chipped this won't happen. This is because scientists' knowledge of neuroscience is now such that, by having a tiny microchip implanted inside our body, we can be regulated at an emotional level.

By gaining control over our body's receptor-ligand network, our emotional state can be manipulated by electrical signals, either as a part of a chip's program or via remote signaling, thus offering the possibility of the creation of a perfect consumer workforce - a people whose only thoughts are those of working, eating, procreating and sleeping. However, despite the progress our planet has made along the road of becoming a world consumerist superstate, most people are still highly resistant to the idea of having a chip put under their skin. There is therefore a progressive strategy that will be gradually implemented to lead us, step by step, into permitting this nightmare future to come about. **It will unfold in three concurrent stages. Firstly, cash will be gradually eliminated. Secondly, all personal and financial data will be placed on individual \"smartcards.\" And, thirdly smartcards will be themselves gradually eliminated to be replaced by microchip implants.** By first removing cash, then introducing problems into electronic money systems while simultaneously promoting microchip implants as a safe and acceptable alternative, the elite will lead us slowly into accepting personal implant technology. I will look more closely at how these three stages will likely unfold. For the past twenty years we have been slowly led towards giving up cash in favor of electronic money, and in the last ten, the heat has been turned up. The increased promotion of credit cards, phone banking, mail order and Internet shopping have all helped to bring about a society where the need for cash transactions is greatly reduced. Yet many people still like carrying cash, meaning more will have to be done if it is to be eliminated completely. One strategy that will be employed will be the gradual implementation of \"smart citizenship\" schemes across ever-widening sectors of our society. \"Smart citizenship\" is one of a variety of euphemisms now emerging for \"cashless society\" and, once one city has been signed up, the benefits can be extensively promoted by the media to encourage others to follow suit. In April 2000 it was announced that the UK city of Southampton and the Swedish city of Gothenberg will host smart citizenship schemes commencing 2002, to be technically facilitated by the French consortium, Schlumberger. Another strategy that might be utilized is the introduction of new, multinational currencies not available as cash. The euro, the currency for the European Union, may well be such a thing.

Another strategy that might be utilized is the introduction of new, multinational currencies not available as cash. The euro, the currency for the European Union, may well be such a thing. Another possibility is that cash will be removed on the pretext of eliminating the illicit drug trade. Many cities now have around 1% of their population using heroin daily. This, along with crack cocaine addiction, is proving a near intolerable social burden for many people who live in the areas affected. If cash were eliminated, anonymous illicit transactions for small sums would not be possible. With electronic money, the identities of the buyer and seller of any article are recorded on computer and, should a transaction be for an illicit substance, it could be traced. Although illicit drugs come into our countries in vast shipments, each load is ultimately sold in small amounts at or near street level. Remove cash and the illicit drug trade would be finished. Whatever tactics are eventually employed, while cash is being eliminated and the creation of a global society pursued, an assortment of \"softening-up\" strategies are likely to be deployed by the media. **There will be a steady trickle of [stories in the papers and on TV](http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2006/01/06/computer_chips_get_under_skin_of_enthusiasts/) relating the benefits of microchipping. Scientists will make statements [extolling the wonders](http://web.archive.org/web/20001109140100/http://more.abcnews.go.com/sections/world/dailynews/cyborgman.html) of implant technology for treating and monitoring illnesses and futuristic articles will relate how, in a few years time, we won't have to carry wallets around.** Such stories will invariably make it seem that microchipping and globalization are not only desirable but also inevitable - that they have already \"been decided.\" Once cash has finally been eliminated from a region, what will next happen is that problems will begin to mysteriously occur within the electronic money system. People will occasionally find their money disappearing into thin air. Computer errors, viruses and fraud, previously virtually unheard of, will increasingly begin to manifest. Having your personal records placed on a microchip implant will become renowned as the only safe way to keep personal data safe from interference, likely because encryption technology available on the personal chip won't be available on the smartcard. Whole groups of people within society will likely have already been chipped by this time. Criminals, the mentally ill, and military personnel are three likely targets. The media will constantly portray chipping as the socially positive thing to do.

Getting chipped will be seen as a cool thing to do, with a vast array of different chip features available to order. Getting chipped will be seen as synonymous with \"getting ahead\" and attracting members of the opposite sex. The media will spare no effort ensuring that the negative aspects of getting chipped, such as feeling like a robot, are driven from people's minds. To still further intensify the drive to get the public chipped, large corporations will begin to make it a requirement for employment, likely under the guise of it being their contribution to creating a positive society. By this time the multinational corporations of today, big as they already are, will have been transformed into transnational giants, astride the world like statues of Colossus, controlling vast sectors of the earth's resources and meeting them out according to their masters' schedule, and with a vast and continuous PR job making it all appear completely consensual. Virtually everything purchased will be from a multinational corporation, and nearly all employment opportunities will involve working for one. With cash gone and no way of bringing it back, and the credit card, ID card, and even smartcard systems increasingly falling into disrepair, life will begin to seem pretty bleak for those persons not chipped. **Pretty soon, not being chipped will effectively mean you are not capable of working for a regular wage in any but the most menial job. ** There will initially still be a large black market operating at varying degrees outside the law and trading in a wide variety of licit and illicit substances. But, as chipping proceeds all across Western society, and becomes seen as being as natural as paying tax, so the State will increasingly make moves to attack illicit activity. With the moral backing of the microchipped population, engineered by the media, those persons not chipped will increasingly be marginalized in the same way the homeless are now - forced to the edges of society and left to fend for themselves in an environment of poverty, drug addiction, sexual exploitation and crime. **Once chipping is finally accepted as being an integral part of life in the twenty-first century, the next stage will be implemented - the promotion of chips that can regulate aspects of our body's function. ** Self-regulation of our body and mind will be seen as a new and convenient means of treating any number of complaints ranging from depression to minor flesh wounds.

No need to take tablets or call up the doctor, just program your chip to do it for you. Scientists are now sufficiently knowledgeable of our body's electrical system and ligand-receptor networks that they can superficially alter many of our natural emotional functions. By changing the way our body metabolizes serotonin, for example, the symptoms of depression can be relieved. With chips available capable of altering a whole range of neurochemical functions, we will increasingly have the ability to emotionally regulate ourselves. Given that it is now well recognized that negative emotions are mere symptoms of deeper needs not being met, all sorts of health problems could easily go undiagnosed. But, apart from health concerns, giving people the means to easily emotionally self-regulate could lead to the \"Prozac generation\" becoming global. People will become obsessed with feeling good about themselves all the time, ignoring anything which threatens to interfere with that feeling. Wars, starvation, political upheavals and global tyranny will all become just \"other people's problems.\" With implant technology accepted as being part of life in the twenty-first century, who is going to notice if one day the chips seem to start regulating themselves. **Who is going to notice if they no longer require us to actually program them, but seem to do it without our help, no longer allowing us access to our true feelings even if we wanted them? ** This nightmare scenario seems like something out of science fiction but, in fact, much of the technology has already been developed. The implantable microchip with global tracking system and biomonitoring system, Digital Angel, is scheduled to go into production in late 2000, [[now in full production](http://www.digitalangel.com/)]. It is powered by human muscle movement and will be offered to people concerned that they or their loved ones may go missing and to doctors wanting to monitor their patients. Patents for implantable chips that release pharmaceuticals into the bloodstream have already been issued and companies, such as ChipRx, have been set up to develop them for the market. The technology is here, the only question is: how much persuading will be necessary to make us accept it? One thing is certain - everything will be done bit by bit.

We are intelligent and inquisitive creatures by nature, craving input and stimulation, and it would appear impossible that a truth of this magnitude could be hidden from us for such a length of time. As I hope to demonstrate, it is actually quite straightforward. **The \"conditioning\" process that most of us undergo in the course of a normal Western childhood not only causes us to divert from our natural behavior but also permanently alters the way most of us evaluate information.** In the second section of this piece I shall be looking at how a typical Western childhood can subconsciously render us: addicted to material pleasures and the quest for personal power, resistant to information which contradicts what we believe we already know, and impervious to natural self-healing - and all without most of us becoming any the wiser. **Conditioning** Conditioning is the means by which our reaction to traumatic events can be put to use to cause us to permanently alter our natural behavior. **Parents usually condition their children by giving them affection when their behavior is deemed \"good\" and withholding affection when it is deemed \"bad.\" **They do this because the overwhelming majority of cultural influences they are exposed to tell them it must be done or we will not grow up to be \"civilized\" human beings. The action of conditioning, when it first occurs, will cause the mind to repress - to block awareness of what it was that happened. This will reoccur the first few times the action of conditioning, for instance, slapping, occurs. Then the mind will learn. It will learn that, in order to avoid being slapped in future, it must undertake the change in behavior required. However, in order for conditioning to take place, the memory and pain associated with the original act of conditioning must remain repressed within, blocked from our awareness. The intention of the mind, in blocking our awareness of events and repressing any associated emotions, is to protect us from emotional damage in our formative years.

The intention of the mind, in blocking our awareness of events and repressing any associated emotions, is to protect us from emotional damage in our formative years. Each time something happens around us that in any way reminds our subconscious mind of a repressed memory, we receive a little burst of anxiety as repressed emotions begin to be processed. As repressed memories build up, whole areas of natural thinking and behavior thus begin to become painful to us. The mind deals with this by learning subconsciously to avoid situations that remind it of repressed memories; and it is this \"need to avoid\" that allows the conditioned mind to be so easily controlled.** By creating a culture in which repressed pain is not released from the system but, instead, can merely be avoided through social conformity, Western populations become emotionally dependent on their culture to feel secure.** They can thus easily be directed to both do work and follow a lifestyle that slowly draws the planet under centralized control. **The Persona** One means by which nearly all Westerners learn to avoid contact with repressed emotions is through the development of a \"persona.\" **The persona is essentially a shield, a face that one can present to the world, behind which one can interact with society free from the risk of experiencing repressed pain. A consequence of developing this shield is that we, as children, start to learn to mask our true needs behind symbolic needs.** We naturally crave deep love and affection but many learn not to seek it directly for fear of re-experiencing the pain that results when it is denied. Instead, many of us grow up learning to crave things that merely symbolize what we truly want, things like material possessions, personal power, sensual pleasures, and fame. Material possessions symbolize love because we learn that our parents show us love by giving us things. Personal power symbolizes love because it represents freedom of expression, the withholding of which was used to condition us. Sensual pleasures symbolize love because we associate intimacy with love. Fame symbolizes love because we associate adoration with love. All these cravings are for things that symbolically represent what we truly need but are not the actual need itself. Because the true needs are not being met, the pleasure experienced proves only temporary and the craving for more symbols of love quickly returns. This is the true root of the universal problem of greed. The child chasing mere symbols of its true wants becomes the adult doing the same. We thus grow up driven to seek", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:15:fef5189d2038", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14755, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "adoration with love.

We thus grow up driven to seek out things that merely symbolize what we actually want, and so never experience lasting satisfaction. When we don't comprehend the root of our behavior, we simply assume that we don't have enough and strive for more. **School** Our school years are a time when we should be opening up emotionally, learning about the world and understanding what it means to be alive. Instead, **most people's experience of school is that of being subjected to a rigorous indoctrination process while immersed in an emotionally repressive environment.** An atmosphere of inhibition and abuse pervades, and fear of ridicule from our peer group causes us to spend most of our time hiding our true feelings and directing our energy into maintaining face. Our shield, our persona, is maintained by self-esteem. Experiencing a feeling of security within the peer group is vital if the persona is to be held in place. To experience embarrassment in front of one's peers will instantly expose the individual to deeply painful repressed emotions, and thus is something to be avoided at all costs. One result of this is a corruption of our innate need to understand the nature of our world. For, from now on, whether or not we accept what we learn as being true will depend not only on whether it makes sense, but also on whether we feel that believing it might pose a threat to our place within the peer group. We thus become dependent on our beliefs not only to help us understand the world but also to help maintain our persona. It is natural therefore that we soon develop a deep need to agree with the taught versions of subjects such as history and science. For not to do so would invite ridicule, and thus lead to a re-experiencing of deeply negative repressed feelings. **The Persona and Social Conformity** Our developing of this \"need to agree\" explains why the overwhelming majority of us appear so happy to go along with convention and popular belief, and are therefore resistant to \"conspiracy theories.\" In fact, even when reading a controversial article in a journal, something that offers little chance of us actually being hurt, the subconscious mind remains constantly on the lookout for anything that could potentially affect our self-image, constantly aware of our need to maintain face. Should it encounter something threatening, it will quickly try to dump the information and move on", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:16:4d03dd19d40c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14756, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "us appear so happy to go along with convention and popular belief, and are therefore resistant to \"conspiracy theories.\" In fact, even when reading a controversial article in a journal, something that offers little chance of us actually being hurt, the subconscious mind remains constantly on the lookout for anything that could potentially affect our self-image, constantly aware of our need to maintain face. Should it encounter something threatening, it will quickly try to dump the information and move on to something else, not bothering to engage the rational mind and evaluate the idea further. We can see how dangerous this is when we look at how little most people challenge the accepted version of history. Of World War II, for example, we are typically taught that Hitler was an evil dictator who rose to power in Germany and sought to take over the world. This provoked a reaction from the Allies, which, while causing a massive and regrettable loss of life, was unfortunately necessary if the world was to be saved from a global fascist regime. But how many of us ask how it was that Hitler, the leader of a country so economically crippled that a wheelbarrow full of banknotes was needed to purchase a mere loaf of bread, could afford the immense cost of all-out European war? **How was it that the German army could secure the vast and continuing supply of oil and armaments necessary to undertake war on so many fronts simultaneously? The answer, of course, is that it was loaned the money necessary by the banking and industrial cartels of the West. ** Yet most people reading this will not bother to enquire further into this story. Instead they will rapidly discount the whole idea on the first pretext that enters their mind. This is because, working at a subconscious level, our mind has already worked out that, if we believe that World War II was entirely manipulated into being by elite groups, then we are going to have to believe that other events in our history may have been similarly manipulated, and if we do this, it knows that we are going to have to adopt a set of beliefs that is different from that of our peers, thus potentially exposing us to ridicule. The need to hold down pain is greater than the need to know the truth and so defensive functions deny us the ability to rationally assess controversial information. Now let's look more deeply at this process. **Emotional Hijacking** In the 1990s, author Daniel Goleman memorably coined the term \"emotional hijacking\" to describe the process by which one part of our mind, operating below the level of our conscious awareness, can \"hijack\" our information-processing facilities and cause us to act irrationally, invariably in situations that it believes could be threatening to us.

Now let's look more deeply at this process. **Emotional Hijacking** In the 1990s, author Daniel Goleman memorably coined the term \"emotional hijacking\" to describe the process by which one part of our mind, operating below the level of our conscious awareness, can \"hijack\" our information-processing facilities and cause us to act irrationally, invariably in situations that it believes could be threatening to us. Emotional hijacking refers to the ability of lower parts of the mind - our instincts, drives and defence mechanisms - to dictate the activity of the higher parts - our facilities for analysis, deduction and creativity. **While we have developed a brain with quite phenomenal processing power, it is still subservient to our more primitive needs**, and if what the higher brain is processing begins to concern our defence functions, then subconscious processes cut in and hijack intellectual activity, directing the mind to simply move away from the lines of thought that are inducing anxiety. Another important route for emotional hijacking is the shift into analytical thinking. If, while processing information, the lower brain begins to become concerned about deductions being made, it can direct the higher mind to seek alternative ways to account for what is presented. This is of course a natural part of the analysis process, but here it is being done, not to further understanding, but to block the formation of anxiety-inducing deductions. The difference is that, when analysis is done to block deductive reasoning, a person will develop an emotional need to believe his or her interpretation is correct. **He or she will become emotionally, rather than intellectually, biased towards one viewpoint.** Now, let's look at the third and most damaging way our natural development of a persona comes to affect our life. **Learning to Deny Our Pain** In addition to the way the persona can render us reliant on consumer culture, and cause us to believe only the mainstream interpretation of history, so it also prevents from us realizing what has happened to us. For, **when we operate from behind a persona, we must resist any attack on our self-esteem. This means we must oppose any suggestion that we have been in any way negatively affected by the experiences of our childhood. ** We saw earlier that, in order to release ourselves from the negative effects of repressed material, we must become consciously aware of its existence, express the pain, and so commence the grieving process. Yet, while we are constantly engaged in maintaining face, we cannot begin to come to terms with what has happened to us and thus begin to heal ourselves. In emotional terms, life becomes a simple feedback loop. Because we have been conditioned, we cannot face the notion that conditioning has affected us.

And because we cannot face the notion that conditioning has affected us, we cannot heal ourselves of its effects. And we thus go on to condition others. **The conditioning of children is central to all elite activities in Europe and the US, and is always done on the pretext of rendering them \"civilized.\"** Once one generation of children has grown up conditioned, you have the raw material that can be directed to go out and enslave other cultures on your behalf. **Part Three - Achieving Total Control** In this section I will look more closely at how the elite is attempting to achieve total control, firstly in terms of principles and symbolism, and then via actual examples. Knowledge is power. Exploiting people is very simple when you have a little more knowledge than they do. And while our knowledge of many things these days is impressive, there are areas where we are deeply lacking. It is because we do not understand how important emotions are and how subconscious needs will always try and get themselves met that we become so controlled by repressed emotions. And it is because the majority do not know what the minority know that so many end up being controlled by so few. Many of the principles used by the elite are already familiar to us, albeit in a different form. But it is the ones that we are not aware of that are being used so effectively to control us. **Pyramids** The pyramid represents a form of political or social structure that allows a small group of individuals to control a much larger group. If you imagine a pyramid split up into ascending levels, you have the basic model. At each level up, there are fewer people but greater power. **The hierarchical pyramid power structure is found all over Western culture. Corporations and government bodies classically use this structure to manage their activities.** At each level on the promotional ladder, there is greater power. And when one gets to the top, the entire structure can be controlled on one's own. When setting up these hierarchical power structures, the elite will invariably design an organization to initially have a benign social function. Once it has power, its role can then be progressively changed such that it begins to forward a hidden agenda when the time is right. **Imbalance and Disconnection** In addition to utilizing the forces represented by the pyramid, the elite also work extensively with the power of \"imbalance.\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:19:136dad6a7ef8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14759, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "the top, the entire structure can be controlled on one's own. When setting up these hierarchical power structures, the elite will invariably design an organization to initially have a benign social function. Once it has power, its role can then be progressively changed such that it begins to forward a hidden agenda when the time is right. **Imbalance and Disconnection** In addition to utilizing the forces represented by the pyramid, the elite also work extensively with the power of \"imbalance.\" **This is done by vastly overemphasizing one side of a structure that is naturally resolved into two seemingly opposed parts - the male over the female, conservatism over liberalism, reductionism over holism, and so on. ** This has the effect of generating deep imbalances within the human psyche, and our innate desire to return to a state of wholeness can be put to use to further negative ends. In order that this principle is effective, we need to be led into believing that the state of imbalance is natural. This is done via yet another well-known principle - the principle of disconnection. From the middle ages onwards, Westerners have sold us the lie that their culture derives almost entirely from Ancient Greece, when in truth it is intimately connected with the ancient cultures of the Middle East, India and the Orient. By creating this disconnection from our true past, the elite can impose their vision of culture upon us, including our belief that overtly one-sided structures are our cultural norm. And because we consciously believe that the culture that surrounds us is natural when it is in fact only half the story, the subconscious mind is driven to seek out a state of wholeness that it feels must exist somewhere. People experience a constant feeling that \"something is missing,\" and this feeling can be put to use in the ongoing quest for total control of the planet, as we shall see at the end of this chapter. In addition, by creating the illusion that Western culture springs from just one source, the elite are also free to utilize other people's knowledge to forward their own aims without the masses realizing its true significance. Esoteric principles derived from ancient Eastern and Middle Eastern cultures, and are being used to control us while we actually ridicule their very existence and our scientists expend much energy trying to prove they are not so! Which brings us to science. **Science** Science is a field in which the elite have been particularly active. In order to keep hidden knowledge to themselves, and thus be free to exploit it to the maximum, the elite had to find a means to keep others away from its study. This was done by establishing a school of thought that would draw the emergent learned classes of Renaissance Europe away from ancient esoteric principles and instead lead them into developing", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:20:da6bd0b19dd4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14760, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "Which brings us to science. **Science** Science is a field in which the elite have been particularly active.

This was done by establishing a school of thought that would draw the emergent learned classes of Renaissance Europe away from ancient esoteric principles and instead lead them into developing the technologies the elite could use to exploit natural forces for their own ends. This school of thought would become known simply as \"science.\" Science is essentially a philosophy of measurement based around the principles of empiricism, or experimentation, and objectivity, the reproducibility of this experimentation. Science, as we know it today, became established with the elite's creation of the Royal Society in 1640s London. In helping to make popular this new and objective \"science,\" the elite achieved two vital aims. Firstly, the significance of esoteric knowledge became progressively hidden from view and thus slowly disregarded by the masses. Secondly, the forces of the material world could progressively be harnessed by the elite as more and more learned men and women were drawn into pursuing this study. To reinforce this new science's ability to merely manipulate natural forces, the principle of reductionism was also vastly emphasized over its counterpart, contextualism, or holism. Reductionism is a scientific philosophy which espouses that something can be understood by examination of its constituent parts as opposed to its function. What the founders of the Royal Society knew, that our scientists today do not, was that the process of formulating scientific laws based upon objective experimentation, the basis of science, would not easily reveal true insights into the nature of our existence. Implicit to the esoteric model is the need for systematic and sustained subjective analysis in addition to objective evaluation. **Science's emphasis on the objective over the subjective therefore actually renders it largely impotent as a tool by which we can truly learn about matters of deeper significance in our world. ** The media unrelentingly promote science as some form of search for \"the truth,\" and frequently debase ideas on the grounds that they are \"unproven.\" Yet, as philosophers of science from Plato to A.N. Whitehead have pointed out, **science often serves much less as a search for the truth than as a means of indoctrinating others into a rigid interpretation of our world narrowly defined by scientists.** \"Proof\" is actually a quite meaningless concept in many ways for, conceptually, only certain types of ideas can be empirically proven, and then only within one, very limited mental framework. Sadly, very few scientists are aware of this, and so the majority go on believing that the attributes of empiricism and objectivity confer some special status to their studies. The reality is that science is merely", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:21:275c88010e1d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14761, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "of indoctrinating others into a rigid interpretation of our world narrowly defined by scientists.** \"Proof\" is actually a quite meaningless concept in many ways for, conceptually, only certain types of ideas can be empirically proven, and then only within one, very limited mental framework. Sadly, very few scientists are aware of this, and so the majority go on believing that the attributes of empiricism and objectivity confer some special status to their studies. The reality is that science is merely one branch of philosophy, and whether people believe it or not depends not on some innate validity it might possess but simply on what the majority have been told is \"the truth.\" ** What the elite understood was that what actually mattered was whether people believed science or not.** The pursuit of a science based on empiricism, objectivity, and reductionism could not easily lead anyone to freedom, and a person brought up to believe in the absolute validity of science would develop a mindset that blocked recognition of this. Yet, even taking into account the conceptual problems, science could still lead to much technology that would free many sectors of society. Effective medications that actually address the cause of illnesses, as opposed to merely temporarily relieving symptoms, and free energy applications are two good examples. And so the elite continue to exert immense power over how modern science develops via a variety of \"establishment\" bodies in government, education and the private sector.** By ensuring that funding for research goes only goes where they want it, the elite thus ensure that science uncovers only that which is beneficial to their deeper purpose. **Now let's look at how scientific beliefs are put to work by the elite. **Thinking and Control** The power of thought is well respected among the controlling elite. Indeed, our thoughts, especially those about ourselves in relation to others, are recognized as being a vital source of energy that can be put to work. **Encouraging selfishness has always made sense to the elite. In the US, a specific social structure has been created wherein the needs of the individual are seen as outweighing the needs of the group to a degree that is unparalleled in modern history.** The corrupted driving instinct that naturally results from exposure to this system benefits the elite in two ways. Firstly, the desire to \"get ahead\" that an American upbringing is specifically intended to induce can be put to work at a corporate level, ensuring that the plan for world takeover proceeds at maximum pace. And secondly, the elite believe that selfish thinking feeds back to them at a psychic level and reinforces their hold on the planet. This latter belief arises because **most of the controlling elite believe that fear, hatred, envy and anger are all emotions that can be used to maintain a state of control over people**. And this is reflected", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:22:0a3768dfba60", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14762, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "induce can be put to work at a corporate level, ensuring that the plan for world takeover proceeds at maximum pace. And secondly, the elite believe that selfish thinking feeds back to them at a psychic level and reinforces their hold on the planet. This latter belief arises because **most of the controlling elite believe that fear, hatred, envy and anger are all emotions that can be used to maintain a state of control over people**. And this is reflected in many of the social and political structures that have developed in the West. Race relations, religion, local government and service industry are all seen as fields where tension and fear can be generated and put to work to help maintain control. However, it is also well recognized that there are limits that must be adhered to when negative emotions are being used to maintain control. For esoteric thought holds that all emotions ultimately derive from love, and so if anyone is driven too deeply into negativity they will discover salvation. **They recognize that the ideal state in which to keep us is that of blame-believing everything is our neighbor's fault, or shame-that everything is our own fault. ** **Western Culture** Here we shall look at how some of the principles mentioned above have actually been put into action. **Patriarchy** - the level to which men dominate our culture accounts for many of the problems our world now faces. Women, being more intuitive than men, are natural healers, and, given the chance, could quite likely resolve many of the world's problems. Yet the overwhelming majority do not get the opportunity to direct their natural healing ability to where it is needed. Instead they find themselves constantly drawn to try and heal individuals resistant to their efforts. Many women who have been subjected to the Western childhood, with its distant and frequently unloving father figures, will find themselves constantly being subconsciously drawn into relationships with certain types of men; men who represent the father who didn't love them in the way their instincts told them he should. By creating a self-perpetuating patriarchy, the elite have successfully ensured that the immense gifts women carry are largely diverted away from where they could do the most good and into fruitless and largely unrewarding sidelines. **Cell structure** - cell structure is what we have when we isolate elements of a process; lots of little cells of activity side by side, each disconnected from the next. Cell structure is found all over Western society - in our jobs, our habits, even in our minds. If Western consumers could see what goes on in the less developed countries of the world simply to bring cheap goods to their tables they would be horrified. But because the process is split up into cells, it is easy to disconnect from the tragedy that is occurring behind the scenes.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:23:943bc15358d4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14763, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "cells of activity side by side, each disconnected from the next.

But because the process is split up into cells, it is easy to disconnect from the tragedy that is occurring behind the scenes. Throughout the less technologically advanced world, relocated populations are compelled to spend long hours churning out clothing in subhuman conditions. The people who ship the clothing to the West don't see this because they just work in shipping; the people who sell the clothing don't see this because they just work in sales; the people who market the clothing don't see this because they just work in marketing; and the people who buy the clothing don't see this because they just see the result of all the marketing. **Because the system is split up into cells, we never realize the level of sheer human misery that goes into producing the inexpensive, abundant goods that we take for granted. ** **Compartmentalization** - essentially, cell structure for the mind. Many people will be aware of the degree to which the media presentation of issues has been standardized over the last decade or so. Slowly the media are being drawn to present information, be it an ad for soap powder or a news broadcast, in pretty much the same format all across the world. This standardization of presentation, combined with the ever-increasing amount of information that we are all now required to process, has the effect of causing our minds to compartmentalize - to split into cells. In order to keep up with all the things that are happening around us, we have to quickly assess incoming information and stick it away in its own little compartment in our minds. Read any newspaper article these days, or watch any news broadcast, and you will find in the opening of the piece information which helps us prepare emotionally and intellectually for what's coming, and tells the mind which compartment to store it in. Pretty soon there will be so much information around that we will cease looking at content at all and merely respond to these little intro \"bytes.\" All of the concepts found above are well-known to those schooled in ancient esoteric thought as means by which natural forces can be harnessed and used for one's own ends.

Having detailed some of the ways that ancient esoteric principals have been put to work at a symbolic and actual level in our world, I now return to modern psychology and look at how the world of commerce is driving our planet along the pathway to total control by the elite, with us at the wheel! **Commerce, workers and consumption** Throughout this piece I have demonstrated how all the pain and fear repressed within drives us away from our natural thinking and behavior and allows us to be easily controlled. Now I would like to expand upon this concept and demonstrate how all the avoidance strategies we are driven to undertake in our daily lives are actually starting to bring about the total control scenario. As we have seen, **many of the daily decisions we take are taken to attempt to fulfil a need that we are not aware exists. We are constantly trying to either protect or distract ourselves from the thought that we are unlovable, or to recreate repressed situations to \"prove to ourselves\" we are not unlovable.** Millions upon millions of us all doing this, so the Western world is actually starting to become just a mass of avoidance strategies. We are each of us interpreting our world in a way that allows us to avoid confrontation with repressed conflicts from our past; and with a society based on supply and demand, so our planet is slowly being compelled to facilitate all these avoidance strategies in order that our minds can continue to hold down all the pain within. This is why our world has become so split between the North and the South. People in the Northern Hemisphere end up enslaving people in the Southern Hemisphere without awareness of what they are doing, just so they can get things to help them get through the day. **The driving instincts and seeking behavior we adopt to keep pain and fear repressed become translated into corporate ambition and consumer desires.** And so we are driven to undertake the enslavement of the \"Third World\" in a desperate attempt to satisfy our misdirected cravings. It is by being brought up in the culture that the elite have manipulated into being that we are driven to virtually enslave other races.

The corporation is the driving force behind the dynamic \"to control everything.\" It is the machine that forcibly draws ever more of the planet's resources under its control. This driving entity sits embedded within a culture of control - a self-sustaining, ever-expanding vortex of repression that generates the people who will work for the corporation and leaves the rest emotionally shipwrecked within a structure that either imprisons them as worker-consumers or sidelines them without the means to effectively rebel (the latter as inmates of the prison system or mental institutions, drug addicts, or the homeless). Emerging as new-born innately beautiful beings from our mothers, our minds are so confused by the bewildering treatment we receive that we allow ourselves to become our own jailers, and slowly, the jailers of the planet. And so we might look at three beautiful humans being born within our culture and see what becomes of them. As a child, Susanna is an amazing person, a golden-haired girl who wants nothing more than to simply enjoy the world around her. But the harsh and imposing conditions of her parents' strict regime soon mean that she is compelled to give up her carefree outlook. As her belief in love and the innate goodness of people is torn from her, she learns to utilize her considerable intelligence to put distance between herself and her past. **Susanna learns that, by distancing herself from others and maintaining borders, she can protect herself from experiencing more pain. ** But because the experiences that caused her to adopt this defensive strategy remain repressed, she has no means to understand what it is that is truly motivating her behavior. Susanna becomes a cynical but powerfully motivated individual. Her driving ambition takes her to the top of the corporate ladder, where the social and economic power she wields enacts a terrible retribution upon the planet. She does not recognize the damage she is doing by forwarding the causes of corporatization for her motivations are entirely subconscious, and her conscious mind always creates excuses.

And should one day she finally begin to understand her part in the tragedy unfolding on Earth and leave the corporate environment, she shall simply be replaced by one of the many under her only too eager to forward their own subconscious agenda. Barry, too, is a quite beautiful and amazing child. Then one day when he is crawling about the floor, his mother shouts at him for getting under her feet. His mother has been getting uptight recently for she has discovered his father has been having an affair. Instead of discussing this with her husband, she finds it easier to just take it out on Barry. Pretty soon, Barry begins to accept that there is no point in \"someone like him\" reaching out for love, for his experience is that it is usually withheld and only results in him getting more pain. And so, as he grows up, he becomes increasingly motivated to do things that can give him some sense of the self-worth he subconsciously craves, none of which of course work. Barry gets a job as a clerk in a post office, intending to use it merely as a stepping stone to a more rewarding life. But his constant subconscious need to experience self worth causes him to slowly be drawn into becoming little more than a slave to consumer society. He works his life away simply to constantly purchase goods, always wanting a new car or new toys for his children, and spends much of his time dreaming of material wealth, believing that, if he had it, the sense of dissatisfaction that lurks within him would go away. Don is another quite beautiful child. He loves nothing more than to look around him at the world going by and stare in wonder at the great beauty of it all. At the age of three, however, Don's father decides it's time he started to grow up, for it was at that age that his own father began to enact his conditioning regime on him. Don starts to find his every waking thought being directed by his father, with any transgression being met with a firm slap. Now grown up, Daniel still loves the natural world. He has no time for consumer culture, soon leaves the small town he grew up in, and heads for the city. There he takes up with a local group of political activists and begins attending demonstrations protesting the activities of the World Trade Organization and similar bodies. **But soon Don's natural desire to reverse the damage being done to our world becomes confused with his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:27:f5d9258d26b6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14767, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "being met with a firm slap.

And so his efforts to change the world ultimately serve only to further marginalize rebellion because his constant subconscious need to indulge in violent confrontations with authority figures ensures that Barry and the millions like him will never join Don on the front-line. Slowly finding himself more and more driven to hang out only with hard-core elements, Don's life begins to implode with self-hatred as he starts to grapple with his inability to control his need for violent confrontation. He soon finds himself addicted to the illicit painkillers which can at least help him maintain emotional stability and, aged 29, is tragically found dead one morning of a heroin overdose in an abandoned building. At his funeral his father believes that, if only he had been tougher on his son, it would all have been different. **Not one of these three characters, or the millions they represent, have done anything wrong. All that has happened is that they have subconsciously utilized natural avoidance strategies to deal with conditioned treatment from their parents.** Unconditioned, and living in a different time and place, they would all have led quite different lives. But here and now, in this time and place, they have become merely the means by which the planet is becoming subject to total control by those who understand how to manipulate human nature. ** Part Four - Escape** Those of you who have read this far could now easily be finding yourselves in a state of either incredulity or despair, possibly a mixture of both. Could it really be true that such an organized assault on our freedom has been going on for so long? And, if it is, what on earth can we do about it? Well, don't panic! Whatever you feel the truth of the matter is, the key to understanding all that is going on around us is to realize that, as a people, we are becoming more aware, and that, as we do so, so more and more people are beginning to develop the capacity to see deeper patterns of causation in the world around us and in the events of our lives.

Most of the rest of this chapter is written for those who, to some degree, do believe. But, even if you are a hardened skeptic, even if you aren't remotely convinced it is happening here and now, you might want to think about ways to prevent this as a possible future scenario. **Evolution of the Mind** **Fifty years ago people simply felt little need to question what they were told to do by those \"above\" them. But because the human mind is still evolving, now they are starting to do so.** And this is why the movement toward globalization and the acceptance of microchip implants is proceeding at such a pace. We are the sleeping giant beginning to stir, and those at the apex of our culture need to shut the prison door tight before we awaken. It is incredible that such a small group of people could wield such a level of control in our world, and all we need to do is wake up and actively express our concerns and the world will be safe. And, without the goal of total control of the world to aim for, the mass of activities currently being undertaken to bring it into being will lose impetus, and the technological advances we have made can be put to use for the benefit of all. **Change** **The real source of the problem is the way we are treating our young. Because we often prefer to give them things to demonstrate our love for them, rather than actually express this love directly, our children grow up addicted to material possessions. Because we teach them wrong from right by withholding affection, they grow up needing rules and regulations, overly concerned with control and personal power. Because they don't adequately experience affection, they grow up craving fame and adoration. And this is principally happening because we experienced the same conditioning when we were children ourselves. ** If we therefore look at both healing ourselves of the effects of our own conditioning, and progressively reducing the degree to which we condition our own children, there will be a massive knock-on benefit to our society. Within many of us there are deep fears that are constantly restricting our ability to express ourselves, and if we wish to avoid transferring these fears onto the next generation, we need to learn where they are coming from and how to stop them crippling", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:29:16d4612c068c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14769, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "therefore look at both healing ourselves of the effects of our own conditioning, and progressively reducing the degree to which we condition our own children, there will be a massive knock-on benefit to our society. Within many of us there are deep fears that are constantly restricting our ability to express ourselves, and if we wish to avoid transferring these fears onto the next generation, we need to learn where they are coming from and how to stop them crippling our desire for change. Remember, the elite are just a few among the six billion people on this planet. The entire source of their power is their ability to corrupt natural instincts and direct subconscious needs into channels of expression that further the ends of total control. This is all they have. And once this principle is understood by more people, it will cease to be effective. Our world will change spontaneously around us and we will be free to love one another in the way we always intended. There are several basic ways in which people who want to can begin to change our world. **Firstly, start to learn about the power of [unconditional love](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#love).** Unconditional love is a real source of healing and actually the most powerful force in existence. When this force begins to become powerful within you, you will find everything else in your life becoming aligned in its wake. **Secondly, challenge the various \"cashless society\" schemes now quietly being introduced in several European cities.** Even if you think the whole idea is ridiculous, might it not be worth clinging to cash for a few extra years just to make sure? The \"SmartCities\" project scheduled to commence in 2002 in Southampton, UK, and Gothenburg, Sweden, is a good example. If the citizens of these towns refuse to accept this plan, then any scheme for world domination is in deep, deep trouble. It might seem ludicrous to believe that such a small thing could save our world, but, in truth, the elite are only too aware of just how tight a time schedule they are on. Once there is resistance at a key point, the whole thing is so severely disrupted it will simply collapse. The immense power that elite groups wield relies entirely on sufficient numbers of people not knowing what is really going on behind the scenes. If the elite cannot get cashless society prototypes going, they cannot get the chips in. And if they cannot get the chips in quickly, then soon so many people will will wake up to what is really going on, it will all be over. So, cling to cash a little. In addition, we can protest any moves to introduce [microchip implants](https://www.WantToKnow.info/microchipsimplantsnewsarticles) onto the market.

In January 2001, US biotech leaders Applied Digital Solutions actually changed the format of their controversial product, Digital Angel, after being bombarded by protests. Digital Angel, a microchip with GPS tracking and human bio-monitoring, was to be offered to the public in implant format, but protests from so-called \"conspiracy theorists\" and Christian groups caused the company to withdraw it and instead offer the chip in wristband format. Advertising features that associate technological advance with implant technology, such as Orange's recent \"in the palm of your hand\" series, can also be attacked. It doesn't matter if the advertiser does not intend to \"soften the way\" for chip implants - if they are using the imagery of implant technology, then protest is valid. **Thirdly, undertake [charitable acts](https://www.WantToKnow.info/051023microcredit).** There are always people less fortunate than ourselves and they require our help. The homeless and those addicted to hard drugs in particular are victims of the elite's inhuman strategy for world domination. **And, finally, start trying to [deal with pain that is repressed within](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue).** It is this which causes us to alter our behavior and thinking to suit the elite's purpose. In fact, the elite believe that all their power is ultimately derived from the repression of emotions. **Release** **The incredible tragedy unfolding in our world is ultimately just the result of millions of personal tragedies that have occurred in our collective childhood.** While we can never reverse what has happened, therapy can help us access our original pain and stop it from controlling our thinking and behavior. In addition, therapy can help us to stop suppressing feelings and actions we believe are unacceptable in our belief that we need to create a persona. **As Jung showed, every emotion we suppress in the belief that we must present only a fragment of our total being to the world continues to exist in our subconscious as part of the \"shadow\" - the counterpart to the persona.** And here all these repressed natural emotions keep us locked in a world of fear and loathing. Remember, there is nothing that we can do that is unnatural. All emotions can be safely accessed and expressed, in appropriate therapy, leaving us free from unnatural needs. **The gentle exploration of the subconscious mind, in such a manner that we can slowly process its contents and express the pain held within, leads to immense natural healing at a very deep level, not just for ourselves but for the planet we inhabit.** These days there are a multiplicity of techniques that can be employed to allow", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:31:ab9568097b63", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14771, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "can do that is unnatural.

These include psychosynthesis, gestalt therapy, rebirthing, primal therapy, psychodrama, hypnotherapy, reiki, transactional analysis, and pulsing - to name but a few. A stress-filled life spent adopting avoidance strategies can be avoided if one takes steps to progressively [uncover any memories repressed](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#acceptance) within us and express the associated emotions. This can be done via therapy or by seeking out peak experiences. All ancient cultures utilized means of releasing the individual from the effects of repression. Some would do this by entering into altered states of consciousness achieved through ritual, the non-ordinary state permitting emotional release to occur on a level not possible in normal awareness. Other cultures would have regular festivals where participants would act out character roles, sometimes with the aid of masks or costume, allowing people to escape sufficiently from their repressed self to release the emotions trapped within. In Greek mythology, the god Dionysus tells Man that he must regularly engage in similar activities or else madness and destruction will descend. It was to the releasing of the effects of trauma and conditioning that he was referring. **Evolution of Humankind ** **Increasing numbers of people believe that humanity is on the edge of a major evolutionary leap.** And there is mounting evidence that many children born now are more developed than those before them. This may be the reason for the near epidemic in cases of hyperactivity or attention deficit disorder now being diagnosed in the West. Those familiar with chaos theory and how living systems evolve will be aware that evolution does not proceed in a smooth and linear fashion. What typically happens is that a few members of a species evolve, followed by a major rearguard action thrown up by nature. Eventually the pressure builds up to such a level that nothing can stop the inevitable and the whole species rapidly rises to a new level of coherence and order. In the ancient writings of the East whence the elite derive their esoteric knowledge, it is believed that the ego, the sense of self, is ultimately just a defensive response we develop to block the experience of primordial fear. And thus it may be that **the centuries of the elite's culture, the culture of the ego, is merely a natural rearguard action waiting to be swept away.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:totalcontrol.txt:32:5db585ae802f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14772, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "totalcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "totalcontrol", "chunk_index": 33, "text": "the whole species rapidly rises to a new level of coherence and order.

This is the realization that the wisdom of the Divine can be discovered deep within you. There is a wide range of means that can facilitate self-mastery through personal transformation. Though the means may vary, the intent behind the means is quite narrowly defined as the intent to expand into a state of integration whereby all aspects of your conscious self become increasingly aligned with your divine essence. There are three particular life principles that help to align your perspective with the perspective of divine essence and thus inspire profound personal transformation. They are: 1) seeing the Divine in all; 2) nurturance of life; and 3) gratitude. When you apply these principles, a deeper meaning will be revealed to the seemingly random events of your life experience. **Seeing the Divine in All** This is the principle that the Divine is present and can be seen everywhere and in all manifestations of life. It is interwoven in all things like an intricate mosaic whose pieces adhere to the same wall, and are thus unified. However, it is not the picture that unifies the mosaic, but the wall upon which its pieces adhere. Similarly, the Divine paints a picture so diverse and seemingly unrelated that there appears to be no unification. Yet it is not the outward manifestations that unify. It is the inward center of divine energy that unifies all life. Seeing the Divine in all is the principle that all manifestations of life convey an expression of All That Is. It does not matter how far the unifying energy has been distorted; the Divine can be observed. It is the action of perceiving unification even when the outward manifestations appear random, distorted, or chaotic. The principle of seeing the Divine in all is the perception that life is perfect in its expression because it flows from perfection, and that no matter how divergent its manifestations are, all life is an extension of the Divine. In light of the obvious turmoil and destruction that are apparent on Earth, this is an outlook or perception that may seem naive. How can life in all its forms and expressions be perceived as optimal or perfect? This is the great paradox of life, and it cannot be reconciled with your mental or emotional capabilities. It can only be understood in the context of the soul, which is deathless, timeless, limitless, and sovereign. **Calling forth the divine perceptions of the soul is actualized through looking for both the inward and outward manifestations of the Divine.** It is not only that the Divine is found within you and within every individual manifestation of life; it is also in itself the wholeness of all life. Thus, this principle of transformation calls for seeing", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:transformation.txt:0:dec05b2c86e7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14778, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "transformation.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "transformation", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "mental or emotional capabilities.

Thus, this principle of transformation calls for seeing the Divine in all its diverse forms of manifestation, as well as in the wholeness of life itself. **Nurturance of Life** Life, in this definition, is an individual's sovereign reality. It is subjective and impressionable. Life is the wholeness of experience flowing past the individual's field of perception in the present moment. Nurturance of life is the principle whereby an individual is in alignment with the natural expansion of intelligence inherent within all life. This alignment enhances the life energy that flows past the individual with the clear intent of gentle support. **It is the action of opening to the highest motive in all people and in all life and supporting the flow of this highest intention towards its ultimate expression.** In so doing, the action is performed without judgment, analysis, or attachment to outcome. It involves simply nurturing the highest energy that flows from all people and thus supporting the fullest expression of their deepest essence. This is a departure from the normal perception that nurturing support can only be granted when others are in alignment with your personal will and desires. When, instead, you view everything in your life as an integrated energy flowing as an expression of ever-expanding divine intelligence, all life is honored as an extension of the Divine. All people and all forms of life can be nurtured and supported to their highest expression. Energy is an element of life that is so subtly interwoven with form that it is one, in much the same manner as space and time are inextricably linked in union. Life energy is always in a state of becoming. It is never static or regressive in its natural state. You are very capable of nurturing this natural expansion of energy to forge new channels of expression and experience. There are many specific actions that can be taken to nurture life. Each soul can transform energy through a wide variety of means. Working through your body, your soul is able to collect and store energy and redirect its purpose or application. This transformation of energy can occur on both personal and universal levels of expression. That is, within an individual's field of awareness at any time, energy can be transformed to conform more to a vision of personal welfare or aligned with a vision of universal welfare and goodwill.

Your soul is aware of these currents either consciously or unconsciously and allows them to carry you into realms of experience that engage your core belief system. By consciously cultivating beliefs that expand and transform energy, you are more able to explore energy systems that are nurturing to life in all its myriad forms. When beliefs are clearly defined as intentions, your life energy engages fully in the present moment. [Clarity of intention](https://www.WantToKnow.info/lifepurposeintentions) is essential to engaging the energy system of your core beliefs, and to allowing the nurturance of life to prevail in all activities. **Gratitude** If you are aware - or at least interested in having the awareness - of how perfectly the Divine supports your sovereign reality, there is a powerful and natural sense of gratitude that flows from you to the Divine. It is this wellspring of gratitude that opens the channel of support from the Divine to the individual and establishes a collaboration of purpose to transform the individual soul into a pure expression of divine essence. It is principally gratitude that opens you to connection and alignment with your divine essence. When you project gratitude, regardless of circumstance or condition, life becomes increasingly supportive. This feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. **Gratitude is an essential facet of love that opens you to redefine your purpose as a supportive extension of the Divine, rather than the whimsical outreach of fate or the exacting reaction of a mechanical, detached universe.** Establishing a relationship with the universe through the outflow of gratitude also attracts life experience that is deeply transformative - experience that is richly devoted to uncovering life's deepest meaning and most formative purpose. When you choose to align with divine essence and to live from this perspective as part of an ever-unfolding reality, you attract a natural state of harmony. This does not mean that your life is without problems or discomforts; rather it signifies a perception that there is an integral purpose in what life reveals. Life experience becomes meaningful to the extent that you choose to live in natural harmony with divine essence.

Life experience becomes meaningful to the extent that you choose to live in natural harmony with divine essence. When your personal reality flows in alignment with divine essence, you create lasting joy and inner peace. It is the perspective of divine essence that all life is pure love in its fullest expression, and that in this single concept, all life is conceived and forever exists. This becomes the core belief from which all other beliefs arise. And as these beliefs expand outward, this core belief system emerges with a clear intent of supporting a fundamental perspective of seeing, nurturing, and appreciating the universe as the divine cradle from which all life is created and evolves. **These life principles are merely symbols represented in words and served to you as a potential recipe to stir awake the embers of light that tirelessly burn within.** There are no specific techniques or rituals that are required to invoke their power. They are simply perspectives. In a real sense, they are intentions that attract experience that expands consciousness. They do not provide quick fixes or instant realizations. They are amplifiers of personal will and intention that clarify how one lives. Their profound transformative power is contained exclusively in the intent of their application. Through these principles of transformation, you can become a master of empowering your deeper self. When you apply these principles with clear intent, you have the tools to accelerate the emergence of divine essence. You can awaken the perspective, insights, and empowered abilities of your divine essence to create new realms of possibility and shape them as learning adventures that expand and transform your consciousness. This is the underlying purpose of these principles, and perhaps the best reason to explore them. **Read the full [seven-page text](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers) of this transformational writing Read a [two-page summary](https://www.WantToKnow.info/divinewisdomunderstanding) of the second of this two-part essay Explore a free, [inspiring online course](https://www.transformationteam.net) and community based on these principles** Principles of Personal Transformation - by [Wingmakers](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers#wingmakers)", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:transformation.txt:3:3f9b6ad26e46", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14781, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "transformingmoney.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "transformingmoney", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Lynne Twist - The Soul of Money Transforming Our Relationship with Money Dear friends, I received this beautiful summary from my step-mother a few days ago. The inspiring story at the end literally brought tears to my eyes. May we all come to see money simply as a tool for manifestation in our lives which flows just as it is meant to flow when our hearts and minds are clear. With much love and joy to you, Fred **Lynne Twist** presentation at Bioneers Conference, 2003 Notes by Jean Barker Lynne has written a book called, *The Soul of Money*. It took her a long time and much work to do this book. She said writing it was the hardest thing she has ever done. Her purpose was to transform our relationship with money. Lynne had been to many places where people struggle just to stay alive. She spent 20 years working for The Hunger Project in places like Ethiopia, India, Senegal, and Burkino Faso. People there are called \"poor.\" Yet she discovered that once she engaged with these people (identified as those from less developed countries), there was nothing \"poor\" about them! They are strong, courageous, innovative, ingenious, gutsy, intelligent! The label insults them. These people merely live in \"resource poor\" conditions. She now calls their countries \"less consuming countries.\" Lynn commented, \"these people have been my teachers.\" She went on to say that the \"resource rich\" have also been her teachers. *It is a sacred work to fund raise*. It is a great privilege to ask people for money! To demonstrate this, Lynne shared the simple, yet powerful story of Gertrude: Early in her life as a fund raiser, Lynne was asked to go to a large corporation in the Midwest to meet the CEO. She was working for The Hunger Project (started by Werner Erhart) whose goal and vision was to bring an end to hunger around the world. She was nervous about going to see this CEO. His company had made some bad decisions and had a poor reputation. She had been informed that the CEO was going to make a large contribution to the Hunger Project as a way of rectifying its poor record. Lynne arrives at the company and takes the elevators to the top floor. She feels scared. She meets the man in his large office behind glass doors. She sits at a long conference table with him on the other end. She gives her talk within the15 minute time limit given to her, and he presents her with an envelope. Inside is a check for $50,000. It is the largest single donation she has ever raised. She thanks him, yet deep down she feels unsettled. Lynne then goes on to NYC to meet with a black church group in their basement meeting room in Harlem.

The pastor has invited her to speak about The Hunger Project. The rain pours down and she is late. She enters and finds that rain leaking into the room is collecting in puddles and spattering into pans placed around the room. She is surprised to find about 75 people waiting for her. She begins her talk, and eventually gets to the place where she is to make the pitch for money. She pauses, wondering how can she ask these people to give, when their own need is so great! She remembers that the pastor has asked her to come and do this very thing, ask for money. She makes her request and then stops. There is silence. No one speaks. Then a woman dressed in a uniform stands and says, \"My name is Gertrude and I like you! I don't have no bank account or checking account, but I earned $75 dollars this week and I'm gonna give it to you!\" Deeply moved, Lynne places the check in the same brief case where she had earlier placed the huge check from the CEO. She then watches as one after another, people follow Gertrude's lead and put in their contributions. Later that evening sitting in her hotel room, Lynne decides to write a letter to the CEO. She thanks him for his contribution and for the time he took to listen to her. She then says she has to return the check because it did not come from his heart. Four years after that memorable day, Lynne received a letter from the CEO. He said that he had been deeply affected by her letter, that he had followed the work of the Hunger Project over the years, and that he had seen that it was a fine organization. He had left his prior company and gone on to other work. Now he wanted to send her another contribution, but this one was from his heart. There was a check for $250,000 in the envelope. Lynne said that she was not the one responsible for this huge change of heart. It was Gertrude and her giving from her heart that had changed both Lynne and this CEO. This man had never forgotten Lynne's letter, a letter which eventually changed his life, and which inspires us all, even now, to take a deep look at the soul of money.

She is currently a [senior lecturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcia_Angell) at Harvard Medical School. The below eye-opening essay by Dr. Angell covers essential points in her highly acclaimed book [*The Truth About the Drug Companies*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375760946/qid=1129335805/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/104-0991901-4113550?tag=wanttinfo-20&v=glance&s=books). Though this revealing book was published in 2005, the major corruption in the pharmaceutical industry it exposes has, if anything, [gotten worse](https://www.wanttoknow.info/pharmaceuticalcorruptionnewsarticles). And it is quite apparent that vaccines are the new gold mine, cleverly promoted as \"free\" when it is your tax money that pays for them. Below are key excerpts from this compelling book and links to the book reviews of three leading US newspapers: [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/06/books/indicting-the-drug-industrys-practices.html): \"A scorching indictment of drug companies and their research and business practices ... tough, persuasive and troubling.\" [*Boston Globe*](https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134248/http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2004/09/05/a_dangerous_dose/): \"A sober, clear-eyed attack on the excesses of drug company power ... a lucid, persuasive, and highly important book.\" [*Washington Post*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16432-2004Oct7.html): \"Always authoritative ...

Mixed in with the pitches for a particular drug-usually featuring beautiful people enjoying themselves in the great outdoors-is a more general message. Boiled down to its essentials, it is this: \"Yes, prescription drugs are expensive, but that shows how valuable they are. Besides, our research and development costs are enormous. We need to cover them. As 'research-based' companies, we turn out a steady stream of innovative medicines that lengthen life, enhance its quality, and avert more expensive medical care.

Prescription drug costs are indeed high-and rising fast. Americans now spend a staggering $200 billion a year on prescription drugs, and that figure is growing at a rate of about 12 percent a year. [[1]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn1) Drugs are the fastest-growing part of the health care bill-which itself is rising at an alarming rate. **The increase in drug spending reflects, in almost equal parts, the facts that people are taking a lot more drugs than they used to, that those drugs are more likely to be expensive new ones instead of older, cheaper ones, and that the prices of the most heavily prescribed drugs are routinely jacked up.** Before its patent ran out, for example, the price of Schering-Plough's top-selling allergy pill, Claritin, was raised thirteen times over five years, for a cumulative increase of more than 50 percent. [[2]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn2) As a spokeswoman for one company explained, \"Price increases are not uncommon in the industry. This allows us to be able to invest in R&D.\" [[3]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn3) **In 2002, the average price of the fifty drugs most used by senior citizens was nearly $1,500 per drug for a year's supply.** (Pricing varies greatly, but this refers to what the companies call the average wholesale price, which is usually pretty close to what an individual without insurance pays at the pharmacy.) Paying for prescription drugs is no longer a problem just for poor people. As the economy continues to struggle ... employers are requiring workers to pay more of the costs themselves. Since prescription drug costs are rising so fast, payers are particularly eager to get out from under them by shifting costs to individuals. The result is that more people have to pay a greater fraction of their drug bills out of pocket. And that packs a wallop. Many of them simply can't do it. They trade off drugs against home heating or food. Some people try to string out their drugs by taking them less often than prescribed, or sharing them with a spouse. Others, too embarrassed to admit that they can't afford to pay for drugs, leave their doctors' offices with prescriptions in hand but don't have them filled. Not only do these patients go without needed treatment but their doctors sometimes wrongly conclude that the drugs they prescribed haven't worked and prescribe yet others-thus compounding the problem. **The people hurting most are the elderly.** When Medicare was enacted in 1965, people took far fewer prescription drugs and they were cheap. For that reason, no one thought it necessary to include an outpatient prescription drug benefit in the program.

For that reason, no one thought it necessary to include an outpatient prescription drug benefit in the program. In those days, senior citizens could generally afford to buy whatever drugs they needed out of pocket. Approximately half to two thirds of the elderly have supplementary insurance that partly covers prescription drugs, but that percentage is dropping as employers and insurers decide it is a losing proposition for them. For obvious reasons, the elderly tend to need more prescription drugs than younger people-mainly for chronic conditions like arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol. In 2001, nearly one in four seniors reported that they skipped doses or did not fill prescriptions because of the cost. (That fraction is almost certainly higher now.) Sadly, the frailest are the least likely to have supplementary insurance. Furthermore, in one of the more perverse of the pharmaceutical industry's practices, prices are much higher for precisely the people who most need the drugs and can least afford them. The industry charges Medicare recipients without supplementary insurance much more than it does favored customers, such as large HMOs or the Veterans Affairs (VA) system. Because the latter buy in bulk, they can bargain for steep discounts or rebates. People without insurance have no bargaining power; and so they pay the highest prices. In the past two years, we have started to see, for the first time, the beginnings of public resistance to rapacious pricing and other dubious practices of the pharmaceutical industry. It is mainly because of this resistance that drug companies are now blanketing us with public relations messages. And** the magic words, repeated over and over like an incantation, are research, innovation, and American. Research. Innovation. American. It makes a great story.** But while the rhetoric is stirring, it has very little to do with reality. First, **research and development (R&D) is a relatively small part of the budgets of the big drug companies-dwarfed by their vast expenditures on marketing and administration, and smaller even than profits**. In fact, year after year, for over two decades, this industry has been far and away the most profitable in the United States. (In 2003, for the first time, the industry lost its first-place position, coming in third, behind \"mining, crude oil production,\" and \"commercial banks.\") The prices drug companies charge have little relationship to the costs of making the drugs and could be cut dramatically without coming anywhere close to threatening R&D. Second, the pharmaceutical industry is not especially innovative.

Second, the pharmaceutical industry is not especially innovative. As hard as it is to believe, only a handful of truly important drugs have been brought to market in recent years, and they were mostly based on taxpayer-funded research at academic institutions, small biotechnology companies, or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). **The great majority of \"new\" drugs are not new at all but merely variations of older drugs already on the market. These are called \"me-too\" drugs.** The idea is to grab a share of an established, lucrative market by producing something very similar to a top-selling drug. For instance, we now have six statins (Mevacor, Lipitor, Zocor, Pravachol, Lescol, and the newest, Crestor) on the market to lower cholesterol, all variants of the first. As Dr. Sharon Levine, associate executive director of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group, put it: **\"If I'm a manufacturer and I can change one molecule and get another twenty years of patent rights, and convince physicians to prescribe and consumers to demand the next form of Prilosec, or weekly Prozac instead of daily Prozac, just as my patent expires, then why would I be spending money on a lot less certain endeavor, which is looking for brand-new drugs?\"** [[4]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn4) Third, the industry is hardly a model of American free enterprise. To be sure, it is free to decide which drugs to develop (me-too drugs instead of innovative ones, for instance), and it is free to price them as high as the traffic will bear, but it is utterly dependent on government-granted monopolies-in the form of patents and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved exclusive marketing rights. If it is not particularly innovative in discovering new drugs, it is highly innovative-and aggressive-in dreaming up ways to extend its monopoly rights. And there is nothing peculiarly American about this industry. It is the very essence of a global enterprise. **Roughly half of the largest drug companies are based in Europe.** (The exact count shifts because of mergers.) In 2002, the top ten were the American companies Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Wyeth (formerly American Home Products); the British companies GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca; the Swiss companies Novartis and Roche; and the French company Aventis (which in 2004 merged with another French company, Sanafi Synthelabo, putting it in third place).

It is true, however, that some of the European companies are now locating their R&D operations in the United States. They claim the reason for this is that we don't regulate prices, as does much of the rest of the world. But more likely it is that they want to feed on the unparalleled research output of American universities and the NIH. In other words, it's not private enterprise that draws them here but the very opposite-our publicly sponsored research enterprise. **Over the past two decades the pharmaceutical industry has moved very far from its original high purpose of discovering and producing useful new drugs. Now primarily a marketing machine to sell drugs of dubious benefit, this industry uses its wealth and power to co-opt every institution that might stand in its way, including the US Congress, the FDA, academic medical centers, and the medical profession itself.** (Most of its marketing efforts are focused on influencing doctors, since they must write the prescriptions.) If prescription drugs were like ordinary consumer goods, all this might not matter very much. But drugs are different. People depend on them for their health and even their lives. In the words of Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), \"It's not like buying a car or tennis shoes or peanut butter.\" People need to know that there are some checks and balances on this industry, so that its quest for profits doesn't push every other consideration aside. But there aren't such checks and balances. **Part 2** What does the eight-hundred-pound gorilla do? Anything it wants to. What's true of the eight-hundred-pound gorilla is true of the colossus that is the pharmaceutical industry. It is used to doing pretty much what it wants to do. The watershed year was 1980. Before then, it was a good business, but afterward, it was a stupendous one. **From 1960 to 1980, prescription drug sales were fairly static as a percent of US gross domestic product, but from 1980 to 2000, they tripled. They now stand at more than $200 billion a year.** [[6]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn6) [As of 2020, that number had [increased another 75% to $348 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/184914/prescription-drug-expenditures-in-the-us-since-1960/)] Of the many events that contributed to the industry's great and good fortune, none had to do with the quality of the drugs the companies were selling.

The claim that drugs are a $200 billion industry is an understatement. According to government sources, that is roughly how much Americans spent on prescription drugs in 2002. That figure refers to direct consumer purchases at drugstores and mail-order pharmacies (whether paid for out of pocket or not), and it includes the nearly 25 percent markup for wholesalers, pharmacists, and other middlemen and retailers. But it does not include the large amounts spent for drugs administered in hospitals, nursing homes, or doctors' offices (as is the case for many cancer drugs). In most analyses, they are allocated to costs for those facilities. Drug company revenues (or sales) are a little different, at least as they are reported in summaries of corporate annual reports. They usually refer to a company's worldwide sales, including those to health facilities. But they do not include the revenues of middlemen and retailers. Perhaps the most quoted source of statistics on the pharmaceutical industry, IMS Health, estimated total worldwide sales for prescription drugs to be about $400 billion in 2002. About half were in the United States. So the $200 billion colossus is really a $400 billion megacolossus. The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 was perhaps the fundamental element in the rapid rise of big pharma-the collective name for the largest drug companies. With the Reagan administration came a strong pro-business shift not only in government policies but in society at large. And with the shift, the public attitude toward great wealth changed. Before then, there was something faintly disreputable about really big fortunes. You could choose to do well or you could choose to do good, but most people who had any choice in the matter thought it difficult to do both. That belief was particularly strong among scientists and other intellectuals.

The gap between the rich and poor, which had been narrowing since World War II, suddenly began to widen again, until today it is a chasm.** The pharmaceutical industry and its CEOs quickly joined the ranks of the winners as a result of a number of business-friendly government actions. I won't enumerate all of them, but two are especially important. Beginning in 1980, Congress enacted a series of laws designed to speed the translation of tax-supported basic research into useful new products-a process sometimes referred to as \"technology transfer.\" The goal was also to improve the position of American-owned high-tech businesses in world markets. The most important of these laws is known as the Bayh-Dole Act. Bayh-Dole enabled universities and small businesses to patent discoveries emanating from research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the major distributor of tax dollars for medical research, and then to grant exclusive licenses to drug companies. Until then, taxpayer-financed discoveries were in the public domain, available to any company that wanted to use them. But** now universities, where most NIH-sponsored work is carried out, can patent and license their discoveries, and charge royalties. Similar legislation permitted the NIH itself to enter into deals with drug companies that would directly transfer NIH discoveries to industry.** Bayh-Dole gave a tremendous boost to the nascent biotechnology industry, as well as to big pharma. Small biotech companies, many of them founded by university researchers to exploit their discoveries, proliferated rapidly. They now ring the major academic research institutions and often carry out the initial phases of drug development, hoping for lucrative deals with big drug companies that can market the new drugs. Usually both academic researchers and their institutions own equity in the biotechnology companies they are involved with. Thus, when a patent held by a university or a small biotech company is eventually licensed to a big drug company, all parties cash in on the public investment in research. These laws mean that drug companies no longer have to rely on their own research for new drugs, and few of the large ones do. Increasingly, they rely on academia, small biotech startup companies, and the NIH for that. [[7]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn7) At least a third of drugs marketed by the major drug companies are now licensed from universities or small biotech companies, and these tend to be the most innovative ones.

The Reagan years and Bayh-Dole also transformed the ethos of medical schools and teaching hospitals. These nonprofit institutions started to see themselves as \"partners\" of industry, and they became just as enthusiastic as any entrepreneur about the opportunities to parlay their discoveries into financial gain. Faculty researchers were encouraged to obtain patents on their work (which were assigned to their universities), and they shared in the royalties. **Many medical schools and teaching hospitals set up \"technology transfer\" offices to help in this activity and capitalize on faculty discoveries. As the entrepreneurial spirit grew during the 1990s, medical school faculty entered into other lucrative financial arrangements with drug companies, as did their parent institutions.** **One of the results has been a growing pro-industry bias in medical research-exactly where such bias doesn't belong**. Faculty members who had earlier contented themselves with what was once referred to as a \"threadbare but genteel\" lifestyle began to ask themselves, in the words of my grandmother, \"If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?\" Medical schools and teaching hospitals, for their part, put more resources into searching for commercial opportunities. Starting in 1984, with legislation known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress passed another series of laws that were just as big a bonanza for the pharmaceutical industry. These laws extended monopoly rights for brand-name drugs. **Exclusivity is the lifeblood of the industry because it means that no other company may sell the same drug for a set period. **After exclusive marketing rights expire, copies (called generic drugs) enter the market, and the price usually falls to as little as 20 percent of what it was. [[9]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn9) There are two forms of monopoly rights-patents granted by the US Patent and Trade Office (USPTO) and those exclusivity granted by the FDA.

They can add billions of dollars to sales-enough to buy a lot of lawyers and have plenty of change left over. No wonder big pharma will do almost anything to protect exclusive marketing rights, despite the fact that doing so flies in the face of all its rhetoric about the free market. As their profits skyrocketed during the 1980s and 1990s, so did the political power of drug companies. By 1990, the industry had assumed its present contours as a business with unprecedented control over its own fortunes. For example, if it didn't like something about the FDA, the federal agency that is supposed to regulate the industry, it could change it through direct pressure or through its friends in Congress. **The top ten drug companies (which included European companies) had profits of nearly 25 percent of sales in 1990**, and except for a dip at the time of President Bill Clinton's health care reform proposal, profits as a percentage of sales remained about the same for the next decade. (Of course, in absolute terms, as sales mounted, so did profits.) **In 2001, the ten American drug companies in the Fortune 500 list ranked far above all other American industries in average net return, whether as a percentage of sales (18.5 percent), of assets (16.3 percent), or of shareholders' equity (33.2 percent).** **These are astonishing margins. For comparison, the median net return for all other industries in the Fortune 500 was only 3.3 percent of sales.** Commercial banking, itself no slouch as an aggressive industry with many friends in high places, was a distant second, at 13.5 percent of sales. [[11]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn11) In 2002, as the economic downturn continued, big pharma showed only a slight drop in profits-from 18.5 to 17.0 percent of sales. **The most startling fact about 2002 is that the combined profits for the ten drug companies in the Fortune 500 ($35.9 billion) were more than the profits for all the other 490 businesses put together ($33.7 billion).** [[12]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn12) In 2003 profits of the Fortune 500 drug companies dropped to 14.3 percent of sales, still well above the median for all industries of 4.6", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:truthaboutdrugcompanies.txt:8:ba6ac881843b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14793, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "truthaboutdrugcompanies.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "truthaboutdrugcompanies", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "downturn continued, big pharma showed only a slight drop in profits-from 18.5 to 17.0 percent of sales. **The most startling fact about 2002 is that the combined profits for the ten drug companies in the Fortune 500 ($35.9 billion) were more than the profits for all the other 490 businesses put together ($33.7 billion).** [[12]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn12) In 2003 profits of the Fortune 500 drug companies dropped to 14.3 percent of sales, still well above the median for all industries of 4.6 percent for that year. When I say this is a profitable industry, I mean really profitable. It is difficult to conceive of how awash in money big pharma is. Drug industry expenditures for research and development, while large, were consistently far less than profits. For the top ten companies, they amounted to only 11 percent of sales in 1990, rising slightly to 14 percent in 2000. **The biggest single item in the budget is neither R&D nor even profits but something usually called \"marketing and administration.\"**** In 1990, a staggering 36 percent of sales revenues went into this category, and that proportion remained about the same for over a decade**. [[13]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn13) Note that this is two and a half times the expenditures for R&D. These figures are drawn from the industry's own annual reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and to stockholders, but what actually goes into these categories is not at all clear, because drug companies hold that information very close to their chests. It is likely, for instance, that R&D includes many activities most people would consider marketing, but no one can know for sure. For its part, \"marketing and administration\" is a gigantic black box that probably includes what the industry calls \"education,\" as well as advertising and promotion, legal costs, and executive salaries-which are whopping. According to a report by the non-profit group Families USA, **the former chairman and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb, Charles A. Heimbold Jr., made $74,890,918 in 2001, not counting his $76,095,611 worth of unexercised stock options. The chairman of Wyeth made $40,521,011, exclusive of his $40,629,459 in stock options.** And so on. [[14]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn14) **Part 3** If 1980 was a watershed year for the pharmaceutical industry, 2000 may very well turn out to have been another one-the year things began to go wrong. As the booming economy of the late 1990s turned sour, many successful businesses found themselves in trouble. And as tax revenues dropped, state governments also found themselves in trouble. In one respect, the pharmaceutical industry is well protected against the downturn, since it has so much wealth and power. But in another respect, it is peculiarly vulnerable, since it depends on employer-sponsored insurance and state-run Medicaid programs for much of its revenues.

When employers and states are in trouble, so is big pharma. And sure enough, in just the past couple of years, employers and the private health insurers with whom they contract have started to push back against drug costs. Most big managed care plans now bargain for steep price discounts. Most have also instituted three-tiered coverage for prescription drugs-full coverage for generic drugs, partial coverage for useful brand-name drugs, and no coverage for expensive drugs that offer no added benefit over cheaper ones. These lists of preferred drugs are called formularies, and they are an increasingly important method for containing drug costs. Big pharma is feeling the effects of these measures, although not surprisingly, it has become adept at manipulating the system-mainly by inducing doctors or health plans to put expensive, brand-name drugs on formularies. **State governments, too, are looking for ways to cut their drug costs.** Some state legislatures are drafting measures that would permit them to regulate prescription drug prices for state employees, Medicaid recipients, and the uninsured. Like managed care plans, they are creating formularies of preferred drugs. **The industry is fighting these efforts-mainly with its legions of lobbyists and lawyers. It fought the state of Maine all the way to the US Supreme Court, which in 2003 upheld Maine's right to bargain with drug companies for lower prices, while leaving open the details. But that war has just begun, and it promises to go on for years and get very ugly.** Recently the public has shown signs of being fed up. **The fact that Americans pay much more for prescription drugs than Europeans and Canadians is now widely known.** An estimated one to two million Americans buy their medicines from Canadian drugstores over the Internet, despite the fact that in 1987, in response to heavy industry lobbying, a compliant Congress had made it illegal for anyone other than manufacturers to import prescription drugs from other countries. [[15]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn15) In addition, there is a brisk traffic in bus trips for people in border states, particularly the elderly, to travel to Canada or Mexico to buy prescription drugs. Their resentment is palpable, and they constitute a powerful voter block-a fact not lost on Congress or state legislatures. The industry faces other, less familiar problems. It happens that, by chance, some of the top-selling drugs-with combined sales of around $35 billion a year-are scheduled to go off patent within a few years of one another. [[16]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn16) This drop over the cliff began in 2001, with the expiration of Eli Lilly's patent on its blockbuster antidepressant Prozac.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:truthaboutdrugcompanies.txt:10:a63f880025bc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14795, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "truthaboutdrugcompanies.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "truthaboutdrugcompanies", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "buy prescription drugs.

In the same year, AstraZeneca lost its patent on Prilosec, the original \"purple pill\" for heartburn, which at its peak brought in a stunning $6 billion a year. Bristol-Myers Squibb lost its best-selling diabetes drug, Glucophage. The unusual cluster of expirations will continue for another couple of years. While it represents a huge loss to the industry as a whole, for some companies it's a disaster. Schering-Plough's blockbuster allergy drug, Claritin, brought in fully a third of that company's revenues before its patent expired in 2002. [[17]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn17) Claritin is now sold over the counter for much less than its prescription price. So far, the company has been unable to make up for the loss by trying to switch Claritin users to Clarinex-a drug that is virtually identical but has the advantage of still being on patent. Even worse is the fact that **there are very few drugs in the pipeline ready to take the place of blockbusters going off patent. In fact, that is the biggest problem facing the industry today, and its darkest secret. All the public relations about innovation is meant to obscure precisely this fact.** The stream of new drugs has slowed to a trickle, and few of them are innovative in any sense of that word. Instead, the great majority are variations of oldies but goodies-\"me-too\" drugs. **Of the 78 drugs approved by the FDA in 2002, only 17 contained new active ingredients, and only seven of these were classified by the FDA as improvements over older drugs.** The other 71 drugs approved that year were variations of old drugs or deemed no better than drugs already on the market. In other words, they were me-too drugs. Seven of 78 is not much of a yield. Furthermore, of those seven, not one came from a major US drug company. [[18]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn18) For the first time, in just a few short years, the gigantic pharmaceutical industry is finding itself in serious difficulty. It is facing, as one industry spokesman put it, \"a perfect storm.\" To be sure, profits are still beyond anything most other industries could hope for, but they have recently fallen, and for some companies they fell a lot.

And that is what matters to investors. For some companies, stock prices have plummeted. Nevertheless, the industry keeps promising a bright new day. It bases its reassurances on the notion that the mapping of the human genome and the accompanying burst in genetic research will yield a cornucopia of important new drugs. Left unsaid is the fact that big pharma is depending on government, universities, and small biotech companies for that innovation. **While there is no doubt that genetic discoveries will lead to treatments, the fact remains that it will probably be years before the basic research pays off with new drugs. In the meantime, the once-solid foundations of the big pharma colossus are shaking.** The hints of trouble and the public's growing resentment over high prices are producing the first cracks in the industry's formerly firm support in Washington. In 2000, Congress passed legislation that would have closed some of the loopholes in Hatch-Waxman and also permitted American pharmacies, as well as individuals, to import drugs from certain countries where prices are lower. In particular, they could buy back FDA-approved drugs from Canada that had been exported there. It sounds silly to \"reimport\" drugs that are marketed in the United States, but even with the added transaction costs, doing so is cheaper than buying them here. But the bill required the secretary of health and human services to certify that the practice would not pose any \"added risk\" to the public, and secretaries in both the Clinton and Bush administrations, under pressure from the industry, refused to do that. The industry is also being hit with a tidal wave of government investigations and civil and criminal lawsuits. The litany of charges includes illegally overcharging Medicaid and Medicare, paying kickbacks to doctors, engaging in anticompetitive practices, colluding with generic companies to keep generic drugs off the market, illegally promoting drugs for unapproved uses, engaging in misleading direct-to-consumer advertising, and, of course, covering up evidence. Some of the settlements have been huge. **TAP Pharmaceuticals, for instance, paid $875 million to settle civil and criminal charges of Medicaid and Medicare fraud in the marketing of its prostate cancer drug, Lupron.** [[19]](https://www.WantToKnow.info/truthaboutdrugcompanies#fn19) All of these efforts could be summed up as increasingly desperate marketing and patent games, activities that always skirted the edge of legality but now are sometimes well on the other side.

One could hope drug companies would decide to make some changes-trim their prices, or at least make them more equitable, and put more of their money into trying to discover genuinely innovative drugs, instead of just talking about it. But that is not what is happening. Instead, drug companies are doing more of what got them into this situation. They are marketing their me-too drugs even more relentlessly. They are pushing even harder to extend their monopolies on top-selling drugs. And they are pouring more money into lobbying and political campaigns. As for innovation, they are still waiting for Godot. The news is not all bad for the industry. **The Medicare prescription drug benefit enacted in 2003, and scheduled to go into effect in 2006, promises a windfall for big pharma since it forbids the government from negotiating prices.** The immediate jump in pharmaceutical stock prices after the bill passed indicated that the industry and investors were well aware of the windfall. This is an industry that in some ways is like the Wizard of Oz-still full of bluster but now being exposed as something far different from its image. Instead of being an engine of innovation, it is a vast marketing machine. Instead of being a free market success story, it lives off government-funded research and monopoly rights. Yet this industry occupies an essential role in the American health care system, and it performs a valuable function, if not in discovering important new drugs at least in developing them and bringing them to market. But big pharma is extravagantly rewarded for its relatively modest functions. We get nowhere near our money's worth. The United States can no longer afford it in its present form. **Clearly, the pharmaceutical industry is due for fundamental reform. Reform will have to extend beyond the industry to the agencies and institutions it has co-opted, including the FDA and the medical profession and its teaching centers.** In my book, *The Truth About the Drug Companies*, I discuss the major reforms that will be necessary. For example, we need to get the industry to focus on discovering truly innovative drugs instead of turning out me-too drugs (and spending billions of dollars to promote them as though they were miracles). The me-too business is made possible by the fact that the FDA usually approves a drug only if it is better than a placebo. It needn't be better than an older drug already on the market to treat the same condition; in fact, it may be worse.

There is no way of knowing, since companies generally do not test their new drugs against older ones for the same conditions at equivalent doses. (For obvious reasons, they would rather not find the answer.) They should be required to do so. **The me-too market would collapse virtually overnight if the FDA made approval of new drugs contingent on their being better in some important way than older drugs already on the market.** Probably very few new drugs could meet that test. By default, then, drug companies would have to concentrate on finding truly innovative drugs, and we would finally find out whether this much-vaunted industry is turning out better drugs. A welcome by-product of this reform is that it would also reduce the incessant and enormously expensive marketing necessary to jockey for position in the me-too market. **Genuinely important new drugs do not need much promotion** (imagine having to advertise a cure for cancer). **A second important reform would be to require drug companies to open their books. Drug companies reveal very little about the most crucial aspects of their business.** We know next to nothing about how much they spend to bring each drug to market or what they spend it on. (We know that it is not $802 million, as some industry apologists have recently claimed.) Nor do we know what their gigantic \"marketing and administration\" budgets cover. We don't even know the prices they charge their various customers. **Perhaps most important, we do not know the results of the clinical trials they sponsor-only those they choose to make public, which tend to be the most favorable findings.** (The FDA is not allowed to reveal the results it has.) The industry claims all of this is \"proprietary\" information. Yet, unlike other businesses, drug companies are dependent on the public for a host of special favors-including the rights to NIH-funded research, long periods of market monopoly, and multiple tax breaks that almost guarantee a profit. Because of these special favors and the importance of its products to public health, as well as the fact that the government is a major purchaser of its products, the pharmaceutical industry should be regarded much as a public utility.

I am deeply thankful that a close friend forwarded the below email from a college friend of hers to me. Her friend, Paul Landgraver, had been living on a beach in Thailand for several years where he taught scuba diving, when he suddenly found himself faced with a huge struggle for his life after being completely swallowed by the merciless tsunami. He was one of the lucky ones who managed to survive the onslaught of this massive wall of water. Paul's descriptive email brought me into the heart of the beast, giving a powerful glimpse of what it was like to be caught up in this great tragedy so far removed from my reality. I share Paul's story with you so that we all might better appreciate what millions went through on that tragic day.

May this great tragedy help us all to open our hearts and work together for the good of all as we move through each day of our lives. With very best wishes, Fred Burks for [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) P.S. I am sending this email from Indonesia, where there are nearly one tsunami million refugees without homes.

Mid-morning, post-breakfast stupor controlling Karin and me. The power flickers and we moan. I suppose we'll have to get up and do something. Then we hear some yelling outside. I look out the front door, still puffed up with pride about our new house just 400 feet back from the beach. People are running up our street yelling. It looks like a fire at the large two-story resort that effectively blocks our view of the beach. Smoke and dust coming up, and all these people. Then a small line of really brown water comes rolling rapidly towards us. That's weird. But I reckon it must be some strange full moon high tide. We go upstairs so we don't get wet. I look out the window and try and take some pictures. There is a quiet rumble to it. The water is getting higher and higher. Then the now surging water destroys our friends cement bungalow! Then our own front door caves in! Then water is coming up the stairs! HOLY SHIT. This was the last point my brain worked for a long time. We try and throw a mattress out the window to float on, but the water is rising too fast.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:tsunamistory.txt:0:dc2baf6e585a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14807, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "tsunamistory.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "tsunamistory", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "out the window and try and take some pictures.

Then water is coming up the stairs! HOLY SHIT. This was the last point my brain worked for a long time. We try and throw a mattress out the window to float on, but the water is rising too fast. Out the window we climb. It's all going so fast. It's faster than conscious thought. By the time we are on our second story roof, the water is coming out the window. We jump. Karin doesn't jump at the same time - or did I jump too early? We're separated. I scream her name, but the crashing roiling water mutes me. I can't hear her. I scream and scream until I get hit by something and pulled under. I can't swim to the top, I pull myself through trash and wood to the surface, and off I go, pulled by the relentless mass of water. Ahead are trees wrapped in flotsam. A Thai guy is struggling to get free of the flotsam. As I pass by at 30 MPH, I realize he is impaled on a piece of wood and can't even scream. My brain shut down when Karin disappeared, and now all I can do is survive. Something triggers and I swim. I swim to avoid the trees which will trap me, possibly kill me. It seems that I am atop the crest of the tsunami, which is less like a wave than a flood. From on high I can see the water slam into buildings, then rise, then watch the buildings collapse into piles of concrete and rebar. I swim to avoid these. Left and right I paddle, looking ahead the whole time trying to figure the hazards. None of this is conscious. It isn't me thinking it out, it's some recessed part of the brain coming out and taking control. I was busy seeing the weird things like massive diesel trucks being rolled end over end. Or the car launched through the 2nd story wall of a former luggage shop. Or the person high up in a still-standing tree wearing a lurid orange thong. Or the older foreigner that I saw stuck in a jumble of wood and steel wrapped around a tree, only to then watch his body be torn off while his head remained. I couldn't scream. I was pulled under, my pants caught on something. I decided that this was neither the place nor time for me to die, and ripped my pants off. I surfaced into a hunk of wood which cut my forehead. A 5 gallon water bottle sped by, and I wrapped myself around it like a horny German Shepard on", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:tsunamistory.txt:1:2341b0fdc7cc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14808, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "tsunamistory.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "tsunamistory", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "and steel wrapped around a tree, only to then watch his body be torn off while his head remained.

I surfaced into a hunk of wood which cut my forehead. A 5 gallon water bottle sped by, and I wrapped myself around it like a horny German Shepard on a Chihuahua. I was passing people with bleeding faces and caked in refuse. Some people reached out to me, and I back, but the water was too fast and erratic. Some people screamed for help, and I told them to swim. Some people just stared with empty eyes, watching what happened, but seeing nothing. Some were just floating corpses. At some point, I passed a guy, cut on his cheek, holding onto big piece of foam. We just made eye contact and shrugged apathetically at each other. Then I turned ahead to watch fate. When I looked back he was gone. Trees were pulled down and their flotsam added to the flow. I was hit by a refrigerator and pushed dangerously towards a building that was collapsing. I swam and swam and swam and swam and still was pushed right towards a huge clump of jagged sticks and metal. I was pulled under, kicked towards the mass, cut my feet and kicked again. I popped up on the other side, spun around and was pulled under again. Down there, I knew it was not my time. I pulled my way up through the floating rubbish of my former town. I pulled and pulled and my lungs ached for air. I flashed on Star Wars, the trash compactor scene, and had some big grin in the back of head as I popped up. Sucking shitty water and air deep in my lungs. This went on seemingly for weeks. Time simply left the area alone. I grabbed the edge of a mattress and floated. Breathing, just breathing. My awareness brought back by the sound and look of waterfalls all around me. Trying to push up onto the mattress more and more, as it took my weight less and less. Tumbling over the edge, sucked under again, and out I shot, swirled into a coconut grove, where the water seemed to have stopped. There was even a dyke like wall around the coconut grove. The water spun and churned, but went nowhere, and finally, it got no higher. I wasn't swimming, or climbing, but something in between. I made my way to the land. Every step had to be careful with broken glass everywhere and sheet metal poking out. It was a long slow struggle.

The low rumble stopped, only to be replaced by the occasional creak of wood on wood and metal scraping. Moans came across the new brown lake. A small boy was in a tree crying, asking for his parents in Norwegian. I climbed up onto the dyke and looked around. I screamed out for Karin, only getting responses in Thai. I stood there, panting, trying to find a thought, anything. As I came back to earth I needed to pee. The first thing I did after surviving the tsunami was piss! Along limps an older Thai guy who finds me naked atop a dyke amid the destruction, covered in mud and filth - pissing. He didn't even smile...nor did I. I spent the next minutes running from high point to high point screaming out for Karin. If I made it, she could too. There was no response from her. I found plenty of other people, and helped who I could, but always looking across this vast area of new lakes for her head. Through the trees was a PT boat, a large, empty, steel police cruiser. The boat and I had been brought more than a kilometer (2/3 mile) inland. I was standing near a tree, hoping for a clue, anything to say Karin was out there somewhere. A small boy in a tree whimpered, and I pulled him down. We went inland. There were houses still standing, a whole neighborhood atop a rise that was untouched. Just feet away were cars wrapped around trees. I handed the boy over to people there. I had just finished my medic training exactly one month before, so I went to work. Pulling people out of mud, from under houses. One car, upright against the trunk of a tree still had the driver. He was dead. It went on. Before this I had only seen a dead body once or twice. That was remedied very quickly. I pulled people out of the water, only to have them choke and die right there in my hands. I would take someone's pulse, scream for help, then find that they had died before we could do anything. It was beyond any nightmare or fear I have ever had. An older Thai woman came up to me with a pair of shorts and averted eyes. She was ashamed that I was totally naked. I smirked and slipped them on. She smiled and scurried away.

Roaming the former streets looking for foreigners to send to higher ground, to find a place where we could all meet and tend to wounds. After an hour the Thais came screaming out of the mud saying there was another wave coming. They flew into the hills. We were left alone. Those that could walk did. The rest were carried. We made a new base, higher and safer. And then moved higher again and again. Eventually we ended up in the woods at a park, where there was water and high ground. It was messy. Eventually there were about 300 foreigners, about 120 of whom were injured pretty severely with broken limbs and ribs, near-drownings. Everyone had gashes of some kind, severed fingers or toes and shock everywhere. There was no medicine, no tools, no scissors, no bandages. Nothing but well water (of questionable cleanliness) and some sticks and clothes. I tried to find anyone medically trained. It was only we diving instructors who all had basic first aid. So we cleaned with the water, we broke sticks and set bones, and talked people into a relatively calm place. If someone was severely cut, we used their own clothing to mend the wounds. It was a horror story. The floor was covered in blood. People were moaning or vomiting or asking us to help them. And more arrived with every new wave of cars and trucks fleeing the \"next wave\". After hours of this, we got news of helicopters evacuating the injured. Everyone rushed towards the trucks. I had to scream and push and pull people out of the way. The ones who needed evacuation the most were the ones who couldn't get to the trucks. After twenty minutes of sorting through the priorities, and feeling like we had a handle on it, someone dragged me to a girl who was bleeding severely out of her thigh and was in shock. No one had brought her to our little clinic area. They had forgotten her in the back of truck. Finally, after a few helicopters had pulled out the worst, I headed back down. Through rubber tree plantations and coconut groves we drove. It seemed quiet and relaxed until we hit the last corner where it was devastation. The road was clear and dry up to a certain point, and then it was a horizon of endless rubble. I shuddered. Someone on a scooter came up and asked for a doctor.

Someone on a scooter came up and asked for a doctor. Everyone looked at me! I jumped on and they took me up roads I never knew existed, over bridges that were barely standing until I was brought to five foreigners in the middle of nowhere. One of them was a good friend and diving instructor. It was the first person I had seen that I knew. It was a total joy. He was banged up pretty bad, but he got out and sent off to the hospital. Then the Thais came roaring up the hill, saying there was another wave coming. We had to carry four more people with broken bones (including a broken hip) up a hill. There was no wave. It never came. I stumbled back down, wandering through the town looking for people to help. I found only corpses. I found one with a tattoo like Karin's on a scooter under some rubble. I pulled her out. It was a Thai woman. Still griping her scooter, mouth agape. Eventually I made my way back to the dive shop I worked at. We had always whined about how it was too far off the main road, but it survived. It was a center for the survivors. I walked up to find friends alive and things clean and organized. I was able to keep on, doing what I could to help people, to close out my mind to what was around me and to look only at what I was doing, to not see the dead people, to not worry about where Karin was. I had held together so well. When I finally found Karin alive, it all fell apart. I suddenly could smell the destruction, the horror I had just walked through, just lived through, that she had lived through. My body shouted out in pain from all the bruises and cuts I had ignored. It all struck me and threw me to the ground. It was too much - I could no longer accept this. We hugged and ate and slept. My feet were cut up. I had small cuts all over my body and a sinus infection from all the bad water. Karin had gotten hold of a coconut tree, wrapped herself around it and never let go.

First time I've ever been happy to see a woman with a black eye. Most of the rest of our friends had come through. They had set up first aid stations and help stations, organized food and created a center for people to meet. The diving community came together and became our support, our medical care, our food - they did everything they could to help and then some. I can't help but give massive appreciation and even a bit of awe to several people. Whether you know them or not, these are the true heroes. Keith - he was tireless - for days, running around, getting medicine, doing first aid, cooking food, getting clothes, talking to the forlorn, coordinating and doing everything he could. His energy was endless and bright. Jim and Andrea opened the doors of their shop. They clothed and housed everyone they could. Joakim ran about grabbing people, helping wherever he could, evacuating people to the next town, the whole while wondering about the safety of his own family. And the two DMT's that helped me out - two guys who had just taken a first aid class only to find themselves dealing with unbelievably massive trauma, death and chaos. And so many other heroes - this was not the work of just one or two people. The diving community at large shined like a beacon over the madness. When there was no one else, they all stepped forward. I can't help but swell with pride to count myself among them. The next day I went back to where my house had been to survey the damage. One bungalow nearby had been lifted up and dropped on top of another. The whole beach was visible, meaning that all of the two or three story hotels that had lined it were gone. The bottom floor of our house was gone. The upper floor was missing a couple of walls. The only thing left was a plastic Jesus doll I had bought as a joke. So I was left without a possession in the world except my plastic Jesus. The level of destruction is virtually impossible to describe. On our beach we had about 2,500 hotel rooms. The week the tsunami hit, between Christmas and New Year's, is the busiest of the year. It looked to me that maybe 50 could still be called hotel rooms.

With no warning and no evacuation plan, the survival rates were minimal. The wave at our house was about 7 meters high (22 feet) and in some places it was 10 meters (over 30 feet) high. It wiped out the third floor of most resorts. The number of dead is astronomical--several thousand on my beach alone. By the second day you could smell the rotting bodies. In the short walk to my former house, we passed about 10 bodies just strewn about. Our final glance of the town was a cattle truck stacked full of wrapped up corpses. We wanted to go home. In Bangkok most people got help pretty quick. The Swedes, Germans and English had arranged charted flights for their citizens to get home. The Thai government gave free hotel rooms to survivors, and there were lists of places to get food. All governments helped as they could EXCEPT the Americans. I went in to find out what help I could get. All I was able to get a was a replacement passport, a toothbrush and a paperback book. They said it was not their policy to arrange flights home. I was cut up, still covered in a pretty good layer of mud. I had no home, no money, no clothing (except some borrowed off Keith), nothing at all, yet they could do nothing to help. They did offer to let me borrow money. But they required three people in America who would vouch for me - a process that could take up to a week. In the mean time I was screwed. I was destitute and rejected by the embassy. Karin was with me (she's Swedish). She said that I could still try and emigrate to Sweden. I was VERY tempted. In these last days, I've heard US politicians go about offering huge amounts of aide, but they won't even take care of their own citizens. I am very, very angry. All the other nations of the world were taking care of their own citizens! Eventually I got a flight home with JAL - that would be JAPAN airlines - not even an American company, but a JAPANESE company helped me get home.

I flew out of the country using a replacement passport they gave me, yet officially I am still not found. Back in the US for three days now, I have been to the hospital three times. As of yesterday, I am now listed as injured at the hospital. My family is now waiting to see how long it will take before they are notified about my status. So am I. It does raise a good question - if I am still officially missing or dead, do I have to pay taxes? While spiteful about the embassy, I am grateful to be alive. I am grateful that those I care about are still alive. I still look around and am in awe at what just happened. I really feel like someone slipped me some roofies and somehow I just woke up in America. No real moral to this story...yet. While not exactly destitute, I am rich in friends. Almost all my money, all my dive gear (my income), as well as my laptop (years of pictures and writing) and most everything else is probably floating somewhere near Burma. If you want to help out, I would recommend going to [www.diveaid.co.uk](http://www.diveaid.co.uk/) These are divers helping divers. Most of our community, while surviving, lost everything. This is a great site that includes some news of the area and those affected. Donations can also be sent to good charities - ones that truly help.

My story is just one among many. There are hundreds of thousands far worse off than me. I had somewhere to fly to. I can't speak, or even dream of what it must be like in Sri Lanka and Indonesia.

Matt Taibbi, one of the main journalists behind this effort, created a compilation of one-paragraph summaries of all the Twitter Files threads by every reporter involved. Links and notes on key information are included. You can access all of the summaries below. From widespread scientific censorship related to COVID-19 issues to concerns of US election meddling and the banning of political voices, significant concerns and questions are being raised about Twitter's handling of current political affairs. **However, the culture wars and polarization playing out on mainstream (and even independent media) platforms hinder the possibility of nuanced debate about these documents. **Why is the media giving so little attention to this and why is the media always against these blatant revelations? What is the role that social media play in moderating vital information related to national security, elections, COVID-19, and other complex issues? Who controls the narrative and why? What influence should our government agencies have over Big Tech? How do we discern trustworthy information from propaganda and misinformation? May we hold these challenging questions across our political differences, as we reform society and our media systems for democracy, free speech, and the greater good.

[Twitter Files Part 2](https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1601007575633305600?lang=en), by [@BariWeiss](https://twitter.com/bariweiss), December 8, 2022 **TWITTER'S SECRET BLACKLISTS** Bari Weiss gives a long-awaited answer to the question, \"Was Twitter shadow-banning people?\" It did, only the company calls it \"visibility filtering.\" Twitter also had a separate, higher council called SIP-PES that decided cases for high-visibility, controversial accounts. **Key revelations**: Twitter had a huge toolbox for controlling the visibility of any user, including a \"Search Blacklist\" (for Dan Bongino), a \"Trends Blacklist\" for Stanford's Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, and a \"Do Not Amplify\" setting for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Weiss quotes a Twitter employee: \"Think about visibility filtering as being a way for us to suppress what people see to different levels. It's a very powerful tool.\" With help from [@abigailshrier](https://twitter.com/AbigailShrier), [@shellenbergermd](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD), [@nelliebowles](https://twitter.com/NellieBowles), and [@isaacgrafstein](https://twitter.com/IsaacGrafstein).

The idea behind the series is to show how all of Twitter's \"visibility filtering\" tools were on display and deployed after January 6th, 2021. **Key Revelations**: Trust and Safety chief Yoel Roth not only met regularly with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, but with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). Also, Twitter was aggressively applying \"visibility filtering\" tools to Trump well before the election.

Also, chief censor Roth argues for a ban on congressman Matt Gaetz even though it \"doesn't quite fit anywhere (duh),\" and Twitter changed its \"public interest policy\" to clear a path for Trump's removal.

Tweeters on both the left and the right were affected. **Key revelations**: A senior Twitter executive reports, \"FBI was adamant no impediments to sharing\" classified information exist. Twitter also agreed to \"bounce\" content on the recommendations of a wide array of governmental and quasi-governmental actors, from the FBI to the Homeland Security agency CISA to Stanford's Election Integrity Project to state governments.

Noting the company explicitly testified to Congress that it didn't allow such behavior, the platform nonetheless was a clear partner in state-backed programs involving fake accounts. **Key revelations**: after the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) sent over a list of 52 Arab-language accounts \"we use to amplify certain messages,\" Twitter agreed to \"whitelist\" them. Ultimately the program would be outed [in the](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/08/24/facebook-twitter-us-influence-campaign-ukraine/)*[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/08/24/facebook-twitter-us-influence-campaign-ukraine/)* in 2022 - two years after Twitter and other platforms stopped assisting - but contrary to what came out in those reports, Twitter knew about and/or assisted in these programs for at least three years, from 2017-2020.

White House officials for instance wanted attention on reporter Alex Berenson. Zweig also found \"countless\" instances of Twitter banning or labeling \"misleading\" accounts that were true or merely controversial. A Rhode Island physician named Andrew Bostom, for instance, was suspended for, among other things, referring to the results of a peer-reviewed study on mRNA vaccines. *See Part 11 below.* Twitter Files [Parts 11](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1610372352872783872) [and 12](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1610394197730725889), by @mtaibbi, January 3, 2023 **HOW TWITTER LET THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IN** and **TWITTER AND THE FBI \"BELLY BUTTON\"** These two threads focus respectively on the second half of 2017, and a period stretching roughly from summer of 2020 through the present. The first describes how Twitter fell under pressure from Congress and the media to produce \"material\" showing a conspiracy of Russian accounts on their platform, and the second shows how Twitter tried to resist fulfilling moderation requests for the State Department, but ultimately agreed to let State and other agencies send requests through the FBI, which agent Chan calls \"the belly button of the USG.\" **Revelations**: at the close of 2017, Twitter makes a key internal decision. Outwardly, the company would claim independence and promise that content would only be removed at \"our sole discretion.\" The internal guidance says, in writing, that Twitter will remove accounts \"identified by the U.S. intelligence community\" as \"identified by the U.S.. intelligence community as a state-sponsored entity conducting cyber-operations.\" The second thread shows how Twitter took in requests from everyone - Treasury, HHS, NSA, FBI, DHS, etc. - and also received personal requests from politicians like Democratic congressman Adam Schiff, who [asked to have journalist Paul Sperry suspended](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1610394284867436547).

As Arnold's story spread, thousands of others stepped forward to share their experiences with mysterious objects in the skies. Not all of these were saucer shaped, and in 1952 the term Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) was created by the Air Force to encompass the various types of objects that witnesses had encountered. The official shift from \"UFO\" to \"UAP\" [emerged in 2020](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-uaps-unexplained-aerial-phenomenon-ufos-new-name/), when the Pentagon established the US Navy \"UAP Task Force\" to investigate reports. UAP initially stood for Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon, but the Pentagon updated it to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon in 2022, so as to include more types of unusual objects. Strangely, the media is no longer debunking UFOs. Yet still to this day, government narratives claim that their official investigations [have not produced anything conclusive](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ufo-reports-ordinary-explanations-government-investigation-continues/story?id=104099370). However, **the long history of secret government programs and cover-ups make it clear that factions within our government possess significant and possibly revolutionary UFO knowledge.** Many intense and real UFO encounters have been reported by military officers, government officials, and public figures, yet those stories rarely get discussed in the mainstream press. Notably, their testimonies emphasize that there hasn't been any proof suggesting that ET intelligences have ever attacked us even when provoked. [**Apollo 14 Astronaut Edgar Mitchell**](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-edgar-mitchell-apollo-14-astronaut-who-walked-moon-dies-85) was the sixth man to walk on the moon. He not only believed in the existence of UFOs and extraterrestrial activities, but that knowledge of the phenomena has been [covered-up extensively by all governments](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-out-space-or-out-mind). Mitchell was also [particularly passionate](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-apollo-14-astronaut-claims-peaceloving-aliens-prevented-nuclear-war-earth) about the compelling idea that UFOs (and possibly ET forces) have demonstrated interest in human military capabilities.

Smith Disclosure Timeline 1947-1969: Project Blue Book Project Blue Book was headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio from 1952 to 1969. Following Project Sign in 1947 and Project Grudge in 1949, Blue Book created reports on 12,618 sightings of unidentified flying objects across the US. Prominent astronomer J. Allen Hynek led the Air Force investigations. Although the purpose of Blue Book was to debunk UFO sightings, there were hundreds of incidents that Hynek was never able to fully explain. According to an [Air Force fact sheet](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104590/unidentified-flying-objects-and-air-force-project-blue-book/) on Blue Book, **701 of the 12,618 sightings studied remained mysterious.** According to the [*New York Times*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-project-blue-book-based-a-true-ufo-story), he \"eventually concluded that they were a real phenomenon in dire need of scientific attention.\" 1969: Condon Report Results Released In 1966-68, a team at the University of Colorado combined Blue Book data with data from the civilian UFO groups National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) to study the UFO issue. The Air Force sponsored the effort financially while sabotaging the investigation from its outset. The report ultimately found that scientific discoveries were unlikely to come from the study of UFOs. These findings were published in [The Scientific Study Of Unidentified Flying Objects](https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-4vyHjooOJagoGAwN/Scientific+Study+Of+Unidentified+Flying+Objects_djvu.txt). **This study was known as the Condon Report.

The group that met, named the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS), included scientists, engineers, a CIA spy, a former Army colonel, and two Apollo astronauts. Harry Reid, a sitting US senator from Nevada, also participated. Years later, [according to Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/05/28/ufos-secret-history-government-washington-dc-487900), \"Reid ultimately enlisted the support of a handful of powerful committee chairs, including Ted Stevens of Alaska and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, to fund hush-hush UFO research inside the Defense Department.

Although the AATIP apparently ceased operations with Elizondo's 2017 departure, it did produce some intriguing results. According to the [*New York Times*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-glowing-auras-black-money-pentagons-mysterious-ufo-program), \"The program produced documents that describe sightings of aircraft that seemed to move at very high velocities with no visible signs of propulsion, or that hovered with no apparent means of lift.

For decades, US officials denied that Area 51 existed. Then, in 2013, the [CIA admitted](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB434/) that the base was real in response to a 2005 Freedom of Information Act request. The admission mentioned experimental spy planes but made no mention of more exotic technologies. Although Area 51's secrets remained hidden, the official acknowledgment of the facility's existence represented a significant disclosure event. **[Explore our archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/articlesearch?aq=area%2051&cats=8&date=&sort=relevance) of top news article summaries from credible sources on Area 51.** 2017: Luis Elizondo Resigns from AATIP and Becomes a Whistleblower Luis Elizondo resigns in October from AATIP due to excessive secrecy. As he put it in his resignation letter to secretary of defense Jim Mattis: \"Bureaucratic challenges and inflexible mindsets continue to plague the department at all levels... The department must take serious the many accounts by the Navy and other services of unusual aerial systems interfering with military weapon platforms and displaying beyond next-generation capabilities... There remains a vital need to ascertain the capability and intent of these phenomena for the benefit of the armed forces and the nation.\" Elizondo also filed a complaint with the inspector general [accusing his former agency](https://thehill.com/changing-america/resilience/smart-cities/555955-ufo-whistleblower-says-pentagon-tried-to-silence-him/) of malicious activities, coordinated disinformation, professional misconduct, whistleblower reprisal and explicit threats. 2017: To the Stars Academy Blink-182 rock star [Tom DeLonge](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-inside-knowledge-about-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-could-lead-worldchanging-technology) launched To The Stars Academy, a company with former CIA officer Jim Semivan and director of the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) [Hal Puthoff](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-six-whistleblowers-who-claim-they-worked-military-ufo-programs-retrieving-analyzing-crash-material-have-come-forward-spill-their-secrets-senior-members-congress).

This also included other DoD personnel and contractors who have encountered UAP/UFOs. 2022: All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2022 included a provision creating a new office called the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). According to the [Department of Defense announcement](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3100053/dod-announces-the-establishment-of-the-all-domain-anomaly-resolution-office/), AARO's mission is to \"synchronize efforts across the Department of Defense, and with other U.S. federal departments and agencies, to detect, identify and attribute objects of interest in, on or near military installations, operating areas, training areas, special use airspace and other areas of interest, and, as necessary, to mitigate any associated threats to safety of operations and national security. This includes anomalous, unidentified space, airborne, submerged and transmedium objects.\" Prior to the establishment of AARO, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) within the Office of Naval Intelligence handled UAP reports. While the Pentagon won't disclose AARO's budget, it is [suggested that](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2023/07/05/senators-want-to-boost-pentagon-ufo-office-funding-transparency/) the office will cost about $11 million this year. **Notably, the National Defense Authorization Act created new whistleblower protections and exemptions to non-disclosure orders and agreements to make it easier for government workers to come forward about their experiences with UFOs and related technologies.** 2023: Whistleblower David Grusch Steps Forward Before becoming a whistleblower, David Grusch worked for the Air Force, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).

Below, we provide compelling evidence that UFOs monitored our use of nuclear weapons, which many believe secretly influenced the halt on nuclear weapons testing in the early 90s. **Perhaps one of the most remarkable events in the history of UFO encounters took place in March of 1967 at the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, which was a base that was responsible for a large amount of nuclear weapons.** Air Force Captain Robert Salas, a missile launch officer and Titan 3 missiles engineer, initially received a call from his flight security controller about strange lights that were flying rapidly around the facility, yet making no sound. A few minutes later, he called back with a shaken up voice, and informed Capt. Salas that an oval-shaped UFO with glowing red lights was hovering right outside the gate. Moments later, all of the missiles started shutting down one by one, and then went completely dead. [Read Capt. Salas' full testimony and story](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/robert_salas_ufo) of this shocking encounter. In March 1967, all ten of the 'Minuteman I' missiles under my control were disabled while an oval shaped UFO hovered at close range over the front gate of my launch control center in Montana. I was sworn to secrecy about this incident until 1994 when the U.S. Air Force declassified a similar incident at the request of my investigator, Jim Klotz under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). - [Air Force Officer Captain Robert Salas](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/robert_salas_ufo) In a nearby launch facility around the same time, maintenance and security officers at Echo Flight witnessed hovering UFOs at the launch facilities. The entire flight of 10 Minuteman I missiles were also disabled within ten seconds, and remained down the entire day. Capt. Salas would also learn that [10 ICBMs were disabled under similar circumstances](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2023/06/former-missile-officer-ufo-whistleblower-demonstrates-tremendous-courage/) at the Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota the previous year, September 1966.

[Boeing Project Engineer] Bob Kaminski headed up the organization to look at all aspects of these shutdowns. Kominski related to me in writing that at some point he was told by his boss that the Air Force said, \"Stop the investigation. Do no more on this and in addition do not write a final report.\" Again, this is very unusual, especially in light of the fact that CINC-SAC [Commander-in-Chief, Strategic Air Command] headquarters was stating that this was of extreme importance. And yet, the head of the investigative team was told during the investigation to stop the investigation and not to write a final report. - [Air Force Officer Captain Robert Salas](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/robert_salas_ufo) It is important to note that there was an intense policy of secrecy regarding UFOs in the Air Force at the time. Despite being deeply frightened and confused by the encounters, officers were required to sign non-disclosure agreements ensuring they wouldn't talk about the encounters with anyone, including their family and even amongst each other. Furthermore, the Air Force was not asked to release information on these classified UFO incident reports at nuclear sites to the Condon Committee, an Air Force-sponsored investigation into UFOs following Project Blue Book. The results of the Condon Report heavily influenced public policy and understanding of the phenomena, emphasizing that UFOs do not bear national security interest or relevance. ** Meanwhile, behind closed doors, the Air Force understandably considered the disabling of all 10 Echo Flight nukes by UFOs to be one \"of grave concern\"** ([pg. 8 of declassified government document collection](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/9330-declassified-u-s-government-documents-on-the-ufo-nuclear-weapons-connection)). **Retired US Air Force Colonel Ross Dedrickson**, who worked with the US Air Force and Atomic Energy Commission, provide further evidence linking UFO activity and nuclear missiles. [Project A119](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_A119) was a top secret Air Force program developed in 1958. Its aim was to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon, which could boost \"domestic morale in the capabilities of the US\" [as the Space Race raged on](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230505-the-crazy-plan-to-explode-a-nuclear-bomb-on-the-moon) between the US and the Soviet Union.

Most of the nuclear missiles blew up on launch, and his job was to provide data on why they blew up. Lieutenant Jacobs [also admitted](https://nypost.com/2021/10/21/former-air-force-chief-claims-he-once-saw-ufo-firing-at-nuke-missiles-launched-from-secret-base/) that they were testing to see if they could launch a nuclear warhead into orbit slightly above the nuclear chaff so that Russian anti-missile missiles would aim at the chaff and the warhead would fly over and \"obliterate Moscow.\" After successfully launching a dummy nuclear warhead into the test range, he sent the film back down to Vandenberg Air Force base. Shortly after, he was called into the office of Major Florenze J Mansmann, where two CIA agents were also present. Maj. Mansmann told Lt. Jacobs to watch the film clip. After the three stages of the rocket's powered flight were observed in the film, a saucer-shaped object traveling at 8,000 mph suddenly appeared and circled the missile. So this thing [UFO] fires a beam of light at the warhead, hits it, and then it moves to the other side and fires another beam of light, and then moves again and fires another beam, and another. And the warhead tumbles out of space. What message would I interpret from this? Don't mess with nuclear warheads. - US Air Force Lieutenant and Professor Robert Jacobs After the screening of the footage, the two officers confiscated the tape and Major Mansmann told Lt. Jacobs to never speak out about this event. **Watch Lt. Jacobs's [intriguing full testimony here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-pe38ZxfKY), where he discusses how he was sworn to secrecy about what he saw for 18 years.** By 1983, Maj.

Major-General Vasily Alexyev of the Russian Air Force has [extensively discussed](https://www.howandwhys.com/ussr-general-claimed-soviets-learnt-to-attract-ufo/) his participation in programs that studied UFOs, including one that deliberately provoked the appearance of UFOs at military bases. Interestingly enough, he elaborated in great length that many of their reported UFO sightings were seen over locations containing \"high concentrations of advanced science\" like nuclear facilities. He suggests that extraterrestrials are concerned about the future of our species. I know that in some places they even learned to create a situation which would deliberately provoke the appearance of a UFO. A UFO would appear where there was increased military activity connected, say, with the transportation of \"special\" loads. It was enough to artificially stimulate or schedule such a move for a UFO to appear. In other words, some kind of conditional relationship emerged. I know that at certain testing ranges ... they even learnt to make contact of a kind. First the UFO appeared; in most instances it was a sphere, but there were other kinds. Contact was achieved with the help of physical indications of behavior - pointing your arms in various directions, say, and the sphere became flattened in the same direction. If you raised your arms three times, the UFO flattened out in a vertical direction three times as well. **Military men in general are not inclined to fantasise. They only report what they see, what actually occurs.** I think that if their level of civilization allows them to move in space across great distances, possibly in other forms of material - and that is indeed the case - then at their level of development, when it comes down to it, they are also concerned about ... the survival of intelligent life, if it does exist in the world. And if we look at the Earth from that point of view, then our whole history is a tale of self-destruction, and not creation. It's the history of murders and the death of whole peoples. Not a single truly civilized society could tolerate that. The higher the level of civilization, the greater the awareness of that. - Excerpt from interview with Major General Alexeyev (full interview on [pg. 257 of the*Disclosure Project*briefing document](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/Disclosure-Project-Briefing-Document-Full.pdf)) Controlling the UFO Narrative: Government Cover-Ups and Secret Programs For all the other officers and men in the Air Force who have had to keep silent about what they experienced with these objects, I, without reservation, accuse the U.S. Department of the Air Force of a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufo-information-center.txt:12:770e7d37d98d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14836, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufo-information-center.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufo-information-center", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "civilized society could tolerate that.

A 1949 FBI memo revealed that the FBI [destroyed thousands of UFO reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/fbi-destroys-ufo-reports), supposedly due to a lack of filing space. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) [claimed to have destroyed all of their UFO reports](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/churchill-ufo-winston-churchill-order-ufo-cover-avoid/story?id=11333892) during World War II. A [previously secret 2009 MoD memo](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-mod-destroy-future-ufo-reports) announced a policy of destroying future UFO reports. Those seeking the truth are often misled, debunked, threatened, or discredited for valid inquiries. Meanwhile, [Wilbert B. Smith](#wbsmith), engineer and head of the Canadian government's first study on UFOs, concluded in a [declassified 1950 memo](https://www.cufon.org/cufon/foia_006.htm) that US authorities consider UFO phenomena to be \"of tremendous significance,\" and that UFOs are the \"most highly classified subject in the US government.\" [Luis Elizondo](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-this-man-ran-pentagons-secretive-ufo-programme-a-decade-we-had-some-questions), whistleblower and former head of the secret Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), [even asserted](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/politics/article/luis-elizondo-interview-2021) that only three presidents have been fully briefed on the matter. **In a democracy, the decision on where to draw the line between a citizen's right to know and the government's national security obligations is especially relevant to the UFO conversation.** There are legitimate reasons to keep this information secret. If the government disclosed the existence of some of the advanced technologies that witnesses have encountered, it could have serious political and economic ramifications.

While this information control has clear benefits to a nation state seeking an edge over its adversaries, it also created a situation where these interests could more easily manipulate the general public using secrets and perhaps secret technologies. **Mainstream media narratives about the UFO topic often serve as limited hangouts, a tactic used in the intelligence community to reveal *parts of the truth* in order to effectively conceal a greater truth.** This strategy is commonly used by authority figures to influence public narratives. Air Force officers have even infiltrated the UFO community, feeding researchers \"[lies and half-truths](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--real-men-black-hollywood-the-great-ufo-coverup)\" to further steer them away from top secret technologies. I am convinced there is a small body of valid (UFO) information, and that there is a body of information ten times as big that is total disinformation put out by the sources to confuse the whole issue. - [Edgar Mitchell](https://web.archive.org/web/20160329183637/http://devoid.blogs.heraldtribune.com/15464/the-way-of-the-explorer/), astronaut and sixth man to walk on the moon **An important consideration regarding government secrecy is the strong possibility that there are deeply classified black budget programs involving ET technology.** According to Navy astronaut Edgar Mitchell, these programs involve rogue private organizations that operate top secret projects with [black budget federal funding](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00965R000707040013-3.pdf).

According to the leaked document, these \"gatekeepers\" formed out of necessity to protect themselves following an audit investigation that drew unwanted attention to the program. A back and forth with the investigator and his Pentagon chief over program transparency ensued. They threatened to blow the program's cover, so the investigator was officially briefed, given a tour, and shown their program. Yet following that, the program managers reached a formal agreement with the Special Access Program Oversight Committee (SAPOC) to prevent that from happening again. The agreement established extremely strict criteria for the circumstances under which anyone could get access in the future. The contractor committee (the program director, security director and attorney) set the criteria. **No US government officials could gain access unless they met the criteria.** Note: This conversation took place at the EG&G Special Projects building parking lot in Nevada.

Despite claims that the existence of the MJ-12 was a hoax, a group of respected researchers and scholars has put together a [comprehensive website of government documents and memos](https://majesticdocuments.com/documents/majestic-documents/documents-dated-1960-1969/) that confirm the existence of MJ-12. **Master Sergeant Dan Morris was a retired Air Force Master Sergeant who worked on extraterrestrial projects for many years.** After leaving the Air Force, he was recruited into the top-secret National Reconnaissance Organization, or NRO, where he was specifically involved in extraterrestrial-connected operations. [According to the National Security Archive](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB257/index.htm), the mission of the NRO was to synchronize \"the space and aerial overflight operations of the Air Force and the CIA\" and \"institute a uniform security control system to protect information about those systems.\" In 1962, the NRO added the Navy reconnaissance satellite program, which collected signals emitted by foreign radars. The existence of the NRO remained an official secret until 1992. I had a clearance 38 levels above top secret, which is cosmic top-secret... it is the top of all of those clearances. It is for UFOs, and aliens, etc. No president has had that level, has ever been cleared for that level. Eisenhower was the closest. I became part of a group that would investigate, gather the information, and in the beginning it was still under the Blue Book, Snowbird and different covert programs. I would interview people who claimed they had seen something, and try to convince them they hadn't, or that they were hallucinating. If that didn't work, another team would give all the threats - threaten them and their family. They would be in charge of discrediting them, making them look foolish. Now, if that didn't work, there was another team that put an end to that problem, one way or another. **So, there would be cover stories deliberately put out and then de-bunked.

Many are calling for formal congressional oversight of these rogue private organizations, and their partnership with covert elements within our government. This is especially important, as the public and scientific community have been misled and discredited for their valid inquiries into UFO matters. While concrete evidence continues to be dug up from all sorts of nooks and crannies, we provide details into three compelling summaries of events that indicate a government cover-up. Skip down below to read a more in-depth look. [Roswell Cover-Up](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufo-information-center#roswell) [Condon Report Cover-Up](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufo-information-center#condonreport) [Rendlesham Incident Cover-Up](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufo-information-center#rendlesham) There's a big difference between saying \"the government must have a lot of data\" and saying \"the government knows what this is.\" The place where I end up is, parts of the government must have a lot of data that should be turned over to the scientific community. What are they afraid of? We know there is data. **All of us who have investigated this have spoken to pilots and radar operators who said that after a sighting, a couple of people in blue jeans showed up with some identification from somewhere and confiscated the tapes or the film, and they took it somewhere and no one ever saw it again.** There's enough of that now that we know that data went somewhere. - Jacques Vallée, scientist and co-developer of NASA's map on Mars.

Within hours, however, the statement was quickly retracted and reclassified as a weather balloon. As a result, the press lost interest and the story was buried for the next thirty years. **Then, in 1978, Major Jesse Marcel, the Air Force intelligence officer tasked with investigating the wreckage, [broke the silence](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/roswell-pratt-story.pdf) by publicly stating that what crashed outside of Roswell in 1947 was not a weather balloon.** Compelling information released decades after the incident, particularly from government officials directly involved in the incident, strongly suggests that the infamous 1947 Roswell crash in New Mexico was a cover-up. **Below, we provide the best, most reliable documentation of what really happened during that time.** When New Mexico rancher Mac Brazel reported on a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufo-information-center.txt:18:2e3ce52458bc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14842, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufo-information-center.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufo-information-center", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "intelligence officer tasked with investigating the wreckage, [broke the silence](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/roswell-pratt-story.pdf) by publicly stating that what crashed outside of Roswell in 1947 was not a weather balloon.** Compelling information released decades after the incident, particularly from government officials directly involved in the incident, strongly suggests that the infamous 1947 Roswell crash in New Mexico was a cover-up. **Below, we provide the best, most reliable documentation of what really happened during that time.** When New Mexico rancher Mac Brazel reported on a pile of strange debris on his ranch about 80 miles northwest of Roswell, Major Marcel's responsibility was to retrieve the wreckage and debris to investigate the matter. He concluded that the [debris was not from this earth](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-physician-who-told-handling-roswell-debris-dies) and the [material from the recovered wreckage was quite peculiar](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-dead-airmans-affidavit-roswell-aliens-were-real).

Despite this bombshell revelation, the Air Force changed the official story yet again in 1997 with the release of \"[*The Roswell Report: Case Closed*](https://media.defense.gov/2010/Oct/27/2001330219/-1/-1/0/AFD-101027-030.pdf).\" In this report, they determined that [Project Mogul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mogul) was responsible for the 1947 events. It was explained that the top secret Mogul balloon was used to acoustically detect Soviet nuclear weapons explosions. However, Major Marcel, the man who investigated the wreckage, was highly trained in radar tracking materials and equipment, which were the dominant parts of Project Mogul's balloon devices. Major Marcel had worked on top secret special weapons projects, and received his diploma in radar technology from the Army Air Forces Command. Notably, he was also the intelligence officer for the [509th Bomb Wing stationed at Roswell's Army air base](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-roswell-ufo-incident-coverup-or-scifi), the only nuclear-equipped jet squadron in the world. **Watch Maj. Jesse Marcel's revealing [testimony about the Roswell cover-up](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTf5-TNASoI?si=3tBXSdI55li5Ps9M&t=723)**. **Did you know...** A [declassified memorandum to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-declassified-memorandum-fbi-director-flying-saucers) reveals that a special agent with the FBI said he received information from an Air Force investigator about flying saucers and human-shaped bodies found in New Mexico. [Another FBI document](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-flying-disks) shows that Hoover wanted \"full access to discs recovered\" at Roswell just days after the Roswell crash. It's important to note that [Stanton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanton_T._Friedman), a respected nuclear physicist who worked for top American companies, began investigating the Roswell investigation. After speaking with Major Marcel and at least 40 other people directly involved, [he became convinced](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/roswell-pratt-story.pdf) that a flying saucer did explode, and that Roswell is an outcome of a long-term cover-up.

Frankie's father was a crew chief with the Roswell Fire Department. At the time of the incident, Frankie had ... stopped at the fire station. A highway patrol officer by the name of Robert Scroggins came into the station with a mischievous look on his face. \"Hey, guys! Want to see something?\" Scroggins reached into his pocket and took out something that he wadded up in his hand. He then held his hand out about a foot over a nearby table and opened it. Something silvery fell from his hand to the surface of the table without a sound. Then, as if by magic, it spread out like quicksilver into a small, thin, irregular sheet of something in one or two seconds. It could not be cut with scissors, scratched, burned, or permanently creased. No one there could figure out what it was. A day or two later, Frankie Dwyer was at home with her mother tending to chores when there was a hard knock on the door. Opening the door revealed a tall man with wide shoulders and a dark complexion dressed in an MP uniform. He was looking for Frankie Dwyer. After Mrs. Dwyer introduced her daughter to the ominous MP, two other MPs escorted Mrs. Dwyer into another room. With a thick New York accent, the first MP started to question Frankie about the incident at the fire station and wanted to know what she had actually seen. Satisfied that the twelve-year-old had seen plenty, he took out his billy club and started pounding it into his open palm as he tried to pound home his reason for the visit. **\"You did not see anything.

Carey](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-author-investigates-roswell). Carey held a Top Secret security clearance and became a long-time researcher into the Roswell incident. Lt. Haut's affidavit would reveal that Major Marcel was very upset that the pieces of the wreckage he brought back were replaced with a weather balloon and a radar kite. **The affidavit also asserts that the weather balloon claim was indeed a cover story, and that the real object had been recovered by the military. Furthermore, his affidavit also describes not just seeing the craft, but also witnessing alien bodies.** [Read the full affidavit here](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/walter-haut-affidavit), which has been [verified by Lt. Haut's daughter](http://www.roswellproof.com/Haut_affidavit_process.html). There have been many accounts of witnessing alien bodies by those allegedly involved in the incident. Some of these accounts appear credible, while others may reflect fabrication or government misinformation. One of the most interesting accounts involved was [Sergeant Frederick Benthal](http://www.roswellproof.com/Benthal.html), who was an Army Air Force photographer in Washington, DC when he was given sudden orders to fly to the Roswell base. At the desert site, he was taken to a dark tent where he and a few others took photographs of small nonhuman bodies with \"dark complexions, thin and with large heads.\" However, his picture-taking was heavily supervised by an officer who did not want Benthal to make sustained observation of the aliens. Because it was so dark in the tent, the flash bulbs gave off a blinding light when pictures were snapped. Before he left the site, his camera and film were confiscated. He was told by a Lieutenant Colonel Marine officer that they did not know what they photographed. Like many other military officers, Benthal would be transferred out of the Roswell base after their duties were completed. He was reassigned to Antarctica \"to study the effects of cold on pieces of equipment.\" **Perhaps the most incredible testimony about the Roswell cover-up was from Colonel Philip J. Corso, former head of the Foreign Technology Desk in the US Army and a member of President Eisenhower's National Security Council from 1953-1957.** A year before his death, he came forward to share his astounding knowledge and involvement in covert government operations regarding UFO phenomena in his book *[Day After Roswell](https://www.amazon.com/Day-After-Roswell-Philip-Corso/dp/067101756X)*, where he would corroborate the testimonies of Maj.

Corso helped spearhead the Army's reverse-engineering project on recovered material from the infamous 1947 Roswell crash, which accelerated the development of sophisticated technologies commonly used today. In his book, he extensively discusses the top secret conversations and investigations by military and government officials, which largely focused on studying and exploiting the technology they recovered at Roswell, that was vastly superior to anything human made. Condon Report Cover-Up The Roswell crash was one of many UFO incidents investigated by [Project Blue Book](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-project-blue-book-based-a-true-ufo-story). The end of Project Blue Book involved the Condon Report, which was an investigation from 1966-1968 that heavily influenced public policy and understanding of the phenomena for years. The [final report](https://files.ncas.org/condon/text/sec-i.htm) from the [Condon Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condon_Committee) was written by committee chair Dr. Edward Condon, an American nuclear physicist. [In the investigation's conclusions](https://files.ncas.org/condon/text/sec-i.htm), Condon writes: Our general conclusion is that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge ... **The question remains as to what, if anything, the federal government should do about the UFO reports it receives from the general public. We are inclined to think that nothing should be done with them** in the expectation that they are going to contribute to the advance of science. - Excerpt from [Condon Report conclusions](https://files.ncas.org/condon/text/sec-i.htm) **However, the Condon Report [failed to conduct or document interviews with principal witnesses](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown), including critical military officials who witnessed the presence of unidentified aerial objects around nuclear missile sites **(*See [UFO Interference with Nuclear Missiles](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufo-information-center#nuclear) for more*). The Air Force was not asked to release information on classified UFO incident reports for the study. Meanwhile, behind closed doors, the Air Force understandably considered the disabling of 10 nuclear missiles by UFOs to be one \"of grave concern\" ([pg. 8 of declassified government document collection](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/9330-declassified-u-s-government-documents-on-the-ufo-nuclear-weapons-connection)).

These contacts were called Base UFO Investigators and attended a meeting with Major General Otto Glasser, Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force. He writes a report of this meeting, with parts of it quoted below: Much effort was expended in explaining the methods that have been used to discount approximately 95% of the UFO sightings to date, i.e., optical mirage, stars, satellites, temperature inversion, etc. **No time was devoted to the 5% of sightings on the Project Blue Book list that remain admittedly unexplained to date.** Although the University study [Condon Committee] has approximately 8 months to run, and barring any dramatic events, the conclusions in the initial formal report will most likely read as follows: a. There is no evidence to support a hypothesis that extraterrestrials have visited earth. b. Certain events have occurred that are difficult to explain due to lack of conclusive data and/or instrumentation and state of the art investigative procedures. - Excerpt from [Lt. Col.

Early in the morning of 27 Dec 80 (approximately 0300L) two USAF security police patrolmen saw unusual lights outside the back gate at RAF Woodbridge. Thinking an aircraft might have crashed or been forced down, they called for permission to go outside the gate to investigate. The on-duty flight chief responded and allowed three patrolmen to proceed on foot. The individuals reported seeing a strange glowing object in the forest. The object was described as being metallic in appearance and triangular in shape, approximately two to three meters across the base and approximately two meters high. **It illuminated the entire forest with a white light. The object itself had a pulsing red light on top and a bank(s) of blue lights underneath. The object was hovering or on legs. As the patrolmen approached the object, it maneuvered through the trees and disappeared.** At this time the animals on a nearby farm went into a frenzy. The object was briefly sighted approximately an hour later near the back gate.* *2. The next day, three depressions 1.5 inches deep and 7 inches in diameter were found where the object had been sighted on the ground. The following night (29 Dec 80) the area was checked for radiation. **Beta/gamma readings of 0.1 milliroentgens were recorded with peak readings in the three depressions and near the center of the triangle formed by the depressions.** A nearby tree had moderate (0.05-0.07) readings on the side of the tree toward the depressions.* *3. Later in the night a red sun-like light was seen through the trees. It moved about and pulsed. **At one point it appeared to throw off glowing particles and then broke into five separate white objects and then disappeared.

Most of the recording, they investigate what appear to be landing marks on the ground by the craft on its earlier visit. At 12:25, they begin observing UFO sightings. Ian Ridpath, the first journalist to investigate the Rendlesham incident after it hit the headlines in 1983, was given a copy of the tape that Col. Halt made, which was created by placing a microphone in front of a loudspeaker that was playing the original tape. Thus, there are a few times where background noises can be heard, including his daughter playing piano for a brief moment.

Militaries keep advanced technologies secret to stay ahead of foreign adversaries. If the Pentagon and its contractors have recovered UFOs and successfully reverse-engineered some of what they found, they could be in possession of technologies capable of changing the world. But they are unlikely to release any information about these technologies voluntarily. Whistleblower David Grusch recently described the unusual characteristics of a downed UFO in the government's possession. At a private event, Grusch [told a crowd of finance and intelligence professionals](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12943153/ufo-whistleblower-secret-talk-wall-street-nyc.html) that this craft was 40 feet long when measured from the outside, but on the inside it was the size of a football field. Imagine a technology that can do 6-to-700 g-forces, that can fly at 13,000 miles an hour, that can evade radar and that can fly through air and water and possibly space ... And oh, by the way, has no obvious signs of propulsion, no wings, no control surfaces and yet still can defy the natural effects of Earth's gravity.

Interestingly enough, Bushman wasn't the only one working for Lockheed Martin that has spoken out. **Don Phillips, a retired Air Force pilot and special aircraft engineer,** came forward to discuss his personal experience with UFOs as a pilot, along with his experiences as a contractor for Lockheed Martin's secret weapons and technology unit, [Skunkworks](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-under-pressure-lockheed-opens-up-about-secret-weapons-unit), which was kept secret until 2014. He worked on secret projects for the CIA and other government agencies as part of an \"unseen\" and \"hidden\" industry. In the Disclosure Project, Phillips described reverse engineering programs and certain technologies that have been developed because of ETs: computer chips, lasers, night vision, and bulletproof vests. **His testimony starts on [pg. 281 of the Disclosure Project](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/Disclosure-Project-Briefing-Document-Full.pdf).** When I was working with the Skunkworks, we signed an agreement with the National Security Agency and the National Security Council, as well as the CIA.

Still to this day, government narratives claim that no secret ET programs have existed. In our 33-min Speculation Station video below, we look at specific UFO technologies that have allegedly been recovered from crashes to how these other-worldly technologies might have helped accelerate the development of some human technologies. Investigating Abductions and Encounters That is, UFOs are in fact observed, filmed on camera at the same time that people are having their abduction experiences. People, in fact, have been observed to be missing at the time that they are reporting their abduction experiences. They return from their experiences with cuts, ulcers on their bodies, triangular lesions, which follow the distribution of the experiences that they recover, of what was done to them in the craft by the surgical-like activity of these beings. - Dr. John Mack, excerpt from PBS, \"[Psychiatrist John Mack on alien abductions](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-Psychiatrist-John-Mack-alien-abductions)\" UFO encounters range from beautiful and transcendent to intensely negative and traumatizing. Some of these encounters involve abductions. In [*UFO Abduction Reports: The Supernatural Kidnap Narrative Returns in Technological Guise*](https://sci-hub.se/10.2307/540677), UFO researcher and folklorist Thomas E. Bullard identified eight distinct events within many abduction accounts. **Alien abductions draw much controversy in an already controversial field of study.** Reports of abduction experiences are greatly varietal, suggesting the possibility that more than one phenomenon is in play. Below, we present a few perspectives. Dr. John E. Mack was a professor of psychiatry at The Cambridge Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and founding director of the Center for Psychology and Social Change. A 1977 Pulitzer Prize winner for his biography of Lawrence of Arabia, Dr. Mack studied the subject of UFO abductions later in his career. He came to some astonishing conclusions: We can continue to try to make the phenomenon fit the world as we have known it ... or we can acknowledge that the world might be other than", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufo-information-center.txt:29:7efe8e364a64", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14853, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufo-information-center.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufo-information-center", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "professor of psychiatry at The Cambridge Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and founding director of the Center for Psychology and Social Change.

He came to some astonishing conclusions: We can continue to try to make the phenomenon fit the world as we have known it ... or we can acknowledge that the world might be other than we have known it. Then we are free to see where our thinking leads us. I will stress once again that we do not know the source from which the UFOs or the alien beings come (whether or not, for example, they originate in the physical universe as modern astrophysics has described it). But they manifest in the physical world and bring about definable consequences in that domain. - Dr. John Mack, excerpt from his book [*Abduction: Human Encounters with Aliens*](https://www.amazon.com/Abduction-Encounters-Aliens-John-Mack/dp/1416575804) In the 1990s, Mack began talking with people who claimed to have had UFO abduction experiences. **He was initially skeptical of these claims, but the more people he talked to, the more convinced he became that something incredible was going on.** In his 1994 book [*Abduction: Human Encounters with Aliens*](https://www.amazon.com/Abduction-Encounters-Aliens-John-Mack/dp/1416575804), he wrote that \"the abduction phenomenon has important philosophical, spiritual and social implications.\" His documentary film [Touched by an Alien](https://www.crackle.com/watch/c143d3ac-893a-4fa5-9715-1adee622e312/touched-by-an-alien) told the powerful stories of UFO experiencers. Though Mack [passed away in 2004](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-dr-john-e-mack-psychiatrist-dies-74), he left behind a legacy in the form of the [John E. Mack Institute](http://johnemackinstitute.org/). After working with hundreds of UFO experiencers, Mack concluded in *Abduction: Human Encounters with Aliens* that a common theme in abduction stories was that abductees emerged from their experiences with a \"commitment to changing their relationship to the Earth, of living more gently on it or in greater harmony with the other creatures that live here\" after being warned by aliens that humans are destroying their planet. Another recurrent story Mack noticed in abductees was that they reported a hybrid species is being developed to replace or join humankind. In his book, he stated that the \"future role that the hybrid offspring are being prepared to play represents one of the most puzzling aspects of the entire abduction phenomenon.\" **For a glimpse into how strange these stories can be, [watch a documentary on alleged alien reproduction programs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh460fQdHm8).** A particularly compelling perspective that this documentary emphasizes is that many women who had mysterious miscarriages also had clear memories of alien abduction experiences.

This has forced me - I'm not alone in this - to become more sophisticated about how we understand or think about reality. For many scholars, including psychiatrists, philosophers and theologians, reality does not fall neatly into two categories, viz. physical or mental, external or internal. There are other dimensions of reality and phenomena can be both. Several write of a third domain, \"one that draws upon the psychological and physical, but that is reducible to neither\" (Tulane Professor of Philosophy, Michael Zimmerman). - Dr. John Mack, \"[Dr. Mack Responds to Psychology Today Article](http://johnemackinstitute.org/2003/07/dr-mack-responds-to-psychology-today-article/)\" **Thousands of people or more have gone through the process of navigating an abduction experience. One of the most controversial parts of this phenomenon is that it often relies on memories recovered from hypnosis.** A reputable doctor [wrote in the prestigious Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61655-9/fulltext) that John Mack's use of hypnosis to uncover abduction stories was potentially \"cementing and constructing false memories.\" Yet even if memories recovered by hypnosis differ from consensus reality, the abduction experience often seems to have some value for the experiencer. And Mack's research suggests that many abduction stories do appear to be supported by material evidence. **Abduction Encounters for Psychological Warfare Purposes and Military Abductions (MILAB)** I am today transmitting to the National Security Council a proposal ... **in which it is concluded that the problems connected with unidentified flying objects appear to have implications for psychological warfare as well as for intelligence and operations.** I suggest that we discuss at an early board meeting the possible offensive or defensive utilization of these phenomena for psychological warfare purposes. - [1952 declassified CIA memo](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/cia-psyop.jpeg) written by [Walter B. Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bedell_Smith), former CIA director There is [strong evidence](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/cia-psyop.jpeg) that the CIA explored using the UFO phenomenon in psychological warfare as early as 1952.

Its existence was revealed in 1975 by [landmark congressional hearings](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--last-honest-man-frank-church-the-fight-restrain-us-power) into the activities of national security agencies.

Ordinary people [became super spies](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse) programmed to carry out assassination, terrorist acts, sexual favors, and more without conscious knowledge of what they were doing. The main focus of the program was summarized in a January 1952 CIA memo, **\"Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self-preservation?\"** In Lammer's book [*MILABS: Military Mind Control and Alien Abduction*](https://www.amazon.com/MILABS-Military-Control-Alien-Abduction/dp/1881532186), he explores how military personnel are often recalled by those claiming to have been abducted by aliens.

Zero-point energy is actually what keeps the electrons energized around the atomic structure of everything in the universe. There's enough of this flux, this electrical charge in the nothingness of space, that if you could capture all the energy that was embedded in just a cubic yard of space, you'd have enough energy to boil the oceans of the entire world. **pp. 501, 508.

Henry Moray was inspired by Tesla's work. There was absolutely no question that he had a system that produced 50 kilowatts out of a 55-pound box. There are all kinds of skullduggery that happened there. The Russians even tried to kidnap him at one time.

What we have is a situation where the entire structure of science, industry, and the organizations of science and the patent office are against you. I've been a victim of quite a bit of suppression. So has any other legitimate researcher in the area. And behind this, we have a few people who are quite wealthy and who own these things. The more powerful the agency, the more they will resort not only to legal, but to extra-legal means to suppress their competition. Lethal force is used. And it is not one cartel. It is many, many groups in energy. And each one does not wish to see simple little electrical taps pulling out enormous energy from the vacuum. They would much rather see you burning a lot more oil.

The July 10 control experiment showed in the raw data excess heat. But then, on July 13, it was shifted completely. It was altered. Clear fraud - no question. I asked for a review at MIT. I got nowhere. Yet today, MIT data is held up. In fact, what Pons and Fleischmann found was only the tip of an iceberg. There are [huge quantities of technical literature](http://www.lenr-canr.org/) published by proponents, and a much smaller amount by the people who found so-called negative results.

Everything from all 11 missions from launch to splashdown is on the videos.** What's missing are the never-before-broadcast clear original videos not the grainy converted pictures the world watched on television more than three decades ago. The tapes aren't lost, insists the NASA official put in charge of the search. But he doesn't know where they are. The original video, taken directly from the moon and beamed to deep space network observatories in Australia, has never been seen by the general public or even NASA officials. There are 15 reels (three boxes) for just Apollo 11's stay on the moon. \"It's the whole history of the entire mission, of everything that went on.\" **Note:** Does this seem strange?

The MoD document adds that the RAF officer said the closest object was \"luminous, round and four to five times larger than a Whirlwind helicopter\". The UFOs were reported to be three miles out to sea at a height of about 5,000ft. The officer, whose report is supported by Cpl Torrington and Sgt Graham, said: \"The objects separated.

The CAA reported reported the objects traveled at \"predominantly lower levels\"-about 1700 feet. July 19. Air Force spokesmen said yesterday only that an investigation was being made into the sighting of the objects on the radar screen in the CAA Air Route Traffic Control Center at Washington National Airport, and on two other radar screens. Methods of the investigations were classified as secret, a spoken said. \"**We have no evidence they are flying saucers; conversely we have no evidence they are not flying saucers.** We don't know what they are,\" a spokesman added. The same source reported an expert from the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton Ohio, was here last week investigating the objects sighted July 19. The expert has been identified as Capt. E. J. Ruppelt. Reached by telephone at his home in Dayton yesterday, Ruppelt said he could make no comment on his activity in Washington. Capt. Ruppelt confirmed he was in Washington last week but said he had not come here to investigate the mysterious objects. He recalled he did make an investigation after hearing of the objects, but could not say what he investigated. Another Air Force spokesman said here yesterday the Air Force is taking all steps necessary to evaluate the sightings. \"The intelligence people,\" this spokesman explained, \"sent someone over to the control center at the time of the sightings and did whatever necessary to make the proper evaluation. Asked whether the radar equipment might have been mis-functioning, the spokesman said, \"radar, like the compass is not a perfect instrument and is subject to error.\" He thought,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__19520728_washington_post_ufos.txt:0:3a0c8cc83abd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14917, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__19520728_washington_post_ufos.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__19520728_washington_post_ufos", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "not say what he investigated.

Asked whether the radar equipment might have been mis-functioning, the spokesman said, \"radar, like the compass is not a perfect instrument and is subject to error.\" He thought, however, the investigation would be made by persons acquainted with the problems of radar. **Two other radar screens in the area picked up the objects.** An employee of the National Airport control tower said the radar scope there picked up very weak \"blips\" of the objects. The tower radar's for \"short range\" and is not so powerful as that at the center. Radar at Andrews Air Force Base also registered the objects from about seven miles south of the base. A traffic control center spokesman said the nature of the signals on the radar screen ruled out any possibility they were from clouds or any other \"weather\" disturbance. \"The returns we received from the unidentified objects were similar and analagous to targets representing aircraft in flight,\" he said. **The objects, \"flying saucer\" or what have you, appeared on the radar scope at the airport center at 9:08 PM. Varying from four to 12 in number, the objects appeared on the screen until 3:00 AM., when they diappeared.** At 11:25 PM., two F-94 jet fighters fro Air Defense Command squadron, at New CAstle Delaware, capable of 600 hundred mph speeds, took off to investigate the objects. Airline, civil and military pilots described the objects as looking like the lit end of a cigarette or a cluster of orange and red lights. **One jet pilot observed four lights in the vicinity of Andrews Air Force Base, but was not able to over-take them, and they disappeared in about two minutes.** The same pilot observed a steady white light in the vicinity of Mt Vernon at 11:49 PM. The light, about 5 miles from him, faded in a minute. The lights were also observed in the Beltsville, MD., vicinity. At 1:40 AM two-other F-94 jet fighters took off and scanned the area until 2:20 AM., but did not make any sightings. Visible two days Although \"unidentified objects\" have been picked up on radar before, the incidents of the last two saturdays are believed to be the first time the objects have been picked up on radar-while visible to the human eye. Besides the pilots, who last saturday saw the lights, a woman living on Mississippi Ave., told the Post she saw a very \"bright light streaking across the sky towards Andrews Air Force Base about 11:45 PM.

Then a second object with a tail like a comet whizzed by, and a few seconds later, a third passed in a different direction toward Suntland, she said. Radar operators plotted the speed of \"saturday night's visitors\" at from 38 to 90 mph, but one jet pilot reported faster speeds for the light he saw. **The jet pilot reported he had no apparent \"closing speed\" when he attempted to reach the lights he saw near Andrews Air Force Base. That means the lights were moving at least as fast as his top speed-a maximum of 600 mph.** One person who saw the lights when they first appeared in this area did not see them last night. He is E.W. Chambers, an engineer at Radio Station WRC, who spotted the lights while working early the morning of July 20 at station's Hyattsville tower. Chamber's said he was sorry he had seen the lights because he had been skeptical about \"flying saucers\" before. Now he said, he sort of \"wonders\" and worrys about the whole thing. Leon Davidson, 804 South Irving St. Arlington, a chemical engineer who made an exhaustive study of \"flying saucers\" as a hobby, said yesterday reports of saucers in the East, have been relatively rare. Davidson has studied the official report on the saucers, including some of the secret portions never made public, and analyzed all the data in the report. Davidson, whose study of saucers is impressively detailed and scientific, said he believes the lights are American \"aviation products\"-probably \"circular flying wings,\" using new type jet engines that permit rapid acceleration and relatively low speeds. He believes, they are either \"new fighter,\" guided missiles, or piloted guided missiles. He cited some of the recent jet fighters, including the Navy's new \" F-4-D, which has a radical \"bat-wing,\" as examples of what the objects might resemble. Davidson thinks the fact that the lights have been seen in this area indicates the authorities may be ready to disclose the \"new aircraft\" in the near future. Previously, most of the \"verified saucers\" have been seen over sparsely inhabited areas, Davidson explained, and now, when they appear here, it may indicate that \"secrecy\" is not so important any more.

PROBLEM To determine: a. Whether there are national security implications in the problem of \"unidentified flying objects\" i.e. flying saucers; b. Whether adequate study and research is currently being directed to this problem in its relation to such national security implications; and c. What further investigation and research should be instituted, by whom, and under what aegis. 2. FACTS BEARING ON THE PROBLEM a. OSI has investigated the work currently being performed on flying saucers and has found that: (1) The only unit of government currently studying the problem is the Directorate of Intelligence, USAF, which has charged the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) with responsibility for investigating the reports of sightings. (2) At ATIC there is a small group consisting of a reserve Captain, two Lieutenants", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__19520907_flying_saucers_cia_document_declassified.txt:0:2170186ca341", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14921, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__19520907_flying_saucers_cia_document_declassified.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__19520907_flying_saucers_cia_document_declassified", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "research should be instituted, by whom, and under what aegis. 2. FACTS BEARING ON THE PROBLEM a. OSI has investigated the work currently being performed on flying saucers and has found that: (1) The only unit of government currently studying the problem is the Directorate of Intelligence, USAF, which has charged the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) with responsibility for investigating the reports of sightings. (2) At ATIC there is a small group consisting of a reserve Captain, two Lieutenants and two secretaries to which come all reports of sightings through official channels, and which conducts investigation of the reports either itself or through consultation with other Air Force officers or with civilian technical consultants. (3) A world-wide reporting system has been instituted and major Air Force Bases have been ordered to make interceptions of unidentified flying objects. (4) The research being carried on is strictly on a case basis and appears to be designed solely to attempt a satisfactory explanation of each individual sighting as it occurs. (5) ATIC has concluded an arrangement with Battelle Memorial Institute for the latter to establish a machine indexing system for official reports of sightings. (6) **Since 1947, ATIC has received approximately 1500 official reports of sightings plus an enormous volume of letters, phone calls and press reports. During the month of July 1952 alone, official reports totaled 250. Of the 1500 reports, Air Force carries 20% as unexplained and of those received January through July 1952 it carries 20% unexplained. ** 3. DISCUSSION a. **OSI entered into its inquiry fully aware that is was coming into a field already charged with partisanship, one in which objectivity had been overridden by numerous sensational writers, and one in which there are pressures for extravagant explanations as well as for oversimplification.** The OSI Team consulted with a representative of Air Force Special Studies Group; discussed the problem with those in charge of the Air Force Project at Wright field; reviewed a considerable volume of intelligence reports; checked the Soviet press and broadcast indices; and conferred with three OSI consultants, all leaders in their scientific fields, who were chosen because of their broad knowledge of the technical areas concerned. b. OSI found that the ATIC study is probably valid if the purpose is limited to a case-by-case explanation. However, the study makes no attempt to solve the more fundamental aspect of the problem which is to determine definitely the nature of the various phenomena which are causing these sightings, or to discover means by which these causes and their visual or electronic effects may be immediately identified. **Our consultant panel stated that those solutions would probably be found on the margins or just beyond the frontiers of our present knowledge in the fields of atmospheric, ionospheric, and extraterrestrial phenomena, with the added possibility that our present dispersal of nuclear waste products might also be a factor.**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__19520907_flying_saucers_cia_document_declassified.txt:1:9568430789f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14922, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__19520907_flying_saucers_cia_document_declassified.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__19520907_flying_saucers_cia_document_declassified", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "determine definitely the nature of the various phenomena which are causing these sightings, or to discover means by which these causes and their visual or electronic effects may be immediately identified. **Our consultant panel stated that those solutions would probably be found on the margins or just beyond the frontiers of our present knowledge in the fields of atmospheric, ionospheric, and extraterrestrial phenomena, with the added possibility that our present dispersal of nuclear waste products might also be a factor.** They recommended that a study group be formed to perform three functions: (1) Analyze and systematize the factors of information which form the fundamental problem; (2) Determine the fields of fundamental science which must be investigated in order to reach an understanding of the phenomenon involved; and (3) Make recommendations for the initiation of appropriate research. Dr. Julius A. Stratton, Vice President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has indicated to OSI that such a group could be constituted at that Institute. Similarly, Project Lincoln, the Air Force air defense project at MIT, could be charged with those responsibilities. 4. CONCLUSION a. The flying saucer situation contains two elements of danger which, in a situation of international tensions, have national security implications. These are: (1) **Psychological - With world-wide sightings reported, it was found that, up to the time of our investigation, there had been in the Russian press no report or comment, even satirical, on flying saucers, though Andre Gromyko had made one humorous mention of the subject. With a State-controlled press, this could result only from an official policy decision.** The question, therefore, arises as to whether or not these sightings: (a) Could be controlled, (b) Could be predicted, and (c) Could be used from a psychological warfare point of view either offensively or defensively. The public concern with the phenomena, which is reflected in the United States press and in pressure of inquiry upon the Air Force, indicates that there is a fair proportion of our population which is mentally conditioned to the acceptance of the incredible. In this fact lies the potential for the touching-off of mass hysteria and panic. (2) Air Vulnerability - The United States Air Warning System will undoubtedly always depend upon a combination of radar screening and visual observation. We give Russia the present capability of delivering an air attack against us, yet at any given moment now, there may be current a dozen official unidentified sightings plus many unofficial. At any moment of attack, we are now in a position where we cannot, on an instant basis, distinguish hardware from phantom, and as tension mounts we will run the increasing risk of false alerts and the even greater danger of falsely identifying the real as phantom. b. Both of these problems are ordinarily operational in nature but each contains readily apparent intelligence factors. **From an operational point of view, three actions", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__19520907_flying_saucers_cia_document_declassified.txt:2:f22ce1d75fcf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14923, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__19520907_flying_saucers_cia_document_declassified.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__19520907_flying_saucers_cia_document_declassified", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "a dozen official unidentified sightings plus many unofficial. At any moment of attack, we are now in a position where we cannot, on an instant basis, distinguish hardware from phantom, and as tension mounts we will run the increasing risk of false alerts and the even greater danger of falsely identifying the real as phantom. b. Both of these problems are ordinarily operational in nature but each contains readily apparent intelligence factors. **From an operational point of view, three actions are required: ** **(1) Immediate steps should be taken to improve identification of both visual and electronic phantoms so that in the event of an attack, instant and positive identification of enemy planes or missiles can be made. ** **(2) A study should be instituted to determine what, if any, utilization could be made of these phenomena by United States psychological warfare planners, and what, if any, defenses should be planned in anticipation of Soviet attempts to utilize them. ** **(3) A national policy should be established as to what should be told the public regarding the phenomena, in order to minimize risk of panic.** c. Intelligence problems include: (1) The present level of Russian knowledge regarding these phenomena. (2) Possible Soviet intentions and capabilities to utilize these phenomena to the detriment of US security interests. (3) The reasons for silence in the Soviet Press regarding flying saucers. d. Intelligence responsibilities in this field as regards both collection and analysis can be discharged with maximum effectiveness only after much more is known regarding the exact nature of these phenomena. e. The problem transcends the level of individual departmental responsibilities, and is of such importance as to merit cognizance and action by the National Security Council. f. Additional research, differing in character and emphasis from that presently being performed by the Air Force, will be required to meet the specific needs of both operations and intelligence. 5. RECOMMENDATIONS It is recommended that: a. The Director of Central Intelligence advise the National Security Council of the security implications inherent in the flying saucer problem with the request that, under his statutory coordinating authority, the Director of Central Intelligence be empowered to initiate through the appropriate agencies, either within or without the government, the investigation and research necessary to solve the problem of instant positive identification of \"unidentified flying objects.\" b. **CIA, under its assigned responsibilities, and in cooperation with the psychological strategy board, immediately investigate possible offensive or defensive utilization of the phenomena for psychological warfare purposes both for and against the United States, advising those agencies charged with U.S. internal security of any pertinent findings affecting their areas of responsibility. ** c. On the basis of these programs of research, CIA develop and recommend for adoption by the National Security Council a policy of public information which will minimize the risk of panic. H.

Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP). Non-human spacecraft. Flying saucers. Interdimensional and extraterrestrial (ET) beings. UFO encounters come in a wide variety of mysterious forms. Some involve experimental military aircraft and secret technologies, while others point to the serious possibility of extraterrestrial or interdimensional life. **This week, we'll be launching our revitalized and updated UFO Information Center!** Over 20+ years, we've documented some of the best, most reliable resources on UFOs that radically transcend conventional models of reality. **Instead of speculating ourselves, we describe what has been documented and backed by credible evidence.

We also rely on information from experts, journalists, investigators, and individuals who have experienced UFO encounters directly. Although the term UFO has historically been associated with tin foil hat conspiracy theories, reputable people and top government officials have disclosed significant information on the subject over the years. **It is now well-known that governments and private defense contractors have covered up the UFO issue, while covertly studying it for their own purposes in secret programs.** Those seeking the truth are often misled, debunked, threatened, or discredited for valid inquiries.

Yet even more revealing, they shared their first hand experiences of witnessing UFOs neutralize American and Russian nuclear missiles. **These individuals were among [more than 100 former or retired US Air Force officers](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-exair-force-personnel-ufos-deactivated-nukes) who came forward to share their personal experiences of UFOs near nuclear weapon storage and testing grounds. ** For more, explore [key excerpts of compelling articles from mainstream media sources](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/ufos_national_press_club_witness_testimony) covering this unprecedented event. Below, we provide compelling evidence that UFOs monitored our use of nuclear weapons, which many believe secretly influenced the halt on nuclear weapons testing in the early 90s. Perhaps one of the most remarkable events in the history of UFO encounters took place in March of 1967 at the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, which was a base that was responsible for a large amount of nuclear weapons. Air Force Captain Robert Salas, a missile launch officer and Titan 3 missiles engineer, initially received a call from his flight security controller about strange lights that were flying rapidly around the facility, yet making no sound. A few minutes later, he called back with a shaken up voice, and informed Capt. Salas that an oval-shaped UFO with glowing red lights was hovering right outside the gate. **Moments later, all of the missiles started shutting down one by one, and then went completely dead. [Read Capt. Salas' full testimony and story](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/robert_salas_ufo) of this shocking encounter.** *In March 1967, all ten of the 'Minuteman I' missiles under my control were disabled while an oval shaped UFO hovered at close range over the front gate of my launch control center in Montana.

The entire flight of 10 Minuteman I missiles were also disabled within ten seconds, and remained down the entire day. Capt. Salas would also learn that [10 ICBMs were disabled under similar circumstances](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2023/06/former-missile-officer-ufo-whistleblower-demonstrates-tremendous-courage/) at the Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota the previous year, September 1966. UFO encounters at the Minot Air Force Base were quite extraordinary, as detailed in [this fascinating summary](https://minotb52ufo.com/introduction.php). Capt. Salas' colleague Colonel Fred Meiwald [would also confirm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIhWjHBeIlQ) that a similar incident occurred just eight days before the Malmstrom Base incident at the Oscar Flight nuclear facility. *[Boeing Project Engineer] Bob Kaminski headed up the organization to look at all aspects of these shutdowns. Kominski related to me in writing that at some point he was told by his boss that the Air Force said, **\"Stop the investigation. Do no more on this and in addition do not write a final report.\" Again, this is very unusual, especially in light of the fact that CINC-SAC [Commander-in-Chief, Strategic Air Command] headquarters was stating that this was of extreme importance.** And yet, the head of the investigative team was told during the investigation to stop the investigation and not to write a final report.* - excerpt from [testimony of Capt. Robert Salas](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/robert_salas_ufo) It is important to note that there was an intense policy of secrecy regarding UFOs in the Air Force at the time. Despite being deeply frightened and confused by the encounters, officers were required to sign non-disclosure agreements ensuring they wouldn't talk about the encounters with anyone, including their family and even amongst each other. Furthermore, the Air Force [was not asked to release information on these classified UFO incident reports at nuclear sites](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown) to the Condon Committee, an Air Force-sponsored investigation into UFOs following Project Blue Book. The results of the Condon Report heavily influenced public policy and understanding of the phenomena, emphasizing that UFOs do not bear national security interest or relevance. **Meanwhile, behind closed doors, the Air Force understandably considered the disabling of all 10 Echo Flight nukes by UFOs to be one \"of grave concern\" ([pg. 8 of declassified government document collection](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/9330-declassified-u-s-government-documents-on-the-ufo-nuclear-weapons-connection)).** Testimonies of other military whistleblowers like retired US Air Force Colonel Ross Dedrickson, who worked with the US Air Force and Atomic Energy Commission, provide further evidence linking UFO activity and nuclear missiles. **[Project A119](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_A119) was a top secret Air Force program developed in 1958.

I learned of a number of incidents [in which] nuclear weapons sent into space were destroyed by the extraterrestrials.

Most of the nuclear missiles blew up on launch, and his job was to provide data on why they blew up. Lieutenant Jacobs [also admitted](https://nypost.com/2021/10/21/former-air-force-chief-claims-he-once-saw-ufo-firing-at-nuke-missiles-launched-from-secret-base/) that they were testing to see if they could launch a nuclear warhead into orbit slightly above the nuclear chaff so that Russian anti-missile missiles would aim at the chaff and the warhead would fly over and \"obliterate Moscow.\" After successfully launching a dummy nuclear warhead into the test range, he sent the film back down to Vandenberg Air Force base. Shortly after, he was called into the office of Major Florenze J Mansmann, where two CIA agents were also present. Maj. Mansmann told Lt. Jacobs to watch the film clip. After the three stages of the rocket's powered flight were observed in the film, a saucer-shaped object traveling at 8,000 mph suddenly appeared and circled the missile. ***So this thing [UFO] fires a beam of light at the warhead, hits it, and then it moves to the other side and fires another beam of light, and then moves again and fires another beam, and another.

Interestingly enough, he elaborated in great length that many of their reported UFO sightings were seen over locations containing \"high concentrations of advanced science\" like nuclear facilities. He suggests that extraterrestrials are concerned about the future of our species. *I know that in some places they even learned to create a situation which would deliberately provoke the appearance of a UFO. A UFO would appear where there was increased military activity connected, say, with the transportation of \"special\" loads. It was enough to artificially stimulate or schedule such a move for a UFO to appear. In other words, some kind of conditional relationship emerged. I know that at certain testing ranges ... they even learnt to make contact of a kind. First the UFO appeared; in most instances it was a sphere, but there were other kinds. Contact was achieved with the help of physical indications of behavior - pointing your arms in various directions, say, and the sphere became flattened in the same direction. If you raised your arms three times, the UFO flattened out in a vertical direction three times as well. ** Military men in general are not inclined to fantasise. They only report what they see, what actually occurs.** I think that if their level of civilization allows them to move in space across great distances, possibly in other forms of material - and that is indeed the case - then at their level of development, when it comes down to it, they are also concerned about ... the survival of intelligent life, if it does exist in the world.

The historic Apollo videotapes have recently been found again, according to [news reports](http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/110442/WORLD-EXCLUSIVE-NASA-finds-missing-moon-landing-tapes) and a [press release](http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/jul/HQ_M09-125_Newseum_Apollo_tapes.html) on the NASA website, and \"15 key moments\" were shown recently for the first time at the Newseum in Washington, DC. **Yet the new clips shown raise more questions than they answer.** Almost exactly 40 years ago, on July 20, 1969, NASA's first successful moon landing brought us those famous words from Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\" A huge milestone in the history of mankind had been crossed. Yet for all the importance of this amazing feat, somehow NASA claims that the original high-quality video tapes went missing. As revealed in [a report](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003201902_moontapes16.html) by the *Seattle Times*/Associated Press nearly two years ago: NASA said Tuesday it was launching an official search for more than 13,000 original tapes of the historic Apollo moon missions. Everything from all 11 missions from launch to splashdown is on the videos. What's missing are the never-before-broadcast clear original videos, not the grainy converted pictures the world watched on television. **The tapes aren't lost, says the NASA official in charge of the search. But he doesn't know where they are.** The original video, taken directly from the moon and beamed to deep space network observatories in Australia, has never been seen by the general public or even NASA officials. How could NASA lose vital documentation from one of the most important events in human history? Wouldn't NASA scientists have been dying to pour over these high quality images and investigate every aspect of the lunar surface in the images? Yet according to this article, NASA officials never even saw the original footage. Why not? And why weren't these landmark videos made available to all interested back in 1969? As mentioned above, NASA claims that the tapes were recently found. An [intriguing report](http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/110442/WORLD-EXCLUSIVE-NASA-finds-missing-moon-landing-tapes) in the U.K.'s *Daily Express* on June 28th stated \"The *Sunday Express* can now reveal that the missing tapes containing the original high quality images have been found.\" Yet strangely, a Google search reveals Fox News was the only other media outlet to report on this important finding. Yet NASA then later confirmed the finding with their July 13th [press release](http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/jul/HQ_M09-125_Newseum_Apollo_tapes.html) stating some greatly improved moon landing videos would be released. Now comes the even more bizarre news today from this [Reuters report](http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE56F5MK20090716): **The original recordings of the first humans landing on the moon 40 years ago were erased and re-used.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__apollo_lunar_landing_videotapes.txt:0:96a63bdbef82", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14933, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__apollo_lunar_landing_videotapes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__apollo_lunar_landing_videotapes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "original high quality images have been found.\" Yet strangely, a Google search reveals Fox News was the only other media outlet to report on this important finding.

They were part of a batch of 200,000 tapes that were degaussed - magnetically erased - and re-used to save money.** But newly restored copies of the original broadcast look even better. NASA released the first glimpses of a complete digital make-over of the original landing footage that clarifies the blurry and grainy images of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the surface of the moon. The full set of recordings, being cleaned up by Burbank, California-based Lowry Digital, will be released in September. Lowry, best known for restoring old Hollywood films, has been digitizing these along with some other bits and pieces to make a new rendering of the original landing. The preview is available at [www.nasa.gov](http://www.nasa.gov). What's going on here? NASA loses the tapes of one of the most important landmark events in human history. Then they find them, but parts have been erased to save money. And now Hollywood is being paid to restore the videos. How could anyone allow these historic tapes to be erased to save money? How could they even have been lost in the first place? I don't doubt that the Apollo missions went to the moon, but there does appear to be some kind of cover-up and manipulation going on here. Hundreds of [military and government witnesses](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg) have gone on record claiming a major cover-up around UFOs. Among them are [a former chief of the CIA](https://www.WantToKnow.info/600228nytimes), the former chiefs of defense of the [UK](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#hillnorton) and [Canada](https://www.WantToKnow.info/051213paulhellyerufos), and [two NASA astronauts](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#cooper), including [Edgar Mitchell](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up10pg#mitchell), the sixth man to walk on the moon.

These billions have funded a secret world of advanced science, technology, weapons, and various covert activities, which have always been shielded from congressional oversight and public scrutiny. Back in the 90s, Members of the House Armed Services Committee once said that [70 percent of the black budget could be declassified at no risk to national security.](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00965R000707040013-3.pdf) **Our taxpayer dollars are partly funding these black budget programs, and we have a right to know what we're paying for. So why the secrecy? What is being kept hidden from the public?** This is why we're interviewing private pilot and military aerospace historian [Michael Schratt](https://www.youtube.com/@michaelschrattofficial), who's investigated top secret advanced technologies buried deep within the military-intelligence complex for over 25 years. He alleges to have first-hand experience with classified government black budget programs, with access to former US Air Force pilots, retired Naval personnel and former aerospace engineers with top-secret clearance. He's one of the leading authority voices in investigating government programs that involve the recovery and study of off-world technology, also known as UAP/UFO crash retrieval programs. He's author of [*DARK FILES*](https://www.amazon.com/DARK-FILES-Pictorial-Forgotten-Encounters/dp/0578369265/ref=sr_1_1), which brings to life historically significant and credible UFO cases obtained from university archives, research centers, and private collections using carefully re-constructed illustrations of the events. Whether it's advanced military aircraft or serious signs of extraterrestrial life, the implications are too profound to ignore. **Michael is suggesting that publicly known technology and weapons programs might be fronts for black budget operations dealing with technologies way more advanced than the public is aware of. ** [Join us in this fascinating 38-min video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOT0tPeQwzI), with many images and videos throughout to verify and illustrate the points being discussed. **Our 38-min interview covers the topics below, which you can follow along at the Youtube link:** • Introduction to the military-industrial complex and the black budget world • What drew Michael Schratt to studying advanced black budget technologies and UFO phenomena • If you could declassify one technology developed under a black budget program, what would it be and why? • Out of all the advanced technologies in use on Earth, how much has ET influence? • UFO/UAP crash retrieval programs • Top secret technologies kept hidden from the public • The infamous Tic Tac video: a UFO, reverse-engineered craft, experimental military tech, or all of the above? • US military bases purported to study ET tech and house advanced technologies • How can the most powerful technologies help humanity instead of harm? • How to balance disclosure with national security obligations • Michael's thoughts on the [UAP Disclosure Act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngn0LimfRDE&) • What keeps Michael inspired and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__black-budget-tech-ufos-interview-michael-schratt.txt:0:470657caf04e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14936, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__black-budget-tech-ufos-interview-michael-schratt.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__black-budget-tech-ufos-interview-michael-schratt", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "• UFO/UAP crash retrieval programs • Top secret technologies kept hidden from the public • The infamous Tic Tac video: a UFO, reverse-engineered craft, experimental military tech, or all of the above? • US military bases purported to study ET tech and house advanced technologies • How can the most powerful technologies help humanity instead of harm? • How to balance disclosure with national security obligations • Michael's thoughts on the [UAP Disclosure Act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngn0LimfRDE&) • What keeps Michael inspired and hopeful With faith in a transforming world, Amber Yang for [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) and [WantToKnow.info](https://www.wanttoknow.info) **As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, we depend almost entirely on donations from people like you.

[**https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/ufos/crop_circles_video**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/ufos/crop_circles_video) Though some crop circles are artificially created, the sheer volume and the [incredible sophistication](https://www.google.com/search?q=crop+circles&num=100&hl=en&lr=&sa=X&oi=images&ct=title&tbm=isch&gws_rd=ssl) and [size](http://davidpratt.info/cropcirc1.htm) of some suggest that it would be nearly impossible for even a group of people to create them in the course of one night. And for undeniable evidence of the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life, watch the amazing UFO footage in the Sci-Fi Channel's [*Out of the Blue*](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060602ufosvideosfootage). This profound documentary includes riveting personal testimony from a number of astronauts, generals, and top politicians on their involvement in a [major cover-up](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up) of the extraterrestrial phenomenon. As described in the crop circle video at the link above,** the most exciting of the Chilbolton crop circle messages turned out on decoding to be a clear response to the 1974 [message from humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message) sent into outer space. Sent to other potential denizens of our universe through the the [world's largest radio telescope](https://www.naic.edu/) in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, the original message was crafted by Carl Sagan, Dr. Frank Drake, and others. **A detailed image of this transmission, with complete description, may be found on page 290 of Sagan's 1980 book *[Cosmos](http://www.amazon.com/Cosmos-Carl-Sagan/dp/0345539435/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437057537&sr=8-1&keywords=sagan+cosmos&pebp=1437057545375&perid=08YFEW5FVRNJVKN74KXM)*. This crop circle's most intriguing formation not only imitated the exact binary form in which the original Arecibo message was sent, it gave precise information on the extraterrestrial group which formed the circle, including their population, location, and even appearance. And it appeared in a field right next to a radio telescope similar to the one that projected the original message. Below is a brief summary of key points decoded from the message: *From the aerial view [the image in the crop circle] is the shape of an ET figure. It clearly has a little stick-like body with two arms and two legs, but has a much larger head and two distinct eyes. If you decode the 'population' binary sequence in the actual crop formation you get a value of approx 21.3 billion. There is also some indication of a change in the basic DNA structure of ET. The additional (third) strand shown on the left and also a change in the number of nucleotides indicates a different DNA than ours.* The above excerpt is taken from a thorough analysis with detailed photos and description of this most amazing crop circle message", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__crop-circles-messages-decoded.txt:0:ca1d7a3c6fe9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14938, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__crop-circles-messages-decoded.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__crop-circles-messages-decoded", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "eyes.

This page and the above video clip are well worth exploring if you are at all intrigued by this amazing message which appears to be from another race of intelligent beings who share our universe. Crop circles are but one of many highly intriguing phenomena which are difficult to explain away. Could some of these be messages informing those with eyes to see that we are not alone in the universe? The question of extraterrestrial life continues to be one of the most baffling and profound [questions about life](https://www.WantToKnow.info/meaningoflifebigpicture) in our universe.

Corso Perhaps one of the most intriguing testimonies of those allegedly involved in top secret UFO government programs was the story of [Lieutenant Colonel Philip J. Corso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_J._Corso), former head of the Foreign Technology Desk in the US Army and a member of President Eisenhower's National Security Council from 1953-1957. A year before his death, he came forward to share his astounding knowledge and involvement in covert government operations regarding UFO phenomena in his book *[Day After Roswell](https://www.amazon.com/Day-After-Roswell-Philip-Corso/dp/067101756X)*. In the book, he describes how he came into contact with Roswell material, and the shocking encounters he had of alien bodies. He also discusses how he helped spearhead the Army's reverse-engineering project on recovered material from the infamous 1947 Roswell crash, which accelerated the development of sophisticated technologies commonly used today. Below are key excerpts from his book that we found particularly useful in understanding the UFO phenomena, and the history of covert government programs regarding UFOs that are just beginning to come to light.

Corso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_J._Corso), and for two incredible years back in the 1960s while I was a lieutenant colonel in the army heading up the Foreign Technology desk in Army Research and Development at the Pentagon, I led a double life. In my routine everyday job as a researcher and evaluator of weapons systems for the army. Part of my job responsibility in Army R&D, however, was as an intelligence officer and adviser to General Trudeau who, himself, had headed up Army Intelligence before coming to R&D. This was a job I was trained for and held during World War II and Korea. At the Pentagon I was working in some of the most secret areas of military intelligence, reviewing heavily classified information on behalf of General Trudeau. I had been on General Mac-Arthur's staff in Korea and knew that as late as 1961- even as late, maybe, as today-as Americans back then were sitting down to watch Dr. Kildare or Gunsmoke, captured American soldiers from World War II and Korea were still living in gulag conditions in prison camps in the Soviet Union and Korea. Some of them were undergoing what amounted to sheer psychological torture. They were the men who never returned. As an intelligence officer I also knew the terrible secret that some of our government's most revered institutions had been penetrated by the KGB and that key aspects of American foreign policy were being dictated from inside the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:0:c3ae7a5a6253", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14943, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "captured American soldiers from World War II and Korea were still living in gulag conditions in prison camps in the Soviet Union and Korea. Some of them were undergoing what amounted to sheer psychological torture. They were the men who never returned. As an intelligence officer I also knew the terrible secret that some of our government's most revered institutions had been penetrated by the KGB and that key aspects of American foreign policy were being dictated from inside the Kremlin. I testified to this first at a Senate subcommittee hearing chaired by Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois in April 1962, and a month later delivered the same information to Attorney General Robert Kennedy. But hidden beneath everything I did, at the center of a double life I led that no one knew about, and buried deep inside my job at the Pentagon was a single file cabinet that I had inherited because of my intelligence background. That file held the army's deepest and most closely guarded secret: the Roswell files, the cache of debris and information an army retrieval team from the 509th Army Air Field pulled out of the wreckage of a flying disk that had crashed outside the town of Roswell in the New Mexico desert in the early-morning darkness during the first week of July 1947. The Roswell file was the legacy of what happened in the hours and days after the crash when the official government cover-up was put into place. **As the military tried to figure out what it was that had crashed, where it had come from, and what its inhabitants' intentions were, a covert group was assembled under the leadership of the director of intelligence, Adm. Roscoe Hillenkoetter,** to investigate the nature of the flying disks and collect all information about encounters with these phenomena while, at the same time, publicly and officially discounting the existence of all flying saucers. This operation has been going on, in one form or another, for fifty years amidst complete secrecy. I wasn't in Roswell in 1947, nor had I heard any details about the crash at that time because it was kept so tightly under wraps, even within the military. You can easily understand why, though, if you remember, as I do, the Mercury Theater \"War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast in 1938 when the entire country panicked at the story of how invaders from Mars landed in Grovers Mill, New Jersey, and began attacking the local populace. The fictionalized eyewitness reports of violence and the inability of our military forces to stop the creatures were graphic. They killed everyone who crossed their path, narrator Orson Welles said into his microphone, as these creatures in their war machines started their march toward New York. The level of terror that Halloween night of the broadcast was so intense and the military so incapable of protecting the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:1:461fa9a5ed17", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14944, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Mars landed in Grovers Mill, New Jersey, and began attacking the local populace.

They killed everyone who crossed their path, narrator Orson Welles said into his microphone, as these creatures in their war machines started their march toward New York. The level of terror that Halloween night of the broadcast was so intense and the military so incapable of protecting the local residents that the police were overwhelmed by the phone calls. It was as if the whole country had gone crazy and authority itself had started to unravel. **Now, in Roswell in 1947, the landing of a flying saucer was no fantasy. It was real, the military wasn't able to prevent it,** and this time the authorities didn't want a repeat of \"War of the Worlds.\" So you can see the mentality at work behind the desperate need to keep the story quiet. And this is not to mention the military fears at first that the craft might have been an experimental Soviet weapon because it bore a resemblance to some of the German-designed aircraft that had made their appearances near the end of the war, especially the crescent-shaped Horton flying wing. What if the Soviets had developed their own version of this craft? The stories about the Roswell crash vary from one another in the details. Because I wasn't there, I've had to rely on reports of others, even within the military itself. In 1961, regardless of the differences in the Roswell story from the many different sources who had described it, the top-secret file of Roswell information came into my possession when I took over the Foreign Technology desk at R&D. **My boss, General Trudeau, asked me to use the army's ongoing weapons development and research program as a way to filter the Roswell technology into the mainstream of industrial development through the military defense contracting program. ** Today, items such as lasers, integrated circuitry, fiber-optics networks, accelerated particle-beam devices, and even the Kevlar material in bulletproof vests are all commonplace. Yet the seeds for the development of all of them were found in the crash of the alien craft at Roswell and turned up in my files fourteen years later. But that's not even the whole story. In those confusing hours after the discovery of the crashed Roswell alien craft, the army determined that in the absence of any other information it had to be an extraterrestrial. **Worse, the fact that this craft and other flying saucers had been surveilling our defensive installations and even seemed to evidence a technology we'd seen evidenced by the Nazis caused the military to assume these flying saucers had hostile intentions and might have even interfered in human events during the war.** That meant that we were facing a far superior", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:2:12d4dd9ec1c5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14945, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "Roswell alien craft, the army determined that in the absence of any other information it had to be an extraterrestrial. **Worse, the fact that this craft and other flying saucers had been surveilling our defensive installations and even seemed to evidence a technology we'd seen evidenced by the Nazis caused the military to assume these flying saucers had hostile intentions and might have even interfered in human events during the war.** That meant that we were facing a far superior power with weapons capable of obliterating us. At the same time we were locked in a Cold War with the Soviets and the mainland Chinese and were faced with the penetration of our own intelligence agencies by the KGB. The military found itself fighting a two-front war, a war against the Communists who were seeking to undermine our institutions while threatening our allies and, as unbelievable as it sounds, a war against extraterrestrials, who posed an even greater threat than the Communist forces. It took us until the 1980s, but in the end we were able to deploy enough of the Strategic Defense Initiative, \"Star Wars,\" to achieve the capability of knocking down enemy satellites, killing the electronic guidance systems of incoming enemy warheads, and disabling enemy spacecraft, if we had to, to pose a threat. It was alien technology that we used: lasers, accelerated particle-beam weapons, and aircraft equipped with \"Stealth\" features. I just did my job, going to work at the Pentagon day in and day out until we put enough of this alien technology into development that it began to move forward under its own weight through industry and back into the army. The full import of what we did at Army R&D and what General Trudeau did to grow R&D from a disorganized unit under the shadow of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), when he first took command, to the army department that helped create the military guided missile, the antimissile missile, and the guided-missile-launched accelerated particle-beam-firing satellite killer, didn't really hit me until years later when I understood just how we were able to make history. I always thought of myself as just a little man from a little American town in western Pennsylvania, and I didn't assess the weight of our accomplishments at Army R&D, especially how we harvested the technology coming out of the Roswell crash, until thirty-five years after I left the army when I sat down to write my memoirs for an entirely different book. That was when I reviewed my old journals, remembered some of the memos I'd written to General Trudeau, and understood that the story of what happened in the days after the Roswell crash was perhaps the most significant story of the past fifty years.

Throughout the 1950s, I witnessed the government become more and more secretive about UFOs even though privately I thought that they would get better information if they were more open about it. But I was also a military officer and understood the necessity of keeping information confidential until you understood what it was. Besides, the Soviets were making great strides in the race to get into space and we didn't know if they were getting cooperation from the EBEs. **In 1961, the air force began two secret projects that, in effect, had been in operation since 1947 but had not been committed to policy.** \"Moon Dust\" had to do with the establishment of recovery teams to retrieve and recover crashed or grounded \"foreign\" space vehicles. But for all intents and purposes, as far as the public was concerned the air force was looking for Soviet satellites that had fallen out of the sky and landed on Earth. But in reality the air force was establishing a recovery of UFOs program just like the army had pulled the crashed UFO out of the New Mexico desert fourteen years earlier. Then in Project \"Blue Fly,\" the air force authorized the immediate delivery of foreign crashed space vehicles and any other item of technical intelligence interest to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, for evaluation. It was a repeat of General Twining's retrieval of the Roswell space vehicle from the 509th to Wright Field in 1947. **In 1962, one of the assistants to the secretary of defense, Arthur Sylvester, told the press at a briefing that if the government deemed it necessary for reasons of national security, it would not even furnish information about UFOs to Congress, let alone the American public.** So, believe it or not, this is the story of what happened in the days after Roswell and how a small group of military intelligence officers changed the course of human history.

Bill Brown] He stepped out from inside the door, and even through the shadow I could see that his face was a dead pale, just as if he'd seen a ghost. \"You won't believe this,\" he said. \"I don't believe it and I just saw it.\" \"What are you talking about?\" I asked. **\"The guys who off-loaded those deuce-and-a-halfs,\" he said. \"They told us they brought these boxes up from Fort Bliss from some accident out in New Mexico? ... Well, they told us it was all top secret but they looked inside anyway.** Everybody down there did when they were loading the trucks. MPs were walking around with sidearms and even the officers were standing guard,\" Brown said. \"But the guys who loaded the trucks said they looked inside the boxes and didn't believe what they saw. You got security clearance, Major. You can come in here.\" In fact, I was the post duty officer and could go anywhere I wanted during the watch. So I walked inside the old veterinary building, the medical dispensary for the cavalry horses before the First World War, and saw where the cargo from the convoy had been stacked up. There was no one in the building except for Bill Brown and myself. \"What is all this stuff?\" I asked. \"That's just it, Major, nobody knows,\" he said. \"The drivers told us it came from a plane crash out in the desert somewhere around the 509th. But when they looked inside, it was nothing like anything they'd seen before. Nothing from this planet.\" There were about thirty-odd wooden crates nailed shut and stacked together against the far wall of the building. The light switches were the push type and I didn't know which switch tripped which circuit, so I used my flashlight and stumbled around until my eyes got used to the darkness and shadows. I didn't want to start pulling apart the nails, so I set the flashlight off to one side where it could throw light on the stack and then searched for a box that could open easily. Then I found an oblong box off to one side with a wide seam under the top that looked like it had been already opened. **It looked like either the strangest weapons crate you'd ever see or the smallest shipping crate for a coffin.** Maybe this was the box that Brownie had seen.

I brought the flashlight over and set it up high on the wall so it would throw as broad a beam as possible. Then I set to work on the crate. The top was already loose. I was right-this one had just been opened. I jimmied the top back and forth, continuing to loosen the nails that had been pried up with a nail claw, until I felt them come out of the wood. Then I worked along the sides of the five-or-so-foot box until the top was loose all the way around. Not knowing which end of the box was the front, I picked up the top and slid it off to the edge. Then I lowered the flashlight, looked inside, and my stomach rolled right up into my throat and I almost became sick right then and there. Whatever they'd crated this way, it was a coffin, but not like any coffin I'd seen before. **The contents, enclosed in a thick glass container, were submerged in a thick light blue liquid, almost as heavy as a gelling solution of diesel fuel. But the object was floating, actually suspended, and not sitting on the bottom with a fluid over top, and it was soft and shiny as the underbelly of a fish.** At first I thought it was a dead child they were shipping somewhere. But this was no child. It was a four-foot human-shaped figure with arms, bizarre-looking four-fingered hands-I didn't see a thumb-thin legs and feet, and an oversized incandescent lightbulb-shaped head that looked like it was floating over a balloon gondola for a chin. I know I must have cringed at first, but then I had the urge to pull off the top of the liquid container and touch the pale gray skin. **But I couldn't tell whether it was skin because it also looked like a very thin one-piece head-to-toe fabric covering the creature's flesh.** Its eyeballs must have been rolled way back in its head because I couldn't see any pupils or iris or anything that resembled a human eye. But the eye sockets themselves were oversized and almond shaped and pointed down to its tiny nose, which didn't really protrude from the skull. It was more like the tiny nose of a baby that never grew as the child grew, and it was mostly nostril.

The creature's skull was overgrown to the point where all of its facial features-such as they were-were arranged absolutely frontally, occupying only a small circle on the lower part of the head. The protruding ears of a human were nonexistent, its cheeks had no definition, and there were no eyebrows or any indications of facial hair. The creature had only a tiny flat slit for a mouth and it was completely closed, resembling more of a crease or indentation between the nose and the bottom of the chinless skull than a fully functioning orifice. I would find out years later how it communicated, but at that moment in Kansas, I could only stand there in shock over the clearly nonhuman face suspended in front of me in a semiliquid preservative. I could see no damage to the creature's body and no indication that it had been involved in any accident. There was no blood, its limbs seemed intact, and I could find no lacerations on the skin or through the gray fabric. I looked through the crate encasing the container of liquid for any paperwork or shipping invoice or anything that would describe the nature or origin of this thing. **What I found was an intriguing Army Intelligence document describing the creature as an inhabitant of a craft that had crash-landed in Roswell, New Mexico, earlier that week and a routing manifest for this creature to the log-in officer at the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field and from him to the Walter Reed Army Hospital morgue's pathology section where, I supposed, the creature would be autopsied and stored. It was not a document I was meant to see, for sure, so I tucked it back in the envelope against the inside wall of the crate.** I allowed myself more time to look at the creature than I should have, I suppose, because that night I missed the time checks on the rest of my rounds and believed I'd have to come up with a pretty good explanation for the lateness of my other stops to verify the sentry assignments. But what I was looking at was worth any trouble I'd get into the next day. This thing was truly fascinating and at the same time utterly horrible. It challenged every conception I had.

You weren't supposed to see it and maybe you can live your whole life without ever having to think about it. Maybe. Once outside the building I rejoined Brownie at his post. \"You know you never saw this,\" I said. \"And you tell no one.\" [Back to top.](#12) **Artifacts from Roswell** It was 1961, four years after I left the White House and put on my uniform again to stand guard across the electronic no-man's-land of radar sweeps and photo sensors just a few kilometers west of the Iron Curtain. My new boss was General Arthur Trudeau, one of the last fighting generals from the Korean War. I was a lieutenant colonel when I came to the Pentagon in 1961, and all I brought with me were my bowling trophy from Fort Riley and a nameplate for my desk cut out of the fin of a Nike missile from Germany. General Trudeau gave me his very grim smile and said, as he walked me toward the locked dark olive military file cabinet on the wall of his private office, \"I need you to cover my back, Colonel. I need you to watch because what I'm going to do, I can't cover it myself.\" Whatever Trudeau was planning, I knew he'd tell me in his own time. And he'd tell me only what he thought I needed to know when I needed it. For the immediate present, **I was to be his special assistant in R&D, one of the most sensitive divisions in the whole Pentagon bureaucracy because that was where the most classified plans of the scientists and weapons designers were translated into the reality of defense contracts.** R&D was the interface between the gleam in someone's eye and a piece of hardware prototype rolling out of a factory to show its potential for the army brass. Only it was my job to keep it a secret while it was developed. The general had put me in an office on the second floor of the outer ring directly under him. That way, as I would soon find out, whenever he needed me in a hurry I could get upstairs and through the back door before anybody even knew where I was. \"This has some special files, war material you've never seen before, that I want to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:8:ba9ce605a7ff", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14951, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "brass.

My specific assignment was to the Research & Development Division's Foreign Technology desk, what I thought would be a pretty dry post because it mainly required me to keep up on the kinds of weapons and research our allies were doing. \"I'll get to those files right away if you like, General,\" I said. \"And write up some preliminary reports on what I think about it.\" \"It's going to take you a little longer than that, Phil,\" Trudeau said. Now he was almost laughing, something he didn't do very much in those days. In fact, the only time I remember him laughing that way was after he heard that his name had been put up to command the U.S. forces in Vietnam. \"Is there something else about this I should know, General?\" I asked, trying not to show any hesitation in my voice. Business as usual, nothing out of the ordinary, nothing anybody can throw my way that I can't handle. \"Actually, Phil, the material in this cabinet is a little different from the run-of-the-mill foreign stuff we've seen up to now,\" he said. \"I don't know if you've ever seen the intelligence on what we've got here when you were over at the White House, but before you write up any summaries maybe you should do a little research on the Roswell file.\" I remembered a hot July night fourteen years before at Fort Riley when I was the young intelligence officer after having just been shipped back from Rome. I remembered being hustled into a storage hangar by one of the sentries, a fellow member of the Fort Riley bowling team. What he pointed to under the thick olive tarp that night was also very, very secret, and I held my breath, hoping that what was inside this cabinet wasn't anything like what I saw that night in Kansas, July 6, 1947. I opened the cabinet, and almost immediately my heart sank. **I knew, from looking at the shoebox of tangled wires and the strange cloth, from the visorlike headpiece and the little wafers that looked like Ritz crackers only with broken edges and colored a dark gray, and from an assortment of other items that I couldn't even relate to the shapes and sizes of things I was familiar with, that my life was headed for a big change.**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:9:f63df878d9c4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14952, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "6, 1947.

I heard footsteps outside my door and caught my breath. There were always sounds in the Pentagon at night because the building was never empty. Somewhere, in some office, in parts of the building most people don't even know about, some group is planning for a war we hope we will never fight. General Trudeau peeked his head around the door. \"Look inside?\" he asked. \"What'd you do to me, General?\" I said. \"I thought we were friends.\" \"That's why I gave you this, Phil,\" he said, but he wasn't laughing, wasn't even smiling. \"You know how valuable this property is? You know what any of the other agencies would do to get this into their hands?\" \"They'd probably kill me,\" I said. **\"They probably want to kill you anyway, but this makes them even more rabid. The air force wants it because they think it belongs to them. The navy wants it because they want anything the air force wants. The CIA wants it so they can give it to the Russians.\"** \"I need a plan from you,\" he said. \"Not simply what this property is, but what we can do with it. Something that keeps it out of play until we know what we have and what use we can make of it.\" \"Look, who's our biggest problem?\" I asked, but it was a pro forma question because I already knew the answer. \"The same people who lost Korea for us and who you had to fight over at the White House,\" he said. \"You know exactly who I mean. We got to keep whatever's valuable here from falling into the wrong hands because as sure as we're standing in this Pentagon, it'll find its way right to the Kremlin.\" **There were people floating around Washington right at that very moment who, even out of the most well-meaning intentions they could muster, would have shipped this Roswell file over to Russia while patting President Kennedy on the back and congratulating him for contributing to world peace.** Just as there were people who would", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:10:7dca9dfe34cd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14953, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "keep whatever's valuable here from falling into the wrong hands because as sure as we're standing in this Pentagon, it'll find its way right to the Kremlin.\" **There were people floating around Washington right at that very moment who, even out of the most well-meaning intentions they could muster, would have shipped this Roswell file over to Russia while patting President Kennedy on the back and congratulating him for contributing to world peace.** Just as there were people who would have cut Trudeau's and my throat and left us right on the rug to bleed to death while they packed that file away. Either way, Trudeau didn't have to quote me chapter and verse to explain that he was handing me one of the most important assignments I would ever receive from him. He was giving me the keys to a whole new kingdom, but neither he nor I knew what in the world we could do with this stuff, short of keeping it out of the hands of the Russians. At the very least, that was a start. **Career after career of anyone in government who even hinted at the big dark secret of Roswell was pulverized by whoever was behind this operation.** And, although I knew far more than I had even admitted to myself, I would never be the one to shoot off my mouth. But now this file, what I would eventually call the \"nut file\" to General Trudeau, had come into my possession, and as the ensuing weeks turned into a month, I gradually figured out where some of the puzzle pieces fit. First there were the tiny, clear, single-filament, flexible glasslike wires twisted together through a kind of gray harness as if they were cables going into a junction. They were narrow filaments, thinner than copper wire. As I held the harness of strands up to the light from my desk, I could see an eerie glow coming through them as if they were conducting the faint light and breaking it up into different colors. **When the personnel at the retrieval site in the desert outside of Roswell pulled this piece out of the wreckage of the delta-shaped object, they thought it was some sort of wiring device-a harness is what they said-or maybe some of them thought it was a junction box or electrical relay. But whatever they thought it was, they believed there was nothing like it on this planet.** As I turned the object over in my hand, I figured, from the way the individual filaments flexed back and forth but didn't break and the way they were able to conduct a light beam along their length, they were a wire of some sort. But for what purpose I didn't have a clue. **Then there were the thin two-inch-around matte gray oyster cracker-shaped wafers of a material that looked like plastic", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:11:873ffb260781", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14954, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "there was nothing like it on this planet.** As I turned the object over in my hand, I figured, from the way the individual filaments flexed back and forth but didn't break and the way they were able to conduct a light beam along their length, they were a wire of some sort. But for what purpose I didn't have a clue. **Then there were the thin two-inch-around matte gray oyster cracker-shaped wafers of a material that looked like plastic but had tiny road maps of wires barely raised/etched along the surface.** They were the size of a twenty-five-cent piece, but the etchings on the surface reminded me of squashed insects with their hundred legs spread out at right angles from a flat body. Some were more rounded or elliptical. It was a circuit-anyone could figure that out by 1961, especially when you put it under a magnifying glass-but from the way these wafers were stacked on each other, this was a circuitry unlike any other I'd ever seen. I couldn't figure out how to plug it in and what kind of current it carried, but it was clearly a wire circuitry of a sort that came from a larger board of wafers on board the flying craft. My hand shook ever so slightly as I held these pieces, not because they themselves were scary but because I was awed, just for a few seconds, about the momentous nature of this find. **I was most interested in the file descriptions accompanying a two-piece set of dark elliptical eyepieces as thin as skin. The Walter Reed pathologists said they adhered to the lenses of the extraterrestrial creatures' eyes and seemed to reflect existing light, even in what looked like complete darkness, so as to illuminate and intensify images in the darkness to allow their wearer to pick out shapes.** The reports had said that the pathologists at Walter Reed hospital who autopsied one of these creatures tried to peer through them in the darkness to watch the one or two army sentries and medical orderlies walking down a corridor adjacent to the pathology lab. These figures were illuminated in a greenish orange, depending upon how they moved, but the pathologists could see only their outer shape. And when they got close to each other, their shapes blended into a single form. But they could also see the outlines of furniture and the wall and objects on desktops. Maybe, I thought as I read this report, soldiers could wear a visor that intensified images through the reflection and amplification of available light and navigate in the darkness of a battlefield with as much confidence as if they were walking their sentry posts in broad daylight. But these eyepieces didn't turn night into day, they only highlighted the exterior shapes of things. **There was a dull, grayish-silvery foil-like swatch of cloth among these", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:12:74dec4cf4f17", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14955, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "the wall and objects on desktops.

It was a metallic fiber with physical characteristics that would later be called \"supertenacity,\"** but when I tried to cut it with scissors, the arms just slid right off without making even a nick in the fibers. If you tried to stretch it, it bounced back, but I noticed that all the threads seemed to be going in one direction. When I tried to stretch it widthwise instead of lengthwise, it looked like the fibers had reoriented themselves to the direction I was pulling in. This couldn't be cloth, but it obviously wasn't metal. It was a combination, to my unscientific eye, of a cloth woven with metal strands that had the drape and malleability of a fabric and the strength and resistance of a metal. I was on top of some of the most secret weapons projects at the Pentagon, and we had nothing like this, even under the wish-list category. There was a written description and a sketch of another device, too, like a short, stubby flashlight almost with a self-contained power source that was nothing at all like a battery. The scientists at Wright Field who examined it said they couldn't see the beam of light shoot out of it, but when they pointed the pencil-like flashlight at a wall, they could see a tiny circle of red light, but there was no actual beam from the end of what seemed like a lens to the wall as there would have been if you were playing a flashlight off on a distant object. **When they passed an object in front of the source of the light, it interrupted it, but the beam was so intense the object began smoking. They played with this device a lot before they realized that it was an alien cutting device like a blowtorch.** One time they floated some smoke across the light and suddenly the whole beam took shape. What had been invisible suddenly had a round, microthin, tunnel-like shape to it. **Then there was the strangest device of all, a headband, almost, with electrical-signal pickup devices on either side.** I could figure out no use for this thing whatsoever unless whoever used it did so as a fancy hair band.

It seemed to be a one-size-fits-all headpiece that did nothing, at least not for humans. Maybe it picked up brain waves like an electroencephalogram and projected a chart. But no private experiment conducted on it seemed to do anything at all. The scientists didn't even determine how to plug it in or what its source of power was because it came with no batteries or diagrams. [Back to top.](#12) **MJ-12 and Beyond: How Secret UFO Government Programs Formed** Like the navy, the air force had different advocates for different goals, and so did the army. And when there are competing agendas and strategies articulated by some of the best and brightest people ever to graduate from universities, war colleges, and the ranks of officers, you have hard-nosed people playing high-stakes games against one another for the big prizes: the lion's share of the military budget. And, at the very center of it all, the place where the dollars get spent, are the weapons-development people who work for their respective branches of the military. And within those first few weeks I saw and learned a lot about how the politics of the Roswell discovery had matured over the fourteen years since the crash and since the intense discussions at the White House after Eisenhower became president. **Each of the different branches of the military had been protecting its own cache of Roswell-related files and had been actively seeking to gather as much new Roswell material as possible. Certainly all the services had their own reports from examiners at Walter Reed and Bethesda concerning the nature of the alien physiology. Mine were in my nut file along with the drawings**. It was pretty clear, also, from the way the navy and air force were formulating their respective plans for advanced military-technology hardware, that many of the same pieces of technology in my files were probably shared by the other services. But nobody was bragging because everybody wanted to know what the other guy had. But since, officially, Roswell had never happened in the first place, there was no technology to develop. On the other hand, the curiosity among weapons and intelligence people within the services was rabid. Nobody wanted to come in second place in the silent, unacknowledged alien-technology-development race going on at the Pentagon as each service quietly pursued its version of a secret Roswell weapon. **If you were in the know about what was retrieved from Roswell,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:14:352dc015aab4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14957, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "what the other guy had.

On the other hand, the curiosity among weapons and intelligence people within the services was rabid. Nobody wanted to come in second place in the silent, unacknowledged alien-technology-development race going on at the Pentagon as each service quietly pursued its version of a secret Roswell weapon. **If you were in the know about what was retrieved from Roswell, you kept your ears open for snippets of information about what was being developed by another branch of the military, what was going before the budget committees for funding, or what defense contractors were developing a specific technology for the services. If you weren't in the Roswell loop, but were too curious for your own good, you could be spun around by the swirling rumor mill that the Roswell race had kicked up among competing weapons-development people in the services and wind up chasing nothing more than dust devils that vanished down the halls as soon as you turned the corner on them.** As if the eyes of the other military services weren't enough, we also had to contend with the analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency. Under the guise of coordination and cooperation, the CIA was amalgamating as much power as it could. Information is power, and the more the CIA tried to learn about the army weapons-development program, the more nervous it made all of us at the center of R&D. \"How does the CIA know what we have?\" [I said to General Trudeau.] \"They're guessing, I suppose,\" he said. \"And figuring it out by the process of elimination. Look, everybody suspects what the air force has.\" Trudeau was right. In the rumor bank from which everybody in the Pentagon made deposits and withdrawals, the air force was sitting on the Holy Grail-a spaceship itself and maybe even a live extraterrestrial. Nobody knew for sure. **We knew that after it became a separate branch of the military in 1948, the air force kept some of the Roswell artifacts at Wright Field outside of Dayton, Ohio, because that's where \"the cargo\" was shipped, stopping off in Fort Riley along the way.** But the air force was primarily interested in how things fly, so whatever R&D they worked on was focused on how their planes could evade radar and outfly the Soviets no matter where we got the technology from. \"And,\" he continued, \"I'm sure the agency fellows would love to get into the Naval Intelligence files on Roswell if they've not done so already.\" With its advanced submarine technology and missile-launching nuclear subs, the navy was struggling with its own problem in figuring out what to do about UUOs or USOs-Unidentified Submerged Objects, as they came to be called.

It was a worry in naval circles, particularly as war planners advanced strategies for protracted submarine warfare in the event of a first strike. **Whatever was flying circles around our jets since the 1950s, evading radar at our top-secret missile bases like Red Canyon, which I saw with my own eyes, could plunge right into the ocean, navigate down there just as easy as you please, and surface halfway around the world without so much as leaving an underwater signature we could pick up. Were these USOs building bases at the bottom of oceanic basins beyond the dive capacity of our best submarines, even the Los Angeles-class jobbies that were only on the drawing boards? That's what the chief of Naval Operations had to find out, so the navy was occupied with fighting its own war with extraterrestrial craft in the air and under the sea.** That left the army. **However we were going to camouflage our development of the Roswell technology, it had to be within the existing way we did business so no one would recognize any difference.** We operated on a normal defense development projects budget of well into the billions in 1960, most of it allocated to the analysis of new weapons systems. Just within our own bureau we had contracts with the nation's biggest defense companies with whom we maintained almost daily communication. Luckily enough for me, the whole Roswell story was still unknown outside the highest military circles in 1961. Retired major Jesse Marcel, the intelligence officer at the 509th who had been at the crash site in July 1947 and who had given the initial reports of a spacecraft, would not yet tell his story in public for at least another ten years. Everyone else connected to the incident was either dead or sworn to silence. The air force, which moved quickly to take over management of the Roswell affair and ongoing UFO contacts and sightings, still kept everything they learned highly classified under the Air Force Intelligence Command and waged a push-and-pull war with the CIA for information about sightings and ongoing contacts with anything extraterrestrial. These really weren't my concerns yet, but they would be.

Roger Ramey's staff determined its final disposition and the official government history of the event began to unfold. **In the early hours after the cargo arrived in Texas, there was so much confusion about what was found and what wasn't found that army officers, who were in charge of the entire retrieval operation, quickly scraped together both a cover story and a plan to silence all the military and civilian witnesses to the recovery.** **The cover story was easy. General Ramey ordered Maj. Jesse Marcel to recant his \"flying saucer\" story and pose for a news photo with debris from a weather balloon, which he described as the wreckage the retrieval team recovered from outside Roswell. Marcel followed orders and the flying saucer officially became a weather balloon.** The silencing worked so well that for the next thirty years the story seemed to have been swallowed up by the quiet emptiness of desert where all things are worn down to a fine grade of sameness. But belying the quiet that settled over Roswell, a thousand miles away, part of the U.S. military went on wartime alert as bits and pieces of the craft reached their destinations. **One of those destinations, Lt. Gen. Nathan Twining's desk at Wright Field, was the focal point from which the Roswell artifacts would reach the Foreign Technology desk at the Pentagon.** Among the first of the army's top commands notified of the events unfolding in Roswell in early July would have had to have been Lieutenant General Twining's Air Materiel Command at Wright Field, where the Roswell debris was shipped. Nathan Twining has become important to UFO researchers because of his association with a number of highly secret meetings at the Eisenhower White House having to do with the national security issues posed by the discovery of UFOs and his relationship to National Security Special Assistant Robert Cutler, who was the liaison between the NSC and President Eisenhower when I was on the NSC staff in the 1950s. The silver-haired General Twining was the point man for initial research and dissemination of Roswell-related materials. General Twining had seen the material for himself, and even before he returned to Wright Field, he'd conferred with the rocket scientists who were part of his brain trust at Alamogordo. **Now, during the remainder of the summer months, he quietly compiled a report that he would deliver to President Truman and an ad hoc group of military, government,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:17:f03d88a44881", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14960, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "NSC staff in the 1950s.

Written to the attention of Brig. Gen. George Schulgen, Twining's memo addressed, in the most general of terms, the official Air Materiel Command's intelligence regarding \"flying discs.\" Flying saucers or UFOs are not illusions, Twining says, referring to the sighting of strange objects in the sky as \"something real and not visionary or fictitious.\" Even though he cites the possibility that some of the sightings are only meteors or other natural occurrences, he says that the reports are based upon real sightings of actual objects \"approximating the shape of a disc, of such appreciable size as to be as large as man-made aircraft.\" **Considering that this report was never intended for public scrutiny, especially in 1947, Twining marveled at the aircrafts' operating characteristics and went on record, drawing major conclusions about the material he had and the reports he'd heard or read.** His characterization of the aircrafts' behavior revealed, even weeks after the physical encounter, that those officers in the military who were now running the yet-to-be-code-named extraterrestrial contact project already considered these objects and those entities who controlled them a military threat. He described the aircraft as it had been reported in the sightings: a \"light reflective or metallic surface,\" \"absence of a trail except in those few instances when the object was operating under high performance conditions,\" \"circular or elliptical in shape, flat on bottom and domed on top,\" flights in formation consisting of from \"three to nine objects,\" and no sound except for those instances when \"a substantial rumbling roar was noted.\" The objects moved quickly for aircraft at that time, he noted to General Schulgen, at level flight speeds above three hundred knots. Were the United States to build such an aircraft, especially one with a range of over seven thousand miles, the cost, commitment, administrative and development overhead, and drain on existing high-technology projects required that the entire project should be independent or outside of the normal weapons-development bureaucracy. **In other words, as I interpreted the memo, Twining was suggesting to the commander of the Army Air Force that were the air force, which would become", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:18:aa4679fb0040", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14961, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "flight speeds above three hundred knots.

The descriptions of the supersecret projects at Nellis Air Force Base or Area 51 in the Nevada desert seem to fit the profile of the kind of recommendation that General Twining was making, especially the employment of the \"skunk works\" group at Lockheed in the development of the Stealth fighter and B2 bomber.** Three days after the memo, on September 26, 1947, General Twining gave his report on the Roswell crash and its implications for the United States to President Truman and a short list of officials he convened to begin the management of this top-secret combination of inquiry, police development, and \"ops.\" This working group, which included Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, Dr. Vannevar Bush, Secretary James Forrestal, Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg, Dr. Detlev Bronk, Dr. Jerome Hunsaker, Sidney W. Souers, Gordon Gray, Dr. Donald Menzel, Gen. Robert M. Montague, Dr. Lloyd V. Berkner, and Gen. Nathan Twining himself, became the nucleus for an ongoing fifty-year operation that some people have called **\"Majestic-12.\"** As more information on sightings and encounters came rolling in through every imaginable channel, from police officers taking reports from frightened civilians to airline pilots tracking strange objects in the sky, the group realized that they needed policies on how to handle what was turning into a mass-media phenomenon. They needed a mechanism for processing the thousands of flying saucer reports that could be anything from a real crash or close encounter to a couple of bohunks tossing a pie tin into the air and snapping its picture with their Aunt Harriet's Kodak Brownie. The group also had to assess the threat from the Soviet Union and Iron Curtain countries, assuming of course that flying saucers weren't restricted to North America, and gather intelligence on what kinds of information our allies had on flying saucers as well.

But who would do it? Where would the material reside? And how could the camouflage of what the military was doing be maintained amidst the push for new weapons, competition with the Soviets, and the flying saucer mania that was sweeping the country in the late 1940s? General Twining had a plan for that, too. Just a little over a year after the initial group meetings at the White House, Air Force Intelligence, now that the air force had become a separate service, issued a **December 1948 report-100-203-79-called \"Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the U.S.\" in which UFOs are never referred to as extraterrestrial objects but as elements of \"foreign technology,\" which is actually the subject of the report.** The report, innocuous to most people because it doesn't say that flying saucers came from outer space, is actually one of the first indications showing how the camouflage plan was supposed to work over the ensuing years. The writers of the report had located within the existing military administrative structure the precise place where all research and development into the flying disk phenomenon could be pursued not only under a veil of secrecy but in the very place where no one could be expected to look: **the Foreign Technology desk**. Here, the materials could be deposited for safekeeping within the military while army and air force brass decided what our existing industrial and research technology allowed them to do. There could be fiascoes as weapons failed, secret experiments without fear of exposure, and, most importantly, an ongoing discussion of how the United States could develop this treasure trove of engineering information, all within the very structure where it was supposed to take place. **Just don't call it extraterrestrial; call it \"foreign technology\" and throw it into the hopper with the rest of the mundane stuff the foreign technology officers were supposed to do.** And that's how, twelve years later, the Roswell technology turned up in an old combination-locked military file cabinet carted into my new Pentagon office by two of the biggest enlisted men I'd ever seen.

If we were forced to fight a war in outer space, we would have to understand the nature of the enemy better, especially if it came to preparing the American people for an enemy they had to face.** So investigate first, he suggested, but prepare for the day when the whole undertaking would have to be disclosed. This, Truman could understand. He had trusted Twining to manage this potential crisis from the moment Forrestal had alerted him that the crash had taken place. And Twining had done a brilliant job. He kept the lid on the story and brought back everything that he could under one roof. **He understood as Twining described to him the strangeness of the spacecraft that seemed to have no engines, no fuel, nor any apparent methods of propulsion, yet outflew our fastest fighters; the odd childlike creatures who were inside and how one of them was killed by a gunshot; the way you could see daylight through the inside of the craft even though the sun had not yet risen; the swatches of metallic fabric that they couldn't burn or melt; thin beams of light that you couldn't see until they hit an object and then burned right through it, and on and on; more questions than answers.** It would take years to find these answers, Twining had said, and it was beyond the immediate capacity of our military to do anything about it. This will take a lot of manpower, the general said, and most of the work will have to be done in secret. General Twining showed photographs of these alien beings and autopsy reports that suggested they were too human; they had to be related to our species in some way. They were obviously intelligent and able to communicate, witnesses at the scene had reported, by some sort of thought projection unlike any mental telepathy you'd see at a carnival show. We didn't know whether they came from a planet like Mars in our own solar system or from some galaxy we could barely see with our strongest telescopes. **But they possessed a military technology whose edges we could understand and exploit, even if only for self-defense against the Soviets.** By the middle of September it was obvious to every member of President Truman's working group,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:21:4269196e9b61", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14964, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "some sort of thought projection unlike any mental telepathy you'd see at a carnival show.

Roscoe Hillenkoetter Secretary of Defense James Forrestal Lt. Gen. Nathan Twining of the AAF and then USAF Air Materiel Command Professor Donald Menzel, Harvard astronomer and Naval Intelligence cryptography expert Vannevar Bush, Joint Research and Development Board Chairman Detlev Bronk, Chairman of the National Research Council and biologist who would ultimately be named to the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics Gen. Robert Montague, who was General Twining's classmate at West Point, Commandant of Fort Bliss with operational control over the command at White Sands Gordon Gray, President Truman's Secretary of the Army and chairman of the CIA's Psychological Strategy Board Sidney Souers, Director of the National Security Council Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg, Central Intelligence Group Director prior to Roscoe Hillenkoetter and then USAF Chief of Staff in 1948 Jerome Hunsaker, aircraft engineer and Director of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics Lloyd Berkner, member of the Joint Research and Development Board **It would have to be, General Twining suggested, at the same time both the greatest cover-up and greatest public relations program ever undertaken.** The group agreed that these were the requirements of the endeavor they would undertake. They would form nothing less than a government within the government, sustaining itself from presidential administration to presidential administration regardless of whatever political party took power, and ruthlessly guarding their secrets while evaluating every new bit of information on flying saucers they received. But at the same time, they would allow disclosure of some of the most far-fetched information, whether true or not, because it would help create a climate of public attitude that would be able to accept the existence of extraterrestrial life without a general sense of panic. **\"It will be,\" General Twining said, \"a case where the cover-up is the disclosure and the disclosure is the cover-up. Deny everything, but let the public sentiment take its course. Let skepticism do our work for us until the truth becomes common acceptance.\"** **Meanwhile, the group agreed to establish an information-gathering project, ultimately named Blue Book and managed explicitly by the air force, which would serve public relations purposes by allowing individuals to file reports on flying disk sightings.** While the Blue Book field officers attributed commonplace explanations to the reported sightings, the entire project was a mechanism to acquire photographic records of flying saucer activity for evaluation and research.

The most intriguing sightings that had the highest probability of being truly unidentified objects would be bumped upstairs to the working group for dissemination to the authorized agencies carrying on the research. For my purposes, when I entered the Pentagon, the general category of all flying disk phenomena research and evaluation was referred to simply as \"foreign technology.\" **Project \"Blue Book\" was created to make the general public happy that they had a mechanism for reporting what they saw. Projects \"Grudge\" and \"Sign\" were of a higher security to allow the military to process sightings and encounter reports that couldn't easily be explained away as balloons, geese, or the planet Venus. Blue Fly and Twinkle had other purposes, as did scores of other camouflage projects like Horizon, HARP, Rainbow, and even the Space Defense Initiative, all of which had something to do with alien technology. But no one ever knew it. And when reporters were actually given truthful descriptions of alien encounters, they either fell on the floor laughing or sold the story to the tabloids, who'd print a drawing of a large-headed, almond-eyed, six-fingered alien. Again, everybody laughed. But that's what these things really look like because I saw the one they trucked up to Wright Field.** Meanwhile, as each new project was created and administered, another bread crumb for anyone pursuing the secrets to find, we were gradually releasing bits and pieces of information to those we knew would make something out of it. Flying saucers did truly buzz over Washington, D.C., in 1952, and there are plenty of photographs and radar reports to substantiate it. But we denied it while encouraging science fiction writers to make movies like The Man from Planet X to blow off some of the pressure concerning the truth about flying disks. **This was called camouflage through limited disclosure, and it worked. If people could enjoy it as entertainment, get duly frightened, and follow trails to nowhere that the working group had planted, then they'd be less likely to stumble over what we were really doing. And what were we really doing?** What had started out as a single-purpose camouflage operation was breaking up into smaller units.

Army CIC, once a powerful force to keep the Roswell story itself suppressed, had weakened under the combined encroachments of the CIA and the FBI. It was during this period that my old friend **J. Edgar Hoover, never happy at being kept out of any loop, jumped into the circle and very quietly began investigating the Roswell incident. This shook things up, and very soon afterward, other government agencies-the ones with official reporting responsibilities-began poking around as well.** For all intents and purposes, the original scheme to perpetrate a camouflage was defunct by the late 1950s. **Its functions were now being managed by series of individual groups within the military and civilian intelligence agencies, all still sharing limited information with each other, each pursuing its own individual research and investigation, and each-astonishingly-still acting as if some super intelligence group was still in command. But, like the Wizard of Oz, there was no super intelligence group. Its functions had been absorbed by the groups beneath it. But nobody bothered to tell anyone because a super group was never supposed to exist officially in the first place.** That which did not exist officially could not go out of existence officially. Hence, right through the next forty years, the remnants of what once was a super group went through the motions, but the real activities were carried out by individual agencies that believed on blind faith that they were being managed by higher-ups. So we began to devise a strategy. \"Hypothetically, Phil,\" Trudeau laid the question out. \"What's the best way to exploit what we have without anybody knowing we're doing anything special?\" \"We start the same way this desk has always started: with reports,\" I said. \"I'll write up reports on the alien technology just like it's an intelligence report on any piece of foreign technology.

Nobody will ever know. We won't even tell the companies we're working with where this technology comes from. As far as the world will know the history of the patent is the history of the invention.\" \"It's the perfect cover, Phil,\" the general said. \"Where will you start?\" [Back to top.](#12) **Examining the Alien Bodies ** \"The photographs in my file,\" I began my report that night over the autopsy reports, which I attached, show a being of about 4 feet tall. The body seemed decomposed and the photos themselves aren't of much use except to the curious. It's the medical reports that are of interest. The organs, bones, and skin composition are different from ours. The being's heart and lungs are bigger than a human's. The bones are thinner but seem stronger as if the atoms are aligned differently for a greater tensile strength. The skin also shows a different atomic alignment in a way that appears the skin is supposed to protect the vital organs from cosmic ray or wave action or gravitational forces that we don't yet understand. The overall medical report suggests that the medical examiners are more surprised at the similarities between the being found in the spacecraft (note:** NSC reports refer to this creature as an Extraterrestrial Biological Entity [EBE]) and human beings than they are at the differences, especially the brain which is bigger in the EBE but not at all unlike ours.** If we consider similar biological factors that affect human beings, like long distance runners whose hearts and lungs are larger than average, hill and mountain dwellers whose lung capacity is greater than those who live closer to sea level, and even natural athletes whose long striated muscle alignment is different from", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:25:126254ef6bb8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14968, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 26, "text": "an Extraterrestrial Biological Entity [EBE]) and human beings than they are at the differences, especially the brain which is bigger in the EBE but not at all unlike ours.** If we consider similar biological factors that affect human beings, like long distance runners whose hearts and lungs are larger than average, hill and mountain dwellers whose lung capacity is greater than those who live closer to sea level, and even natural athletes whose long striated muscle alignment is different from those who are not athletes, can we not assume that the EBEs who have fallen into our possession represent the end process of genetic engineering designed to adapt them to long space voyages within an electromagnetic wave environment at speeds which create the physical conditions described by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity? **(Note for the record: Dr. Hermann Oberth suggests we consider the Roswell craft from the New Mexico desert not a spacecraft but a time machine. His technical report on propulsion will follow.)** **The medical report and supporting photographs in front of me suggested that the creature was remarkably well adapted for long-distance space travel.** For example, biological time, the Walter Reed medical examiners hypothesized, must have passed very slowly for the entity because it possessed a very slow metabolism, evidenced, they said, by the enormous capacities of the huge heart and lungs. The physiology of this thing indicated that this was not a creature whose body had to work hard to sustain it. A larger heart, my ME's report read, meant that it took fewer beats than an average human heart to drive the thin, milky, almost lymphatic-like fluid through a limited, more primitive-looking, and apparently reduced-capacity circulatory system. **As a result, the biological clock beat more slowly than a human's and probably allowed the creature to travel great distances in a shorter biological time than humans.** It seemed to them that our atmosphere was quite toxic to the creature's organs. Given the time that passed between the crash of the vehicle and the creature's arrival at Walter Reed, it decomposed all of the organs far more rapidly than it would have decomposed human organs. **This fact particularly impressed me because I had seen one of these things, if not the very one described in the report, suspended in a gel-like substance at Fort Riley.** So whatever exposure it must have had was very minimal by human standards because the medical personnel at the 509th's Walker Field got it into a liquid preservation state very quickly. Nevertheless, the Walter Reed pathologists were unable to determine with any certainty the structure of the creature's heart except to guess that because it functioned as a passive blood-storage facility as well as a pumping muscle that it didn't work the same way as did a four-chambered human heart. They said the alien heart seemed to have had internal diaphragm-like muscles that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:26:67f4e877672e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14969, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "because the medical personnel at the 509th's Walker Field got it into a liquid preservation state very quickly.

They said the alien heart seemed to have had internal diaphragm-like muscles that worked less hard than human heart muscle did because the creatures were meant to survive within a reduced gravity field as we understand gravity. As camels store water, so did this creature store whatever atmosphere it breathed in the large capacity of its lungs. The lungs functioned in ways similar to a camel's humps or to our scuba tanks and released atmosphere very slowly into the creature's system. Because of the large heart and the storage function we believed it had, we also surmised that it took far less breathable atmosphere to sustain the creature, thereby reducing the need for carrying large volumes of atmosphere along on the voyage. Perhaps the aircraft had a means of recirculating its atmosphere, recycling spent or waste air back into the craft. Moreover, because the creatures were only four or so feet tall, the large lungs occupied a far greater percentage of the chest cavity than human lungs did, further impressing the pathologists who examined the creatures' remains. If we believed the heart and lungs seemed bioengineered for long-distance travel so, too, was the creature's skeletal tissue. Although it was in a state of advanced decomposition, the creature's bones looked to the army medical examiners to be fibrous, actually thinner than comparable human bones such as the ribs, sternum, clavicle, and pelvis. **Pathologists speculated that the bones were more flexible than human bones and had a resiliency that might be related to the function of shock absorbers.** More brittle human bones might more easily shatter under the stresses these alien entities must have been routinely subjected to. However, with a flexible skeletal frame, these entities appeared well suited for potential shocks and physical traumas of extreme forces and could withstand the fractures that would cripple human space travelers in a similar environment. There was much speculation from the different medical analysts about what these beings were composed of and what could have sustained them. First of all, doctors were more tantalized by the similarities the creatures shared with us than they were concerned about the differences. Rather than hideous-looking insects or the reptilian man-eaters that attacked Earth in War of the Worlds, these beings looked like little versions of us, only different. It was eerie. **Of specific interest was the fluid that served as blood but also seemed to regulate bodily functions in much the same way glandular secretions do for the human body.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:27:fa22a9b94cea", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14970, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "First of all, doctors were more tantalized by the similarities the creatures shared with us than they were concerned about the differences.

It was eerie. **Of specific interest was the fluid that served as blood but also seemed to regulate bodily functions in much the same way glandular secretions do for the human body. In these biological en-tities, the blood system and lymphatic systems seem to have been combined. And if an exchange of nutrients and waste occurred within their systems, that exchange could have only taken place through the creature's skin or the outer protective covering they wore because there were no digestive or waste systems.** The medical report revealed that the creatures were enclosed within a one-piece protective covering like a jumpsuit or outer skin in which the atoms were aligned so as to provide a great tensile strength and flexibility. One examiner wrote that it reminded him of a spider's web, which appears very fragile but is, in fact, very strong. The unique qualities of a spiderweb result from the alignment of fibers that provide great tenacity because they're able to stretch under great pressure, yet display a resiliency that allows them to snap back into shape even after the shock of an impact. **Similarly, the creature's spacesuit or outer skin appeared to be stretched around it as if it were literally spun over the creature and seized up around it, providing a perfect skin-tight protective fit. The doctors had never seen anything like it before.** The lengthwise alignment of the fibers in the suit also prompted the medical analysts to suggest that the suit might have been capable of protecting the wearer against the low-energy cosmic rays that would routinely bombard any craft during a space journey. The interior organs of the creature seemed so fragile and oversized that the Walter Reed medical analysts imagined that without the suit the entity would have been vulnerable to the cumulative physical trauma from a constant energy particle bombardment. Space travel without protection from subatomic particle bombardment might subject the traveler to the same kind of effects he'd experience if he were cooked in a microwave oven. The particle bombardment inside the craft, if heavy enough to constitute a shower, would so excite and accelerate the creature's atomic structure that the resulting heat energy would literally cook the entity up. The Walter Reed doctors were also fascinated by the nature of the creature's inner skin. It resembled, although their preliminary reports didn't go into any chemical analysis, a thin layer of fatty tissue unlike any they'd ever seen before. And it was completely permeable, as if it were constantly exchanging chemicals back and forth with the combination blood/lymphatic system.

And it was completely permeable, as if it were constantly exchanging chemicals back and forth with the combination blood/lymphatic system. Was this the way the creatures nourished themselves during their journeys and was this how waste was processed? The very small mouths and the lack of a human digestive system troubled the doctors at first because they didn't know how these things were sustained. But their hypothesis that they processed chemicals released from their skin and maybe even recirculated waste chemicals would have explained the lack of any food-preparation or waste-processing facilities on the craft. **I speculated, however, that they didn't require food or facilities for waste disposal because they weren't actual life-forms, only a kind of robot or android.** Another explanation, of course, suggested by the engineers at Wright Field, is that there would have been no need for food-preparation facilities had this craft been only a small scout ship that didn't venture far from a larger craft. The creatures' low metabolism meant that they could survive extended periods away from the main craft by subsisting on some form of military prepackaged foods until they returned to base. Neither the Wright Field engineers nor the Walter Reed medical examiners had an explanation for the lack of waste disposal on board the craft, nor could they explain how the creatures' waste was processed. Maybe I was speculating too far about robots or androids when I was writing my report for General Trudeau, but I kept thinking, also, that the skin analysis that I was reading sounded more akin to the skin of a houseplant than the skin of a human being. That, too, could have been another explanation for the lack of food or waste facilities. Much credence also was given to the firsthand descriptions of on-scene witnesses who said they received impressions from the dying creature that it was suffering and in great pain. No one heard the creature make any sounds, so any impressions, Army Intelligence personnel assumed, would have to have been created through some type of empathic projection or outright mental telepathy. **But witnesses said they heard no \"words\" in their mind, only the resonance of a shared or projected impression much simpler than a sentence but far more complex because they were able to share with the creature a sense not only of suffering but of profound sadness, as if it were in mourning for the others who perished on board the craft.

These witness reports intrigued me more than any other information we took from the crash site.** **Where the possibility of some evidence about the workings of the alien brains did exist was in what I referred to in my reports as the \"headbands.\"** Among the artifacts we retrieved were devices that looked something like headbands but had neither adornment nor decoration of any kind. Embedded by some very advanced kind of vulcanizing process into a form of flexible plastic were what we now know to have been electrical conductors or sensors, similar to the conductors on an electroencephalograph or polygraph. This band was fitted around the part of the alien cranium just above the ears where the skull began to expand to accommodate the large brain. At the time, the field reports from the crash and the subsequent analysis at Wright Field indicated that the engineers at the Air Materiel Command thought these might be communication devices, like the throat mikes our pilots wore during World War II. But, as I would find out when I evaluated the device and sent it into the market for reverse-engineering, this was a throat mike only in a way that a primitive stylus can be considered the forerunner of the color laser-imaging printer. Suffice it to say that in the few hours the material was at Walker Field in Roswell, more than one officer at the 509th gingerly slipped this thing over his head and tried to figure out what it did. At first it did nothing. **There were no buttons, no switches, no wires, nothing that could even be considered to have been a control panel. So no one knew how to turn it on or off.** Moreover, the band was not really adjustable, though it had enough elasticity to have been one-size-fits-all for the creatures whose skulls were large enough to accommodate them. However, the reports I read stated, the few officers whose heads were just large enough to have made contact with the full array of conductors got the shocks of their lives. In their descriptions of the headband, these officers reported everything from a low tingling sensation inside their heads to a searing headache and a brief array of either dancing or exploding colors on the insides of their eyelids as they rotated the device around their head and brought the sensors into contact with different parts of their skull. **These eyewitness reports suggested to me that the sensors stimulated different parts of the brain", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:30:f5da23afdc84", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14973, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "conductors got the shocks of their lives.

Perhaps these headband devices comprised the pilot interface of the ship's navigational and propulsion system combined with a long-range communications device. At first I didn't know, but it was only when we began development of the long brain-wave research project toward the end of my tenure at the Pentagon that I realized just what we had and how it might be developed. **It took a long time to harvest this technology, but fifty years after Roswell, versions of these devices eventually became a component of the navigational control system for some of the army's most sophisticated helicopters and will soon be on the American consumer electronics market as user-input devices for personal computer games.** The first Army Air Force analysts and engineers both at the 509th and at Wright Field were also bedeviled by the lack of any traditional controls and propulsion system in the crashed vehicle. Looking at their reports and the artifacts from the perspective of 1961, however, I imagined that the keys to understanding what made the craft go and directed its flight lay not only within the craft itself but in the relationship between the pilots and the craft. If we hypothesized a brain-wave guidance system that was as specific to the pilots' electronic signature as it was to the spacecraft's, then we were looking at an entirely revolutionary concept of guided flight in which the pilot was the system. Imagine transportation devices in which the key to the ignition is a digitized code derived from your electroencephalographic signature and is read automatically upon your donning some sort of sensorized headband. **That's the way I believed the spacecraft was navigated, by direct interaction between the electronic waves generated within the minds of the pilots and the craft's directional controls. The electronic brain signals were interpreted and transmitted by the headband devices, which served as interfaces.** [Back to top.](#12) ** Investigating the Recovered Craft** When the air force became a separate branch of the service, the remaining bodies, stored at Wright, along with the spacecraft, were sent to Norton Air Force Base in California, where the air force began experiments to replicate the technology of the vehicle.

This made sense. The air force cared about the flight capabilities of the craft and how to build defenses against it. **Experiments were carried out at Norton and ultimately at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, at the famous Groom Lake site where the Stealth technology was developed.** The army cared only for the weapons systems aboard the craft and how they could be reengineered for our own use. The original Roswell spacecraft remained at Norton, however, where the air force and CIA maintained a kind of alien technology museum, the final resting place of the Roswell spacecraft. But experiments in replicated alien craft continued to be carried on through the years as engineers tried to adapt the propulsion and navigation systems to our level of technology. This continues to this very day, almost in plain sight for people with security clearance who are taken to where the vehicles are kept. Over the years, the replicated vehicles have become an ongoing, inner-circle saga among top-ranking military officers and members of the government, especially the favored senators and members of the House who vote along military lines. **Those who are shown the secrets are immediately bound by national secrecy legislation and cannot reveal what they saw. Thus, the official camouflage is maintained despite the large number of people who really know the truth.** I admit I've never seen the craft at Norton with my own eyes, but enough reports passed across my desk during my years at Foreign Technology so that I knew what the secret was and how it was maintained. **There were no conventional technological explanations for the way the Roswell craft's propulsion system operated. There were no atomic engines, no rockets, no jets, nor any propeller-driven form of thrust.** Those of us in R&D from all three branches of the service tried for years to adapt the craft's drive system to our own technology, but, through the 1960s and 1970s, fell short of getting it operational. The craft was able to displace gravity through the propagation of magnetic wave, controlled by shifting the magnetic poles around the craft so as to control, or vector, not a propulsion system but the repulsion force of like charges.

The air force discovered that the entire vehicle functioned just like a giant capacitor. In other words, the craft itself stored the energy necessary to propagate the magnetic wave that elevated it, allowed it to achieve escape velocity from the earth's gravity, and enabled it to achieve speeds of over seven thousand miles per hour. The pilots weren't affected by the tremendous g-forces that build up in the acceleration of conventional aircraft because to aliens inside, it was as if gravity was being folded around the outside of the wave that enveloped the craft. Maybe it was like traveling inside the eye of a hurricane. But how did the pilots interface with the wave form they were generating? I reported to General Trudeau that the secret to this system could be found in the single-piece skin-tight coveralls spun around the creatures. The lengthwise atomic alignment of the strange fabric was a clue to me that somehow the pilots became part of the electrical storage and generation of the craft itself. **They didn't just pilot or navigate the vehicle; they became part of the electrical circuitry of the vehicle, vectoring it in a way similar to the way you order a voluntary muscle to move. The vehicle was simply an extension of their own bodies because it was tied into their neurological systems in ways that even today we are just beginning to utilize.** So the creatures were able to survive extended periods living inside a high-energy wave by becoming the primary circuit in the control of the wave. They were protected by their suits, which enclosed them head to feet, but their suits enabled them to become one with the vehicle, literally part of the wave. In 1947 this was a technology so new to us that it was as frightening as it was frustrating. **If we could only develop the power source necessary to generate a consistently well-defined magnetic wave around a vehicle, we could harness a technology which would have surpassed all forms of rocket and jet propulsion.

It's a process we're still trying to master today, fifty years after the craft fell into our possession.** I had found the puzzle pieces for a whole new age of technology. Things that were only twinkles in the minds of engineers and scientists were right here in front of me as hard, cold artifacts of an advanced culture. Craft that navigated by brain waves and floated on a wave of electromagnetic energy, creatures who look through devices that helped them turn night into day, and beams of light so narrow and focused you couldn't see them until they bounced off an object far away. For years scientists had thought about what it would have been like to travel in space, especially since the Russians first put up their Sputnik. Plans for a military-operated moon base had been developed by the army in the 1950s under the leadership of Gen. Arthur Trudeau at R&D but were ultimately shelved because of the formation of NASA. Those plans had tried to confront the issues of space travel for prolonged periods of time and adjusting to a low-gravity state on the moon. **But here, right in front of us, was the evidence of how an alien culture had adapted itself to long-range space travel, different gravities, and the exposure to energy particles and waves crashing into a spacecraft by the billions.** All we had to do was marshal the vast array of resources in the military and industry at R&D's disposal and harvest that technology. It was all laid out for us, if we knew how to use it. This was the beginning and I was right there on the cusp of it. Roswell Spacecraft Questions and Overview • The crescent-shaped space vehicle also had no traditional navigational controls as we understood them. There were no control sticks, wheels, throttles, pedals, cables, flaps, or rud-ders. How did the creatures pilot this ship and how did they control the speed, accelerating from a near stationary hover above a given spot, like a helicopter, to speeds in excess of seven thousand miles per hour in a matter of seconds? • What protected the creatures from the tremendous g-forces they would have had to have pulled in any conventional aircraft?

Our own pilots in World War II had to wear special devices as they pulled up out of dives that kept the oxygen from flowing out of their brains and causing them to black out. But we found nothing in the flight suits of the creatures that indicated that they faced the same problem. Yet their craft should have pulled ten times the g-forces our own pilots did, so we couldn't figure out how they managed this. • No controls, no protection, no power supply, no fuel: these were the riddles I listed. Alongside them I listed that: • The craft itself was an electrical circuit. • That the flight suits-\"flight skins\" is a better description-the creatures wore were made of a substance whose atomic structure was elongated, strengthened lengthwise, so as to provide a directional flow to any current applied to it. **The engineers who first discovered this were amazed at the pure conductivity of these skins, functionally like the skin of the craft itself, and their obvious ability to protect the wearer while at the same time vectoring some kind of electronic field. Where was the physical junction of the circuit between the pilot and the ship? Was it turned on and off somehow by the pilot himself through a switch we didn't know about?** Alongside the riddle of the apparent absence of navigational controls I listed the sensorized headband that so intrigued the officers at Roswell's Walker Field and fascinated me as well. If, as we all suspected, this device picked up the electronic signatures from the creatures' oversized brains, what did it do with them? I believed- and our industrial product development from the 1960s through today as the brain-wave-control helmets finally came into service ultimately confirmed-that these headbands translated the brain's electronic signals into system commands that controlled speed, direction, and elevation. Maybe the headbands had to be calibrated or tuned to each individual pilot, or maybe the pilots- since I believed they were genetically engineered beings biologically manufactured especially for flight or long-term exploration-had to be calibrated to the headband. Either way, the headbands were the interface between the pilot and the ship. But that still didn't resolve the question of the lack of cables, gears, or wires. Maybe the answer lay not in the lack of structural controls but in the way the suit, the headband, the creatures' brains, and the entire craft worked together. In other words, when I looked at the possible function of the entire system, the synchronicity between the brain interface in the headband, the pure conductivity of the spacecraft,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:35:012fe2c87033", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14978, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 36, "text": "the interface between the pilot and the ship.

In other words, when I looked at the possible function of the entire system, the synchronicity between the brain interface in the headband, the pure conductivity of the spacecraft, and the elongated structure of the space skins, which also acted like a circuit, I could see how directional instructions could have been translated by the headbands into some form of current flowing through the skins. Nikola Tesla, kept bubbling up in the conversation because the scientists examining the damaged craft described the way it must have converted an electromagnetic field into an antigravity field. And, of course, the craft itself reminded them of the German experimental fighter aircraft that made their appearance near the end of the war but that had been in development ever since the 1930s. Tesla and a number of other European scientists had been pioneers in the conversion of circumscribed small-area antigravity fields out of electromagnetic fields. However, the effort to develop true antigravity aircraft never came to fruition among conventional aircraft manufacturers because gasoline, jet, and rocket engines provided a perfectly good weapons technology. But the theory of electromagnetic antigravity propulsion was not unknown even if it was not well understood and, without a power source like a small portable nuclear fission generator, not at all feasible. But, what if the flying craft already carried enough electric potential and storage capacity to retain its power, just like a very advanced flying battery? Then it might have all the power it needed to propagate and vector a wave directionally by shifting its magnetic poles. In my notes to General Trudeau, I reviewed for him all the technological implications that I believed were relevant in any discussion about what could be harvested from the Roswell craft. I also wrote up what I understood about the magnetic field technology and how unconventional designers and engineers had drafted prototypes for these \"antigravs\" earlier in the century. **All of this pointed in one direction, I suggested: that we now had a craft and could farm out to industry the components that comprised this electromagnetic antigravity drive and brain-wave-directed navigational controls.** We had to dole them out piecemeal once we broke them down into developable units, each of which could have its own engineering track.

These were scientists who routinely worked with our prime defense contractors and could tell us whom to approach in their R&D divisions for secure and private consultations. I know that my reports were read by the higher-ups in the military because top-secret research has continued right through to the present on a whole range of designs and propulsion systems from the Stealth fighter and bomber to prototypes for a very high altitude suborbital interceptor aircraft, developed at Nellis and Edwards, now on the drawing board, which can hover in place and fly at speeds over seven thousand miles per hour. Once I finished my report on the opportunities we could possibly derive from the EBEs and the craft, **I turned my attention to compiling a short list of immediate opportunities I believed achievable by the Army R&D's Foreign Technology Division from a reverse-engineering of items retrieved from the crash. Each of these artifacts, as a direct result of Army R&D's intervention, helped spawn an entire technological industry from which came new products and military weapons.** Among the Roswell artifacts and the questions and issues that arose from the Roswell crash, on my preliminary list that needed resolution for development scheduling or simple inquiries to our military scientific community were: 1. Image intensifiers, which ultimately became \"night vision\" 2. Fiber optics 3. Supertenacity fibers 4. Lasers 5. Molecular alignment metallic alloys 6. Integrated circuits and microminiaturization of logic boards 1 minute left in chapter 7. HARP (High Altitude Research Project) 8. Project Horizon (moon base) 9.

Electromagnetic propulsion systems 14. Depleted uranium projectiles General Trudeau also had relationships with the army contractors who were developing new weapons systems for the military within one part of the company while another part was harvesting some of the same technology for consumer products development. **These were companies-Bell Labs, IBM, Monsanto, Dow, General Electric, and Hughes-that General Trudeau wanted to talk to about the list of technological products that we'd compiled from our R&D Roswell nut file.** \"You begin calling our scientist friends,\" General Trudeau announced. \"And make whatever appointments you want.\" [Back to top.](#12) **Surveilling Extraterrestrial Activity and Secret Moon Programs** Our only successes in defending against them, back in the late 1950s and early 1960s, occurred when we were able to get a firm tracking radar lock.

Then when we locked our targeting radars on, the signals that missiles were supposed to follow to the target, it somehow interfered with their navigational ability and the vehicle's flight became erratic. If we were especially fortunate and able to boost the signal before they broke away, we could actually bring them down. Sometimes we actually got lucky enough to score a hit with a missile before the UFO could take any evasive action, which an army air defense battalion did with an antiaircraft missile near Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany in May 1974. The spacecraft managed to crash-land in a valley. The craft was retrieved and flown back to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. **The Roswell crash was different. There was much speculation that it was a combination of the desert lightning storm and our persistent tracking radars at Alamogordo and the 509th that helped bring down the alien vehicle over the New Mexico desert in 1947.** We did not know their motives, but could only assume the worst and, therefore, needed to defend ourselves however we could. While never disclosing it publicly, military intelligence analysts supported the view that Earth was already under some form of probing attack by one or more alien cultures who were testing both our ability and resolve to defend ourselves. Without ever directly addressing whether contacts between the aliens and Earth governments had already taken place-because the notes and minutes of the Hillenkoetter working group were never released to the Chiefs of Staff or to their intelligence officers. At the same time, the civilian leaders of the nation's space program at NASA decided that military intelligence was overreacting to the shadowing and buzzing of our spacecraft. NASA, which had been holding as highly confidential any reports of extraterrestrial activity surrounding our space vehicles, nevertheless decided to adopt an internal official \"wait and watch\" attitude because they believed that it would have been impossible to launch an explicitly military defensive space program and still achieve the civilian scientific aims at the same time. **So NASA agreed to go covert. As a cover, NASA, in 1961, agreed to cooperate with military planners to work a \"second-tier\" space program within and covered up by the civilian scientific missions.** They agreed to open up a confidential \"back-channel\" communications link to military intelligence regarding any hostile activities conducted by the EBEs against our spacecraft even if these included only shadowing or surveillance.

I was aware of this through my contacts in the military intelligence community. **What NASA didn't tell military intelligence, of course, was that they already had an even more classified back channel to the Hillenkoetter working group and were keeping them updated on every single alien spacecraft appearance the astronauts reported, especially during the early series of Apollo flights when the EBE craft began buzzing the lunar modules on successive missions after they thrusted out of earth orbit.** Even though military intelligence was kept out of the operational loop between NASA and the working group, I and a few others still had contacts in the civilian intelligence community that kept us informed. And the army and air force managed to find at least 122 photos taken by astronauts on the moon that showed some evidence of an alien presence. It was a startling find and was one of many reasons that the Reagan administration pushed so hard for the Space Defense Initiative in 1981. **In 1960, upon the confidential approval of the working group and at the request of the National Security Agency, which was concerned about the vulnerability of its U2 flights, NASA agreed to allow some of its missions to become covers for military surveillance satellites.** These satellites, although approved for surveillance of Soviet ICBM activity, were also supposed to spot alien activity in remote portions of the earth. Maybe, in the 1960s, we didn't have the technology we have now to intercept their ships, but by using new satellite surveillance techniques we believed we'd be able to pick up the signatures of an alien presence on the face of our planet. If we made it too difficult for them to set up shop with bases on Earth, military intelligence planners speculated, maybe they would simply go away. **This was another example of how Cold War strategy was utilized for the dual purpose of trying to surveil extraterrestrial activity under the cover of surveilling Soviet activity.** Project Horizon and Project Moon Base \"I envision expeditious development of the proposal to establish a lunar outpost to be of critical importance to the U.S. Army of the future.

It was the army's most ambitious response to the threat from extraterrestrials and, by the time I arrived at the Pentagon, it was one of the projects that General Trudeau had handed off to me to get moving.** **The army conceived of the development of a moon base as an endeavor similar to the building of the atomic bomb: a vast amount of resources applied to one particular mission, complete secrecy about the nature of the mission, and a crash program to complete the mission before the end of the next decade.** He said that the establishment of the outpost should be a special project having authority and priority similar to the Manhattan Project in World War II. Once established, the lunar base would be operated under the control of a unified space command, which was an extension of current military command-and-control policy, and still is. Space, specifically an imaginary sphere of space encompassing the earth and the moon, would be considered a military theater governed by whatever military rules were in force at that time. The first two astronauts, the spearhead of the scouting crew, were scheduled to touch down on the lunar surface in April 1965, in an area near the lunar equator where, according to the surveys, the army believed the terrain would support multiple landing and liftoff facilities and the construction of a cylindrical, ranch-house type of structure with tubular walls built beneath the surface into a crevice that would house an initial twelve personnel. The bulk of the construction materials for the lunar outpost, about 300,000 pounds, would already be on the site, having been transported there over the previous three months. According to the army plan, an additional 190,000 pounds of cargo would be sent to the moon from April 1965 through November 1966. And from December 1966 through December 1967, another 266,000 pounds of cargo and supplies would be scheduled to arrive at the now operational moon base. **It is April 1965, and a lunar vehicle with a crew of two astronauts has just touched down on the moon's surface.** Although the vehicle has an immediate liftoff capability to return the astronauts to Earth, their scouting from orbit has determined that the area is safe and that there are no threats from either the Soviets or any extraterrestrials.

By July 1965, the first crew of nine men arrive to begin laying the cylindrical tubes in the crevice beneath the surface and install the two portable atomic reactors that will power the entire outpost. A number of factors influenced the army's decision to sink the main structures beneath the lunar surface. The most important of these were the uniform temperatures, the insulation of the lunar surface material itself, protection from a potentially hazardous shower of small meteors and meteorites, camouflage and security, and protection from the kinds of radiation particles that are normally prevented from reaching Earth by our atmosphere. **These facilities begin the surveillance of Earth, establish our military presence by the emplacement of fortified positions on the moon, and begin the first scientific experiments and exploration.** In Phase VI, based upon the success of the permanent outpost and the exploration of the lunar terrain, the army planned to expand the outpost with more landings and additional facilities and report on the results of biological and chemical testing and the first attempts to exploit the moon as a commercial entity. **The army also believed, because that was the way we in R&D believed we could pay back the enormous development overhead we incurred, that by commercially exploiting the moon, perhaps through the same kind of federal land-leasing deals the Department of the Interior currently grants for oil and mineral exploration, we could put the billions of dollars spent back into the federal coffers.** If the preliminary basic space station were successful, the army envisioned a more elaborate, sophisticated facility that would have its own scientific and military mission and serve as a relay station for crews on their way to or from the lunar outpost. This station would have an enhanced military capability and enable the United States to dominate the airspace over its enemies, blind its enemies' satellites, and shoot down its missiles. The army also saw the enhanced orbiting space station as another component in an elaborate defense against extraterrestrials, especially if the military were able to develop high-energy lasers and the particle-beam weapon we had seen aboard the Roswell spacecraft. The space station would, according to the army plan, effectively provide the platform for testing Earth-to-space weapons, and these, General Trudeau and I agreed, would be primarily directed against the hostile extraterrestrials who were the real threat to our planet.

In its plan for a separate administration and management structure within the structure of the army, Project Horizon was designed to be the largest research, development, and deployment operation in the army's history. Larger than the Manhattan Project, Horizon could easily have become a completely separate unit within the army itself. As such, Horizon was perceived as an immediate threat to the other branches of the military as well as to the civilian space agencies. The navy had its own pet plan for establishing undersea bases that would harvest the commercial and scientific opportunities at the bottom of the oceans while at the same time, and more importantly, establishing an antisubmarine defense that would counter the threat from Soviet nuclear submarines. We suspected that the navy plans, like our own plans for a moon base, also gave the navy the capability of carrying out surveillance tracking of unidentified undersea objects if, in fact, that's what the EBEs were sending to Earth. However, as hard as we tried to get Project Horizon into full funding and development, we were stopped. The nation's space program had become the property of the civilian space agency, and NASA had its own agenda and its own schedule for space exploration. We were successful in discrete projects like Corona, but it would not relinquish to the army the control necessary to establish a moon base under the terms of a Project Horizon. I became General Trudeau's point man for the project in Washington. I was able to lobby for it, and Horizon also became an effective cover for all of the technological development I was overseeing out of the Roswell file. After his first full year in office, President Kennedy also saw the value in Project Horizon even though he was in no position to dismantle NASA or order NASA to cede control to the army for the development of a base on the moon. But I think we eventually made our point to the President because he ultimately saw the value in a moon base.

We came to a meeting of the minds that day. I know that I convinced him that the official intelligence the President was receiving through his agencies was not only faulty, it was deliberately flawed. Robert Kennedy began to see that those of us over at the Pentagon were not just a bunch of old soldiers looking for a war. He saw that we really did see a threat and that the United States was truly compromised by Soviet penetration of our most secret agencies. We didn't talk about Roswell or any aliens. **I never told him about extraterrestrials, but I was able to convince him that if the Soviets got to the moon before we did, victory in the Cold War might just belong to them by the end of this decade. Bobby Kennedy suspected that there was another agenda to the army's desire to deploy a lunar outpost for military as well as for scientific and commercial purposes and, without ever acknowledging that agenda, promised that he would talk about it with the President.** I can only tell you that it was a mark of achievement for me personally when President John Kennedy announced to the nation shortly after my meeting with Bobby at the Justice Department that it was one of his goals that the United States put a manned expedition on the moon before the end of the 1960s. He got it! The way history turned out, it was our lunar expeditions, one after the other throughout the 1960s, that not only caught the world's attention but showed all our enemies that the United States was determined to stake out its territory and defend the moon. Nobody was looking for an out-and-out war, especially the EBEs who tried to scare us away from the moon and their own base there more times than even I know. They buzzed our ships, interfered with our communications, and sought to threaten us by their physical presence. But we continued and persevered. Ultimately, we reached the moon and sent enough manned expeditions to explore the lunar surface that they effectively challenged the EBEs for control over our own skies and sphere of space, the very sphere General Trudeau was talking about in the Project Horizon memoranda ten years earlier.

[Back to top.](#12) **Transistors** Just a few years shy of the midpoint of the century, the computer itself was the product of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century thinking and technology. In fact, given the shortcomings of the radio tube and the enormous power demands and cooling requirements to keep the computer working, the development of the computer seemed to have come to a dead end. Although IBM and Bell Labs were investing huge sums of development money into designing a computer that had a lower operational and maintenance overhead, it seemed, given the technology of the digital computer circa 1947, that there was no place it could go. It was simply an expensive-to-build, expensive-to-run, lumbering elephant at the end of the line. And then an alien spacecraft fell out of the skies over Roswell, scattered across the desert floor, and in one evening everything changed. In 1948 the first junction transistor-a microscopically thin silicon sandwich of n-type silicon, in which some of the atoms have an extra electron, and p-type silicon, in which some of the atoms have one less electron-was devised by physicist William Shockley. The invention was credited to Bell Telephone Laboratories, and, as if by magic, the dead end that had stopped the development of the dinosaur-like ENIAC generation of computers melted away and an entirely new generation of miniaturized circuitry began. Where the radio-tube circuit required an enormous power supply to heat it up because heat generated the electricity, the transistor required very low levels of powers and no heating-up time because the transistor amplified the stream of electrons that flowed into its base. Because it didn't rely on a heat source to generate current and it was so small, many transistors could be packed into a very small space, allowing for the miniaturization of circuitry com-ponents. Finally, because it didn't burn out like the radio tube, it was much more reliable. Thus, within months after the Roswell crash and the first exposure of the silicon-wafer technology to companies already involved in the research and development of computers, the limitations on the size and power of the computer suddenly dropped like the removal of a roadblock on a highway and the next generation of computers", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:44:d00ab388be4d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14987, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 45, "text": "into a very small space, allowing for the miniaturization of circuitry com-ponents.

Thus, within months after the Roswell crash and the first exposure of the silicon-wafer technology to companies already involved in the research and development of computers, the limitations on the size and power of the computer suddenly dropped like the removal of a roadblock on a highway and the next generation of computers went into development. This set up for Army R&D, especially during the years I was there, the opportunity for us to encourage that development with defense contracts calling for the implementation of integrated-circuit devices into subsequent generations of weapons systems. **More than one historian of the microcomputer age has written that no one before 1947 foresaw the invention of the transistor or had even dreamed about an entirely new technology that relied upon semiconductors, which were silicon based and not carbon based like the Edison incandescent tube. Bigger than the idea of a calculating machine or an Analytical Engine or any combination of the components that made up the first computers of the 1930s and 1940s, the invention of the transistor and its natural evolution to the silicon chip of integrated circuitry was beyond what anyone could call a quantum leap of technology.** The development of the silicon transistor seemed to come upon us in a matter of months. And, had I not seen the silicon wafers from the Roswell crash with my own eyes, held them in my own hands, talked about them with Hermann Oberth, Wernher von Braun, or Hans Kohler, and heard the reports from these now dead scientists of the meetings between Nathan Twin-ing, Vannevar Bush, and researchers at Bell Labs, I would have thought the invention of the transistor was a miracle. I know now how it came about. **It was as if from the year 1947 to 1980 a fundamental paradigm shift in the ability of humankind to process information took place.** Computers themselves almost became something like a silicon-based life-form, inspiring the carbon-based life-forms on planet Earth to develop them, grow them, and even help them reproduce. With computer-directed process-control programs now in place in virtually all major industries, software that writes software, neural-network-based expert systems that learn from their own experience in the real world, and current experiments under way to grow almost microscopically thin silicon-based chips in the weightless environment of earth orbit may be the forerunner of a time when automated orbital factories routinely grow and harvest new silicon material for microprocessors more sophisticated than we can even imagine at the present.

Once implanted successfully on Earth, our culture having reached a point of readiness through its development of the first digital computers, would not the natural development stream, starting from the invention of the transistor, have carried us to the point where we achieve a symbiotic relationship with the silicon material that carries our data and enables us to become more creative and successful? General Trudeau and I had quickly established our routine in early 1961, and our categorization of how we did our jobs seemed to be working. **Night vision was under development at Fort Belvoir, and researchers who worked with us had made sure that the silicon wafer chips had gotten to their colleagues at Bell Labs and assured us that a new generation of transistorized circuitry was already finding its way into development. The silicon chips were a covert reintroduction to the people at Bell Labs because the initial introduction of the integrated-circuit chips from the Roswell crash had reached defense contractors as early as 1947 in the weeks after the material reached Wright Field.** **A similar history of introduction and reintroduction had occurred with stimulated-energy radiation, a weapon the early analysts believed they were looking at in the wreckage of the Roswell craft.** Since directed-energy radiation was a technology we'd already deployed in World War II, seeing what they thought was a superad-vanced version of that technology, so advanced as to be in a completely different realm, so excited the analysts at Wright Field that they wanted to get it out to research scientists as quickly as possible, which they did. And by the early 1950s, a version of stimulated-energy radiation had found its way into the scientific community, which was developing new products around the process of microwave generation. [Back to top.](#12) **Lasers** **The retrieval team that pulled the wreckage out of the desert also found a short, stubby, internally powered flashlight device that threw a pencil-thin, intense beam of light for a short distance that could actually cut through metal.** This, the engineers at Wright Field believed, was also based on wave stimulation. The questions then were, how did the EBEs use wave stimulation and how could we adapt it to military uses or slip it into the product development already under way?

By 1954, when I was at the White House, the National Security Council was already receiving reports of a theory, developed by Charles H. Townes, that described how the atoms of a gas could be excited to extraordinarily high energy levels by the application of bursts of energy. The gas would release its excess energy as microwaves of a very precise frequency that could be controlled. In theory, we thought, the energy beam could be a signal to carry communications or an amplifier for the signal. When the first maser was assembled at Bell Laboratories in 1956, it was used as a timer because of the very exact calibration of the wave frequency. **The maser, however, was only a forerunner of the product that was to come, the laser, which would revolutionize every aspect of technology it touched. Where the maser was an amplification of generated microwaves, the laser was an amplification of light, and theories about how this might be accomplished were circulating widely throughout the weapons-development community even before Bell Labs produced the first maser.** I had seen the descriptions of the EBE laser in reports about the Roswell crash, a beam of light so thin that you couldn't even see it until it landed on a target. What was the purpose of this light generator? the Alamogordo group had asked. It looked like a targeting or communications device, seemed to have an almost limitless range, and, if the right power source could be found to amplify the light beam to where it could penetrate metal, the device could be used as a drill, a welder, or even a devastating weapon. **Even while I was at the White House, all three branches of the military were working with researchers in university laboratories to develop a working laser.** In theory, exciting the atoms of an element to produce light energy in the same way that atoms of a gas were excited to produce microwaves, lasers offered the tantalizing promise of a directed-energy beam that had such a wide variety of applications it could become an almost universal utility for all divisions of the military, even controlling warehouse inventory for the Quartermaster Corps. Finally, in 1958, the year after I left the White House, there was a surge in research activity, especially at Columbia University where, two years later, physicist Theodore Maiman constructed the first working laser. >The first practical demonstration of the laser took place in 1960, and by the time I got to the Pentagon, General Trudeau had put it on our list", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:47:322fe67b6d6e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14990, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 48, "text": "an almost universal utility for all divisions of the military, even controlling warehouse inventory for the Quartermaster Corps.

Also, because stimulated-energy radiation devices were among the cache of technological debris we recovered from Roswell, the U.S. development of the laser encompassed the special urgent requirements of my Roswell mission. **I had to write a report to General Trudeau suggesting ways the EBEs might have used laser technology in their missions on this planet and how we could develop similar uses for it under the guise of a conventional development program. In other words, once we guessed how the aliens were using it, it was to become our developmental model for similar applications.** **We believed that the EBEs used lasers for navigation, by bouncing beams off distant objects in space and homing in on them to triangulate a course; for communication, by using the laser beam as a carrier signal or as a signal in and of itself; for surveillance, by painting potential targets with a beam; and for power transmission, illumination, and even data storage.** The strength and integrity of the laser beam should have served as the EBEs' primary method of communication over vast distances or even as a way of storing communications in packages for later delivery. **One of those weapons, which had a wide application potential, was the laser-light amplification through stimulated energy radiation-the device the army found in the Roswell spacecraft and would later develop as a weapon in cooperation with Hughes Aircraft.** I began by listing the needs of the army for what the laser might be able to accomplish. Based on what the army analysts reported they saw in the Roswell ship, it seemed to me obvious that if the Roswell laser was a cutting or surgical tool, the beam could also be utilized as an advanced rapid-firing weapon. With a beam so precise and directed, the laser would also make an excellent range finder and target manager for artillery. If the beam was capable of instantaneous readjustment and fed into a computer, it would also be the perfect targeting system for a tank, especially a tank on the move. Typically, a tank must stop before it can fire because the gunner needs to have a fixed firing platform from which he calculates range, direction, and other compensating factors. The laser can do all that while the vehicle is moving and should therefore enable a tank to stay on the move while firing. And if", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:48:01248d985344", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14991, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 49, "text": "of instantaneous readjustment and fed into a computer, it would also be the perfect targeting system for a tank, especially a tank on the move.

The laser can do all that while the vehicle is moving and should therefore enable a tank to stay on the move while firing. And if a laser can paint a target from a tank and find the range, I speculated, it can do the same for a helicopter from air to air and air to ground. I suggested to General Trudeau that all the research we were conducting into helicopter tactics, especially into the role of helicopters as infantry support gun and rocket platforms, dovetailed perfectly with the possibilities of the laser as a range-finding mechanism. We could paint friendly troops to locate them, identify our foes, and illuminate potential targets with light invisible to all but our own gunners. At the same time, our own bombs or missiles can home in on the laser image we project onto a target, like a heat-seeking missile. Once painted, the target could evade the laser-guided rocket or shell only with great difficulty. For a stationary target such as a fortification or artillery redoubt, a laser-guided shell would be particularly devastating because we could take it out with one or two rounds instead of having to go back again and again to make sure we'd found the target. As a signal, a laser is so intense, refined, and perfectly stable that it is almost impervious to any kind of disturbance. For this reason, I wrote General Trudeau, the EBEs must have used an advanced form of a laser for their communication, and we can, too. The intensity of the beam and its highly refined focus mean that it can be aimed with minute precision. Amplifying the power to boost the signal should not distort the beam's aim, which makes it perfect for straight-line long-distance communication. Lasers also have high capacities for carrying multiple signals. Therefore, I wrote the general, we can pack a greater number of transmission bands into a laser signal than we can with our conventional signal carriers. **This meant that we could literally flood a battlefield with different kinds of communication channels, each carrying different kinds of communication, some not even invented yet, and have them securely carried by laser signals.** Our work with laser products was becoming so successful by the end of 1961 that General Trudeau was urging me to spread the wealth around as many army bases as I could.

Maybe as range finders, we suggested, or even as ways to lock onto a target the way the air force was experimenting with something they were calling \"smart bombs.\" **By 1964, after seeing the research into the feasibility of lasers that we had commissioned, handheld range finders were being tested at army bases around the country, and today, police forces use laser sights on their weapons. Lasers became one of the army's great successes.** [Back to top.](#12) **Fiber Optics** Members of the retrieval team who foraged around inside the spacecraft on the morning of the discovery told Colonel Blanchard back at the 509th that they were amazed they couldn't find any conventional wiring. Where were the electrical connections? they asked, because obviously the vehicle had electronics. They didn't understand the function of the printed circuit wafers they found, but, even more important, they were completely mystified by the single glass filaments that ran through the panels of the ship. At first, some of the scientists thought that they comprised the missing wiring that also had the engineers so confused as they packed the craft for shipping. Maybe they were part of the wiring harness that was broken in the crash. But these filaments had a strange property to them. The wire harness seemed to have broken loose from a control panel and was separated into twelve frayed filaments that looked something like quartz. When, back at the 509th's hangar, officers from the retrieval team applied light to one end of the filament, the other end emitted a specific color. Different filaments emitted different colors. The fibers-in reality glass crystal tubes-led to a type of junction box where the fibers separated and went to different parts of the control panel that seemed to acknowledge electrically the different color pulsing through the tube. Since the engineers evaluating the material at Roswell knew that each color of light had its own specific wavelength, they guessed that the frequency of the light wave activated a specific component of the spacecraft's control panel. But beyond that, the engineers and scientists were baffled. They couldn't even determine the spacecraft's power source, let alone what generated the power for the light tubes. And, the most amazing thing of all was that the filaments not only were flexible but still emitted light even when they were bent back and forth like a paper clip.

How could light be made to bend? the engineers wondered. This was one of the physical mysteries of the Roswell craft that stayed hidden through the 1950s until one of the Signal Corps liaisons, who routinely briefed General Trudeau on the kinds of developments the Signal Corps was looking for, told us about experiments in optical fibers going on at Bell Labs. The technology was still very new, Hans Kohler told me during a private briefing in early 1962, but the promise of using light as a carrier of all kinds of signals through single-filament glass strands was holding great promise. He explained that the premise of optical fibers was to have a filament of glass so fine and free of any impurities that nothing would impede the light beam moving along the center of the shaft. You also had to have a powerful light source at one end, he explained, to generate the signal, and I thought of the successful ruby laser that had been tested at Columbia University. EBEs had integrated the two technologies for their glass-cable transmission inside the spacecraft. **\"But what makes the light bend?\" I asked Professor Kohler, still incredulous that the aliens seem to have been able to defy one of our own laws of physics. \"Is it some kind of an illusion?\"** \"It's not a trick at all,\" the scientist explained. \"It only looks like an illusion because the fibers are so fine, you can't see the different layers without a microscope.\" He showed me, when I gave him the broken pieces of filament that I still had in my nut file, that each strand, which looked like one solid piece of material enclosing the circumference of a tiny tube, was actually double layered. When you looked down the center of the shaft you could see that around the outside of the filament was another layer of glass. Dr. Kohler explained that the individual light rays are reflected back toward the center by the layer of glass around the outside of the fiber so that the light can't escape.** By running the glass fibers around corners and, in the case of the Roswell spacecraft, through the interior walls of the ship, the aliens were able to bend light and focus it just like you can direct the flow of water through a supply pipe.

He suggested that all ship's communication, visual images, telemetry, and any amplified signals that the vehicles sent or received from other craft or from bases on the moon or on earth would use these glass fiber cables.** \"They seem to have an enormous capacity for carrying any kind of load,\" he suggested. \"And if a laser can amplify the signal, in their most refined form, these cables can carry a multiplicity of signals at the same time.\" I was more than impressed. **Even before asking him about the specific types of applications these might have for the army, I could see how they could make battlefield communications more secure because the signals would be stronger and less vulnerable to interference.** Then Professor Kohler began suggesting the uses of these fibers to carry visual images photographed in tiny cameras from the weapons themselves to controlling devices at the launcher. \"Imagine,\" he said, \"being able to fire a missile and actually see through the missile's eye where it's going. Imagine being able to lock onto a target visually and even as it tries to evade the missile, you can see it and make final adjustments.\" **And Kohler went on to describe the potential of how fiber-optics-based sensors could someday keep track of enemy movements on the ground, carry data-heavy visual signals from surveillance satellites, and pack very complicated multichannel communications systems into small spaces.** \"The whole space program is dependent upon carrying data, voice, and image,\" he said. \"But now, it takes too much space to store all the relays and switches and there's too much impedance to the signal. It limits what we can do on a mission. **But imagine if we could adapt this technology to our own uses.\"** Then he asked me for the army's commitment. He explained that some of our research laboratories were already looking into the properties of glass as a signal conductor and this would not have to be research that was started from complete scratch. **Those kinds of start-ups gave us concern at R&D because unless we covered them up completely, it would look like there was a complete break in a technological", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:52:830cbcf61e93", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14995, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "if we could adapt this technology to our own uses.\"** Then he asked me for the army's commitment.

How do you explain that?** **But if there's research already going on, no matter how basic, then just showing someone at the company one of these pieces of technology could give them all they need to reverse-engineer it so that it became our technology.** But we'd have to support it as part of an arms-development research contract if the company didn't already have a budget. This is what I wanted to do with this glass-filament technology. \"Where is the best research on optical fibers being done?\" I asked him. \"Bell Labs,\" he answered. \"It'll take another thirty years to develop it, but one day most of the telephone traffic will be carried on fiber-optic cable.\" Army R&D had contacts at Bell just like other contractors we worked with, so I wrote a short memo and proposal to General Trudeau on the potential of optical fibers for a range of products that Professor Kohler and I discussed. I described the properties of what had been previously called a wiring harness, explained how it carried laser signals, and, most importantly, how these fibers actually bent a stream of light around a corner and conducted it the same way a wire conducts an electrical current. Imagine conducting a beam of high-intensity single-frequency light the same way you'd run a water line to a new bathroom, I wrote. Imagine the power and flexibility it provided the EBEs, especially when they used the light signal as a carrier for other coded information. **This would enable the military to re-create its entire communications infrastructure and allow our new surveillance satellites to feed and store potential targeting information right into frontline command-and-control installations.** The navy would be able to see the deployment of an entire enemy fleet, the air force could look down on approaching enemy squadrons and target them from above even if our planes were still on the ground, and for the army it would give us an undreamed-of strategic advantage. We could survey an entire battle-field, track the movements of troops from small patrols to entire divisions, and plot the deployments of tanks, artillery, and helicopters at the same time.

I didn't have to wait long for the general's response. \"Do it,\" he ordered. \"And get this under way fast. I'll get you all the development allocation you need. Tell them that.\" [Back to top.](#12) **Bulletproof Vests** **Among the items in my Roswell file that we retained from the retrieval were strands of a fiber that even razors couldn't cut through.** When I looked at it under a magnifying glass, its dull grayness and almost matte finish belied the almost supernatural properties of this fiber. You could stretch it, twist it around objects, and subject it to a level of torque that would rend any other fiber, but this held up. Then, when you released the tension, it snapped back to its original length without any loss of tension in its original form. It reminded me of the filaments in a spiderweb. We became very interested in this material and began to study a variety of technologies, including spider silks because they, alone in nature, exhibit natural supertenacity properties. Clearly, when the scientists at Roswell saw how this fiber-not cloth, not silk, but something like a ceramic-had encased the ship and formed the outer skin layer of the EBEs, they realized it was a very promising avenue for research. When I examined the material and recognized its similarity to spider thread, I realized that a key to producing this commercially would be to synthesize the protein and find a way to simulate the extrusion process. **General Trudeau encouraged me to start contacting plastics and ceramics manufacturers, especially Monsanto and Dow, to find out who was doing research on super-tenacity materials, especially at university laboratories.** **I not only discovered that Monsanto was looking for a way to develop a mass-production process for a simulated spider silk, I also learned that they were already working with the army.** Army researchers from the Medical Corps were trying to replicate the chemistry of the spider gene to produce the silk-manufacturing protein. Years later, after I'd left the army, researchers at the University of Wyoming and Dow Corning also began experiments on cloning the silk-manufacturing gene and developing a process to extrude the silk fibers into a usable substance that could be fabricated into a cloth. Our research and development liaison in the Medical Corps told me that the replication of a supertenacity fiber was still years away", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:54:562eeada88f3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14997, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "trying to replicate the chemistry of the spider gene to produce the silk-manufacturing protein. Years later, after I'd left the army, researchers at the University of Wyoming and Dow Corning also began experiments on cloning the silk-manufacturing gene and developing a process to extrude the silk fibers into a usable substance that could be fabricated into a cloth. Our research and development liaison in the Medical Corps told me that the replication of a supertenacity fiber was still years away back in 1962, but that any help from Foreign Technology that we could give the Medical Corps would find its way to the companies they were working with and probably wouldn't require a separate R&D budget. The development funding through U.S. government medical and biological research grants was more than adequate, the Medical Corps officer told me, to finance the research unless we needed to develop an emergency crash program. But I still remained fascinated by the prospect that something similar to a web spinner had spun the strands of supertenacity fabric around the spaceship. I knew that whatever that secret was, amalgamating a skin out of some sort of fabric or ceramic around our aircraft would give them the protection that the Roswell craft had and still be relatively lightweight. Our scientists told us that one way to simulate the effect of supertenacity was in the cross-alignment of composite layers of fabric. **This idea was the premise for the army's search for a type of body armor that would protect against the skin-piercing injuries of explosive shrapnel and rounds fired from guns.** \"Now this won't protect you against contusions,\" General Trudeau told me after a meeting with Army Medical Corps researchers at Walter Reed. \"And the concussive shock from an impact will still be strong enough to kill anybody, but at least it's supposed to keep the round from tearing through your body.\" I thought about the many blunt trauma wounds you see in a battle and could imagine the impact a large round would leave even if it couldn't penetrate the skin. **But through the general's impetus and the contacts he set up for me at DuPont and Monsanto, we aggressively pursued the research into the development of a cross-aligned material for bulletproof vests. I hand-carried the field descriptions of the fabric found at Roswell to my meetings at these companies and showed the actual fabric to scientists who visited us in Washington. This was not an item we wanted to risk carrying around the coun-try. By 1965, Du Pont had announced the creation of the Kevlar fabric that, by 1973, was brought to market as the Kevlar bulletproof vest that's in common use today in the armed services and law-enforcement agencies.** I don't know how many thousands of lives have been saved, but every time I hear of a police officer whose Kevlar vest protected him from", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:55:5d6608895255", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14998, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary", "chunk_index": 56, "text": "who visited us in Washington.

The cross-stitched supertenacity fibers on the skin of the Roswell vehicle, which I believe had been spun on, also became an impetus for an entirely new generation of attack and strategic aircraft as well as composite materials for future designs of attack helicopters.** [Back to top.](#12) **Kindly support this work: [Donate here](https://www.peerservice.org/donations.php)** Explore the mind and heart expanding websites managed by the nonprofit PEERS network: [www.peerservice.org](https://www.peerservice.org) - PEERS websites: Spreading inspiration, education, & empowerment [www.momentoflove.org](https://www.momentoflove.org) - Every person in the world has a heart [www.personalgrowthcourses.net](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net) - Dynamic online courses powerfully expand your horizons [www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) - Reliable, verifiable information on major cover-ups [www.weboflove.org](https://www.weboflove.org) - Strengthening the Web of Love that interconnects us all [Subscribe here](https://www.peerservice.org/subscribe_peers) to one of the two popular PEERS email lists", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__day-after-roswell-ufo-summary.txt:56:c95dfcc1d48c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 14999, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__inside-worlds-largest-ufo-conference.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__inside-worlds-largest-ufo-conference", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Behind the Scenes at the World's Largest UFO/UAP Conference\n\nBehind the Scenes at the World's Largest UFO/UAP Conference\n\nDear WantToKnow.info friends,\n\nI recently went to the 10th Anniversary of Contact in the Desert, the world's largest UFO conference. **[Check out our 15-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCgNow3VrEo&), where I had the opportunity to talk to the leaders at the center of this movement!**\n\nThis event holds immense significance as [an unprecedented bipartisan movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngn0LimfRDE&) is currently creating the clearest political path to UAP/UFO disclosure that we've ever seen.\n\n[This comes after after at least 80 years](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufo-information-center) of well-documented UFO cases, groundbreaking testimonies from high-ranking military officials, and government efforts to cover up any real inquiry into the phenomena while covertly studying it for their own purposes in secret programs partly funded by our taxpayer dollars.\n\n**While some may doubt that the current disclosure process will produce meaningful results, these efforts leave a trail of documentation showing that we the people remembered that our government belongs to us, and that we stood up for our values.**\n\nBecause it's not just about chasing shiny lights in the sky.

The descriptions of the supersecret projects at Nellis Air Force Base or Area 51 in the Nevada desert seem to fit the profile of the kind of recommendation that General Twining was making, especially the employment of the \"skunk works\" group at Lockheed in the development of the Stealth fighter and B2 bomber.* - Col.

According to his testimony, Col. Corso tells how he spearheaded the Army's reverse-engineering project that led to today's integrated circuits, fiber optics, lasers, bulletproof vests, and more. **Secretly, they would \"seed\" ET technology to American industry giants, mixing human technology with ET technology, without telling those companies where it came from.** **Read our [full summary of his book,*Day After Roswell*](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/day-after-roswell-ufo-summary).** *In 1961, regardless of the differences in the Roswell story from the many different sources who had described it, the top-secret file of Roswell information came into my possession when I took over the Foreign Technology desk at R&D [Research and Development]. My boss, General Trudeau, asked me to use the army's ongoing weapons development and research program as a way to filter the Roswell technology into the mainstream of industrial development through the military defense contracting program. Today, items such as lasers, integrated circuitry, fiber-optics networks, accelerated particle-beam devices, and even the Kevlar material in bulletproof vests are all commonplace. Yet the seeds for the development of all of them were found in the crash of the alien craft at Roswell.* - Col.

Salas graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy and spent seven years in active duty from 1964 to 1971. He also held positions at Martin Marietta and Rockwell and spent 21 years at the FAA. In the Air Force, he was an air traffic controller and a missile launch officer as well as an engineer on the Titan 3 missiles. Capt. Salas testifies below about a UFO incident in March of 1967, where he states that 16 nuclear missiles became non-operational at two different launch facilities immediately after guards saw UFOs hovering above. The guards could not identify these objects even though they were only about 30 feet away. The Air Force did an extensive investigation of the incidents and could not find a probable cause. At a debriefing about the incident, an officer from the Air Force Office of Special Investigations required Capt. Salas to sign a non-disclosure form, and told him that he was not to talk about the event to anyone including his family or other military staff. At a time during the Cold War when minor technical anomalies were openly communicated amongst the staff, this incident was highly unusual. Even today, Captain Salas thinks this to be very unusual. **Captain Salas' UFO Testimony ** The UFO incident happened on the morning of March 16, 1967. I was on duty along with my commander Fred Mywald. We were both on duty at Oscar Flight as part of the 490th strategic missile squad and there are five launch control facilities assigned to that particular squadron. It was still dark out and we were sixty feet underground [at the ICBM launch control facility]. It was early in the morning and I received a call from my topside security guard who's the flight security controller. He said that he and some of the guards had been observing some strange lights flying around the site around the launch control facility. He said they were acting very unusual just flying around, and I said, \"You mean UFOS?\" He said, well, he didn't know what they were, but they were lights and were flying around. They were not airplanes; they weren't making any noise. They were not helicopters; they were making some very strange maneuvers and he couldn't explain it. It wasn't more than a few minutes - maybe a half hour later - and he calls back. This time he's very frightened. I can tell by the tone of his voice he's very shook up. He says, \"Sir, there's a glowing red object hovering right outside the front gate. I'm looking at it right now. I've got all the men out here with their weapons drawn.\" I immediately went over to my commander who was taking a nap - we have a little cot down there", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__robert_salas_ufo.txt:0:7d1110e9cccd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15006, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__robert_salas_ufo.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__robert_salas_ufo", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "- maybe a half hour later - and he calls back.

I'm looking at it right now. I've got all the men out here with their weapons drawn.\" I immediately went over to my commander who was taking a nap - we have a little cot down there for rest periods - and I was telling him about the telephone call we just received. As I was relating this to him our missiles started shutting down one by one. By shutting down, I mean they went into a \"no-go\" condition meaning they could not be launched. So we get bells and whistles - a red light no-go condition. These weapons were Minuteman One missiles, and were of course nuclear-tipped warhead missiles. As they started shutting down, immediately he gets up, and we both start querying the status board. We've got the ability to query and determine what the cause of the shutdowns was. As I recall, most of them were guidance and control system failures. And then he started reporting to the command post. In the meantime I called upstairs to find out what the status was of this object and the guard said, well, the object has left - it just left at high speed. The Air Force did an extensive investigation of the entire incident and was not able to come up with a probable cause for the shutdowns. And I've got quite a few witnesses that will testify to that. We've got a couple of people who worked on the investigative team. And I've got correspondence from the man who actually organized the investigative team. There was no viable explanation for this [shutdown of multiple ICBMs]. Each missile is basically self-supporting. Most of them are powered by commercial power but each missile has its own power generator. At our site anywhere from six to eight went down, but they went down in rapid succession, which again is an extremely rare happening. We rarely had more than one missile go down for any reason at all. After I talked to my guard upstairs, my commander talked to the command post. When he finished talking to the command post he turned to me and said, \"The same thing occurred at ECHO Flight.\" ECHO Flight is another squadron, I'd say probably 50 - 60 miles away from our location, but they had the same sort of thing happen. They had UFOs that were hovering, not at the launch control facility, but at the actual launch facilities where the missiles are located. They had some maintenance and security people out there at the time and they observed the UFOs at those sites. Now they lost all ten of their", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__robert_salas_ufo.txt:1:1a37f20570e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15007, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__robert_salas_ufo.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__robert_salas_ufo", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "thing occurred at ECHO Flight.\" ECHO Flight is another squadron, I'd say probably 50 - 60 miles away from our location, but they had the same sort of thing happen. They had UFOs that were hovering, not at the launch control facility, but at the actual launch facilities where the missiles are located. They had some maintenance and security people out there at the time and they observed the UFOs at those sites. Now they lost all ten of their weapons - all ten. So ... we lost anywhere from between 16 to 18 ICBMs at the same time UFOs were in the area and were observed by airmen. Those missiles were down the entire day because we've got testimony from Colonel Don Crawford, who relieved the crew at ECHO Flight. He was there when the missiles were being brought up to alert status, and he said it took the whole day. So I'm assuming it took our missiles all day to be brought back up also. I wrote up a report about this incident - it was in my log - and I turned it in. When we got to the base, we had to report to our squadron commander right away. And in that room with my squadron commander was a fellow from AFOSI (we had an Air Force Office of Special Investigations on the base). He was there in the office with the commander. He asked for my logs, and he wanted a quick briefing, although it seemed to me he knew pretty much what had happened already. But we gave him a quick briefing. Then he asked us both to sign a non-disclosure agreement saying this was classified information. We were not to release this to anybody, and that was it. We couldn't talk. He told us we could not talk about this to anyone, including any of the other crews, our spouses, our family, even amongst each other. I've got a copy of a telex which we received under FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) coming from SAC (Strategic Air Command) headquarters and coming to Malstrom and other bases right after the morning that happened saying that this incident was of extreme concern to SAC headquarters because they couldn't explain it. Nobody could explain what happened. And yet we never got de-briefed. And we were cleared for very high classification because these are nuclear weapons we're dealing with. We did get the security incursion alarms at those sites when the missile went down. That is unusual because usually when a missile went down for something like guidance failure, we wouldn't get security incursion alarms, which means a perimeter is breached, an object crossed the fence, or something broke the security alarm system that we had on the perimeter of the launch facility. I did sent out guards to a couple of those facilities to investigate that.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__robert_salas_ufo.txt:2:3e086c7f7882", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15008, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__robert_salas_ufo.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__robert_salas_ufo", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "dealing with.

I did sent out guards to a couple of those facilities to investigate that. The reason I think this story is very significant is because, going back to August of 1966 at Minot, ND, a very similar thing happened at one of the launch control facilities at Minot Air Force Base. They had the same kind of weapon system that we had. They had M-1 missiles. This [UFO] was observed on radar, there was some communication failure, and the object was observed over the launch control facility. That happened in August 1966 and that's a well-documented incident. About a week prior to my incident, in March 1967, I've got a record of a call from one of the security guards who was out roaming looking at the launch facilities and saw an object very similar to what I just described over the launch facility. Bob Kominski headed up the organization to look at all aspects of these shutdowns. Kominski related to me in writing that at some point he was told by his boss that the Air Force said, \"Stop the investigation. Do no more on this and in addition do not write a final report.\" Again, this is very unusual, especially in light of the fact that CINC-SAC headquarters was stating that this was of extreme importance. And yet, the head of the investigative team was told during the investigation to stop the investigation and not to write a final report. **Note:** For Captain Salas' personal research showing many other levels of cover-up and deception, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufos/ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown).

It concerned nothing less than a confirmation of the existence of deeply classified programs to study alien technology. That is, extraterrestrial aliens. Their craft and technology.\"** Dear friends, [Richard Dolan](https://www.richarddolanpress.com/richard-dolan-bio) is a leading researcher, historian, and writer on the subject of UFOs. In my estimation, he is the best, most thorough researcher on this most intriguing topic. His article below explores what may be the biggest leak of the century - all but proving the existence of a massive, deeply hidden U.S. program to reverse engineer technologies recovered from alien spacecraft. **The glaring weakness of this article is that it is written for those already steeped in UFO lore. To help those who have little to no knowledge of this field, I'll give a few pointers. ** The key figure below is [Admiral Thomas Wilson](https://www.dia.mil/About/Leadership/Article-View/Article/567057/vadm-thomas-r-wilson-usn/), who served in several of the very highest positions at the Pentagon, including director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. [Eric Davis](https://earthtech.org/team/) is a top scientist with a serious interest in studying anomalies in science like interstellar flight, UFOs, and teleportation. Knowing Wilson's interest in abnormal phenomenon, trusted colleagues had put him in contact with Davis, whose notes about their interchanges were eventually leaked. In the leaked documents, we see that in communications and meetings between the two, Davis is eventually able to draw out of Admiral Wilson the fact that he was stunned to learn in 1997 about programs to reverse engineer a crashed UFO. Yet even with his lofty position in the Pentagon, he was denied access to these projects that on the books were under his jurisdiction. **Admiral Wilson was quite justifiably incensed that he couldn't get access to projects over which he had supervision. He questioned the legality of being denied aces, yet was then warned by powerful individuals that if he fought this, he would lose his job and be disgraced.** So these leaked documents show not only that there are downed ET vehicles, but that there are projects so secret that even those at the highest level of the Pentagon are denied access to them.

The public conversation we will be having about these documents is only beginning, and there is no doubt in my mind that it will continue through the remainder of this year and for years to come. Or until it is surpassed by something even bigger. I'm talking about the Admiral Wilson documents. **These are in relation to Thomas Ray Wilson, a man with a long and distinguished career in the U.S. Navy. Wilson was Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency from 1999 until 2002, and prior to that served as Director of Intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Deputy Director of Intelligence for the Joint Chiefs. **This position is known as J-2, and Wilson held that from 1997 to 1999. The basics of what I'm about to tell you have been known by a few researchers for many years, including by myself. Many of us have discussed this series of events repeatedly, but until now, we haven't had the documents to prove it. I've been talking about this since I first learned about it in 2007. Others, like [Steven Greer](https://siriusdisclosure.com/about-us/#drgreer) and the late Apollo astronaut [Edgar Mitchell](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufocover-up10pg#mitchell), also made many statements, direct and indirect, about it. [http://omnitalkradio.weebly.com/pentagon-ufo-briefing.html](http://omnitalkradio.weebly.com/pentagon-ufo-briefing.html) So what are we talking about? **These are notes by Dr. Eric Davis from October 16, 2002.** Who is Eric Davis? He is a scientist, but surely qualifies as a very interesting scientist. **For many years, during the 1990s, he was a member of the National Institute for Discovery Sciences, which was owned by billionaire Robert Bigelow. NIDS was a very important organization back then and brought scientific rigor to many interesting areas of research connected to UFOs and beyond. **The mystery of the black triangles, for instance. And most famously the Skinwalker Ranch in Utah, something Davis was very much involved in studying.

And most famously the Skinwalker Ranch in Utah, something Davis was very much involved in studying. Davis is also a close associate of [Dr. Hal Puthoff](https://earthtech.org/team/), who owns the scientific company [Earthtech](https://earthtech.org/). Dr. Puthoff has an extensive career in science and the world of intelligence. Along with Russell Targ he developed the protocols for America's classified [remote viewing program](https://www.wanttoknow.info/remoteviewing/remote-viewing) [psychic spying] in the 1970s and 80s. He is an expert on [Zero Point Energy](http://www.calphysics.org/zpe.html) and what is called spacetime metric engineering. Think about that for a moment. And he has also has worked closely with Bigelow on a number of occasions. Plus he is an integral member of [To the Stars Academy](https://dpo.tothestarsacademy.com/) (TTSA). Hal Puthoff is someone I've known for many years and I have said it over and over again that he is someone who has always quietly been trying to help the cause of UFO Disclosure. In my own judgment, and I am surely not alone in this, Davis and Puthoff are currently engaging in some of the most important scientific research related to UFOs in terms of their work on the now famous artifact from an alleged UFO which contains what's known as a metamaterial and possesses incredible properties. I've discussed this elsewhere so more on that another time. The bottom line is that Eric Davis is not just any scientist, but a scientist with a deep appreciation and solid scientific approach to certain areas of the fringe. And, through his association with people like Bigelow and Puthoff, he clearly has been able to have access at least from time to time to powerful individuals like Admiral Thomas Wilson. **These notes, then - 15 pages in all - were written by Davis in the aftermath of a meeting he had with Wilson in October 2002.** They concern a series of events that took place during the spring of 1997, when Wilson was Deputy Director of Intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. **What took place during this meeting was a discussion of very great importance. It concerned nothing less than a confirmation of the existence of deeply classified programs to study alien technology. That is, extraterrestrial aliens. Their craft and technology.** As everyone knows, claims and more claims have been made over many years regarding this. I've discussed it countless times, and so have many other researchers. But these leaked documents, while not the first leaked documents to offer such a claim, are the most compelling. And unlike, say the various MJ12 and Majestic documents, there is no argument over their authenticity. They are real. We need to be clear about what this is. It's not a classified", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufo-leak-of-century.txt:2:c60efe7442d9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15019, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufo-leak-of-century.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufo-leak-of-century", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "craft and technology.** As everyone knows, claims and more claims have been made over many years regarding this.

And unlike, say the various MJ12 and Majestic documents, there is no argument over their authenticity. They are real. We need to be clear about what this is. It's not a classified statement from the President or even from Wilson himself attesting to the reality of this program. However, it is a wholly credible series of notes by a scientist who only intended this to go to an extremely limited group of close colleagues. As such it has exceptional credibility. Moreover, the amount of detail and of specific names in it make it obvious that this is all very real. It will be impossible to debunk this leak as a hoax or fabrication. At most, skeptics might argue that somehow these men were given wrong information. But as you will see, this is also not a credible argument. **The full fifteen pages are available [at this link.](https://imgur.com/a/ggIFTfQ)**[https://imgur.com/a/ggIFTfQ](https://imgur.com/a/ggIFTfQ) I will try to present the highlights of this, although you will surely want to read the entire 15 pages carefully on your own. As stated, this note is dated October 16, 2002. There are names contained in here that I don't yet know, undoubtedly others will identify everyone here. But most are searchable and identifiable. The two were set to meet at 10 a.m. that day, and Wilson apparently was ten minutes late, arriving with two Navy officers in uniform. Wilson himself was in civilian clothing. The two sat in the back of Wilson's car for a little more than an hour, in back of the EG&G Special Projects Building. One interesting thing about that is that EG&G's \"Special Projects\" division was the operator of the [Janet Terminal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_(airline)) at [McCarran Airport**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarran_International_Airport) in Las Vegas, which became famous or notorious as the airline to fly employees and contractors to remote government sites in Nevada and California - places like Area 51. **Davis began asking Wilson about a very important meeting dating from April 1997. At the time, it was known only to a very few people. But it involved UFO researcher Dr. Steven Greer, Apollo 14 astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell, and a U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Willard Miller, who met with Wilson and two other individuals, Admiral Michael Crawford and General Patrick Hughes.** In Edgar Mitchell's recollection, the date was April 9, 1997. Later in the notes, Wilson gives the same date. Davis's notes do not explicitly state what this meeting was about. But this much is known through statements by Greer and Mitchell, which is that is was to bring to their attention the existence of deep black and let's say rogue private organizations", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufo-leak-of-century.txt:3:0bded14e0e61", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15020, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufo-leak-of-century.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufo-leak-of-century", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "Commander Willard Miller, who met with Wilson and two other individuals, Admiral Michael Crawford and General Patrick Hughes.** In Edgar Mitchell's recollection, the date was April 9, 1997.

But this much is known through statements by Greer and Mitchell, which is that is was to bring to their attention the existence of deep black and let's say rogue private organizations involved in studying alien technology and bodies, and essentially needed to be brought under formal control by the U.S. government. Or, let's say, something reasonably close to that. **One thing that came up later in the notes is that they presented the thesis of what was then a brand new book: *[The Day After Roswell](https://www.amazon.com/Day-After-Roswell-William-Birnes/dp/150117200X)* by Philip J. Corso. This book brought forth the allegation that at least some of the technology recovered from the Roswell crash in 1947 was segued into private industry. Turns out in the aftermath of Wilson's two-month adventure, which I'm about to describe, he became a believer in the fundamentals of Corso's thesis.** Davis's notes gloss over this part of the meeting but focus on what was discussed after the formal meeting. This was a two-hour conversation between Lt. Commander Miller and Wilson on \"UFOs, MJ-12, Roswell, crashed UFO/alien bodies, etc.\" That's rather interesting, and we are just getting started. Wilson, in fact, said that \"he knew about intelligence on US mil/intell on UFO close encounters - and foreign gov't encounters. Seen records.\" Again, that is a very interesting statement, isn't it? Remember, this is 1997, a full decade before the start of the AATIP program. You'd sure like to know which records Wilson was talking about. **Then comes the first major bombshell of this document, and we are only at the bottom of page one. In Davis's notes, Wilson stated that he was able to confirm in June 1997 that \"there is such an organization in existence\" in relation to \"MJ-12/UFO cabal - crashed UFO.\" **At that time, this is late June 1997, Wilson phoned Miller and apparently told him that yes, he was right. There is such a group, a cabal, that manages the crashed UFO program. Davis showed Wilson a letter from Miller dated April 25, 2002 - this letter is part of the leak. This letter makes it clear that Davis and Hal Puthoff were engaged in their own research into crashed UFOs and trying to figure out all the players within the government that have something to do with it. One of the extremely interesting statements in Miller's letter is that he would be able to provide Davis and Puthoff with \"the name and last location of a senior officer who I believe had first-hand knowledge [of] U.S. government and alien reproduction vehicles (ARVs) at Area-51 and associated locations.\" There's", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufo-leak-of-century.txt:4:73f8a599e73e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15021, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufo-leak-of-century.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufo-leak-of-century", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "and Hal Puthoff were engaged in their own research into crashed UFOs and trying to figure out all the players within the government that have something to do with it.

Then Wilson said \"Miller can make good educated guesses on who (contractors) has alien hardware.\" Then, \"Miller can give good advice on which defense companies to look at - that's all he knows.\" Clearly, Wilson knew a lot more. Wilson was also angry that Miller, a fellow Navy officer, betrayed the trust of their conversation by relaying it to Greer and who knows who else. In reality, it doesn't seem that Miller told many other people. Davis in his note added that Miller only told Edgar Mitchell, who was the one who told Davis about it in 1999. It's possible that Miller told something to journalist Leslie Kean. At least this is what Wilson believed in his conversation with Davis in 2002. **Wilson was clearly nervous even in talking with Davis and said he was taking a risk just talking with him. And indeed, two decades later, the entire conversation is now out.** Davis then asks Wilson to describe what happened during the timeframe of April 1997 to June 1997. Wilson said that about a week or so after his meeting with Miller, he \"made phone calls, knocked on a few doors, talked to people.\" This went on for 45 days, on and off, he said. The way Wilson investigated this is worth consideration. He said he received a suggestion from a General Ward to search through the records group files in the OUSDAT office. That is, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology). After doing some searches I believe this is Air Force General H. Marshal Ward, who in fact soon after became Director of special programs, at the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology in the Pentagon. Even more interesting, during this time Wilson ran into William", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufo-leak-of-century.txt:5:25c55186b387", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 15022, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "ufos__ufo-leak-of-century.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "ufos__ufo-leak-of-century", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "a suggestion from a General Ward to search through the records group files in the OUSDAT office.

Marshal Ward, who in fact soon after became Director of special programs, at the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology in the Pentagon. Even more interesting, during this time Wilson ran into William Perry, who had just left his position as U.S. Secretary of Defense. Perry is an extremely important and powerful figure and is still alive at age 91. Perry is someone of exceptional intelligence and ability who knows all the right people and appears to have always known all the right people. What's fascinating to read is that Wilson told Davis that he ran into Perry in May 1997 and they \"talked about this quietly.\" And Perry suggested the same thing as General Ward had. That is, go through the OUSDAT records. Again, this is the Defense Department records pertaining to \"acquisition and technology.\" Which makes sense. Wilson then said \"they told me\" (and I am not sure in this case who the \"they\" is but it seems to be Ward and Perry) \"of a special projects record group not belonging to usual SAP - a special subset of the unacknowledged /carve-outs/waived programs - not belonging to the usual SAP divisions as organized in '94 by Perry himself - set apart from [the] rest but buried/covered by conventional SAPs.\" This is a very significant statement. **SAP, or Special Access Programs, are the primordial 'black budget' programs that infamously are nearly completely outside Congressional oversight. It's been understood for a long time that in this environment, many of these programs are beyond oversight not merely of Congress, but the armed services themselves, dominated by the private contractors even sometimes over the defense department officials themselves.** Here, Wilson is telling Davis that he learned that this UFO crash retrieval program appears to have been buried within other Special Access Programs, not belonging to the standard organization of how these programs are set up, but set apart. Wilson then mentioned a few other names in this regard, Paul Kaminski, General Michael Kostenik, and Judith Daley, who was the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Advanced Development, OUSDAT. Out of this he did find this unusual record group. The budget information as he learned seemed very high, but he said that might just have been errors in the way that budgets were reported. Davis then tried to get to the main point: what SAP compartment did you find it in? Wilson's answer was \"core secret - won't say.\" Davis: code name? Wilson: core secret. Davis: who was the project contractor or government agency that ran the program? Wilson: a top aerospace technology contractor.

Davis: who was the project contractor or government agency that ran the program? Wilson: a top aerospace technology contractor. Davis: who? Wilson: core secret. Davis asks for hints. Wilson: sorry, no. Then the story comes to the climax. Wilson said he \"made three calls to the program manager - one of them [a] conference call with [the] security director and [the] corporate attorney.\" These individuals were not happy to hear from Wilson. He said all of them had a \"testy tone\" with him, and were confused as to why he was looking for them and what he wanted to know. Wilson said they were \"agitated\" and \"surprised.\" **Wilson informed them that he read their program record in the OUSDAT special program records group \"and wanted to know about their crashed UFO program, what their role in that was, what they had, etc.\" He also \"asked if they heard of MJ-12 or some such organization code related to crashed/recovered UFO craft.\"** This is a simply breathtaking moment here. You have the Deputy Director of Intelligence of the Joint Chiefs of Staff attempting to inquire about a UFO crash retrieval program by contacting the private contracting firm that appeared to be responsible for it. Remember, he's talking to the program manager, the security director, and the corporate attorney. **Wilson told the three that he demanded a formal briefing on this program, and was doing so on his authority as Deputy Director DIA and Joint Chief of Staff J-2.** This was an oversight on their part they needed to correct, he said. Their reply was interesting: they would need to discuss this and get back to him. That they would arrange for a face-to-face meeting and settle the matter that way. The meeting took place about ten days later, in mid-June 1997, according to Wilson. He \"flew out there\" to a conference room in \"a secure vault.\" There he met with the three individuals. The program director, the corporate attorney, and the security director, whom he noted was retired from the NSA and was a counter-intelligence expert. **They called themselves the watch committee or the gatekeepers.** This was because some years earlier the entire program was nearly outed during a Pentagon audit investigation. They were there to ensure the program remained ultra secret. On that previous occasion they were forced to brief the government investigator on the program. In the aftermath of that episode they somehow made a formal agreement with the Pentagon to prevent this in the future.

In the aftermath of that episode they somehow made a formal agreement with the Pentagon to prevent this in the future. What this meant was exceptionally tight controls to allow any U.S. government personnel into the program. Public status or rank were irrelevant. You could only gain entry by meeting unspecified criteria as determined by the watch committee. As Wilson put it, \"their way or the highway.\" **He was mad. This group was operating without proper oversight from legitimate U.S. government agencies. And furthermore, he learned that the purpose of the meeting was to deny his access. His credentials and government authority was proper and valid, but he wasn't on the \"bigot list.\" This is a term in the classified world referring to the people who are cleared to have a need to know. The Admiral was told he did not have a need to know.** This prompted some angry back and forth. Apparently, Wilson did indeed have proper legal authority to be demanding what he did. It didn't matter. Now this part is interesting. As a reply to Wilson's arguments, they pulled out their Bigot list, last updated in 1993, which was four years earlier. Wilson didn't give Davis any names, but he did say they were nearly all employees of the company. He didn't recognize any military names, no politicians, no one in the White house, no on in Congress, or even any Congressional staffers. No one he recognized from the Clinton or Bush Sr. administrations. A small handful of names were Pentagon officials who's names he knew. Then they got down to some more detail. The program manager told Wilson they were not a weapons program, not an intelligence program, not any special ops or logistics program. When he asked what they were, there was a loud groan from the Program Manager. But the security director and the corporate attorney said it's okay, you can tell him. **They told Wilson \"they were a reverse engineering program\" of \"technological hardware\" recovered in the past. He wondered, hmmm, reverse engineering Soviet or Chinese technology? They said no, not that.** **They had an intact craft that they believed could fly. **That's interesting. (a) it's intact and (b) they had not yet figured out how to fly it since they \"believed\" it could fly. **They made it clear to Wilson that \"they didn't know where it was from,\" although they had ideas about that, but that \"it was technology that was not of this Earth - not made by man - not by human hands.\"** **They", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:ufos__ufo-leak-of-century.txt:8:bf1680b95dd4", "wtk_id": NaN}]
