It sounds like science fiction, but it's true.\" The network, known as Echelon, traces its roots all the way back to the John F. Kennedy presidency, and had been expanding ever since.101 In 1992, the Director of the NSA described the goal of the program in simple terms: 'Global Access'.102 The agenda for mass surveillance was institutionalized long before most Americans recognize. Then there was George Bush's illegal warrantless wiretapping.

When the revelations about the program were made in 2006, they were controversial, but Congress repeatedly renewed the NSA's license without much of an uproar from the public. By the 2008 election, citizens were growing weary of the spying program and Barack Obama capitalized on this sentiment. He vowed to end warrantless wiretapping and during his primary campaign he went as far as to say he would filibuster the extension of the FISA legislation, responsible for allowing the expanded spying capabilities.105 \"When I'm president, one of the first things I'm going to do is call in my attorney general and say to him or her, I want you to review every executive order that was issued by George Bush, whether it relates to warrantless wiretaps or detaining people or reading e- mails, or whatever it is. I want you to go through every single one of them and if they are unconstitutional, if they're encroaching on civil liberties unnecessarily, we are going to overturn them. We're going to change them.\" - Barack Obama, 2007106 He first broke this promise after winning the primary campaign, in July 2008, when he was one of 68 Senators who voted to renew the NSA capabilities.107 Less than a year later, Barack Obama would vastly broaden the legal argument the Executive branch used to justify the spying, and exempted the Government from the possibility of being sued thanks to a liberal interpretation of a clause in the Patriot Act.108 **\"In other words, beyond even the outrageously broad 'state secrets' privilege invented by the Bush administration and now embraced fully by the Obama administration, the Obama DOJ has now invented a brand new claim of government immunity, one which literally asserts that the U.S. Government is free to intercept all of your communications (calls, emails and the like) and - even if what they're doing is blatantly illegal and they know it's illegal - you are barred from suing them unless they 'willfully disclose' to the public what they have learned,\" - Glenn Greenwald** On June 6th 2013, it was revealed that Barack Obama oversaw the largest infringement of the Fourth Amendment in the history of the United States with the construction of a veritable surveillance state, capable of tracking the movements and communications of every American citizen. **We now know that the NSA and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:23:bae35b9240ce", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13225, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "is blatantly illegal and they know it's illegal - you are barred from suing them unless they 'willfully disclose' to the public what they have learned,\" - Glenn Greenwald** On June 6th 2013, it was revealed that Barack Obama oversaw the largest infringement of the Fourth Amendment in the history of the United States with the construction of a veritable surveillance state, capable of tracking the movements and communications of every American citizen. **We now know that the NSA and United Kingdom counterpart GHCQ:** **• Collect the domestic meta-data of both parties in a phone-call.109** **• Set up fake internet cafes to steal data.110** • Have intercepted the phone calls of at least 35 world leaders, including allies such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel.111 • Can tap into the underwater fiber-optic cables that carry a majority of the world's internet traffic.112 • Track communications within media institutions such as Al Jazeera.113 • Have 'bugged' the United Nations headquarters.114 • Have set up a financial database to track international banking and credit card transactions.115 • Collect and store over 200 million domestic and foreign text messages each day.116 • Collect and have real-time access to browsing history, email, and social media activity. To gain access, an analyst simply needs to fill out an on-screen form with a broad justification for the search that is not reviewed by any court or NSA personnel.117 \"I, sitting at my desk, could wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email\". - Edward Snowden • Create maps of the social networks of United States citizens.118 • Have access to smartphone app data.119 • Use spies in embassies to collect data, often by setting up 'listening stations' on the roofs of buildings.120 **• Use fake LinkedIn profiles and other doctored web pages to secretly install surveillance software in unwitting companies and individuals.121** • Track reservations at upscale hotels.122 • Have intercepted the talking-points of world leaders before meetings with Barack Obama.123 • Can crack encryption codes on cellphones.124 **• Have implanted software on over 100,000 computers worldwide allowing them to hack data without internet connection, using radio waves.125** • Have access to computers through fake wireless connections.126 • Monitor communications in online games such as World of Warcraft.127 • Intercept shipping deliveries and install back-door devices allowing access.128 • Have direct access to the data centers of Google, Yahoo and other major companies.129 • Covertly and overtly infiltrate United States and foreign IT industries to weaken or gain access to encryption, often by collaborating with software companies and internet service providers themselves.

Only official U.S. communications are affected, and there are no legal limits on the use of the data from Israel.132 • Spy on porn habits of activists to discredit them.133 Possibly the most shocking revelation was made on February 24, 2014. Internal documents show that the NSA is attempting to manipulate and control online discourse with \"extreme tactics of deception and reputation-destruction.\"134 The documents revealed a top-secret unit known as the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Unit, or JTRIG. Two of the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in an effort to discredit a target, and to use social sciences such as psychology to manipulate online discourse and activism in order to generate a desirable outcome. **The unit posts false information on the internet and falsely attributes it to someone else, pretend to be a 'victim' of a target they want to discredit, and posts negative information on various forums. In some instances, to discredit a target, JTRIG sends out 'false flag' emails to family and friends.** One slide describes the methods to discredit a company: Leak confidential information to the press, post negative information on forums, interfere with business deals and ruin business relationships. The use of psychological techniques to fracture activist groups and to 'game' online discourse is very interesting. One document describes creating tension in a group by exploiting personal power, pre-existing cleavages and minor ideological differences. In online discourse, another document describes how to use 'mirroring' of language cues, expressions and emotions, and the adjustment of speech, patterns and language to manipulate opinion. Consider the words of former NSA employee turned whistleblower Russ Tice: \"**They went after - and I know this because I had my hands literally on the paperwork for these sort of things - they went after high-ranking military officers; they went after members of Congress, both Senate and the House, especially on the intelligence committees and on the armed services committees and some of the ... judicial**. But they went after other ones, too. They went after lawyers and law firms. Heaps of lawyers and law firms. They went after judges. **One of the judges is now sitting on the ****Supreme Court.

They went after NGOs ... like the Red Cross, people like that that go overseas and do humanitarian work. They went after a few antiwar civil rights groups. Don't tell me that there's no abuse, because I've had this stuff in my hand and looked at it. And in some cases, I literally was involved in the technology that was going after this stuff. And you know, when I said to [former MSNBC show host Keith] Olbermann, [that] my particular thing is high tech and you know, what's going on is the other thing, which is the dragnet. The dragnet is what Mark Klein is talking about, the terrestrial dragnet. Well my specialty is outer space. I deal with satellites, and everything that goes in and out of space. I did my spying via space. So that's how I found out about this... I was worried that the intelligence community now has sway over what is going on. Now here's the big one. I haven't given you any names. This was is summer of 2004. One of the papers that I held in my hand was to wiretap a bunch of numbers associated ... with a 40-something-year-old wannabe senator from Illinois. You wouldn't happen to know where that guy lives right now, would you? It's a big white house in Washington, DC. **That's who they went after. And that's the president of the United States now.**\" - Russ Tice, NSA Whistleblower135 **On March 5, 2014, it was revealed that the CIA, with the knowledge of Barack Obama, spied on members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the group tasked with overseeing clandestine agency activities and preventing abuses.136** The implications are complete subversion of oversight on domestic spying. Collectively, the evidence of the burgeoning security state under Barack Obama reveals a global information grid with real time access that targets both domestic citizens and lawmakers in addition to foreign people and governments. 101 Duncan Campbell, Investigative Journalist, \"[Echelon: World under watch, an introduction](http://www.zdnet.com/echelon-world-under-watch-an-introduction-3002079845/),\" June 29, 2000 102 National Security Archives hosted document, \"[Farewell from Vice Admiral William O.

Of 'official' wars, it is certainly the case that the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq war were begun by George H.W. and George W. Bush. Though it is important to quantify 'official' because there has not been a true declaration of war since World War II. After all, Bill Clinton dropped bombs on no less than four sovereign countries: Iraq, Serbia, Afghanistan, and Sudan. And Clinton was able to get away with maintaining one of the darkest stains on America's soiled history: the full-force economic sanctions against Iraq that began with the first Gulf war and ended after Saddam's fall in 2003. The sanctions killed 567,000 *children *according to the British Medical Societies *Lancet*.137 (Later studies have argued the number 350,000 children to be more accurate). The total number of deaths including adults is thought to be much higher. **United Nations ambassador Madeline Albright, when asked about these numbers, coldly stated \"The price is worth it.\" This statement truly illuminates the attitude of those who set the agenda: Cold indifference to life on the grand chessboard of geopolitics.** Obama's first major act of war was a no-fly zone over Libya which resulted in the removal of Muammar Gaddafi. The media had a well orchestrated propaganda campaign that garnered significant public support. His second major act of war was the arming of Syrian rebels, undoubtedly prolonging the horrific civil war. Some of the groups that form the opposition are terrorist organizations, which mirrors the policies of Carter and Reagan arming terrorist groups in Afghanistan under Operation Cyclone.138 But the true depths of Obama's war", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:28:fbc5df311e8f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13230, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 29, "text": "war was a no-fly zone over Libya which resulted in the removal of Muammar Gaddafi.

Some of the groups that form the opposition are terrorist organizations, which mirrors the policies of Carter and Reagan arming terrorist groups in Afghanistan under Operation Cyclone.138 But the true depths of Obama's war mongering resides in his constant and silent drone war. A policy that started under W. Bush, **Obama expanded the use of drones extensively. He allowed the usage of Signature Strikes, whereby drone operators bomb people they do not know, based on movements they find suspicious.139** Worst of all is the policy of double tapping, bombing the same scene twice after rescuers have come to try and help their fellow citizens.140 Obama's drones even bombed funerals.141 While the death toll of the drone war may not be as high as the conventional wars of the Bush family, the moral depravity certainly gives them a run for their money. The argument that drones are an alternative method to direct personnel involvement leaves out these cold facts. **It is important to note the presence of 'blowback': the concept that bombing funerals and responders to attacks will create a whole new generation of terrorists. It is almost a forbidden word in the mainstream media. **For example, Ron Paul was ridiculed by pundits across the political spectrum on cable television when he insisted that blowback was a reality. While they deny it in public, many groups secretly relish the idea that their intangible enemy will only grow stronger while their profits grow larger. Drones are helping usher in the era of endless war. Another aspect of Barack Obama's capacity to wage war could be seen in his secretive 'kill list', which was a collection of singled out individuals deemed to pose a threat to the United States and selected for targeted killing.142 The list is known to include American citizens such as Anwar Al Alwaki, raising serious questions regarding human rights and legality.143 137 *The Nation, *\"[A Hard Look at Iraq Sanctions](http://www.thenation.com/article/hard-look-iraq-sanctions),\" November 15, 2001 138 *ABC News, *\"[U.S. Declares Syria Rebel Group Terrorists, Sending Message to Opposition](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/12/u-s-declares-syria-rebel-group-terrorists-sending-message-to-opposition/),\" December 12, 2012 139 *New York Times, *\"[The 'Signature Strikes' Program](http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/the-signature-strikes-program/),\" May 29, 2013 140 *The Guardian, *\"[US drone strikes target rescuers in Pakistan - and the west stays silent](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/us-drones-strikes-target-rescuers-pakistan),\" August 20, 2012 141 *Salon, *\"[U.S. Again Bombs Mourners](http://www.salon.com/2012/06/04/obama_again_bombs_mourners/),\" June 4, 2012 142 *The Guardian, *\"[Obama's secret kill list - the disposition matrix](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/obama-secret-kill-list-disposition-matrix),\" July 14, 2013 143 *New York Times, *\"[Secret 'Kill List' Proves a Test of Obama's Principles and Will](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0),\" March 29, 2012 * * * * Private Military and Intelligence Contractors It has always been hard to tell exactly how many private contractors are employed", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:29:87658105c066", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13231, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "*\"[US drone strikes target rescuers in Pakistan - and the west stays silent](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/us-drones-strikes-target-rescuers-pakistan),\" August 20, 2012 141 *Salon, *\"[U.S. Again Bombs Mourners](http://www.salon.com/2012/06/04/obama_again_bombs_mourners/),\" June 4, 2012 142 *The Guardian, *\"[Obama's secret kill list - the disposition matrix](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/obama-secret-kill-list-disposition-matrix),\" July 14, 2013 143 *New York Times, *\"[Secret 'Kill List' Proves a Test of Obama's Principles and Will](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0),\" March 29, 2012 * * * * Private Military and Intelligence Contractors It has always been hard to tell exactly how many private contractors are employed by the Federal government, and how many of those are under the umbrella of the defense industry. It was under Reagan that the Pentagon's privatization agenda began, and it has continued ever since. An NYU study on the size of government shows that the use of private contractors increased under the Clinton administration by about 25%.144 It is known that Clinton hired KBR, at the time owned by Halliburton, to build military bases and support troops in Kosovo.145 **It was under the administration of George W. Bush, with the Iraq war, when the use of private contractors skyrocketed. By 2008, the number of private contractors in use in Iraq was 155,000, more than the number of troops, a degree of privatization unprecedented in modern warfare.146 The public became acquainted with the likes of Blackwater under the Bush administration, with events such as the unprovoked massacres in Baghdad and Fallujah.147** During his campaign, Obama promised to cut federal spending on private contractors.148 It soon became clear, however, that much of the stimulus money would go straight to their pockets. His Afghanistan surge was primarily accomplished through contractors, which made up half of the military forces in the country by 2009.149 The total number of contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan quickly reached 250,000.150 Security contractors (e.g. private military forces) increased by over 400% under Obama and represent a quarter of all contractors employed by the Pentagon.151 The most shocking use of contractors has only recently been revealed. It turns out that they represent a significant amount of the NSA workforce. 483,000 people are employed by private contractors that work with the NSA and have 'Top Secret' access.152 The potential for illicit spying and extortion represented by these numbers is so high as to reach certainty. 144 \"[Fact Sheet on the New True Size of Government](http://wagner.nyu.edu/files/news/truesize.pdf),\" NYU, Published for the Brookings Institution (PDF Warning) 145 [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KBR_(company)) on KBR 146 *The Christian Science Monitor, *\"[A lesson from Iraq war: How to outsource war to private contractors](http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2013/0319/A-lesson-from-Iraq-war-How-to-outsource-war-to-private-contractors),\" March 19, 2013 147 *USA Today, *\"[What Exactly Happened That Day in Fallujah?](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-06-10-fallujah-deaths_N.htm?csp=usat.me)\" June 11, 2007 148 *National Journal, *\"[Cut Federal Contract Spending By At Least 10 Percent](http://promises.nationaljournal.com/government-spending/cut-federal-contract-spending-by-at-least-10-perce/),\" June 10, 2009 (If link fails, [check here](https://web.archive.org/web/20091129093949/http://promises.nationaljournal.com/government-spending/cut-federal-contract-spending-by-at-least-10-perce/)) 149 *Talking Points Memo, *\"[DOD: Obama's Afghan Surge Will Rely Heavily On Private Contractors](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/dod-obama-s-afghan-surge-will-rely-heavily-on-private-contractors),\" December 15, 2009 150 *CommonDreams, *\"[Obama Has 250,000 'Contractors' in Iraq and Afghan Wars, Increases Number of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:30:ae72fa6cc854", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13232, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "Monitor, *\"[A lesson from Iraq war: How to outsource war to private contractors](http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2013/0319/A-lesson-from-Iraq-war-How-to-outsource-war-to-private-contractors),\" March 19, 2013 147 *USA Today, *\"[What Exactly Happened That Day in Fallujah?](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-06-10-fallujah-deaths_N.htm?csp=usat.me)\" June 11, 2007 148 *National Journal, *\"[Cut Federal Contract Spending By At Least 10 Percent](http://promises.nationaljournal.com/government-spending/cut-federal-contract-spending-by-at-least-10-perce/),\" June 10, 2009 (If link fails, [check here](https://web.archive.org/web/20091129093949/http://promises.nationaljournal.com/government-spending/cut-federal-contract-spending-by-at-least-10-perce/)) 149 *Talking Points Memo, *\"[DOD: Obama's Afghan Surge Will Rely Heavily On Private Contractors](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/dod-obama-s-afghan-surge-will-rely-heavily-on-private-contractors),\" December 15, 2009 150 *CommonDreams, *\"[Obama Has 250,000 'Contractors' in Iraq and Afghan Wars, Increases Number of Mercenaries](https://web.archive.org/web/20160419104356/https://www.commondreams.org/news/2009/06/01/obama-has-250000-contractors-iraq-and-afghan-wars-increases-number-mercenaries),\" June 1, 2009, written by Jeremy Scahill 151 *Salon, *\"[Obama resides over a private contractor boom](http://www.salon.com/2011/02/24/afghanistan_private_contractors/),\" February 24, 2004 152 *Salon, *\"[500,000 contractors can access NSA data hordes](http://www.salon.com/2013/06/11/500000_contractors_can_access_nsa_data_hoards/),\" June 11, 2013 * * * * Renditions **The CIA has an official policy of 'rendition', where they send suspected terrorists to be interrogated in foreign countries, bypassing United States torture laws.** The process was used extensively during George W.

This PBS Frontline report confirms that the rendition process began in 1995.153 In 2007, Obama wrote an article in the *Foreign Affairs *journal stating: \"To build a better, freer world, we must first behave in ways that reflect the decency and aspirations of the American people... This means ending the practices of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far-off countries, of detaining thousands without charge or trial, of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law.\"154 Yet the process of rendition has continued. The *Washington Post * reported that the Obama administration \"embraced rendition\" and consistently resisted lawmakers efforts to reform the policy.155 153 *PBS Frontline, *\"[Rendition Timeline](http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/rendition701/timeline/timeline_1.html).\" 154 *Foreign Affairs, *\"[Renewing American Leadership](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/62636/barack-obama/renewing-american-leadership),\" June 2007 155 *Washington Post, *\"[Renditions continue under Obama, despite due-process concerns](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/renditions-continue-under-obama-despite-due-process-concerns/2013/01/01/4e593aa0-5102-11e2-984e-f1de82a7c98a_story.html?hpid=z4),\" January 1, 2013 * * * * Police Militarization Under President Bill Clinton, a provision was added to the Defense Appropriations Bill that allowed the Pentagon to transfer unused military assets to local police departments around the country.156 The program continued through President Bush and expanded throughout the Obama presidency. \"[Fiscal Year] 11 has been a historic year for the program.

The saying that power is in guns and money has never been truer. The corruption has been heavily and cleverly obfuscated behind a wall of relentless partisan rhetoric that magnify the small differences between presidential candidates. Consider the major initiatives of the Obama presidency. His Affordable Care Act was championed as a bastion of liberal reform, but in reality it is simply forcing Americans to purchase health plans from private corporations. His raising of the top tax bracket was proffered as proof of a liberal agenda, however the tax burden is still squarely on the middle class. In addition, the wealthiest Americans are virtually unaffected, as their wealth resides in assets and investments, not income. We are left with a platform that is nearly indistinguishable from his predecessors, from which Obama promised significant change. **When George Bush bombs a foreign country, liberals cry foul and protest in droves. When Obama does the same thing, the previous protestors often become supporters of the policy. The same phenomenon can be seen on the other side of the aisle. Conservatives are quick to criticize the expansion of programs under Democratic presidents, but stand silent while Reagan and the Bush family oversaw many of the largest expansions of the Federal government and budget in the history of the United States.** It should be clear after even a cursory inspection of the legacies of presidencies from the last 30 years that there is very little tangible differences between the two parties.

How do we approach future elections knowing that there are no real alternatives to be found within the two parties? Even candidates with exceptionally favorable rhetoric cannot be trusted to translate their platform into actual policies. It is possible to dismiss the previous two chapters as a result of 'market forces', that endless war and the One-Party state are the result of uncoordinated actors in a free market. Even if this was the case, the implications and subsequent need for reform would be tremendous. The result can accurately be described as the dirty 'F' word: Fascism. I understand that there will be a lot who disagree with this designation; I argue that the term has many different meanings and many prominent people have used it in different ways. If you feel that another term best describes the phenomenon, that is OK, ultimately it is not important what semantics we apply. Fascism (or whichever term you prefer) is appropriate because the system has evolved into collusion between the military and economic entities to mutually ensure each others entrenchment. It has grown out of control, and perhaps no evidence is stronger than the fact that the media almost invariably refuses to indicate something might be wrong, as they have been enveloped by the system. * * * * Food for Thought: 1. What is responsible for the massive disconnect between lack of differences between presidential candidates and the vitriolic rhetoric in the media and on Capitol Hill? 2. Why did Barack Obama reversed his position on so much of his campaign platform? 3. What forces are the driving factors in the constant overseas military and economic hegemony? 4. Who is driving the creation of agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and where does the order of secrecy come from? 5.

Entertainment media bombards us with a particular version of the psychopath, one that is irrational, dangerous and violent. Someone who doesn't fit in, who 'just doesn't seem right'. Is this an accurate description? Dr. Robert D. Hare, an eminent psychologist on the subject of psychopathy, portrays the disorder in a drastically different light. In his book *Without Conscience, ***he describes psychopaths as being conscienceless yet rational, not suffering from any insanity or debilitation; instead they are logical, manipulative, predisposed to crime, selfish and without guilt, shame, remorse or empathy.166** In other words, these men and women are not *mentally ill *in the sense that we traditionally imagine. Psychopathy is surely an illness, but it is not a neurosis that will manifest symptoms others can easily perceive. Often, the psychopath will be aware of his condition and completely conceal his aberrant traits. In *Without Conscience, *Dr. Hare presents numerous case studies and statistics to illuminate the world of the psychopath; the evidence points towards a world full of people programmed for evil. Dr. Hare stresses multiple times that the psychopath is someone who has a strong desire for power and the need to manipulate others, not for personal gain but simply for the sake of manipulation. While some psychopaths are erratic, others have the ability to completely conceal their condition behind a carefully constructed social persona. Dr. Hare's list of psychopathic personality traits include: • Displaying glibness and superficial charm • Being in constant need of stimulation and prone to excessive boredom • Acting in a conning or manipulative way • Showing shallow emotional responses • Acting out promiscuous sexual behavior • Behaving irresponsibly • Avoiding long term relationships • Feeling a grandiose sense of self worth • Lying repeatedly without remorse • Lacking any remorse or guilt • Lacking empathy for others • Having poor behavioral controls • Displaying behavioral problems early on in life • Behaving impulsively • Failing to accept responsibility for actions • Displaying signs of criminal diversity Dr. Hare's predecessor Harvey Cleckly, perhaps the first psychologist to study the psychopathic phenomenon decades earlier, compiled a similar list: • Superficial charm and average intelligence. • Absence of delusions and other signs of irrational thinking. • Absence of nervousness or neurotic manifestations. • Unreliability. • Untruthfulness and insincerity. • Lack of remorse or shame. • Antisocial behavior without apparent compunction. • Poor judgment and failure to learn from experience. • Pathological egocentricity and incapacity to love. • General poverty in major affective reactions. • Specific loss of insight. • Unresponsiveness in general interpersonal relations. • Fantastic and uninviting behavior with drink, and sometimes without. • Sex life impersonal, trivial, and poorly integrated.

Most of the case studies Dr. Hare presents in his book are from the prison population and anecdotal accounts from those who have been abused. This is a natural, structural problem in the study of psychopathy: the study is limited for the most part to the 'Unsuccessful Psychopath', those who could not conceal their traits or whose social circumstances led to blue-collar crime. Yet Dr. Hare also spends some significant time devoted to **the 'Subdeviant Criminal', the psychopath who has control over his deviance and the ability to hide it from the populace. Instead of the petty criminal, these men and women occupy positions in business, government, industry, and law. Their condition goes entirely unnoticed by the populace; their employers, peers, even their family and those who love them are fooled.** How can such deception be possible? Consider that psychopathy is not an 'acquired' illness. Instead, it has strong genetic components and manifests itself in early childhood.167 168 169 170 From an early age, the psychopath recognizes that to fit into society in any manner they need to develop to ability to lie extensively. Over time, they become exceptionally good at it. Their entire public persona becomes one complex act, a web of lies to hide their deviant personality. 165 [Professor Robert W.

They were also willing to expend extra time and energy to be able to amplify the discomfort they were causing their 'opponent'. \"Some find it hard to reconcile sadism with the concept of 'normal' psychological functioning, but our findings show that sadistic tendencies *among otherwise well-adjusted people *must be acknowledged,\" - Erin Buckels \"The researchers hope that these new findings will help to broaden people's view of sadism as an aspect of personality that manifests in everyday life, helping to dispel the notion that sadism is limited to sexual deviants and criminals,\" - *Association for Psychological Science* Erin Buckels concludes that her research may offer valuable insights into domestic abuse, animal abuse, and military and police brutality, through the understanding that disposition to sadism and abuse is a personality trait that manifests itself in every day life. The true insights which can be derived from her work and those of other psychopathy researchers go much deeper than police brutality; they shed much needed light on the widespread relationship between evil and power. 171 *Association for Psychological Science, *\"[Everyday Sadists Take Pleasure In Others' Pain](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/everyday-sadists-take-pleasure-in-others-pain.html),\" September 12, 2013 * * * * Secondary Psychopathy Understanding the nature of psychopathy alone does not reveal the full picture. Numerous researchers have differentiated between 'primary psychopathy', that which is genetic, and 'secondary psychopathy', that which is acquired through environment.172, 173, 174 Unlike the primary psychopath, who is born with their condition and lacks entirely the capacity for empathy and other higher human emotions, the secondary psychopath occasionally manifests these traits. In other words, non-psychopathic individuals can exhibit psychopathic behaviors through the conditioning of their environment. Two well known studies in psychology underscore this. The first is the [Milgram Experiment](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/milgram_experiment). A volunteer would be placed at a booth with an apparatus that sends an electric shock to a person in another room. The volunteer believes the man in the other room is a fellow volunteer; in reality he is an actor that is not actually receiving electric shocks. The volunteer asks the actor a series of questions, a wrong answer means the use of an increasingly high voltage of shocking.

The volunteer asks the actor a series of questions, a wrong answer means the use of an increasingly high voltage of shocking. The volunteer would be prompted by a man in a lab coat to continue administering the shocks long after it had become unsafe. The verbal prodding would range between 'Please continue' and 'You have no other choice, you *must *continue'. After the shock reached 300 volts, the actor would stop answering, but the man in the lab coat would continue insisting on shocks. **Dr. Stanley Milgram repeatedly found that nearly 2/3rds of people would continue to the maximum voltage of 450, long after they had believed their peer to be incapacitated.** Regarding the experiment, Milgram wrote: \"Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process. Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, **relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority.\"** The second experiment is the [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/stanford_prison_experiment). Volunteers were asked to simulate a prison in Stanford's psychology hall; half of the participants simulated prisoners and the other half guards. The guards were told to make the prisoners feel powerless though not resort to violence. Zimbardo, the lead experimenter, found that many of the guards stepped far beyond the boundaries of what had been predicted, leading to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. A third of the guards had displayed 'genuine sadistic tendencies'. Some prisoners were emotionally traumatized and had to leave the experiment early. Zimbardo argued that his experiment shows that people internalize authority and submission. Though the nature of the Stanford Prison Experiment does not lend itself to empiricism, it does give some credence to the idea that 'power corrupts' and changes people. Furthermore, an experiment published in August 2012 by the *Journal of Experimental Psychology *showed definite psychological changes associated with power. It found that people who considered themselves in positions of power literally perceived the world around them differently.175 We would like to think that humanity has evolved since these experiments took place, and since the atrocities that were revealed after World War II. Unfortunately, this is not the case. **In 2008, the Stanley Milgram study was reproduced, with only slight alterations to conform to modern ethical standards, and found the exact same results: A vast majority of participants were willing to inflict significant pain on another human if pressured to do so by", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:38:dedb6deae071", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13240, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "the world around them differently.175 We would like to think that humanity has evolved since these experiments took place, and since the atrocities that were revealed after World War II.

Not long ago, it was revealed that the CIA made doctors and psychologists working at various Department of Defense institutions violate the ethical codes of their profession in order to become involved with the torture and degrading treatment of terror suspects.177 \"Medical professionals were in effect told that their ethical mantra \"first do no harm\" did not apply, because they were not treating people who were ill.\" - *The Guardian* The report, compiled by the Taskforce on Preserving Medical Professionalism in National Security Detention Centers, supported by the Institute on Medicine as a Profession (IMAP), found that doctors working with the Department of Defense and CIA routinely participated in waterboarding, sleep deprivation and force-feeding, the latter being against the rules of World Medical Association and the American Medical Association, while gathering and sharing intelligence. \"The American public has a right to know that the covenant with its physicians to follow professional ethical expectations is firm regardless of where they serve. It's clear that in the name of national security the military trumped that covenant, and physicians were transformed into agents of the military and performed acts that were contrary to medical ethics and practice. We have a responsibility to make sure this never happens again.\" - Dr Gerald Thomson, professor of medicine emeritus at Columbia University and member of the taskforce. While participation in waterboarding and force-feeding may not be shocking to the desensitized public's sensibilities, it is still very revealing that **physicians and psychologists who would otherwise balk at the suggestion that they would violate their professions ethical codes, do so without hesitation when it is done in the name of War. And after all, the United States did sentence Japanese war criminals to death for the act of waterboarding during the International Military Tribunal for the Far East following World War II.178** Armed with this context, it is easy to understand the ease with which psychopaths can manipulate institutions and societies.

It was not for consideration of land; that would be meted out later during the Yalta and Potsdam conferences. Nor was it to capture the Nazi leadership and bring them to trial for their heinous crimes against humanity. In fact, the goal was the opposite. The rush to secure Germany was much more about securing Germany's infrastructure: their leadership and the best minds in intelligence, science and industry. **NationalArchives.gov hosts a list of over 1,500 Nazis that were transferred into America, many of them rampant war criminals.182 It has been released to the public only in recent years thanks to the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act.

The project that oversaw this endeavor is known as Operation Paperclip** and was undertaken by the Office Of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA. President Harry Truman formally ordered the Operation in August 1945, but it had covertly begun months earlier, in May. Truman's orders expressly forbid the transfer of any person known \"to have been a member of the Nazi Party, and more than a nominal participant in its activities, or an active supporter of Nazi militarism\".183 This directive was not followed, for it would have prevented the acquisition of a lot of prominent Nazis such as Arthur Rudolph, who endorsed the usage of slave labor from concentration camps for the building of the V2 rocket184 and later became a prominent figure in NASA.185 More people would die building the V2 rocket - a number estimated at 60,000 - than were killed by it in combat.186 The dossiers of prominent Nazis brought into the United States such as Wernher von Braun cannot be found on the National Archives sheet; we can conclude that either identities were faked and whitewashed during the process, or the 1,500 names is an incomplete tally. Regardless, we can conclude that the order of Truman was not heeded, and **many former Nazis became entrenched within the United States science, intelligence and industrial industries, undoubtedly contributing to a web of psychopathic conditioning.** There are many interesting profiles of war criminals who found employment in the United States after the war. Krunoslav Draganovic, for example, was a Franciscan priest who actively served the Nazi satellite regime in Croatia, where they were responsible for over 350,000 deaths. He also facilitated the escape of numerous Croatian war criminals through the assets of the clergy. After the war, he was hired as a U.S. spy.187 **Kurt Blome was the director of the Nazi Biological Warfare program and former SS officer. He oversaw nerve gas experimentation on prisoners at Auschwitz, and established the bioweapons research center for Heinrich Himmler. One of his experiments involved inoculating prisoners with the plague and recording its progression.188 He was hired by the US Army Chemical Corps in 1951 to work on chemical warfare research.189** **The most interesting case study is that of Reinhard Gehlen, a Major General in the German Wehrmacht, close confidant of Hitler, and head of the German Army Intelligence on the Eastern Front.

The OSS found that Gehlen's knowledge of the Soviets that he had gained during World War II was so important that not only did they let him keep his job, he was able to maintain a vast majority of his infrastructure. What became known as the Gehlen organization functioned as a semi-autonomous intelligence unit for the United States and West Berlin, and employed over 100 former Gestapo and SS officers.190** \"The Gehlen Organization was the one group that did have networks inside Eastern Europe, and that is why we hired them... Hiring Gehlen was the biggest mistake the US ever made. Our allies said, 'You are putting Nazis at the senior levels of your intelligence', and they were right. The Gehlen organization was the primary source of intelligence that claimed that, 'The Soviets were about to attack West Germany' ...that was the biggest bunch of baloney then and it is still a bunch of baloney today. Gehlen had to make his money by creating a threat that we were afraid of, so we would give him more money to tell us about it. In my opinion, the Gehlen Organization provided nothing worthwhile for understanding or estimating Soviet military or political capabilities in Eastern Europe or anywhere else. The Gehlen organization had been penetrated by Soviet intelligence and many of the US Nazi assets were now double agents, taking CIA wages and turning around and selling information to the enemy.\" - Victor Marchetti, CIA Veteran and former Chief of Soviet Strategic War Plans191 The lack of internal security in the Gehlen Organization was egregious. One former Army Counter-Intelligence Corps officer lamented: \"Recruiting methods then employed were so loose that former German Officers and noncoms were blindly being approached to work for American Intelligence in espionage activity directed against the USSR.\"192 Not only did this mean that the Gehlen Organization became saturated with radical Nazis and other fascist elements, it also served as an easy entry of infiltration by the Soviet Union. The organization functioned semi-autonomously so strict controls over their operations was impossible. The Soviet press did not hesitate to use the Gehlen Organization as an effective propaganda tool, pointing out that the West had maintained the very intelligence unit that was responsible for a long series of crimes against humanity along the Eastern Front of the War. Future Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms stated that: \"The reports in the Soviet-dominated press in Germany concerning the use of former German staff and intelligence is such that there is no question that the Russians know this operation is going", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:43:8e2b7219765e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13245, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 44, "text": "to use the Gehlen Organization as an effective propaganda tool, pointing out that the West had maintained the very intelligence unit that was responsible for a long series of crimes against humanity along the Eastern Front of the War.

For example, the Red Cross and the Vatican collaborated to smuggle thousands of war criminals to safety immediately after the fall of Nazi Germany.198 They used underground passages known as 'ratlines' to keep the men out of sight. The Red Cross issued legitimate travel documents to many Nazi members: it is estimated that over 8,000 SS members ended up in Britain and Canada alone.

Many of the human guinea pigs were mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts and prostitutes - ''people who could not fight back,'' as one agency officer put it. In one case, a mental patient in Kentucky was dosed with LSD continuously for 174 days.\" - *New York Times*199** MK-ULTRA is the codename given to a CIA research operation into biological behavioral engineering, also known as mind control. Many people are familiar with the operation but incorrectly assume that it was limited to LSD research. While there were plenty of resources devoted to LSD research, it was only one area of a vast field of mind control operations. MK-ULTRA researcher Ike Feldman said himself that: **\"The LSD... that was just the tip of the iceberg... Espionage. Assassinations. Dirty tricks. Drug experiments. Sexual encounters and the study of prostitutes for clandestine use. That is what I was doing when I worked for George White and the CIA.\"200** MK-ULTRA had several precursors. There was Project Chatter in 1947, which tested drugs such as the infamous Scopolamine during interrogations.201 There was Project Bluebird in 1949, which began studies into hypnosis.202 The document describing the initiation of Project Bluebird outlines these special problems, among many others, that they were hoping to address: • Can we in a matter of an hour, two hours, one day, etc., induce an hypnotic condition in an unwilling subject to such an extent that he will perform an act for our benefit? • Can we create by post-hypnotic control an action contrary to an individual's basic moral principles? • Can we guarantee total amnesia under any and all conditions? • Can we \"alter\" a person's personality? How long will it hold? • Can we devise a system for making unwilling subjects into willing agents and then transfer that control to untrained agency agents in the field by use of codes or identifying signs or credentials?203 Project Artichoke began in 1951, with a scope of ... \"Can we get control of an individual", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:46:55143049fe5f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13248, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 47, "text": "to an individual's basic moral principles? • Can we guarantee total amnesia under any and all conditions? • Can we \"alter\" a person's personality?

Many of the projects were covertly run through front organizations without the knowledge of the institution that hosted them. **The experiments and operations under MK-ULTRA have been shrouded in extreme secrecy. When it was enacted, then-CIA Director Allen Dulles exempted the program from normal financial controls, allowed the Technical Services Staff to begin experiments without contracts or written agreements with leadership, and ordered the financial office to pay any cost blindly on the signature of Sidney Gottlieb.207 CIA Document 17748 states that:** **\"There are just two individuals in TSD who have full substantial knowledge of the program and most of that knowledge is unrecorded. Both are highly skilled, highly motivated, professionally competent individuals. Part of their competence lies in their command of intelligence tradecraft. In protecting the sensitive nature of the American intelligence capability to manipulate human behavior, they apply \"need to know\" doctrine to their professional associates and their clerical assistants to a maximum degree...** TSD has pursued a policy of minimum documentation in keeping with the high sensitivity of some of the projects... The lack of consistent records precludes use of routine inspection procedures and raised a variety of questions regarding management and fiscal controls.\"208 The two individuals the document refers to are likely [Sidney Gottlieb](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-sidney-gottlieb-80-dies-took-lsd-cia), the director of MK-ULTRA, and Richard Helms, the Deputy Director of the CIA. **In 1973, when Richard Helms became the Director of the CIA, he ordered all of the available MK-ULTRA files to be destroyed.209 Thanks to a clerical error, about 20,000 files survived the destruction order.** However, not only were most of the files destroyed, but many experiments were so sensitive that they were never recorded in the first place, so we must understand that as brutal and astonishing as the recorded experimentation is, we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg.

He would commute to the McGill University system in Canada to conduct experiments on brainwashing, 'psychic driving' and other forms of psychological torture. Cameron had a theory that a person with a psychological illness such as schizophrenia would benefit from having their brain essentially wiped clean, presuming the patient would redevelop their cognitive functions without the disorder. The CIA felt that brainwashing had obvious intelligence applications.211 **Dr. Cameron had a 'depatterning' program he used to erase the minds of his patients that began with 15 - 30 days of 'sleep therapy' (sometimes lasting as long as 65 days), where the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:48:1eb53b9f3ae3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13250, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 49, "text": "of psychological torture.

The next step was to play taped messages to a patient 16 hours a day for multiple months in an attempt to program the desired behavior.212 **Over half of his patients have suffered permanent amnesia of their lives before their 'depatterning'. They were not told that they would be participating in experiments prior to their admittance. A large group of Cameron's victims brought a lawsuit against the CIA in 1988 which was settled out of court, so the agency would not have to admit any official wrongdoing.** Why the interest in electroshock?

Dr. Cameron died in 1967. The money was provided to Dr. Cameron as part of the C.I.A.'s effort in the 1950's and 60's to develop drugs or techniques that could control human behavior. Patients of Dr. Cameron were subjected to a regimen that included heavy doses of LSD and barbiturates, the application of powerful electric shocks two or three times a day, and prolonged periods of drug-induced sleep.

The justification was that it was the only way to truly discover the reactions of the mind under stress and exposed to various mind control chemicals. **The policy was upheld even after it led to deaths. ** One high profile fatality was that of Dr. Frank Olson, a scientist from the Army Chemical Corps' Special Operations Division. During a joint Army-CIA gathering at Deep Creek Lodge in the woods of Northern Maryland, Sidney Gottlieb added LSD to the drinks of the few men in attendance, and did not inform them until the effects started to begin. Dr. Frank Olson was one of these men, and unlike his peers, he was not able to handle the effects of the psychedelic. His colleagues described his reaction as 'psychotic'. He survived the trip, but entered a deep depression and ended up jumping out a window of the window of a New York hotel a week later. **The death of Dr. Olsen prompted an internal review by the CIA of surreptitious testing, but the policy was resumed just a few months later.** One CIA document, issued nearly a decade after Olsen's death, affirmed the internal consensus of unwitting administration of drugs: \"(Officers) argued for the continuation of unwitting testing, using as the principal point that controlled testing cannot be depended upon for accurate results. General Carter, Mr. Kirkpatrick, and I do not disagree with this point.\"216 Another aspect of unwitting testing involves experimentation of children. Although most of MK-ULTRA experiments on minors has been covered up, a *New York Times *article from 1995 reveals a disturbing glimpse, stating that: **\"About 9000 Americans, including children and newborns, were used in 154 radiation tests sponsored by the Atomic Energy Commission,** the Energy Department's Cold War predecessor, Government officials said today...", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:50:e65884ccf74e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13252, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 51, "text": "be depended upon for accurate results.

(PDF Warning) * * * * Entrapment One program uncovered during the internal CIA review centered around George White, a CIA associate who formally worked for the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. The CIA considered White's position ideal, as it gave him unrestricted access to a variety of drugs without suspicion. Under CIA auspices, George White set up 'safehouses' in New York and later San Francisco, fully equipped with covert video and audio surveillance equipment. The goal was to study the use of prostitutes for covert intelligence.218 **\"TSS officials wanted to find out everything they could about how to apply sex to spying, and the prostitute project became a general learning and then training ground for CIA carnal operations.** After all, states one TSS official, \"We did quite a study of prostitutes and their behavior.... At first nobody really knew how to use them. How do you train them? How do you work them? How do you take a woman who is willing to use her body to get money out of a guy to get things which are much more important, like state secrets. I don't care how beautiful she is-educating the ordinary prostitute up to that level is not a simple task.\" - John Marks In addition to studying the use of prostitutes for clandestine use, the safehouses were used to administer drugs to the unwitting solicitors, after which the various effects would be recorded. At least a couple CIA veterans were willing to discuss the use of these safehouses for a more sinister operation: entrapment. John Marks' research of the over 20,000 declassified documents into MK-ULTRA shortly after their release in the mid 70's revealed the following shocking information: \"Gottlieb did not limit his interest to drugs. He and other TSS officials wanted to try out surveillance equipment. CIA technicians quickly installed see-through mirrors and microphones through which eavesdroppers could film, photograph, and record the action. 'Things go wrong with listening devices and two-way mirrors, so you build these things to find out what works and what doesn't,' says a TSS source.

'If you are going to entrap, you've got to give the guy pictures [flagrante delicto] and voice recordings. Once you learn how to do it so that the whole thing looks comfortable, cozy, and safe, then you can transport the technology overseas and use it.' This TSS man notes that the Agency put to work in the bedrooms of Europe some of the techniques developed in the George White safehouse operation.\"219 James Keehner, a former CIA psychologist, recalled his involvement in one entrapment case, in which he analyzed a nurse who had 'offered her body' for her country: **Keehner noted that he became disillusioned with entrapment cases, but that other officers 'got their jollies' from this type of work. Regarding his typical assignment, Keehner stated:** **\"I was sent to deal with the most negative aspects of the human condition. It was planned destructiveness. First, you'd check to see if you could destroy a man's marriage. If you could, then that would be enough to put a lot of stress on the individual, to break him down. Then you might start a minor rumor campaign against him. Harass him constantly. Bump his car in traffic. A lot of it is ridiculous, but it may have a cumulative effect.**\" Knowing that some officers got their 'jollies' from entrapment operations, and that safehouses were installed in the United States, the question \"Were entrapment techniques ever used against United States officials or other domestic people of importance?\" is logically raised. \"We wanted her to sleep with this Russian... Either the Russian would fall in love with her and defect, or we'd blackmail him. I had to see if she could sleep with him over a period of time and not get involved emotionally. Boy, was she tough!\"220 218 [1977 Joint Hearing Before the Select Committee on Intelligence](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/19770803-senate-intelligence-committee-project-mkultra.pdf) (PDF Warning) 219 John Marks, \"The Search for the Manchurian Candidate,\" [PDF available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/search-manchurian-candidate.pdf) 220 Ibid * * * * Personality Assessment Although MK-ULTRA was originally devoted to biological mind control, it quickly evolved into a program dedicated to understanding all aspects of the human psyche. George White's experiments tested how people reacted to entrapment, and other experiments tested how different types of people responded to alcohol. It is with this context that the CIA contacted Psychologist John Gittinger to become an instrumental part of MK-ULTRA.

George White's experiments tested how people reacted to entrapment, and other experiments tested how different types of people responded to alcohol. It is with this context that the CIA contacted Psychologist John Gittinger to become an instrumental part of MK-ULTRA. Gittinger had developed the Personality Assessment System, a test which would be administered to give fascinating insights into a person's personality and had distinct variables that separated his work from other known personality tests at the time such as the famous Weschler exam. Like Ewen Cameron, Gittinger received funding through the Human Ecology Society to research what type of personality would be likely to defect from their country, both to target foreign agents and to weed out domestic ones. At one point, Gittinger traveled to work with George White to use his test on prostitutes and homosexuals to refine his assessment test to figure out what type of sexual orientation someone likely had, and to figure out who had sexually deviant tendencies. One of Gittinger's colleagues stated that he knew of cases where the Personality Assessment System was used to identify targets for entrapment, both heterosexual and homosexual.221 **One particularly useful application of the Personality Assessment System was to identify people who would be easily hypnotized. It has likely been used extensively to hand-pick subjects and employees on sensitive projects within and beyond MK-ULTRA, assessing peoples personalities to discover who would retain secrecy and loyalty.** Interestingly, Gittinger was familiar enough with his test that he was able to observe someone's behavior and then retroactively apply the attributes to determine their personality type. By observing how a man held his cigarette, handled his alcohol, or interacted with women, Gittinger could profile that person and determine their weaknesses and propensity for exploitation through entrapment or other means. One logical application of the Personality Assessment System is the ability to assign certain people to a program that required secrecy, by determining how loyal an agent or asset would be to the Agency. 221 John Marks, \"The Search for the Manchurian Candidate,\" [PDF available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/search-manchurian-candidate.pdf) * * * * Hypnotism In mainstream culture, hypnotism is viewed as a type of 'science fiction', confined to the realm of magic tricks and entertainment. The truth is that hypnotism is very real and used both in mainstream psychology and in military intelligence. Hypnotism was used by the United States military before the creation of the CIA, during World War II. Psychologist Dr. George H. Estabrooks recalled his involvement in the clandestine program to *Science Digest *in 1971, in an article titled \"Hypnotism Comes of Age\". \"One of the most fascinating but dangerous applications of hypnosis is its use in military intelligence. This is a field with which I am familiar through formulating guidelines for the techniques used by the United States in two world wars.

Psychologist Dr. George H. Estabrooks recalled his involvement in the clandestine program to *Science Digest *in 1971, in an article titled \"Hypnotism Comes of Age\". \"One of the most fascinating but dangerous applications of hypnosis is its use in military intelligence. This is a field with which I am familiar through formulating guidelines for the techniques used by the United States in two world wars. Communication in war is always a headache. Codes can be broken. A professional spy may or may not stay bought. Your own man may have unquestionable loyalty but his judgment is always open to question. The \"hypnotic courier,\" on the other hand, provides a unique solution. I was involved in preparing many subjects for this work during World War II. One successful case involved an Army Service Corps Captain whom we'll call George Smith. Captain Smith had undergone months of training. He was an excellent subject but did not realize it. I had removed from him, by post hypnotic suggestion, all recollection of ever having been hypnotized. First I had the Service Corps call the captain to Washington and tell him they needed a report on the mechanical equipment of Division X headquartered in Tokyo. Smith was ordered to leave by jet next morning, pick up the report and return at once. These orders were given him in the waking state. Consciously, that was all he knew, and it was the story he gave his wife and friends. Then I put him under deep hypnosis, and gave him-orally-a vital message to be delivered directly on his arrival in Japan to a certain colonel-let's say his name was Brown-of military intelligence. Outside of myself, Colonel Brown was the only person who could hypnotize Captain Smith. This is \"locking.\" I performed it by saying to the hypnotized Captain: \"Until further orders from me, only Colonel Brown and I can hypnotize you. We will use the signal phrase 'the moon is clear.' Whenever you hear this phrase from Brown or myself you will pass instantly into deep hypnosis.\" When Captain Smith re-awakened, he had no conscious memory of what happened in trance. All that he was aware of was that he must head for Tokyo to pick up the division report. On arrival there, Smith reported to Brown, who hypnotized him with the signal phrase. Under hypnosis, Smith delivered my message and received one to bring back. Awakened, he was given the division report and returned home by jet. There I hypnotized him once more with the signal phrase, and he spieled off Brown's answer that had been dutifully tucked away in his unconscious mind. The system is virtually foolproof. As exemplified by the case, the information literally was \"locked\" in Smith's unconscious for retrieval by the only two people who knew the combination. The subject had no conscious memory", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:54:ff6c08404204", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13256, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "message and received one to bring back.

The subject had no conscious memory of what happened, so couldn't spill the beans. No one else could hypnotize him even if they might know the signal phrase...\" \"The potential for military intelligence has been nightmarish. **During World War II, I worked this technique with a vulnerable Marine lieutenant I'll call Jones. Under the watchful eye of Marine intelligence I split his personality into Jones A and Jones B. Jones A, once a \"normal\" working Marine, became entirely different. He talked communist doctrine and meant it. He was welcomed enthusiastically by communist cells, and was deliberately given a dishonorable discharge by the Corps (which was in on the plot) and became a card-carrying party member.** **The joker was Jones B, the second personality, formerly apparent in the conscious Marine. Under hypnosis, this Jones had been carefully coached by suggestion. Jones B was the deeper personality, knew all the thoughts of Jones A, was a loyal American and was \"imprinted\" to say nothing during conscious phases.** **All I had to do was hypnotize the whole man, get in touch with Jones B, the loyal American, and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp.** It worked beautifully for months with this subject, but the technique backfired. While there was no way for an enemy to expose Jones' dual personality, they suspected it and played the same trick on us later.\" - *Science Digest, *April 1971222 **It is pretty shocking to see that Estabrooks was willing to completely destroy the life of a marine by relegating his primary personality to an 'alternate' that would only appear when accessed through hypnosis.** It is more shocking that such an application of hypnotism is even possible. He noted that the potential for military intelligence was nightmarish but felt content that his knowledge was being used for the United States instead of the Nazis or the Russians. Unfortunately, corrupt elements in the United States, namely the CIA, would capitalize on this knowledge for illicit means in the near future. There are a variety of CIA documents released through the Freedom of Information Act that shed light on their hypnotism activities. One particularly disturbing example is MK-ULTRA document 190691. It describes an experiment where an unnamed CIA official hypnotized two subjects, both 19 year old women.

After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened and expressed complete amnesia for the entire sequence.\"** MK-ULTRA Document 190691 Not only was the CIA officer able to coerce otherwise peaceful subjects into violence, he was able to remove any memories of the event after they 'woke up' from the hypnotism. MK-ULTRA Document 190527 MK-ULTRA Document 190527 reveals that through hypnotic suggestion, one subject was coerced into setting up an incendiary bomb and leaving the device in a bathroom.224 The document states that even with unforeseen problems in location availability during the hypnotic state, the experiment was: \"...carried off without any difficulty or hesitation on the part of either of the girls... Throughout, their movements were easy and natural, and (bystanders) were, to all intents and purposes, completely unaware of what was taking place although they could clearly observe the movements of [redacted] and [redacted].\" Dr. Estabrooks once noted that only one in five people were susceptible to hypnotism in this manner. True to form, the CIA researched ways to improve to hypnotic susceptibility in their subjects, and found some success by combining techniques with administering drugs. A document titled *Continuation of Studies on Hypnosis and Suggestibility *states: \"Preliminary clinical research during 1955-56 has yielded promising leads in terms of knowledge of how hypnotizability can be influenced by pharmacological means.

What is the possibility that psychopaths would use this knowledge to exploit women sexually? Perhaps the most disturbing CIA document of all is numbered 140393 and details a CIA interview with a professional hypnotist who was asked to give an instructional course in hypnotism to CIA agents. It states:** **\"On July 2 1951 approximately 1:00 pm the instruction began with [redacted] relating to the student some of his sexual experiences. [Redacted] stated that he constantly used hypnotism as a means of inducing young girls to engage in sexual intercourse with him.

[Redacted] stated that he first put her into a hypnotic trance and then suggested to her that he was her husband and she desired sexual intercourse with him. [Redacted] further stated that many times while going home he would use hypnotic suggestion to have a girl turn around and talk to him and suggest sexual intercourse to him and that as a result of these suggestions he spent approximately five nights a week away from his home engaging in sexual intercourse.\"226** It is nothing short of terrifying to read how interested the CIA was in methods of rape. The fact that this was beyond any application to intelligence is an afterthought. The document finishes by describing how the student of the hypnotism instructor was able to successfully use his newly-learned techniques on new subjects, indicating that hypnotism was able to spread throughout the ranks of the CIA relatively effortlessly. When Operation Bluebird first began, marking the beginnings of research into hypnosis, one early document revealed a surprising goal: \"Can we \"condition\" by post-hypnotic suggestion agency employees (or persons of interest to this agency) to prevent them from giving information to any unauthorized source or for committing any act on behalf of a foreign or domestic enemy?\"227 This raises the distinct and disturbing possibility that the act of hypnotizing agency members for the purpose of altering their behavior became a common practice at the CIA under MK-ULTRA, with the power of what suggestions to induce at the hands of only two psychopathic men. 222 *Science Digest, *\"[Hypnotism Comes of Age](http://www.whale.to/b/estabrooks.html),\" April 1971 223 [Declassified CIA document 190691](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/foia_mind_control/190691_assassins_programmed_mind_control).

The available evidence clearly shows that this is a lie. From the documents that survived Director Helm's destruction order, we can already see the potential for a 'Manchurian candidate': a mind controlled assassin. ** So what happened to MK-ULTRA? 14 year CIA veteran Victor Marchetti has stated in numerous interviews that the claim MK-ULTRA was halted was merely a cover-story, and that the operation went completely black, in other words, research continued at the highest level of secrecy.228 **Is it possible that academic research into hypnosis and other organic forms of mind control have been deliberately marginalized from mainstream entertainment, media and academics in order to keep its potential use within a military-industrial complex a secret?** After all, MK-ULTRA researcher Dr. Ewen Cameron became the president of the World Psychiatric Association in 1961 and also served as presidents of the Canadian and American Psychiatric Associations.229 It is important to reiterate that not only does the available evidence of MK-ULTRA comprise a very small portion of the documents that were created, but many of the experiments were never recorded in the first place. The operation was presided over by only two individuals who had a complete knowledge of the operations. Not even the Director of the CIA had full access. When John F. Kennedy appointed John McCone as the new director in the wake of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Richard Helms declined to inform him about the more sensitive MK- ULTRA operations, such as George White's safehouses.230 Ultimately, the goal of MK-ULTRA was not to find the 'holy grail' of mind control but to map out a complete knowledge of human nature and the human mind, and then find ways to exploit it. This was done on both individual and group levels. We have no idea how much was accomplished towards this goal, or how much more developed the mind control research has gotten in the 50 years that have passed since the available documents were last issued. After all, if this is what the CIA was able to accomplish in the 1950's, what are they capable of today? 228 *Telegraph,*\"[Histories Greatest Conspiracy Theories](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/howaboutthat/3477148/The-greatest-conspiracy-theories-in-history.html?image=20)\" 229 Research from Historian John Simpkin, [available here](http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKcameronDE.htm). 230 Church Committee's Assassination report, pp. 102-3 * *", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:58:41da0cca817f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13260, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 59, "text": "levels.

Theirs is a tale of secret arms caches and exotic code names, of military stratagems and political intrigues. At best, their tale is no more than a curious footnote to the cold war. The question is if, at worst, it could be the key to unsolved terrorism dating back two decades... The focus of the inquiry is a clandestine operation code-named Gladio, created decades ago to arm and train resistance fighters in case the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies invaded. All this week, there have been disclosures of similar organizations in virtually all Western European countries, including those that do not belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\" - *New York Times*231 How far would the United States go to prevent the spread of communism in Western Europe?

Witnesses withheld information to cover right-wing extremists.\"233 Casson points to a 1972 car bombing in Peteano that killed three paramilitary police and was blamed on leftists, after which 200 Communists were immediately arrested. He found that there were no police investigations of the scene, and the official report was a forgery.234 In fact, it was perpetrated by a right-wing terrorist named Vincenzo Vinciguerra,235 operating under Gladio orders, who later confessed to the crime. Vinciguerra's testimony reveals that it was easy to escape and remain hidden because everyone in the Italian security apparatus shared his anti-Communist convictions.236 His testimony further revealed \"a secret organisation, a super-organisation with a network of communications, arms, and explosives, and men trained to use them.\"237 **Years later, in prison, he would claim \"I say that every single outrage that followed from 1969 fitted into a single organised matrix.\"238** Nearly 2,000 people would die from political murder or acts of terrorism over this period of time. **When ex-Prime Minister Andreotti finally testified in 1990, he revealed that arms and equipment were provided by the CIA and placed in 139 underground caches across the country. General Giandelio Maletti, a former head of Italian counterintelligence, in March 2001 confirmed the CIA involvement. He stated that after the Piazza Fontana bombing in 1969, pieces of a bomb were planted in a leftist editors villa in order to blame the communists.** He stated: \"The CIA, following the directives of its government, wanted to create an Italian nationalism capable of halting what it saw as a slide to the left, and, for this purpose, it may have made use of right-wing terrorism.\"239 232 [Judge Felice Casson's Wikipedia", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:60:329367a8ea1f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13262, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 61, "text": "counterintelligence, in March 2001 confirmed the CIA involvement.

During the Cold War, Turkey shared a third of the total borders with the Soviet bloc and maintained the largest standing army in Europe, and the second in NATO after the United States. In 1952, a stay-behind army was organized under the codename 'Counter-Guerrilla'. \"On November 3 (1996), a truck crashed into a Mercedes Benz in Susurluk, ninety miles south of Istanbul, and killed three Turkish passengers: a fugitive heroin smuggler and hitman, a former high-ranking police officer, and a former 'Miss Cinema.' The lone survivor was a right-wing member of parliament. In the car's trunk, police found a forged passport, police identification papers, ammunition, silencers, and machine guns. Abdullah Catli, the fugitive heroin smuggler, had escaped from a Swiss prison. The dead beauty queen, Gonca Uz, was his girlfriend. The police officer was Huseyin Kocadag, head of a Turkish police academy and a former Istanbul deputy police chief who reportedly organized hit squads in the southeast that kill Kurdish guerrillas and their supporters. The survivor, Sedat Bucak, a member of parliament from the conservative True Path Party, is reportedly in charge of 2,000 Kurdish mercenaries paid by the government to fight Kurdish guerrillas. The car crash has created a sensation in Turkey and has led parliament to hold hearings on the ties linking the True Path Party, the police, and thugs like Abdullah Catli.

Even though there was no Soviet occupation, some of the groups did take up arms against left-wing dissidents in their own countries. Some descendants of these groups are still at it, especially in Turkey.** Abdullah Catli was one of those. \"The accident unveiled the dark liaisons within the state,\" former prime minister Bulent Ecevit told parliament in December. Now leader of a small opposition social-democratic party, Ecevit knows a lot about those liaisons. He first told me about them - and the American connection - back in 1990, when I interviewed him in his Ankara office.\" - *The Progressive*240 Bulent Ecevit, five time Turkish prime minister, who is cited in the above quote, declared that the Taksim Square massacre was a Gladio operation, where half a million citizens had rallied. It was organized by trade unions, and the shooting lasted for 20 minutes while a thousand policemen in attendance did not intervene. About 40 people were killed, and though none of the perpetrators were caught, 500 demonstrators were detained. The massacre occurred during a broader wave of political violence.241 The U.S. State Department in its 1995 Human Rights report noted that: \"Prominent credible human rights organizations, Kurdish leaders, and local Kurds asserted that the government acquiesces in, or even carries out, the murder of civilians... Human rights groups reported the widespread and credible belief that a Counter-Guerrilla group associated with the security forces had carried out at least some 'mystery killings'\".242 American journalist Lucy Komisar, when asking U.S. officials about investigating the human rights reports, was told \"That's classified.\" The Turkish military would likewise block all investigations in their country.243 **There is evidence of Gladio operatives extensively operating torture campaigns for political purposes. For example, Talhat Turhan, former Turkey General, survived torture at the hands of special forces. He was told \"...I was now 'in the hands of a Counter Guerrilla unit operating under the high command of the Army outside the constitution and the laws.' They told me that they 'considered me as their prisoner of war and that I was sentenced to death.'\"244** Much of the violence was directed at the Kurdish minority. In 1984 the Counter-Guerrillas were behind the brutal crackdown that would kill and torture thousands over the next five years. Among other operations, Counter-Guerrillas would dress up as PKK members (A Kurdish political party) and attacked villages, raping and executing people randomly.245 The political violence in Turkey, with Gladio operatives responsible to at least a moderate extent, paved the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:62:e9bf3fdc9f39", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13264, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "their prisoner of war and that I was sentenced to death.'\"244** Much of the violence was directed at the Kurdish minority.

A 1996 *New York Times *article notes that: \"evidence suggests that officially sanctioned criminality may have reached levels that few had imagined... **One of Turkey's most prominent pro-Kurdish politicians, Guven Ozata, said the car crash and its aftermath had convinced him that state-sponsored death squads were behind many of the estimated 3,500 unsolved killings that have been committed in the southeastern part of the country in the last decade. Most of the victims had been suspected of sympathizing with separatist Kurdish causes.** ''These gangs have a direct link with mystery killings,'' Mr. Ozata said at a news conference. ''This is no longer a hypothesis or a guess. It is a reality acknowledged by government officials.'' **Several politicians and others who are calling for investigations into the government's relationship with criminal gangs believe that the gangs used their official ties as cover for involvement in Turkey's lucrative heroin-smuggling trade. They suspect that senior officials were engaged in the trade or tolerated it as a way of repaying gangs that killed at their behest.\" - *New York Times*246** The evidence of Gladio operations in Turkey reveal another important link: The collusion between paramilitary forces and drug traffickers. At the time (and to this day), Turkey served as a major hub in the smuggling of drugs into Western Europe, from the Southeast Asian 'Golden Triangle' and later the Middle East. **It is likely that drugs served as a significant source of funding for these decentralized operations and was the catalyst for a bond between the state and the criminal underworld that ensured massive corruption in the country that exists to this day. After all, we know that the Gehlen Organization was involved in the black market in the area to raise extra funds for their intelligence operations. It seems that this practice spread throughout the web of 'stay-behind' armies financed and armed by the CIA and NATO.** 240 *The Progressive, *\"[Turkey ́s Terrorists: A CIA Legacy Lives On](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Turkey%27s%2Bterrorists%3A%2Ba%2BCIA%2Blegacy%2Blives%2Bon.-a019254727),\" April 1, 1997 241 Ganser ́s *Whitehead Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations, *page 73 242 Ganser's *NATO's Secret Army, *page 20 243 Ibid. 244 Ganser ́s *Whitehead Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations, *page 74 245 Ganser's *NATO's Secret Army, *page 240 246 *New York Times, *\"[Scandal Links Turkish Aides to Death, Drugs and Terror](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/10/world/scandal-links-turkish-aides-to-deaths-drugs-and-terror.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm)\", December 10, 1996 * * *", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:63:6488717a45c8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13265, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 64, "text": "and armed by the CIA and NATO.** 240 *The Progressive, *\"[Turkey ́s Terrorists: A CIA Legacy Lives On](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Turkey%27s%2Bterrorists%3A%2Ba%2BCIA%2Blegacy%2Blives%2Bon.-a019254727),\" April 1, 1997 241 Ganser ́s *Whitehead Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations, *page 73 242 Ganser's *NATO's Secret Army, *page 20 243 Ibid. 244 Ganser ́s *Whitehead Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations, *page 74 245 Ganser's *NATO's Secret Army, *page 240 246 *New York Times, *\"[Scandal Links Turkish Aides to Death, Drugs and Terror](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/10/world/scandal-links-turkish-aides-to-deaths-drugs-and-terror.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm)\", December 10, 1996 * * * * Greece One of the countries that suffered the most from the Cold War terrorism groups was Greece, the country with perhaps the most significant propensity for the rise of a natural leftist coalition.

Each of the several groups was trained and equipped to act as an autonomous guerrilla unit, capable of mobilizing and carrying on guerrilla warfare with minimal or no outside direction.\"247** These groups were equipped with automatic weapons and small mountain mortars stashed in underground caches throughout the country.248 The group was involved with the 1967 coup, where leftists were widely reported to have large leads in the polls. As NATO orders were to prevent any type of leftist 'insurgency', the group took over the Greece Defense Ministry, rolled into Athens, took control of communications centers, Parliament, the Royal Palace, and arrested over 10,000 people, many of whom were tortured.249 247 Len Scott, \"Intelligence, Crisis and Security.\" [http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=MS_cAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=%E2%80%9CThe%2BGreek-American%2BCIA%2Bofficer%2Brecruited%2Bseveral%2Bgroups%2Bof%2BGreek%2Bcitizens%2Bfor%2Bwhat%2Bthe%2BCIA%2Bcalled%2B%E2%80%98a%2Bnucleus%2Bfor%2Brallying%2Ba%2Bcitizen%2Barmy%2Bagainst%2Bthe&source=bl&ots=0GpTLFblo7&sig=3Yq62aNUVVeQhMfkdf-s_NwpSbw&hl=es-419&sa=X&ei=m5VYUt-ZBYPQ9ASymIGIBw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA%23v%3Donepage&q=%E2%80%9CThe%20Greek-American%20CIA%20officer%20recruited%20several%20groups%20of%20Greek%20citizens%20for%20what%20the%20CIA%20called%20%E2%80%98a%20nucleus%20for%20rallying%20a%20citizen%20army%20against%20the&f=false](http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=MS_cAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=%E2%80%9CThe%2BGreek-American%2BCIA%2Bofficer%2Brecruited%2Bseveral%2Bgroups%2Bof%2BGreek%2Bcitizens%2Bfor%2Bwhat%2Bthe%2BCIA%2Bcalled%2B%E2%80%98a%2Bnucleus%2Bfor%2Brallying%2Ba%2Bcitizen%2Barmy%2Bagainst%2Bthe&source=bl&ots=0GpTLFblo7&sig=3Yq62aNUVVeQhMfkdf-s_NwpSbw&hl=es-419&sa=X&ei=m5VYUt-ZBYPQ9ASymIGIBw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA%23v%3Donepage&q=%E2%80%9CThe%20Greek-American%20CIA%20officer%20recruited%20several%20groups%20of%20Greek%20citizens%20for%20what%20the%20CIA%20called%20%E2%80%98a%20nucleus%20for%20rallying%20a%20citizen%20army%20against%20the&f=false)[Excerpt available here](http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=MS_cAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=%E2%80%9CThe%2BGreek-American%2BCIA%2Bofficer%2Brecruited%2Bseveral%2Bgroups%2Bof%2BGreek%2Bcitizens%2Bfor%2Bwhat%2Bthe%2BCIA%2Bcalled%2B%E2%80%98a%2Bnucleus%2Bfor%2Brallying%2Ba%2Bcitizen%2Barmy%2Bagainst%2Bthe&source=bl&ots=0GpTLFblo7&sig=3Yq62aNUVVeQhMfkdf-s_NwpSbw&hl=es-419&sa=X&ei=m5VYUt-ZBYPQ9ASymIGIBw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA%23v%3Donepage&q=%E2%80%9CThe%20Greek-American%20CIA%20officer%20recruited%20several%20groups%20of%20Greek%20citizens%20for%20what%20the%20CIA%20called%20%E2%80%98a%20nucleus%20for%20rallying%20a%20citizen%20army%20against%20the&f=false). 248 Ganser ́s *Whitehead Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations, *page 77 249 Ibid. * * * * Conclusion **Although the CIA and NATO have steadfastly refused to acknowledge the existence of Gladio, giving them deniability from ever having to disclose documents related to the operation, the existence of these fascist and violent underground networks has been acknowledged by the governments of nearly every NATO country.

Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti confirmed that the last coordination meeting he was aware of was held in 1990.251 It has to be noted that this was a period of time where terrorism was evolving, moving towards the widespread radical Islamic terror that bombards our television screens daily, just three years before the first World Trade Center bombing and two years after the creation of Al-Qaeda.

We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars a year just for that... close to a billion dollars are being spent every year by the United States on secret propaganda.\" - Testimony of William Schaap to Congress252** In 1948, the United States began the Marshall Plan, an initiative to help the devastated Europe recover from the War. The CIA decided to siphon funds to create the Office of Policy Coordination, which would become the covert action branch of the Agency.253 It was under this program that **Operation Mockingbird, a domestic propaganda campaign aimed at promoting the views of the CIA within the media, began. From the onset, Operation Mockingbird was one of the most sensitive of the CIA's operations, with recruitment of journalists and training of intelligence officers for propaganda purposes usually undertaken by Director Allen Dulles himself or his direct peers.254** It is a false belief that the CIA 'infiltrated' unwitting media institutions. **The recruitment of journalists was frequently done with complicity from top management and ownership.

Former CIA Director William Colby claimed during the Church Committee investigative hearings, \"Lets go to the managements. They were witting.\" Among the organizations that would lend their help to the propaganda efforts was the *New York Times, Newsweek*, Associated Press, and the *Miami Herald*. Providing cover to CIA agents was a part of the *New York Times *policy, set by their late publisher, Arthur Hays Salzberger.255** The investigative committee of Frank Church, officially titled \"Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities\", uncovered a lot of evidence concerning Operation Mockingbird and came to the conclusion that: \"The CIA currently maintains a network of several hundred foreign individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt to influence opinion through the use of covert propaganda. These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of newspapers and periodicals, scores of press services and news agencies, radio and television stations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign media outlets.\"256 [Carl Bernstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Bernstein), the reporter famous for his excellent investigation into the Watergate scandal, wrote that: \"(Joseph) Alsop is one of more than 400 American journalists who in the past twenty-five years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents on file at CIA headquarters. Some of these journalists' relationships with the Agency were tacit; some were explicit. There was cooperation, accommodation and overlap. Journalists provided a full range of clandestine services-from simple intelligence gathering to serving as go betweens with spies in Communist countries. **Reporters shared their notebooks with the CIA. Editors shared their staffs. Some of the journalists were Pulitzer Prize winners, distinguished reporters who considered themselves ambassadors without portfolio for their country. **Most were less exalted: foreign correspondents who found that their association with the Agency helped their work; stringers and freelancers who were as interested in the derring-do of the spy business as in filing articles; and, the smallest category, full-time CIA employees masquerading as journalists abroad. In many instances, CIA documents show, journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the managements of America's leading news organizations.\"257 **While a majority of Mockingbird operations were overseas, the goal was to have important, hard-hitting stories to be circulated in the American press.** Relationships with major United States media institutions certainly helped with this goal. Bernstein lists *The New York Times, CBS *and *Time inc. *as the most productive relationships the agency cultivated.

Bernstein lists *The New York Times, CBS *and *Time inc. *as the most productive relationships the agency cultivated. They also created front organizations overseas who publicly maintained an appearance of free press but privately were operated by the agency. An example of this is the *Rome Daily American, *which was 40% owned by the CIA for three decades.258 Another strategy was developing relationships with major media owners who were known to harbor right-wing views, such as William Paley of *CBS*, and then passing on information of journalists, actors and screenwriters who harbored left-wing views. Information was also passed on to friendly congressmen such as Joseph McCarthy. These men and women would then be blacklisted from the industry. Lee J. Cobb was one such actor who was blacklisted, and recalled his experience: \"When the facilities of the government of the United States are drawn on an individual it can be terrifying. The blacklist is just the opening gambit - being deprived of work. Your passport is confiscated. That's minor. But not being able to move without being tailed is something else. After a certain point it grows to implied as well as articulated threats, and people succumb. My wife did, and she was institutionalized. In 1953 the HCUA (House UnAmerican Activities Committee) did a deal with me. I was pretty much worn down. I had no money. I couldn't borrow. I had the expenses of taking care of the children. Why am I subjecting my loved ones to this? If it's worth dying for, and I am just as idealistic as the next fellow. But I decided it wasn't worth dying for, and if this gesture was the way of getting out of the penitentiary I'd do it. I had to be employable again.\"259 **The CIA went as far as to write scripts for Hollywood. One interesting example is the funding of the movie version of Animal Farm in 1954, a book written just less than a decade earlier by George Orwell which enjoyed large commercial success. The problem for the CIA was that Orwell was a socialist, and his book attacked both capitalism and communism. To avoid this conflict, the CIA changed the ending of the Hollywood version to portray capitalism in a more positive light.260** Domestic surveillance was also used on journalists who had published classified material. In one example, a physical surveillance post was set up at a Hilton Hotel in view of the office of *Washington Post *writer Michael Getler.261 The operation defied the CIA's charter, which specifically prohibits", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:67:d4b12bcc9db3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13269, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 68, "text": "that Orwell was a socialist, and his book attacked both capitalism and communism.

In one example, a physical surveillance post was set up at a Hilton Hotel in view of the office of *Washington Post *writer Michael Getler.261 The operation defied the CIA's charter, which specifically prohibits domestic spying. The operation was directed towards numerous members of the Washington press corp, and was signed off by John F. Kennedy himself, in coordination with CIA director John McCone.262 **One CIA document states: \"Get books published or distributed abroad without revealing any U.S. Influence, by covertly subsidizing foreign publicans or booksellers... Get books published for operational reasons, regardless of commercial viability\". The Church Committee concluded that over 1000 books were published under this directive.263** Some investigative journalists have claimed that Operation Mockingbird did not end in 1976 as the CIA claims. For example, in 1998, researcher Steve Kangas claimed that conservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, who ran 'Forum World Features', a foreign news organization, was a CIA asset and used the organization to disseminate propaganda for circulation in the United States.264 Kangas ended up dead with a bullet hole in his head, in the office of Richard Scaife. It was ruled a suicide, although there were discrepancies in the police report and the autopsy.265 The Church Committee's conclusion accurately reflects the problems associated with Operation Mockingbird: \"In examining the CIA's past and present use of the U.S. media, the Committee finds two reasons for concern. The first is the potential, inherent in covert media operations, for manipulating or incidentally misleading the American public. The second is the damage to the credibility and independence of a free press which may be caused by covert relationships with the U.S. journalists and media organizations.\"266 While it is deplorable for citizens of countries to be subjected to a state-owned media, at least they can be aware of the biases and filter information accordingly. **We have been taught a lie from birth that the U.S. press is free from government meddling. In a situation where the manipulation is completely covert, the American public has been left unaware of the propaganda they have been ingesting for decades.** ------------------ 252 Testimony [available here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbnxsPgcsH0).

Clark fired his shotgun, the only shot fired by the Panthers that day, while the police and FBI would end up shooting 98 times.270 Forensics and firearms experts determined that Clark's shot was fired from very near the floor, indicating that Clark had already sustained grave injuries. The raid team would then assault the room of Fred Hampton, a rising leader in the Panther movement. Police would fire twice at Hampton, who was lying next to his pregnant girlfriend, hitting his shoulder. Court transcripts revealed the following conversation took place:271 \"That's Fred Hampton.\" \"Is he dead?... Bring him out.\" \"He's barely alive. \"He'll make it. Two more shots were fired, point blank at Hampton's head. \"He's good and dead now.\" Crime Scene from Fred Hampton's Bedroom Over a dozen more Panthers residing in the apartment would be wounded, beaten, and then charged with attempted murder of police officers. The next day, the media largely defended the FBI's actions. The *Chicago Tribune *published photos showing holes purported to be from bullets fired by the Panthers, but forensics would later reveal these holes to have been made by nails.272 Documents released by the Freedom of Information Act include a sketch of Hampton's apartment drawn by an FBI informant, used by police and FBI in the assassination. The informant received $300 from the FBI for providing the information.273 **The FBI had tried other methods before resorting to assassination, including sending a bogus letter to a rival Chicago gang leader in hopes of provoking a violent retaliation** which read: \"Brother Jeff: I've spent some time with some Panther friends on the west side lately and I know whats been going on.

They also advocated for community control of police, schools and other institutions. Today, these points are largely ignored in favor of the racist caricature promoted by the Bureau. The operations the FBI took to subvert the Panthers is truly astounding. **For example, there is the Black Panther coloring book, created by the FBI and distributed by Bureau informants to black children in an attempt to marginalize the Party within the black community.277 It is directly related to Hoover's directive:** **\"4.

The coloring book aimed to do just that, and would certainly be shocking to anyone who saw it. Once marginalized, the public would support increasingly repressive policies against the Panthers and their leadership, such as the Fred Hampton assassination. To J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, it did not matter what the activities of the Black Panther Party consisted of. **In 1969, an FBI special agent sent Hoover a memo detailing how his investigation of the Panthers had only turned up pacifist activities such as feeding breakfast to children.278 Hoover shot back a memo saying that the agent's career ambitions were directly related to supplying Hoover with information supporting his view that the Panthers were \"... a violence prone organization seeking to overthrow the government by revolutionary means.\"279** **To prevent the unification of the Black Panther Party and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, popularly known as SNCC, the FBI resorted to fostering splits between the leadership of the two organizations. The FBI targeted Stokely Carmichael by using a technique known as 'bad jacket': they forged documents indicating that Carmichael was a CIA informant.280 It worked.** The FBI also had the policy of arresting Panther members for any reason, even just on suspicion of crime without evidence, for the purpose of exhausting the Party's funds to pay bonds. The Panther's attorney said in 1970: \"In a period of two years - December, 1967 to December, 1969 - the Black Panther Party has expended in bail-bond premiums alone - just the premiums, that is, money that will never be returned - a sum in excess of $200,000! How many breakfasts or lunches for hungry children, how much medical attention sorely needed in the ghetto communities would that $200,000 have furnished? In the same two-year period, twenty-eight Panthers were killed.\"281 In instances where dozens of Panthers were arrested, the bond requirements were too high to pay and members sat in jail for weeks, or even months, a common COUNTELPRO tactic used against other groups as well. By 1974, the Black Panther Party had essentially collapsed under the weight of ruthless harassment. 277 The Coloring Book is hosted in various places, it is [available here](https://web.archive.org/web/20130726203047/http://www3.nd.edu/~dmyers/courses/old/102au98/blpan.html) at NotreDame.edu 278 Memo [available here](http://www.publiceye.org/liberty/FBI_Files/CA/state-ca.html). 279 Ibid. 280 \"COINTELPRO Papers,\" page 147 281 Ibid, page 164 * * * * Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1957, the FBI targeted the Southern Christian Leadership", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:72:26dc5477acbd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13274, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 73, "text": "in jail for weeks, or even months, a common COUNTELPRO tactic used against other groups as well.

It was founded by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and several other southern black ministers. By 1964, Dr. King had given his 'I have a dream speech' and had emerged as a preeminent civil rights leader and had also began to address social change that transcended racial issues. At this point, the FBI had marked King as a clear threat to the 'established order'. **Agent William C. Sullivan committed to writing:** **\"We must mark [King] now, if we have not before, as the most dangerous Negro in the future of this Nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro, and national security... it maybe unrealistic to limit [our actions against King] to legalistic proofs that would stand up in court or before Congressional Committees.\"283** **When it was announced that King would win the Nobel Prize, the FBI compiled an audio tape consisting of various fragments of conversations from King's tapped phones, bugged offices and hotel rooms. It was purported to demonstrate that King was a sexual deviant.** It was sent to King with an anonymous note stating that it would be released to the press unless he committed suicide prior to receiving the award.284 When King failed to reply, FBI Associate Director Cartha DeLoach offered the contents of the tape to various news institutions, including *Newsweek, *but the reporters nearly universally declined to report on the story.

Although public memory has largely forgotten, King was in the process of organizing the 'Poor Peoples Campaign', aimed at uniting poor people of all races to rally for social change.

As the movement rose to prominence, the FBI marked them as an 'extremist organization' to target.287 One document released under the Freedom of Information Act advocates that: \"local police put [AIM] leaders under close scrutiny, and arrest them on every possible charge until they could no longer make bail.\"288** During a presentation by members of the Congressional Black Caucus to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, it was alleged that virtually every known leader of AIM had been imprisoned in state or federal prisons, some repeatedly. Russell Means, for example, was charged with 37 counts but not one held up in court.289 It was later revealed that the FBI had infiltrated Mean's defense team but was still unable to pin their charges against him. In 1973, thousands of Native Americans from reservations across the West had gathered at Wounded Knee at the Pine Ridge reservation to simultaneously commemorate the 1890 massacre and protest the political corruption of tribal president Dick Wilson, who had received $62,000 from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and was using it to fund a private force that suppressed opposition and often resorted to murder.290 The force designated themselves \"Guardians of the Oglala Nation\", abbreviated as GOONS. Attempts to impeach Wilson, who was responsible for years of political violence, had failed. The FBI considered the occupation an act of treason and began a siege of AIM members, in coordination with US Marshalls, agents from the BIA and the GOONS of Dick Wilson. Wilson bluntly declared in a speech that \"AIM will die at Wounded Knee\".291 According to Historian Rex Weyler, who obtained documents subpoenaed from the Pentagon, the U.S. Marshall Service: \"...directed the employment of 17 APCs [armored personnel carriers], 130,000 rounds of M-16 ammunition,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:74:fc9ba286a6c2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13276, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 75, "text": "years of political violence, had failed.

By the end, hundreds of thousands of rounds were fired at AIM positions, two AIM members were killed, 14 seriously injured, and eight 'disappeared'. In the 36 months that proceeded the end of the Pine Ridge standoff, more than 60 AIM members died violently on or near Pine Ridge.293 The Civil Rights Commission revealed that AIM was right to feel aggrieved during the occupation of Pine Ridge: The FBI had been complicit in rigging the 1974 Pine Ridge elections against AIM members.294 286 Ward Churchill, \"Agents of Repression.\" [Excerpt available here](http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=uP8YRoyyNVwC&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=They%2B%5Bthe%2BIndians%5D%2Bare%2Ba%2Bconquered%2Bnation%2C%2Band%2Bwhen%2Byou%2Bare%2Bconquered%2C%2Bthe%2Bpeople%2Byou%2Bare%2Bconquered%2Bby%2Bdictate%2Byour%2Bfuture.%2BThis%2Bis%2Ba%2Bbasic%2Bphilosophy%2Bof%2Bmine.%2BIf%2BI%27m%2Bpart%2Bof%2Ba%2Bconquered%2Bnation%2C%2BI%27ve%2Bgot%2Bto%2Byield%2Bto%2Bauthority...%2B%5BThe%2BFBI%2Bmust%2Bfunction%2Bas%5D%2Ba%2Bcolonial%2Bpolice%2Bforce.%E2%80%9D%2B-%2BAssistent%2BSpecial%2BAgent%2Bin%2BCharge%2BNorman%2BZigrossi&source=bl&ots=7_6wkrfkqK&sig=skuoZ8z2cy1hzjv9ptRnRrb-1L8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WbgVU9WeNMP7kQfJtIG4DQ&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA%23v%3Donepage&q=They%20%5Bthe%20Indians%5D%20are%20a%20conquered%20nation%2C%20and%20when%20you%20are%20conquered%2C%20the%20people%20you%20are%20conquered%20by%20dictate%20your%20future.%20This%20is%20a%20basic%20philosophy%20of%20mine.%20If%20I%27m%20part%20of%20a%20conquered%20nation%2C%20I%27ve%20got%20to%20yield%20to%20authority...%20%5BThe%20FBI%20must%20function%20as%5D%20a%20colonial%20police%20force.%E2%80%9D%20-%20Assistent%20Special%20Agent%20in%20Charge%20Norman%20Zigrossi&f=false). 287 Documents [available here.](http://www.whale.to/b/cointelpro_7.html) 288 \"The COINTEPRO Papers,\" page 280 289 *The Guardian, *\"[Russell Means obituary](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/01/russell-means),\" November 1, 2012 290 A Presentation to the United Nations Human Rights Committee by members of the Congressional Black Caucus, [available here](http://www.whale.to/b/wolf_coin.html#American_Indian_Movement_). 291 Ward Churchill, \"Agents of Repression,\" Excerpt [available here](http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=uP8YRoyyNVwC&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146&dq=%22aim%2Bwill%2Bdie%2Bat%2Bwounded%2Bknee%22%2Bdick%2Bwilson&source=bl&ots=7_4wgtkkpF&sig=3fx-Ho6z04aNFr7mswhw8IJXsr4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=c9LeUb_EBOSTyQGM_YGgBw&redir_esc=y%23v%3Donepage&q=%22aim%20will%20die%20at%20wounded%20knee%22%20dick%20wilson&f=false). 292 Weyler, Rex \"Blood on the Land,\" page 54 293 \"COINTELPRO Papers,\" Page 270 294 Ibid. * * * * Conclusion The Church Committee investigated COINTELPRO and concluded: **\"Too many people have been spied upon by too many Government agencies and too much information has been collected.

The Constitutional system of checks and balances has not adequately controlled intelligence activities. Until recently the Executive branch has neither delineated the scope of permissible activities nor established procedures for supervising intelligence agencies. Congress has failed to exercise sufficient oversight, seldom questioning the use to which its appropriations were being put.\" Simply put, the committee's conclusions are correct but fall short. It is clear that for a period of nearly three decades, the FBI waged a literal domestic war on largely peaceful activists who sought to bring about social and political change. During the time of the Vietnam war, MK-ULTRA, the struggles of various civil rights movements, Watergate and other criminal acts in the executive branch, the United States needed effective leaders and organizations to affect change, yet the FBI successfully suppressed any serious movements that arose. * * * * Food for Thought: 1. How responsible is COINTELPRO for the fall of the American left in the 1970's? 2. How likely is it that other high profile assassinations similar to Fred Hampton, such as Martin Luther King Jr., were undertaken by the FBI under COINTELPRO orders? 3. What movements are currently being subverted by the FBI and other intelligence agencies today? 4. Did J. Edgar Hoover leave a corrupt infrastructure when he retired in 1972, after 37 years of being the FBI Director? * * * * Chapter IX: The Phoenix Program **Thanks to the *New York Times *and *60 Minutes, *most people are now aware that former Senator and Presidential candidate Bob Kerrey once led a raid on the peasant village of Thanh Phong during his service in Vietnam, and murdered nearly two dozen villagers in cold blood. His team disemboweled women, children and infants and shot dead whole families.** **What most people don't know, is that Kerrey was operating on orders from a CIA program known as Operation Phoenix, the program that oversaw some of the most horrific war crimes ever unleashed on Earth.295** It was in 1964, under CIA station chief Peer DeSilva, that the Phoenix Program was initiated. DeSilva was a proponent of the belief of 'counter-terrorism', CIA doublespeak for the idea that terror was a legitimate tactic in unconventional warfare.296 Historian Douglas Valentine summarizes the concept of Operation Phoenix as follows: **\"Central to Phoenix is the fact that it targeted civilians, not soldiers... Under Phoenix, due process was totally non-existent. South Vietnamese civilians whose names appeared on blacklists could be kidnapped, tortured, detained for two years without trial, or even murdered simply on the word of an anonymous", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:76:e73b0ea95479", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13278, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 77, "text": "was a proponent of the belief of 'counter-terrorism', CIA doublespeak for the idea that terror was a legitimate tactic in unconventional warfare.296 Historian Douglas Valentine summarizes the concept of Operation Phoenix as follows: **\"Central to Phoenix is the fact that it targeted civilians, not soldiers... Under Phoenix, due process was totally non-existent. South Vietnamese civilians whose names appeared on blacklists could be kidnapped, tortured, detained for two years without trial, or even murdered simply on the word of an anonymous informer. ** \"At its height, Phoenix managers imposed a quota of eighteen hundred neutralizations per month on the people running the program in the field, opening up the program to abuses by corrupt security officers, policemen, politicians, and racketeers, all of whom extorted innocent civilians as well as VCI [Viet Cong Infrastructure]. Legendary CIA officer Lucien Conein described Phoenix as, \"A very good blackmail scheme for the central government: 'If you don't do what I want, you're VC.'\" \"Indeed, Phoenix was, among other things, an instrument of counter-terror - the psychological warfare tactic in which members of the VCI were brutally murdered along with their families or neighbors as a means of terrorizing the entire population into a state of submission. Such horrendous acts were, for propaganda purposes, often made to look as if they had been committed by the enemy.\"297 This is the intellectual context under which Bob Kerrey massacred the hamlet of civilians, for which he was subsequently awarded the Bronze Star. Peer DeSilva quickly expanded Phoenix to cover all 40 provinces in South Vietnam, each equipped with an Intelligence Coordinating Committee and its own prison. Torture techniques such as electric shock, beatings and rape were commonplace.298 The Central Intelligence Agency originally had trouble finding Americans who were willing to murder and mutilate, so the 'counter-terror' squads were composed of ex-convicts, VietCong defectors, and mercenaries.299 They then employed special forces, Navy SEALS and other highly trained Americans such as Bob Kerrey, who had essentially been indoctrinated by the military into killing machines, to oversee the program. Former Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Herbert, who was involved in Operation Phoenix, described his experience in his autobiography *Soldier: *\"They wanted me to take charge of execution teams that wiped out entire families and tried to make it look as though the VC themselves had done the killing.\"300 Former CIA agent Ralph McGee, speaking to *PBS*'s Bill Moyers for the fantastic documentary '[The Secret Government](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050423secretgovernment)', stated that: \"We were murdering these people, incinerating them...

He recalls that the program cost billions of dollars, and CIA Director William Colby refused an investigative audit before a Congressional Committee.302 The Agency's website describes how the entire South Vietnamese population was mapped out with Census Grievance teams in conjunction with national data.303 They determined which villages were more likely to be friendly to the VietCong through interviews, and color coded maps based on that information, specifically noting that \"These maps would often contain the names of family members who were VCI members or sympathetic to the communists.\" \"I think it's common knowledge what goes on at the interrogation center... It was common knowledge that when someone was picked up their lives were about at an end because the Americans most likely felt that, if they were to turn someone like that back into the countryside it would just be like multiplying NLF followers.\" - Jeff Stein, Author and Former Military Intelligence, Vietnam Veteran304 The 1971 Congressional Inquiry revealed that the blacklists created by these maps and census data was not thoroughly vetted, as opposed to claims by Agency officials. One member of the Phoenix Program described to Congress that: \"It was my experience that the majority of people classified as VC were \"captured\" as a result of sweeping tactical operations. In effect, a huge dragnet was cast out in our area of operation (AR) and whatever looked good in the catch, regardless of evidence, was classified as VCI.\"305 **Lieutenant Vincent Okamoto, Army Combat Officer and recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross, testified on his experiences with using blacklists as a means of 'neutralizing' Viet Cong:** **\"The problem was, how do you find the people on the blacklist? It's not like you had their address and telephone number. The normal procedure would be to go into a village and just grab someone and say, 'Where's Nguyen so-and-so?' Half the time the people were so afraid they would say anything. Then a Phoenix team would take the informant, put a sandbag over his head, poke out two holes so he could see, put commo wire around his neck like a long leash, and walk him through the village and say, 'When we go by Nguyen's house scratch your head.' Then that night Phoenix would come back, knock on the door, and say, 'April Fool, motherfucker.' Whoever answered the door would get wasted.

As far as they were concerned whoever answered was a Communist, including family members. Sometimes they'd come back to camp with ears to prove that they killed people.\"** Psychological warfare against civilians was an integral part of Phoenix. Soldiers would leave pamphlets on dead bodies, or on doors indicating that recipients were marked for death. \"Attention Villagers: 1.Your village was bombed because you harbored Vietcong in your village. 2. Your village was bombed because you gave help to the Vietcong in your area. 3. Your village was bombed because you gave food to the Vietcong.\" - USMC Leaflet306 **Phoenix officer Bart Osbourne testified before Congress in 1971:** **\"I never knew in the course of all those operations any detainee to live through his interrogation. They all died. There was never any reasonable establishment of the fact that any one of those individuals was, in fact, cooperating with the VC, but they all died and the majority were either tortured to death or things like thrown out of helicopters. It became a sterile depersonalized murder program.\"307** Throwing victims out of a helicopter, for example, served a psychological warfare purpose as well, terrorizing those on the ground. The intelligence that the CIA received was often flawed. Anyone in the South Vietnam infrastructure could report intelligence, and it was often not verified, which led to abuses such as South Vietnam politicians feeding intelligence to kill their political rivals.308 \"We had no way of determining the background of these sources, nor their motivation for providing American units with information. No American in the team spoke or understood Vietnamese well enough to independently debrief any \"contact.\" None of us were sufficiently sensitive to nor knowledgeable of the law, the culture, the customs, the history, etc. Our paid sources could easily have been either provocateurs or opportunists with a score to settle.

Understanding that official documents don't cover the full scope of Phoenix, and the history of records destruction by the Agency, it is unlikely that the full extent of Phoenix will ever be known. So what about the infamous My Lai massacre that resulted in the rape and mutilation of around 400 civilians? Historian Daniel Valentine argues it was most certainly a Phoenix operation. He cites a known 'blacklist' of names to be 'neutralized' in My Lai, multiple accounts of military personnel referring to the entire village as Viet Cong sympathizers, using the logic that only sympathizers could survive in the area, and a Vietnamese Colonel who said himself that My Lai was a Phoenix operation, among other evidence.314 Marvin Gettleman concurs: **\"By late 1967, before the Tet offensive, 70% of the villages in Quang Ngai province had already been destroyed.** **In response to Tet, this slaughter was intensified literally with a vengeance. In mid-March on 1968, Quang Ngai province was the scene of what was to become the most notorious example: the massacre of villagers in My Lai 4. There the killing of hundreds of villagers, almost all unarmed women and children, and old men, so successfully swelled the body count that General Westmoreland sent a personal message of 'Congratulations to officers and men of Charlie Company for outstanding action' that 'dealt the enemy a heavy blow'.** When the carnage finally came to light, evidence poured in showing that this massacre was not an aberration but just an especially appalling instance of a systematic strategy.\" - Gettleman, page 411315 Project Phoenix would first come to the public in 1971 with a congressional inquiry.

Since the act was passed, the NSC has steadily grown in power and scope under various presidencies. During Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration in the '50s, the NSC became a 'virtual adjunct of the president', and started reporting directly to the executive branch. John F. Kennedy, skeptical of the CIA and other agencies after the Bay of Pigs fiasco, allowed the NSC to begin functioning operationally, evolving from its traditional role as a planning committee.319 Under Ronald Reagan, the NSC expanded with increased staff and scope of operations. Under Eisenhower, it had been tasked with creating a: \"...virtual Cold War machine against Communism,\" and to \"create and exploit troublesome problems for international Communism... reduce international Communist control over any areas of the world,\" and \"develop underground resistance and facilitate covert and guerilla operations.\"320 This directive would be the rational and motivation for the group conducting subversive actions in Nicaragua under the Reagan administration. 318 Report hosted at [Archive.org](http://www.archive.org/details/reportofcongress87unit) 319 Draper, Theodore. \"*A Very Thin Line: the Iran-Contra Affairs\", *1991, p. 4 320 Draper, p. 6 * * * * Nicaragua United States intervention in Nicaragua is nothing new. The U.S. had landed troops numerous times in the country during the 19th century. As recently as 1912, during a period known as the 'banana wars', U.S. military forces directly quelled rebellions against the American-supported leadership. In 1936, the American-trained head of the Nicaraguan National Guard, Somoza Garcia, forcefully took power in the country by murdering and disposing the former leader Augusto César Sandino, marking the beginning of a lengthy U.S. Supported dictatorship.321 Trouble arose in the 1970's, when a revolutionary communist party called 'The Sandanistas', named after the disposed Sandino, began mounting a series of attacks and sabotage against the right wing Somoza dynasty, including the high-profile kidnapping of Nicaraguan elite at a Christmas party in 1974. The Sandanistas enjoyed wide support from much of the disenfranchised Nicaraguan population, who had become tired of the heavy-handed Somoza rule. One striking example is the 1972 earthquake that struck the Nicaraguan capital Managua, where Anastasia Debayle, son of Somoza Garcia, exercised emergency powers that allowed him to confiscate most of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:82:41e864d26d10", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13284, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 83, "text": "disposed Sandino, began mounting a series of attacks and sabotage against the right wing Somoza dynasty, including the high-profile kidnapping of Nicaraguan elite at a Christmas party in 1974.

One striking example is the 1972 earthquake that struck the Nicaraguan capital Managua, where Anastasia Debayle, son of Somoza Garcia, exercised emergency powers that allowed him to confiscate most of the international aid that had been directed towards rebuilding the city, instead ending enriching Debayle's personal coffers.322 In 1979, the Sandanista uprising culminated in their gaining full power in Nicaragua. They were helped by the policies of Jimmy Carter, who had withdrawn aid to the Somoza regime after a series of revelations of human rights abuses. Carter originally hoped to remain on good terms with the Sandanistas, who had constructed a defacto socialist government in Nicaragua, and responded by sending them $99 million in aid. After they solidified a pact with the Soviet Bloc in 1980, Carter changed his tune and authorized the CIA to begin subversive acts in the country including propaganda efforts but prohibiting direct conflict.323 In 1980, right wing elements in Nicaragua created the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, FDN, which would become the largest and most organized member of the group that would become known as the 'Contras'. When Reagan was inaugurated in 1981, he stepped up support of the group and expanded the scope of covert action in the country, allowing the CIA to directly arm, fund and train the Contras. In 1983, he signed the National Security Decision Directive 77, entitled \"Management of Public Diplomacy Relative to National Security,\" institutionalizing public diplomacy. In effect, it was a special planning group within the NSC to coordinate public diplomacy campaigns, the most institutionalized 'public propaganda ministry' in United States history.324 The group used extensive media propaganda and control efforts, with one 14 page memorandum written by Oliver North detailing over 80 specific 'publicity stunts' designed to influence congressional and public opinion before upcoming Contra aid votes.325 **When the covert war in Nicaragua became public knowledge in 1982, a group of congressmen led by Massachusetts representative Edward P. Boland tried to end all covert efforts in the country. This was with good reason, as news of the human rights abuses of the Contras became public knowledge. For example, a 1987 *Chicago Tribune *article noted that the Contras \"engaged repeatedly in kidnappings, torture and murder of unarmed civilians.\"326 ** ***The Guardian *would delve deeper into the atrocities of the Contras, describing a particular attack where \"Rosa had her breasts cut off.

Then they cut into her chest and took out her heart. The men had their arms broken, their testicles cut off. They were killed by slitting their throats and pulling the tongue out through the slit.\"327** Americas Watch, a humans rights group, accused the Contras of328: • targeting health care clinics and health care workers for assassination • kidnapping civilians • torturing civilians • executing civilians, including children, who were captured in combat • raping women • indiscriminately attacking civilians and civilian houses • seizing civilian property • burning civilian houses in captured towns. **These were the principle means of waging war. Meanwhile, Reagan called the Contras the \"moral equivalent of the founding fathers\".329** **The terrorism of the Contras was not simply 'collateral damage' of supporting subversive groups. Rather, evidence shows that it was a deliberate campaign led by the CIA in the vein of Phoenix. In fact, the CIA wrote the training manual for the Contras titled \"Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare\" which, among other activities, advocated for assassinating judges and priests, blackmailing citizens, blowing up public buildings, and firing on dissenting citizens.330** Congressman Boland submitted legislation on December 21, 1982 which would become known as the Boland Amendment. It specifically barred \"the use of funds 'for the purpose of' overthrowing the government of Nicaragua or provoking a war between Nicaragua and Honduras.\"331 Open defiance was impossible, but the CIA, NSC and the Reagan Administration were dedicated to supporting the Contras at all costs, so they chose various methods of covert defiance by exploiting loopholes in the amendment. As long as the funds going to the Contras were not tagged as being used for overthrowing the Sandanista government, then they could be delivered under the guise of international aid. The use of soliciting third party funding was also left out of the Boland Amendment. Ultimately, the Boland Amendment had no tangible impact on the covert war in Nicaragua. During the period proceeding the Boland Amendment, the CIA directly assisted the Contra's subversive efforts. One example is the use of air strikes against an airport near Managua. They also placed mines in Nicaraguan harbors in 1984, damaging several ships. The *Wall Street Journal, *which exposed these covert actions, also revealed the role of Oliver North, a Marine Colonel working on assignment with the NSC, in coordinating the actions, one of the first mentions of a name which would become notorious to the public just a few years later.332 Congress soon realized the ineffectiveness of the Boland Amendment and responded with new legislation that toughened the restrictions on funding the support, known as the Boland Amendment II.

One result is the infamous 'Diversion Memo', written by North, detailing a plan to sell arms to Iran, overcharge the country and funnel excess funds to the Contras. This plan was blatantly illegal under Operation Staunch, a U.S. led arms embargo against Iran during the Iran-Iraq war which lasted from '80 to '90. ** At the outset of the war, the US began arming Iraq, first with 200 million dollars in helicopters, and later escalating to several billion dollars worth of economic aid, the sale of dual-use technology, non-U.S. origin weaponry, military intelligence, Special Operations training,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:85:2fec36bfdb92", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13287, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 86, "text": "to Iran, overcharge the country and funnel excess funds to the Contras.

Initially, the plan worked relatively well: Israel provided Iran with hundreds of TOW anti-tank missiles and multiple American hostages were released.336 The deal was completed just months after Ronald Reagan famously said: \"The United States gives terrorists no rewards. We make no concessions, we make no deals.\"337 Although North estimated that $12 million would be raised for the Contras in this manner, only $2 million ever made it to the group, likely because the private actors involved in the Operation were acting with a motivation of profit. **As is thematic with American covert operations, the funds were funneled through a 'front organization' called Stanford Technology Trading Group International, as well as using 'proprietary' airlines to transfer the missiles: aircraft owned by the CIA and used in normal operations until needed by the Agency for covert operations.338** The story unraveled in 1986 when two Lebanon reporters broke the story of the secret arms transfer. The revelations sparked the widely publicized hearings in the United States to find the 'truth' of the operations. In 1987 hearings, Oliver North was given immunization from self-incrimination before Congress. Regarding the destruction of documents, he humorously noted: \"I would prefer to say that I shredded documents that day like I did on all other days, but perhaps with increased intensity; that's correct.\"339 The hearings' Majority Report concluded that: \"North's testimony demonstrates that he also lied to members of the Executive branch, including the Attorney General, and officials of the State Department, CIA and NSC.\" And also that... \"other officials lied repeatedly to Congress and to the American people about the Contra covert action and Iran arms sales, and that he altered and destroyed official documents.\" 335 [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Iraq_during_the_Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_war) on United States Support for Iraq During the Iran-Iraq War 336 Brown University, \"[The Iran/Contra Affair](http://www.brown.edu/Research/Understanding_the_Iran_Contra_Affair/iran-contra-affairs.php).\" 337 *Chicago Tribune, *\"[President: Terrorists Must Pay](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-07-01/news/8502120339_1_hostage-crisis-hostages-release-hijack-victims),\" July 1, 1985 338 Brown University 339 Ibid. * * * * Rex 84 **The most shocking revelation of the Contra hearings, which the mainstream media nearly universally failed to report on, was the existence of an emergency preparedness plan known as Rex 84.** The only public mention", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:86:dc3e561fb359", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13288, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "he altered and destroyed official documents.\" 335 [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Iraq_during_the_Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_war) on United States Support for Iraq During the Iran-Iraq War 336 Brown University, \"[The Iran/Contra Affair](http://www.brown.edu/Research/Understanding_the_Iran_Contra_Affair/iran-contra-affairs.php).\" 337 *Chicago Tribune, *\"[President: Terrorists Must Pay](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-07-01/news/8502120339_1_hostage-crisis-hostages-release-hijack-victims),\" July 1, 1985 338 Brown University 339 Ibid. * * * * Rex 84 **The most shocking revelation of the Contra hearings, which the mainstream media nearly universally failed to report on, was the existence of an emergency preparedness plan known as Rex 84.** The only public mention of the plan, known officially as 'Readiness Exercise 1984', was as follows: Congressman Jack Brooks: Colonel North, in your work at the N.S.C. were you not assigned, at one time, to work on plans for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster? Brendan Sullivan [North's lawyer, agitatedly]: Mr. Chairman? Senator Daniel Inouye: I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area so may I request that you not touch upon that? Brooks: **I was particularly concerned, Mr. Chairman, because I read in Miami papers, and several others, that there had been a plan developed, by that same agency, a contingency plan in the event of emergency, that would suspend the American constitution**. And I was deeply concerned about it and wondered if that was an area in which he had worked. I believe that it was and I wanted to get his confirmation. Inouye: May I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage. If we wish to get into this, I'm certain arrangements can be made for an executive session. Luckily, the media was able to get more details on the program which was too sensitive to discuss in a public forum. *The Miami Herald, *in a July 5, 1987 exposé, published the following: **\"Some of President Reagan's top advisers have operated a virtual parallel government outside the traditional cabinet departments and agencies almost from the day Reagan took office, congressional investigators and administration officials have concluded.** Investigators believe that the advisers' activities extended well beyond the secret arms sales to Iran and aid to the Contras now under investigation. **Lt. Col. Oliver North, for example, helped draw up a controversial plan to suspend the Constitution in the event of a national crisis, such as a nuclear war, violent and widespread internal dissent or national opposition to a U.S. military invasion abroad.\" *The Miami Herald*340 ** **Implementation of Rex 84 would have turned control over the United States to FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would act as an 'emergency czar', and turn control of state and local governments to appointed Military commanders, and also included mention of 'assembly centers and relocation camps' to house dissidents. **Attorney General William Smith correctly protested that the plan \"exceeded its proper function as a coordinating agency for emergency preparedness.\"341 It doesn't take reading between the lines to see the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:87:93f9b03c7af2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13289, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 88, "text": "of Rex 84 would have turned control over the United States to FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would act as an 'emergency czar', and turn control of state and local governments to appointed Military commanders, and also included mention of 'assembly centers and relocation camps' to house dissidents. **Attorney General William Smith correctly protested that the plan \"exceeded its proper function as a coordinating agency for emergency preparedness.\"341 It doesn't take reading between the lines to see the immediate intent of Rex 84. The NSA, CIA and other U.S. institutions believed that an invasion of Nicaragua might have been necessary to prevent the spread of communism so close to their borders. Such an idea isn't farfetched: Sandanista policies and their agreements with the Soviet Union indicate that they believed an American invasion was imminent.342 Being just a decade removed from the massively unpopular Vietnam War, an invasion would have prompted widespread dissent, and Rex 84 was the NSC's plan to deal with a domestic anti-war movement. The investigation described by the *Miami Herald *had interesting revelations of other activities. For example, it revealed that the 'secret government' stole President Carter's briefing book used in campaign speeches and presidential debates with Reagan, indicating that the structure was in existence before Reagan's inauguration. It noted meetings with Iranian officials to discuss the release the delay of the release of U.S. Embassy hostages until after the election. Lastly, it discussed how certain officials orchestrated leaks to paint Reagan in a positive light, such as the November 4, 1984 election day announcement that Soviet Jet Fighters were on their way to Nicaragua, orchestrated by Oliver North himself.343 340 *Miami Herald, *\"[Reagan Aides and the 'Secret' Government](https://www.WantToKnow.info/articles/parallel-government-870705),\" July 5, 1987.

Why was there no significant drive for reform of the CIA originating from within Congress? 3. How often does the CIA disregard domestic and international law when it interferes with their agenda? 4. Why did the CIA find hegemony in Nicaragua to be so important? What threat, if any, did the country pose to the United States? 5. Does a modern version of Rex 84 exist today? 6. How far will the United States go to suppress domestic dissent the next time they deem a foreign invasion necessary? **Note:** Feeling overwhelmed with this material?

In the United States, Continuity of Government plans have been on the books since at least the Eisenhower administration. The plans involved building intricate hidden command centers such as the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center built in 1959, nestled away in the Blue Ridge Mountains.** While the Government officially classifies Mt. Weather as a 'bunker', many sources claim that it is essentially a full blown city. According to GlobalSecurity.org, a respected institution in the intelligence community, Mount Weather contains a hospital, sewer treatment system, reservoirs, a power plant, an emergency television studio, and a thorough system of dormitories & office buildings.345 None of this is out of the ordinary, so to speak. It is reasonable for the government to have such plans in place.

It is reasonable for the government to have such plans in place. However, **on September 11, 2001, the Continuity of Operations plan was officially activated and has been live ever since, meaning that Mt. Weather and similar installations are likely in operation today.** \"A national emergency exists by reason of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, New York, New York, and the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States,\" President George W. Bush proclaimed on September 14, 2001. Dick Cheney officially enacted the \"Continuation of Government\" plans shortly after the World Trade Center attacks, although the Bush Administration would not confirm that this took place until March, 2002.346 **A simultaneous 'State of Emergency' was declared and is also in effect today, extended each year by George Bush, Barack Obama, and then [Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/09/14/permanent-emergency-trump-becomes-third-president-renew-extraordinary-post-9-11-powers/661966001/).347** CBS reported: \"A 'shadow government' consisting of 75 or more senior officials has been living and working secretly outside Washington since Sept. 11 in case the nation's capital is crippled by terrorist attack. \"This is serious business,\" President Bush said of plans to ensure the continuity of government. Such an operation was conceived as a Cold War precaution against nuclear attack during the Eisenhower administration but never used until now. It went into effect in the first hours after the terror attacks and has evolved over time, said senior government officials who provided details of the plan. Under the classified \"Continuity of Operations Plan,\" which was first reported by *The Washington Post *in its Friday editions, high-ranking officials representing their departments have begun rotating in and out of the assignment at one of two fortified locations along the East Coast. The Post said the first rotations were made in late October or early November, a fact confirmed by a senior government official late Thursday. Officials who are activated for the duty live and work underground 24 hours a day, away from their families, according to the Post. The shadow government has sent home most of the first wave of deployed personnel, replacing them most commonly at 90-day intervals. The government-in-waiting is an extension of a policy that has kept Vice President Dick Cheney in secure, undisclosed locations away from Washington. Cheney has moved in and out of public view as threat levels have fluctuated.\"348 **Serious business indeed.

One example is Oregon Congressman Peter DeFazio, a key member of the Homeland Security Committee, pushed to review the classified portion of the Continuity plan in a secure setting in 2007 but his access was denied.349** What can we know about the Continuity of Operations plan currently in effect? Patrick Thronson, editor-in-chief of the University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform, has put together the most comprehensive publicly available paper detailing the states of emergencies and powers granted to the executive branch.350 Available knowledge is naturally incomplete because many powers and documents are still classified. Some highlights include: **• Congress is required by statue to vote on the continuation of a state of National Emergency every six months. Since September 11th, 2001, it has only happened once.** **• There are currently thirty simultaneous declared states of emergency.** • The Executive Branch can freeze the assets and prevent financial transactions of individuals. This extends to even basic life necessities. They can go as far as to prohibit donations of food to said person. • The president can unilaterally order the inspection and seizure of commercial vessels. • The president is authorized to suspend or alter rules for broadcast stations, or authorize control of said station. • Provisions to suspend or control internet traffic. **\"Thus, the only apparent legal obstacle standing between present conditions and this degree of government control over mass media and telecommunications is a presidential order. \" - Thronson** • The ability to seize property • The delegation of 'maintaining law and order' to the department of defense. • Extend military tours of duty beyond contractually agreed termination dates. \"A nation under thirty states of national emergency can hardly claim that emergency laws are the exception to-rather than the rule of-normal governance. \" - Thronson **Like every other case study of covert activities highlighted in this book, 'Continuity of Operations' has a friendly face but the actual workings of the secret government are strictly secret. Suffice it to say that the powers behind the Iran/Contra activities have become fully institutionalized. ** The implications are that the workings of Congress, the Justice Department and other institutions have become merely a show to distract from the reality that a secret government which does not respond to civilian rule and has granted itself sweeping, unchecked powers and is certainly directly operating in the realm of foreign policy, covert activities and likely domestic espionage, among other potential activities. 345 [Mount Weather profile](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/facility/mt_weather.htm) at GlobalSecurity.org", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:91:1e4522ecf2ad", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13293, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 92, "text": "the powers behind the Iran/Contra activities have become fully institutionalized. ** The implications are that the workings of Congress, the Justice Department and other institutions have become merely a show to distract from the reality that a secret government which does not respond to civilian rule and has granted itself sweeping, unchecked powers and is certainly directly operating in the realm of foreign policy, covert activities and likely domestic espionage, among other potential activities. 345 [Mount Weather profile](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/facility/mt_weather.htm) at GlobalSecurity.org 346 *CBS, *\"[The Shadow Government](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/03/02/attack/main502695.shtml),\" February 11, 2009 347 *MSNBC, *\"[Obama quietly extends post-9/11 state of national emergency,](http://www.msnbc.com/all/obama-quietly-extends-post-911-state)\" September 11, 2013 348 *CBS, *\"[The Shadow Government](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/03/02/attack/main502695.shtml),\" February 11, 2009 349 *Oregon Live, *\"[DeFazio demands access to classified information,](http://blog.oregonlive.com/politics/2007/07/defazio_demands_access_to_clas.html)\" July 27, 2007 350 Patrick Thronson, \"[Towards Comprehensive Reform of America's Emergency Law Regime](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2056822),\" March 23, 2013 * * * * Food for Thought: 1.

One central figure, Craig Spence, a Republican powerbroker, had the political clout to bring prostitutes on midnight tours of the White House. The report names multiple White House insiders, military personnel and members of major media institutions as clients, based on credit card records procured by Rodriguez.** \"Among the client names contained in the vouchers - and identified by prostitutes and escort operators - are government officials, locally based US military officers, businessmen, lawyers, bankers, congressional aides and other professionals... Although the confiscated material was turned over to District police on the scene, witnesses and law enforcement agents say the Secret Service kept one box containing names and other information about high-level government officials who were clients of the male escort business.

Various associates, including multiple of Spence's body guards, came forward and admitted that his house, where the parties were located, was thoroughly bugged with audio and video recording equipment, with the intent of extortion and blackmail of those who ended up in compromising positions.354 Spence was somewhat of a mystery man. What type of employment did he have? No one knew for sure, though Spence himself would often boast of his important connections. One of his associates told the *Times*: \"He described Mr. Spence as 'strange', saying he often boasted that he was working for the CIA, and on one occasion said he was going to disappear for a while 'because he had an important CIA assignment'. According to the businessman, Mr. Spence told him that the 'CIA might double-cross him', however, and kill him instead and then 'make it look like a suicide.'\" - *Washington Times*355 Indeed, Spence would die just months after the interview, of an apparent suicide, but not before admitting that his parties were bugged by friendly intelligence assets which he refused to name.356 **The investigation by Rodriguez and his associates would also screech to a halt after all of the evidence was either", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:93:01388de515fc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13295, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 94, "text": "to the businessman, Mr. Spence told him that the 'CIA might double-cross him', however, and kill him instead and then 'make it look like a suicide.'\" - *Washington Times*355 Indeed, Spence would die just months after the interview, of an apparent suicide, but not before admitting that his parties were bugged by friendly intelligence assets which he refused to name.356 **The investigation by Rodriguez and his associates would also screech to a halt after all of the evidence was either classified by the Secret Service or tied up in red tape.

King, one of the fastest rising Republican stars of the 1980's.** He was a public figure in Franklin, Nebraska who ran the Franklin Federal Credit Union, along with a series of restaurants and bars. These various businesses apparently furnished King's lavish lifestyle of private jets, extravagant parties and an entourage of assistants and bodyguards. Larry King, as he was known, was accused by seven children of child abuse and prostitution before he sang the National Anthem at the 1988 Republican National Convention. But despite various petitions to local police and the FBI, no official investigations were ever undertaken.358 One of the allegations began from the serious abuse of children at the hands of Jarret and Barbara Webb, the former a member of the Franklin Credit Union board; the latter a cousin of King, who adopted various foster children and would proceed to subject them to horrific physical, emotional and sexual abuse.

The girls housed at the Webbs told of being taken to various parties in the Franklin area where Larry King and other important local figures sexually abused them. One of the girls, Eulice Washington, recalled being flown on King's private jets to be abused across the country. \"Among the first accusers was Eulice Washington, who claimed King flew her to out-of-state pedophilic orgies. She had been adopted by relatives of King's in the 1970s. Her new 'mother' was King's cousin Barbara Webb, and her new 'father' was husband Jarrett Webb, who sat on the board of the Franklin Federal Credit Union. To Eulice Washington, King had been Uncle Larry. 'Larry King set up the pedophile ring,' says Eulice. 'From my knowledge and from what I saw go down, he was the man who got it moving and rolling. Everything went through him. He loves boys. He loves them like he shouldn't.'\" - *The Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse and Betrayal*359 Despite Eulice passing various lie detector tests, charges were never pressed against the Webbs.360 **The Foster Care Review Board (FCRB) was the first organization to come across various cases of abuse, from Eulice Washington and others. They wrote numerous letters to Nebraska's Attorney General Robert Spire urging an investigation, but their pleas were ignored.** The FCRB testified to the State Legislature's Investigative Executive Review Board Subcommittee in 1988 that: FCRB Chairman Dennis Carlson: The nature of these allegations are something that is going to shock the Committee. They deal with cult activities. They deal with sexual abuse. And there's a correlation between these two different reports. We have, the Boys' Town report ... prepared by a worker from Boys' Town named Julie Walters [which] contains the allegations of the children that were in the Webb foster home, Nelly primarily. Years later, well, two years later, we have Loretta Smith in Richard Young Hospital who's making allegations against Larry King, and as far as we know there is no relationship between Nelly and Loretta Smith...

Stitt: Yes, he seems to be more the organizer, or the high-class pimp, I mean if that helps fit this together.361 **Larry King would also be linked to embezzlement before he sang the National Anthem at the 1988 Republican National Convention, but again avoided an investigation.** The facade unraveled in November 1988, when an IRS investigation revealed that King had stolen over $40 million from the coffers of the Franklin Federal Credit Union. The financial corruption alone shocked the city, but soon reports started circulating that in addition to various fraudulent accounting documents, investigators found a huge stash of child pornography as well.362 More rumors of sexual abuse began to arise, with multiple allegations that Larry King was using children from Boys Town, the nearby Catholic charitable institution for orphaned youth.363 His yellow sports car was notorious on the Boys Town campus, where he would drive around and pick up minors for his pedophilic activities. The Catholic management denied any connection to King, but financial records showed that Boys Town had a close-knit relationship to the Franklin Federal Credit Union.364 Federal and local authorities immediately moved to close the investigation and seal evidence, claiming that allegations of child abuse were unfounded.365 The authorities backtracked and stated that they had done everything in their power to investigate these claims. Attorney General Robert Spire said: \"We did receive some sensitive information in July. My office acted promptly and professionally and nothing was sat on.\" However, it would later be revealed that no authorities ever interviewed Eulice Washington and other children noted by the FCRB until three years later, after they made their report public.366 Despite this, **Omaha Chief of Police Robert Wadman stated to the press that \"Every step that should have been taken, was taken.\"367 However, Wadman would later confess that he had never contacted Eulice Washington, one of the children abused at the hands of Webb, nor the Child Protective Services department that handled Washington's claims.368 Wadman would later be identified as a child abuser at King's parties by four different victims.369** 358 FranklinCase.org, \"[Franklin Timeline](https://web.archive.org/web/20150420152057/http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11&Itemid=9)\" 359 Nick Bryant, \"[The Franklin Scandal: A Story", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:96:873635e65b60", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13298, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 97, "text": "**Omaha Chief of Police Robert Wadman stated to the press that \"Every step that should have been taken, was taken.\"367 However, Wadman would later confess that he had never contacted Eulice Washington, one of the children abused at the hands of Webb, nor the Child Protective Services department that handled Washington's claims.368 Wadman would later be identified as a child abuser at King's parties by four different victims.369** 358 FranklinCase.org, \"[Franklin Timeline](https://web.archive.org/web/20150420152057/http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11&Itemid=9)\" 359 Nick Bryant, \"[The Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse and Betraya](http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Scandal-Story-Powerbrokers-Betrayal-ebook/dp/B005H3AUIC/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1446853076&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=%E2%80%9CThe+Franklin+Scandal%3A+A+Story+of+Powerbrokers%2C+Child+Abuse+and+Betrayal%E2%80%9D.+Nick+Bryant)l\".

Nebraska Foster Care Review Board official Dennis Carlson related Omaha Police Officer Carmean's testimony to the Legislature's Executive Board hearing: \"[Officer Carmean] told me some things which I found to be somewhat startling. I asked if he was interested in information regarding Larry King and he said, yes we are, we're conducting what he called a supersensitive investigation of Larry King and he said this investigation was so supersensitive that they were not even using the steno pool in the Omaha Police Department. They were handwriting their police reports, and he also told me that Chief Wadman had come to their unit and directly asked if they were investigating Larry King.... Investigator Carmean told me, we lied to the Chief and we said, no, we are not investigating Larry King. That conversation took place on July 20th of 1988.\"370 Shortly afterward, Officer Carmean was transferred out of the Robbery and Sex unit and the investigation stalled. On July 5, 1989, in a lengthy \"Inter-Office Communication\" to Omaha Public Safety Director Pitmon Foxall (a cousin of Larry King), Wadman announced that Carmean needed a mental health evaluation.371 **Many were not convinced of the Police Department's conclusion that there was no", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:97:898a5b691941", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13299, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 98, "text": "Chief and we said, no, we are not investigating Larry King.

Following the money trail, Schmit and his team quickly found that it could be traced directly to the sex parties and child abuse. It became clear to Schmit that he was uncovering some serious 'dirty laundry':** \"I received a phone call on the floor of the legislature. The caller would not identify himself, but he said, Loren, you do not want to have an investigation of the Franklin Federal Credit Union. And I asked, who am I speaking to? And they said, that doesn't matter, but you shouldn't have that investigation. And I said, well, why not? And he said, it will reach to the highest levels of the republican party, and we're both good republicans.\" - Loran Schmit372 **Schmit wasn't the only one to receive threats. The lead investigator of the State Senator's Committee, Gary Caradori, had also specified that he had received a series of threats, such as obvious tampering with his vehicle, as to send a message. In early July 1990, Caradori made a trip to Chicago to meet with a secret informant who had evidence which would 'blow the lid' off the case, and reportedly confided to a friend that he was one step ahead of those who wanted to squash the investigation, saying that if 'they' knew what information he had, he would be killed.373** **On returning from Chicago, Caradori's private plane crashed, killing him and his son. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation found that the wreckage was scattered over a radius between 3/4 to 1 mile, indicating without a doubt that the plane broke up in the air, instead of upon impact. Certain items were missing from the crash, most notably Caradori's briefcase. Within 24 hours, all of the evidence was collected by the FBI and sealed.374** 370 John DeCamp, \"The Franklin Coverup,\" page 48.

It turns out he was meeting with Russell 'Rusty' Nelson, a photographer for Larry King, who attended King's parties with the intention of photographing powerful men in compromising positions with minors, in order to blackmail them later.375** Like Craig Spence, King was known to throw lavish parties for the Republican elite, with underage prostitutes allegedly in attendance. Rusty Nelson was in hiding for an entire decade after the Franklin Scandal broke, but ended his silence under oath during a court hearing in 1999, in order to 'set the record straight'. He revealed that he had a very close relationship with King and kept hundreds of thousands of photographs of King's business dealings and parties in various locations. Most of the evidence had been confiscated, and more had been destroyed in Gary Caradori's plane crash. **Rusty's testimony to the District Court was very interesting. Among other events, he revealed that he personally saw Larry King place a direct call to then-president Ronald Reagan when other associates could not resolve a specific problem. He also claimed to have seen and taken pictures of the Chief of Police of Omaha Robert Wadman at various parties, engaged in various sexual acts with minors, and had once seen Wadman accept a large envelope full of bearer bonds from King.** While most of Rusty's evidence was confiscated, he was able to provide the court with photographs that corroborated his close relationship to King, such as photographs of King inside his private jet and limousine, and alongside male strippers.376 The District Court hearing was not about Rusty Nelson, but rather for compensation for one of the victims, Paul Bonacci, who had first made accusations of abuse against Larry King in 1986, two years before there was even a *Franklin Scandal. *The testimony given was so convincing that the judge awarded Bonacci with $1 million. The plan was to donate the proceeds to charitable organizations dealing with child abuse, but King has never paid. Paul Bonacci suffered from Multiple Personality Disorder, a diagnosis confirmed by three different state-appointed psychiatrists, from extreme abuse he had received beginning at the age of 3. At the age of 8, he became associated with Larry King and began attending his parties as a child prostitute. The type of abuse Bonacci underwent at the hands of Larry King is shocking: Bonacci: \"They put guns up to my head. They put guns in my mouth... Larry King sent out boys, men, to jump me.

If they wanted to get something passed in the legislature, he would put some people that were against it in a compromising position, by using us boys and girls.\"377 One of the men in Washington that Paul Bonacci claimed abused him is Democratic Senator Barney Frank. Bonacci was also taken on the very same midnight tours of the White House hosted by Craig Spence that journalist Paul Rodriguez wrote about in the *Washington Times, *as a child. He claimed that immediately after the tours of the White House, he was taken to another place to be sexually abused.378 375 [Court Transcripts, \"Paul Bonacci vs. Lawrence E. King\"](https://vdocuments.mx/paul-bonacci-court-transcripts-from-larry-king-lawsuit.html) 376 Ibid. 377 Ibid. 378 Ibid. * * * * The Grand Jury Coverup **Before his untimely death, Gary Caradori had compiled a leads list of 271 victims of sexual abuse in the Franklin area. His death precluded interviewing most, and others recanted their stories under pressure from Federal authorities, often accompanied by the threat of jail time for perjury. Along with Paul Bonacci, the investigation proceeded with three other primary witnesses, Troy Boner, Danny King (no relation to Larry), and Alisha Owens.** Both Boner and Owens recounted tales, after passing multiple state-sponsored lie detector tests,379 of attending hundreds of parties hosted by Larry King where they were abused by King and other prominent men in Lincoln and Omaha. The three would repeatedly corroborate each other in interviews taken under oath by Gary Caradori, initially without knowledge of each others participation in the investigation.380 Most of the victims claimed that they were used to transport drugs across state lines, at the demand of Larry King and Alan Baer, a prominent Omaha millionaire. Gary Caradori once followed a lead of Alisha Owens where she claimed that she was often abused at The French Café in Omaha. He talked to the former manager on the telephone, Sheila McGuire, who told Gary that: \"We had parties in my apartment above the French Cafe.

Larry King would wine and dine potential investors downstairs at the Cafe. When the French Cafe closed about 1 AM, King and his man called Parking Lot Bob - who worked for him (and was our coke connection) - would bring people upstairs to my place. If Larry King investors wanted drugs, booze, children or hookers (male or female), we'd get them. While these guests of Kings took their pleasures with the kids or whoever, King would sit and watch while he drank, did coke and played with his young boys. One time, when this guy Irv from NYC wanted Sandra who was about 12 or 13 years old and getting her 1st period, Larry intervened when Sandra refused. King pulled out a roll of $100.00 bills and gave Sandra 5 of them. King then pulled out a small gram of coke and gave that to Sandra. Sandra finally agreed and went off to bed with Irv. King took good care of the local and out of town high rollers. If you had the money to invest at Franklin, King would cater to your most deranged perversion. And, let me tell you another thing. The boys in the board rooms around Omaha are shitting in their Brogans. If this case gets cracked open, the list of involved will read like Who's Who. King and his crew have ruined a lot of children's lives.\"381 **The [*New York Times*confirmed](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/18/us/a-lurid-mysterious-scandal-begins-taking-shape-in-omaha.html) that both the FBI and state investigators received numerous reports regarding sexual abuse from children and testimonies from people involved in the foster care system.382 What happened next is amazing. Instead of indictments of the accused perpetrators to develop cases against them, both Douglas County and Federal Grand Juries ordered all files to be sealed, declined to interview dozens of witnesses, and then brought charges of perjury against Alisha Owens.383** Both Grand Juries concluded that Troy Boner and Alisha Owens had indeed been abused, but claimed that the adults they testified against were innocent! Alisha Owens was later found guilty of perjury, and sentenced to between 9 and 15 years. She ended up spending two years in solitary confinement, more than any other woman in Nebraska history, and a clear message to other victims: Stay silent.384 **\"This is unprecedented, probably in the history of the United States.

If the children are not telling the truth, particularly if they have been abused, they need help, medical attention. You don't throw them in jail!\"** - Dr. Judianne Densen-Gerber, a lawyer, psychiatrist and nationally prominent specialist on child abuse, during her visit to Nebraska in December 1990.385 On the same day that Alisha Owens was convicted of perjury, the charges against Paul Bonacci, who told a very similar story, were dropped.386 Perhaps they did not want certain testimony to come to trial, such as Bonacci's claim that Larry King would send limousines to Offutt Air Force Base and pick up CIA agents for his parties.387 The Grand Jury trial was a mockery of justice, where the state-appointed attorney Samuel Van Pelt vigorously attacked the charges and mocked the allegations of the defendants. It has to be noted that a Grand Jury is a special type of proceeding where the attorney chooses all of the witnesses and what evidence is presented; there is no presentation of the defense or cross examination. A former Chief Judge of New York State once quipped that a special prosecutor could persuade a grand jury to \"indict a ham sandwich.\"388 There are shocking irregularities with the Grand Jury proceedings. First, it never called Larry King to testify. In fact, the evidence of child abuse and child pornography has never been presented against King in *any *court of law. One member of the Douglas County Grand Jury claimed that the Van Pelt helped write the final report, which is illegal. The report contained some very peculiar statements, such as \"children do have the right to expect that *if they exhibit reasonable behavior, *they will not be abused.\" (Emphasis added). It also contained blatant lies, such as the claim that Paul Bonacci's doctor said that Bonacci was not capable of the truth, even though not only was the doctor not called to testify, he said elsewhere that he believed Bonacci's story.389 Owen's attorney, Henry Rosenthal, found that the evidence shown to the Grand Jury was deliberately tampered with. The video testimony taken by Gary Caradori was edited to remove sections where Troy Boner and Alisha Owens corroborated each others claims.390 The lawyer representing Owens, Boner and (Danny) King originally claimed to have had over 100 clients who had suffered sexual abuse in relation to King and Boys Town, but then later claimed that their testimonies were all fabrications.391 **There is also the curious trend of upward mobility for a group of men who were instrumental in rigging the Grand Juries:392** 1.

Shortly after these threats, Troy's brother Shawn was found dead from a gunshot wound.** The official story was a game of Russian Roulette.394 Troy cites this as a primary motivating factor in coming forward with the truth in his affidavit. \"Maybe the most important thing any honest investigator should do is to ask me, Troy Boner, or any of the other kids such as Alisha or Paul Bonacci, to take polygraph, lie detector tests SIDE BY SIDE ON THE SAME QUESTIONS WITH THE PEOPLE WE ARE ACCUSING OF THESE THINGS. Example, ask Alan Baer if he shot mainline drugs into me and if he is a major drug dealer and if he had sex with me. Ask Eugene Mahoney if he met me at a bookstore in Council Bluffs and used to regularly pay me to have sex with him as a boy. Ask [redacted] to take a polygraph test on whether he is a big time drug dealer.\" - Troy Boner's Affidavit (Emphasis retained) **The polygraph tests never happened. In 2004, Troy Boner entered an Omaha hospital visibly shaken and adamant that he was being targeted because of his testimony. The next day, he was found in a hospital room dead, drugged and beaten.395 The timing might be related to the reelection campaign of George W. Bush, who multiple victims claimed had attended Larry King's parties. Troy would round out a 'suspicious death' list that reached 15 names,** including:396 1. Troy Boner 2.

It was called \"Conspiracy of Silence.\" Yet shortly before it was set to air, it was pulled.** No explanation has ever been given, though there are rumors that an anonymous person paid the Discovery Channel $500,000 to revoke the television rights to the film. It would only be unofficially released two years later, when someone who helped produce the video and felt it was so important it needed to be public, leaked a rough draft from the copy room to attorney and former State Senator John DeCamp. **It is now [widely available for viewing online](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence).** Overall, eight high profile Omaha figures would be accused of sexual assault, with testimonies corroborated between victims. They were:397 1. Larry King 2. Robert Wadman, Omaha Chief of Police 3. Harold Anderson, retired Editor of the *Omaha World-Herald* 4. Alan Baer, wealthy businessman 5. Deward Finch, Superintendent of schools. 6. Peter Citron, media personality 7. Judge Theodore Carson 8.

Before the allegations leading to Citron's arrest broke, he was threatening to sue John DeCamp for naming him as a child abuser in a memo sent to the Omaha press. How could such a massive and orchestrated coverup take place? It involved the FBI withholding all sensitive files, including explicit videos and pictures of the relationships between King and his associates and young children. It involved a campaign of denial by the Omaha Police Department, whose chief was a primary member of the child abuse ring, and a disinformation campaign by Nebraska's media, who also had important members implicated in the ring. ** It involved zealous FBI agents who were self-expressed 'good friends' with Robert Wadman. And it involved a campaign of suspicious deaths designed to silence testimony. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it involved an American public unwilling to believe that powerful men could be implicated in child abuse, child prostitution and drug running.** 397 Discovery Channel, \"[Conspiracy of Silence](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence).\" * * * * The Dutroux Affair **In the summer of 1995, a wave of disappearances of young girls in Belgium grabbed national headlines. The series of kidnappings would continue through the next year, with the Belgium BOB (FBI equivalent) unable to develop any leads. ** **Then in the summer of '96, an anonymous tip about a suspicious white van led investigators to the doorsteps of Marc Dutroux, a known pedophile who had only recently been released from prison after serving three years of a 13 year sentence, despite warnings from various professionals and even his own mother that he was likely to be a repeat offender.398 The man who let Dutroux out of prison, Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet, would soon be promoted to serve as a judge at the European Court of Justice at the Hague.399** Various stories soon emerged in the press regarding how the BOB had repeatedly, and suspiciously, failed to implicate Dutroux during the previous years. For example, BOB officer Rene Michaux once searched Dutroux's house, but failed to investigate yells that he heard in the house, claiming the voices were coming from children outside. Nor did he find the odd construction of Dutroux's basement, shaped in an L with one wall much newer than the others, reason for inquiry.400 **At the time, Dutroux, though unemployed and receiving welfare from the state, owned seven homes and lived quite lavishly from his involvement in selling children and child porn.401 Michaux ignored reports from an informant who claimed to have been made an offer by", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:106:e33a6377574c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13308, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 107, "text": "heard in the house, claiming the voices were coming from children outside. Nor did he find the odd construction of Dutroux's basement, shaped in an L with one wall much newer than the others, reason for inquiry.400 **At the time, Dutroux, though unemployed and receiving welfare from the state, owned seven homes and lived quite lavishly from his involvement in selling children and child porn.401 Michaux ignored reports from an informant who claimed to have been made an offer by Dutroux to kidnap young girls in exchange for about €4000.402** He once had in his possession a video tape of Dutroux constructing his makeshift basement dungeon and raping a 14 year old girl, but the tape was returned to Dutroux's wife, apparently unviewed.403 Michaux's failures likely directly led to the death of two girls who were held captive by Dutroux at the time of the investigation and reportedly died of starvation. The arrest of Dutroux did not come until a new lead investigator, Jean-Marc Connorette, was assigned to the case. For the first time, many victims of child abuse and trafficking in Belgium felt that they had someone they could trust, and began to come forward with their stories. The case quickly spiraled to the point where Dutroux was no longer the focus. During the investigation, these victims were each assigned a number, appended after an X. For example, X1 was first sexually abused at the age of two, at the hands of her grandmother, who owned a hotel frequented by pedophiles. At the age of 4, she was introduced to a 'pimp' who would take her out to other locations for abuse and torture. She was diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder, now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder. Even after getting married and moving away at the age of 19, she was never able to fully leave the 'network': Occasionally, when her husband was out of town, her old pimp would show up and take her back to places she was abused as a child, and she would be raped.404 **She named and described in great detail, to a specially assembled police team, the people and places involved in the pedophile ring. Senior judges, one of the country's most powerful politicians - now dead - and a very influential banker were included.405** **\"The sessions not only involved sex, they included sadism, torture and murder; and again, she described in detail, the place, the victims and how they were killed.\" - *BBC*406** X1 and other witnesses recounted being raped by dogs and snakes, and being forced to witness the murders of other children which were captured on video tape.407 X1 was quoted as saying: \"In Brussels there was a villa in which a room was set up with built-in cameras. Even in the 1970s these cameras were so discrete that only the people who maintained them and the child prostitutes knew", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:107:d2d7e86d1074", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13309, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 108, "text": "the place, the victims and how they were killed.\" - *BBC*406** X1 and other witnesses recounted being raped by dogs and snakes, and being forced to witness the murders of other children which were captured on video tape.407 X1 was quoted as saying: \"In Brussels there was a villa in which a room was set up with built-in cameras. Even in the 1970s these cameras were so discrete that only the people who maintained them and the child prostitutes knew where they were located... Why did I [have] to get those guys clearly in the picture, why was I supposed to get them to hit me and brutally rape me? Why was 'regular' sex often not enough?... Blackmail, the word that was never mentioned; I only started to really understand when I was thirteen, fourteen years old.\"408 **The other victims told similar stories, all independent of one another. Most had developed Multiple Personality Disorder, and had been turned over to the 'network' by family members. Many accurately and independently verified locations and members of the network who were their abusers.409 Perhaps most importantly, they all claimed that high profile members of society were involved.410** X1 also corroborated that one of Dutroux's associates, Jean-Michel Nihoul, was instrumental in the abuse parties. **Nihoul had significant connections among Belgian political and financial elite. He later confessed to organizing an orgy at a Belgian chateau attended by government officials, described by the press as a 'Policeman's Orgy'.411 It emerged that Dutroux and Nihoul were part of a long distance child trafficking ring that imported children from Slovakia, among other places. Nihoul would later be found not guilty, a decision made by the judges who overruled a 'guilty' verdict by the jury.** **Just as the investigation was heating up and began to show promise, it was completely dismantled from higher powers. Jean-Marc Conorrette was dismissed from the case, which drew huge criticism from across the nation.412 It prompted the event known as the 'White March', in which 300,000 Belgians from the nation of just 10 million took to the streets to protest the dismissal.413 414 **Conorette would later break down in tears in court while describing the death threats he received when he was still involved with the investigation.415 A second change that greatly affected the proceedings was the introduction of a strict hierarchy to the examinations of the witnesses, which was previously undertaken by BOB officers working independently, overseen by Gendarmerie Commandant Jean-Luc Duterme. Duterme would conduct abusive interrogations which emotionally devastated the witnesses who were suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder. In addition, the prosecutor that replaced Conorette, Jacques Langlois, deliberately obfuscated the investigation. He sent police out on false tips and helped spread disinformation in the media. Jean-Marc Connorete once described how he felt about the leads that Langlois would end up investigating: \"I regularly and much earlier complained about those terrible circumstances", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:108:24796d323bb6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13310, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 109, "text": "BOB officers working independently, overseen by Gendarmerie Commandant Jean-Luc Duterme.

Jean-Marc Connorete once described how he felt about the leads that Langlois would end up investigating: \"I regularly and much earlier complained about those terrible circumstances in which I had to work in the Dutroux case... We continually received information about all kinds of bizarre leads. Those then received a lot of media attention, but to us meant nothing but time loss... Just think about the Abrasax case and the digs in Jumet. If I remember correctly, the first leads in those two cases were already put under my nose in the very beginning of the investigation. Afterwards precisely Abrasax and Jumet were used by the media as an argument to say that the whole investigation was manipulated and pointed towards false leads. I experienced the same thing in the Cools case, in which the police began to manipulate and was wholeheartedly supported by the media.\" - *Humo *(Belgian publication)416 Fuel to the fire would be added when a highly regarded children's activist, Marie France Botte, claimed that prosecutors were sitting on a politically sensitive list of high profile customers of Dutroux's thousands of video tapes.417 Marc Verwilghen, the Flemish parliamentarian who became the most popular politician in the country after leading the inquiry into Dutroux, claimed that many in the Belgian establishment, including heads of government, refused to cooperate and sought to stifle and ridicule his report. He claimed that magistrates and police were officially told to not answer certain questions, in what he described as a 'characteristic smothering operation'. He was further quoted as saying \"For me, the Dutroux affair is a question of organized crime.\"418 **A parliamentary panel revealed the names of 30 government officials it said were complicit in the hiding of Dutroux's misdeeds, none of whom have been punished.419** **As the trial came to an end in 2004 and faded from the public spotlight, Dutroux adamantly claimed that he was not a lone pedophile, but instead was acting on behalf of a large pedophile ring.420** \"Marc Dutroux insisted yesterday that he was not a 'lone predator' who kidnapped and raped young girls, but part of a wider paedophile ring. Dutroux portrayed himself as a victim, a 'puppet in a show trial' who had to be put away to 'hide the truth' and serve the interests of 'organised corruption'.

The files are sealed, with the presiding judge claiming he saw no reason to reopen them. ** **The Dutroux affair follows a shockingly similar pattern to the events in Franklin, Nebraska. The local police have no interest in uncovering the child abuse ring and even go to seemingly absurd lengths to keep it a secret. The courts are hostile towards the witnesses and the trials are deliberately obfuscated. Charges of perjury are brought against those who refuse to recant their stories. The Federal investigators withheld proof of the claims of the witnesses, including the names of high profile members of the child abuse ring and visual evidence of their crimes.** ***[Editor's Note]**** An excellent, disturbing documentary titled ** \"[Imperium](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/child-trafficking-documentary)\" uses engaging major media footage to show how the investigation into the Dutroux affair was corrupted by individuals and groups at the highest levels.

The youth claimed to be one of a number of boys regularly having sex with rich and powerful men in the 1980s - some of whom would fly to the illegal orgies from Europe. As well as the Cabinet minister - who is still alive - he pointed the finger at judges, European bigwigs and senior civil servants. He told his story to detectives, who are understood to have received other allegations against the minister. But a former detective who worked on the case revealed they were suddenly told to halt the probe. **The furious ex-policeman said: \"It wasn't that we ran out of leads, but it reached a point where a warning to stop came. It was a case of 'get rid of everything, never say a word to anyone'. It was made very clear to me that to continue asking questions would jeopardise my career.\"** - *The Sunday Daily Star*421 **The passing of Sir Jimmy Savile in October 2011, entertainer, socialite and personal friend of the royal family, opened the floodgates of a myriad of revelations, with hundreds of victims coming forward claiming they were abused at the hands of Savile in esteemed institutions such as BBC and various hospitals. It seemed that many people where aware of the transgressions, but no one acted. **Years later, new revelations were still coming to light on a weekly basis. One interesting story was published in January of 2013 which read, \"Jimmy Savile was part of satanic ring\".422 \"Dr Sinason told the *Sunday Express* she first spoke to the victim in 1992.

She recalled being led into a room that was filled with candles on the lowest level of the hospital, somewhere that was not regularly used by staff. Several adults were there, including Jimmy Savile who, like the others, was wearing a robe and a mask. She recognised him because of his distinctive voice and the fact that his blond hair was protruding from the side of the mask. He was not the leader, but he was seen as important because of his fame. She was molested, raped and beaten and heard words that sounded like 'Ave Satanas', a Latinised version of 'Hail Satan', being chanted. There was no mention of any other child being there, and she cannot remember how long the attack lasted, but she was left extremely frightened and shaken.\" **Allegations of powerful pedophile rings in Britain were nothing new. Over 30 years ago in 1981, Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens warned parliament against a pedophile ring he had uncovered, claiming that the network involved \"big, big names - people in positions of power, influence and responsibility\" and threatened to expose them in Parliament.423** **Dickens made waves regarding the pedophile ring and dossiers he received for four years in parliament before backing down in the face of harassment and death threats. It seems that no one took him seriously at the time, but new evidence shows that his claims had merit: In January 2013, Scotland Yard reopened their investigation.** \"Last month Metropolitan Police began Operation Fernbridge into allegations that residents of a childrens home in Richmond, west London, were taken to the nearby Elm Guest House in Barnes, where they were abused. Pornography involving adults having sex with children was allegedly shot at the property and then circulated commercially. Sir Peter was among the visitors to the property. Others, according to a list seized by Scotland Yard last month, were the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith, the former Russian spy Sir Anthony Blunt, a Sinn Fein politician, a Labour MP, and several Conservative politicians. After neighbours complained about the arrival of children, the police raided the guesthouse in 1982 but the operation was mysteriously cut short. A 2003 investigation also failed.\" - *The Independent*424 The new inquiry was prompted by MP Tom Watson, who requested the original dossier collected by Dickens, but Scotland Yard has been unable to produce it.

The revelations of Jimmy Savile opened new opportunities for investigations of former cases. **By December 12, 2012, the number of victims who had come forward claiming abuse at the hands of Jimmy Savile had reached 450, spanning dozens of childrens homes and hospitals.425** Two famous childrens homes who were each subject to their own vast child abuse scandals in the last decade, Haut de la Garenne on Jersey Island, and Bryn Estyn Boys Home in Wrexham, North Wales, have had a series of fresh allegations in the wake of the Savile revelations. In Wrexham, North Wales, the tale is a familiar one. Boys from the Bryn Estyn home would be taken to parties throughout the city where they acted as child prostitutes for socialites and were severely sexually abused. **\"Over the years, twenty seven police inquiries failed to disclose the scale of the alleged abuse. Thirteen reports by social services went unpublished. Several journalists reached out for the truth and ended up scorched by libel actions. When police finally launched a major inquiry, in 1991, they secured the conviction of only four care workers and concluded that there was no evidence of a paedophile ring. Clwyd County Council then commissioned its own independent inquiry but decreed that its report could not be published.\"** - *The Guardian*426 Celebrated investigative journalist Nick Davies, writing for *The Guardian*, nails the concept and motivation behind these various sex abuse scandals with the following statement: \"Power is the fabric of a paedophile ring, essential first to subjugate the children, whose passivity is essential for the adults' indulgence; and second, where possible, to neutralise the authorities who might otherwise frustrate its activities.\" **Writing about a new tribunal launched into the Wrexham case in 1997, Davies noted that over 300 men and women had come forward, naming 148 different abusers.** **The official Wrexham inquiry concluded that widespread abuse of boys did indeed occur at Bryn Estyn and other nearby childrens homes, and that dozens of potential inquiries were completely suppressed by administrators.** \"During the period under review there was a paedophile ring in the Wrexham and Chester areas in the sense that there were a number of male persons, many of them known to each other, who were engaged in paedophile activities and were targeting young males in their middle teens. The evidence does not establish that they were solely or mainly interested in persons in care but such youngsters were particularly vulnerable to their approaches.\"427 After the Savile revelations, 76 new victims came forward in North Wales, and the investigation has been reopened.

The victims claimed that the 1997 inquiry only examined a small fraction of the abuse allegations.428 *The Independent *revealed in 2012 further details of a coverup: **\"A damning report that laid bare the North Wales child abuse scandal might have aired the issue of sex attacks on children in care nearly half a decade before an official judicial inquiry in 2000. Instead copies of the report were ordered to be destroyed because the council that commissioned it feared it might be sued**, *The Independent *on Sunday can reveal. Only a handful remain, including one obtained by this newspaper.\" - *The Independent* They claim the following details: • \"The then newly appointed North Wales chief constable, who was uncontactable yesterday, refused to meet them or help with access to the police major-incident database. We were disappointed at the apparent impossibility of obtaining a breakdown of data. We are unable to identify the overall extent of the allegations received by the police in the many witness statements which they took.'' • **Some 130 boxes of material handed over by the council to the police were not made available to the panel.** • The council did not allow the inquiry to place a notice in the local press seeking information. \"This was considered to be unacceptable to the insurers,'' says the report. • \"There were numerous claims and suggestions that senior public figures including the police and political figures might have been involved in the abuse of young people,'' the report said. - *The Independent*429 After his death, Jimmy Savile would be repeatedly linked to the North Wales home. One victim claimed to have been repeatedly raped by the deputy head of the home, Peter Howarth, while Savile watched for entertainment.430 \"Howarth pulled down my pyjama bottoms in front of Savile. I was helpless as Jimmy watched. He thought it funny entertainment. This happened to a number of boys.\" According to \"Ben\", Savile would ask him: \"What do you want me to do? Can I fix it for you.\" The victim added: \"He kept on looking at me and smiling and laughing. Then he started rubbing my leg. After that I went to bed but he had other children brought up to him.\" - *The Telegraph* **The phrase \"Can I fix it for you\" is a sick play on Jimmy Savile's popular TV show, 'Jim'll Fix It', where Savile would put underprivileged or sick kids into contact with celebrities, or take them on", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:114:7e1683b0de68", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13316, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 115, "text": "Can I fix it for you.\" The victim added: \"He kept on looking at me and smiling and laughing.

This put Savile in contact with hundreds of vulnerable children.** Peter Howarth was one of the few people convicted during the original North Wales child abuse inquiries. \"Another victim of Bryn Estyn was Steve Messham, who claims he was repeatedly abused as a child by a senior member of the conservative party, as well as others. Yesterday he told Channel 4 News that he passed photographs of children being abused, including himself, to the police but they failed to act. He also said the men who abused him as a teenager frequently threatened him, saying: 'If you tell anyone, I'll have you killed.'\" - *The Telegraph* **The Haut de la Garrene childrens home in Jersey has similar evidence of a massive coverup. Jersey, not subject to European Union regulations, has long been a haven of tax dodgers and secrecy. In 2008, more than 200 victims came forward with tales of rape and torture.431** It soon became clear that many of the accused were Tory officials and aides, prompting a swift response by Prime Minister David Cameron to address the claims.432 After his death, it was revealed that Jimmy Savile was a regular visitor of the childrens home.433 **In 2008, after being replaced as the lead of the investigation, Police Chief Lenny Harper blasted the road blocks he encountered during his tenure and accused an 'Old Boys' network of obstructing his investigation.** **In his most outspoken criticism of the Jersey authorities, Mr Harper told the *Telegraph*: \"I can quite clearly say that the investigation is being held up. There are people on the island who just don't want us going down the route of this inquiry.\" ** Mr Harper, who handed over the reins of the investigation to his successor on Thursday and officially leaves the Jersey force at the end of the month, also revealed fresh details of why he is so convinced that someone deliberately concealed the bones and teeth of five children, perhaps after murdering them. Mr Harper has repeatedly said that because some of the 100 bone fragments had been cut, and because the 65 milk teeth found at the home had roots on them, meaning they did not come out naturally, children were either murdered or their bodies were illegally concealed.\" - *The Telegraph*434 Jimmy Savile pictured with 30 children from the Haut de la Garrene Home Jimmy Savile was also", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:115:49a86986679d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13317, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 116, "text": "deliberately concealed the bones and teeth of five children, perhaps after murdering them.

It was revealed in October 2012 that his name had come up numerous times in a police investigation four years earlier, but he was not investigated further.435 Lenny Harper, the lead investigator into the Garenne home, told the *Telegraph *in 2012: \"Savile chose his victims with great care; vulnerable and often troubled youngsters many in care homes. If they complained they were labeled troublemakers, or brutally put down. We know from court cases and statements made to my team [during the 2008 inquiry] that children in Jersey care homes were 'loaned out' to members of the yachting fraternity and other prominent citizens on the pretense of recreational trips but during which they were savagely abused and often raped. **\"When these children complained they were beaten and locked in cellars [at Haut de la Garenne], which the Jersey authorities denied existed in 2008, but which can still be seen on YouTube footage.** What chance did they have? This would have been the perfect hunting ground for Savile. The great and good of Jersey fawn over anyone with even loose connections to British royalty. Saville would have been a VIP to them and children would not have stood a dog's chance of complaining about him. It would have been so easy for him.\" - *The Telegraph*436 Regarding the statement about the 'yachting fraternity', Rupert Murdoch's famous tabloid *News of the World *launched an investigation and found that children were \"loaned out to rich pedophile yachtsmen\".437 They alleged that Jimmy Savile personally delivered the boys to the club. Jimmy Savile is certainly a weird character. He once gave an interview to *Esquire *Magazine where he stated: \"I guess I am like Forrest Gump. I am like a sewing machine needle that goes in here and goes in there, but I am also the eminence grise: the grey, shadowy figure in the background. The thing about me is I get things done and I work under cover.\"438 Perhaps he is referring to his close connections with the United Kingdom's royalty. **Savile was known to have acted as a 'marriage counselor' between Prince Charles and Princess Diana in the '80s.

His weird behavior was noted by the press, where he was reported to greet Prince Charles' assistants by \"taking their hands and rubbing his lips all the way up their arms.\"439** **Jimmy Savile had numerous private meetings with former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, documents released in 2012 revealed. **They detailed how Savile had petitioned Thatcher to change a law that would allow easier tax deductions for Savile's involvement with the Stoke Mandeville hospital (where Savile was alleged to have abused girls during Satanic rituals). *BBC *explained that the documents showed that Thatcher was favorable to Savile's petition, and had several private meetings including lunch, though she was adamant that his name never be mentioned.440 Later it was revealed that Prince Charles himself signed on to be the 'Patron of the Appeal'.441 As of January 2013, police confirmed that at least 22 sexual abuse offenses by Jimmy Savile had taken place at the Stoke Mandeville hospital.442 A 2009 police interview with Savile shows that all he had to do was threaten legal action against the police, and the claims of abuse against him were dropped. At one point he told the officers, in reference to the Stoke Mandeville hospital, \"I own it.\"443 **The connections between Savile and the UK elite are certainly cause for suspicion. In 2007, Prince Charles sent Savile a Christmas Card which read: \"Jimmy, with affectionate greetings from Charles. Give my love to your ladies in Scotland.\"444** **Perhaps the most disturbing part of the Savile tale is that *everyone knew. *One senior police officer told *BBC *that \"We know Jimmy likes them young, he's got friends in high places.\"445 A retired Leeds policeman has claimed that \"there wasn't a copper in the city who didn't know Savile was a pervert\".446 *BBC *television and radio legend Sir Terry Wogan claimed that Savile's abuse was an 'open secret' and that it was common knowledge in the industry what he was up to.447** \"David Nicolson, 67, said he reported the incident to his bosses at the corporation in 1988 but was rebuffed and simply told: \"That's Jimmy\". He told *The Sun *newspaper: \"I was revolted by his behaviour. They just shrugged it off, saying, 'Yeah, yeah - that's the way it goes'.\" **\"Everyone knew what was going on.

The child told the doctor who examined her that a teacher at the West Point day care center was the one who hurt her... Children at West Point told stories that would become horrifyingly familiar. They said they had been ritually abused. They said they had had excrement smeared on their bodies and been forced to eat feces and drink urine. They said they were taken away from the day care center and photographed.\" - *San Jose Mercury News*460 The Presidio that the *San Jose Mercury News *and *New York Times *mentioned is a military base located in San Francisco. It became the subject of one of the strangest and sickening child abuse scandals in American history. In 1987, some parents whose children attended the Presidio day care center began to notice signs of abuse in their children, who began acting strangely, using sexually provocative language and sexually inappropriate behavior. **Upon taking their children to the hospital, it was revealed that they also suffered an array of physical symptoms showing clear cases of sexual abuse. When authorities would not act, the parents directly contacted the parents of other kids at the center and the result was shocking: 60 children had clear physical signs of abuse and 4 had contracted Chlamydia. Some were only infants.** The *American Journal of Orthopsychiatry *wrote an extensive analysis of the victims of the Presidio. They stated: \"The severity of the trauma for children at the Presidio was immediately manifest in clear cut symptoms. Before the abuse was exposed, parents had already noticed the following changes in their children: vaginal discharge, genital soreness, rashes, fear of the dark, sleep disturbances, nightmares, sexually provocative language, and sexually inappropriate behavior. In addition, the children were exhibiting other radical changes in behavior, including temper outbursts, sudden mood shifts, and poor impulse control. All these behavioral symptoms are to be expected in preschool children who have been molested.\"461 **The U.S. Army was in no hurry to investigate the claims of child abuse.** It took them 12 days to form a strategy group, and nearly a month passed before they notified other parents of the day care that child abuse allegations had been made. Although it is normal procedure to shut down a government daycare after such allegations, the Presidio Daycare Center remained open for nearly a year. By then, 59 other victims between the ages of three and seven were identified.462", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:120:284be0979f91", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13322, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 121, "text": "was in no hurry to investigate the claims of child abuse.** It took them 12 days to form a strategy group, and nearly a month passed before they notified other parents of the day care that child abuse allegations had been made.

By then, 59 other victims between the ages of three and seven were identified.462 Reports of a satanic cult being housed within the military base had apparently surfaced many years earlier. Military Police had investigated some buildings after reports of a man dressed all in black holding a little girl's hand had been reported. An MP was recorded as saying: \"We kicked the door open and here's this nice little bedroom. In a corner was a mannequin with a gun aimed at the door. On the left side there was a bunk against the wall. There was a pentagram on the floor, a huge one. There were dolls' heads all over the ceiling, just off-the-wall stuff... We were sitting there, we've got a cult on the Presidio of San Francisco and nobody cares about it. We were told by the provost marshal to just forget about it.\"463 **On the Autumnal equinox of 1987, an occult day of importance, fire would strike a building adjacent to the day care, destroying many records relating to the center. A month later, fire would destroy the day care center itself. The ATF found that the causes of both fires had been arson, contrary to the Armies own investigation which claimed faulty wiring.464** Only one man would ever have charges brought against him: Gary Hambright, a civilian employee who oversaw the daycare center. However, the prosecution bungled the case, bringing to trial only the children who 'would make the best witnesses' and leaving out the most prolific examples of physical abuse, such as those with rectal lesions and missing hymens. The judge presiding over the case deemed the charges as 'too vague' and Hambright walked free. **No other persons were charged and the US government quietly closed the case against Presidio itself.465 The lawyer for the Presidio was Joseph Russoniello, who also defended the United States government during the Iran/Contra trials.466** **At one point in the investigation, it was revealed that another man was being investigated by the police: Lieutenant Colonel Michael Aquino, military intelligence specialist. Army documents and child testimony showed that children from the day care center regularly took trips outside of the center, and many children were able to accurately identify what the inside of Aquino's house looked like. Investigators searched Aquino's house and retrieved thousands of videos and photographs, and found what appeared to be a soundproof room, but charges were never brought against him.467** **Who exactly is Michael Aquino?

Investigators searched Aquino's house and retrieved thousands of videos and photographs, and found what appeared to be a soundproof room, but charges were never brought against him.467** **Who exactly is Michael Aquino? It turns out he is an important piece of the puzzle. Aquino is openly a Satanist, who founded his own church called the Temple of Set. He coauthored the highly controversial document \"[Mindwar](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/mindwar-michael-aquino.pdf)\" in 1980, which would define the strategy and importance of Psychological Operations, aka PSYOPS, for the Department of Defense from that point forward.** In 'Mindwar', Aquino argues that the reason for the failure in Vietnam was not tactical, but rather the United States simply lost the war of information, being unable to turn the Vietnamese to their cause and unable to convince the domestic public of the importance of the war.468 Aquino proposes a new look at PSYOPS, claiming that it ought to be at the very forefront of the war effort, the very first and the most important technique employed as soon as conflict is deemed inevitable. No longer would 'tactical propaganda' such as leaflets and loudspeakers on the battlefield suffice, instead a vast array of propaganda and coercion techniques are needed. This goes beyond what we traditionally think of propaganda, such as planted news stories or front organizations that we saw in Operation Mockingbird. He also advocates 'Mindwar' on American citizens. \"MindWar must target all participants if it is to be effective. It must not only weaken the enemy; it must strengthen the United States.\" Immediately afterwards is a disturbing justification on the use of PSYOPS on Americans: \"Under existing United States law, PSYOP units may not target American citizens. That prohibition is based upon the presumption that \"propaganda\" is necessarily a lie or at least a misleading half-truth, and that the government has no right to lie to the people. The Propaganda Ministry of Goebbels must not be a part of the American way of life. Quite right, and so it must be axiomatic of MindWar that it always speaks the truth. Its power lies in its ability to focus recipients' attention on the truth of the future as well as that of the present. MindWar thus involves the stated promise of the truth that the United States has resolved to make real if it is not already so.\" So there is virtually no law barring the use of 'Mindwar' on Americans, because if it is not yet the truth, the Department of Defense will make it the 'truth'. Perhaps most terrifying is Aquino's insistence that: **\"There are some purely natural conditions under which minds may become more or", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:122:9eee21293e59", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13324, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 123, "text": "well as that of the present.

Perhaps most terrifying is Aquino's insistence that: **\"There are some purely natural conditions under which minds may become more or less receptive to ideas, and MindWar should take full advantage of such phenomena as atmospheric electromagnetic activity, air ionization, and extremely low frequency waves.\"** Consider the magnitude of this statement, imagine the Department of Defense manipulating domestic and foreign persons with Extremely Low Frequency waves to alter their political and moral dispositions to align with the interests of the United States. It sheds light on a statement Aquino makes in the beginning of the document: **\"Psychotronic research is in its infancy, but the U.S. Army already possesses an operational weapons systems designed to do what [Lieutenant Colonel John] Alexander would like ESP to do - except that this weapons system uses existing communications media. It seeks to map the minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then to change them in accordance with U.S. national interests. It does this on a wide scale, embracing military units, regions, nations, and blocs.\" ** Psychotronics, as defined by Aquino himself, is 'intelligence and operational use of ESP.' In the simplest terms, the Department of Defense has the capability to map a persons brain waves, and then use techniques such as ELF (Extremely Low Frequency Waves) to alter that persons brainwaves to a pattern more conducive to United States interests. This is the technique that Aquino is advocating to be used on domestic citizens, in the most defining thesis in PSYOPs history. And remember this paper was published 34 years ago. Where is the technology today? **As an important side note, Franklin victim Paul Bonacci (see section below) once identified Michael Aquino as an associate of convicted felon Larry King.469 Rusty Nelson at one point identified Michael Aquino as the man to whom he had seen Larry King once turn over a suitcase full of cash and bonds.470** In addition, Michael Aquino has been implicated in various other daycare and military installation child abuse scandals. One important example is the abuse case at the Jubilation Day Care Center at Fort Bragg, where multiple children positively identified Aquino as an abuser out of a video lineup of men dressed exactly like him.471 ***Editor's Note:** Watch [this revealing video](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/mind_control/satanic_cults_geraldo_aquino_gunderson) of Col.

According to the girl, she became involved in a cult where older male members sexually molested her and killed infants and children to establish their dominance over other cult members.\" Both Smith and Paul Bonacci claimed to have seen Larry King present at some rituals. Paul Bonacci wrote in his written history that King picked him up after school one day: \"...and took me to the Triangle which is in a wooded area in Sarpy County. I witnessed a sacrifice of a human baby boy. Everyone was chanting and it was a yearly ritual around the time of Christ's birth to pervert the blood of Christ.

Realm of darkness come now empower us your slaves.' Then they all began to chant some weird sounds and I got scared and was threatened I'd become the next sacrifice if I told anyone about it.\" **One of the names on the 'suspicious death list' surrounding the Franklin Scandal is Kathleen Sorenson, who took in the children who fled from the Webb family among many other abused children. Sorenson gave a stunning report to a Christian television channel which aired in Nebraska in 1989, based on her experiences with over 30 abused foster children who spent months or years in her home.** It provides an eye-opening introduction to a shocking phenomenon known as ritual abuse. The claims without further documentation certainly seem to be fantastical, so I urge the reader to suspend their disbelief until after the empirical evidence of extreme abuse has been fully discussed: \"We got involved and learned about this subject because we were foster parents and worked with a number of children. And several years back, several of the children began, after a period of time and building up trust, to talk about some very bizarre events that had happened in their past, and they were frightening and very confusing. I really didn't know what to think. We went to the police, and we went to social services, and there was really nothing anyone could do. These children we worked with are now adopted in safe homes and probably would never have talked had they not felt able to trust the people they were living with. There are certain things that are in common in the children's stories when we talk about devil worship... There are things that come up in every single story, such as candles. They all talk about sex. **Sex is without a doubt a part of every area of this - all sorts of perverted sex. **That is what you will first hear, about the sex, about the incest, and it is so hard to believe. But once we get that, we have learned that we can go on and ask and find out... and it will involve pornography; that is always part of it. Part of the reason is that they can use that to threaten the children. \"We have pictures. We will show the police if you talk.\" It makes the children feel that they are in great danger, and they are all very frightened of the law.

They talk about the garish makeup that the people in the group wear. They talk about singing that they didn't understand. Obviously that is chanting, and that has come up in every one of these stories, and none of them call it chanting. There will be dancing. Most often that will involve sexual acts. There will always be a leader and they will be very frightened of the leader. **These children, from a very young age, and I am talking about children who came out of birth homes, the family they were born to, worshiped the devil. ...** **Important Note: The remainder of this testimony is highly graphic and disturbing. Only if you feel you are ready for it, [click here](javascript:;).** **The children I have talked to have all had to murder before the age of two. That is something beyond anything I could comprehend.** But in some way, whether with the help of an adult's hand over theirs, by having them practice, by getting them excited to be part of the adult scene, they do murder. And the evil thing that happens is, that they really believe that they want to. They want to do what the older people are doing, and they are praised for that. And that becomes their goal, to be like the adults... They are told they will never get out, no one will ever believe them, that there is no freedom, that \"the law will get you.\" They are hopeless before they get someone willing to listen. They are threatened with death. **Every time a child is killed in their group, they are told, \"If you tell, this will happen to you.\" **They have every reason to believe that. So even when they are into the [foster care] system, and with another family and begin to feel somewhat safe, they still expect these people to show up on the doorstep. They believe that these people know everything they are doing, everyone they're talking to. One teenager told me that she had been told that if she ever got married, that they would fool her.

As you listen to us talk about these things, there will be a natural part of you which will deny much of what you hear, and believe me, we did too. I would like to share this with you, partly in the children's words, so that you can hear the things that they said that nobody could make up, that no child could know. That's what eventually convinced me, along with the deep emotion. The grieving, screeching damage and hurt that they cry out with as they talk. The children I will be talking about, these are all children that I personally talked to. They are today between the ages of five and 17. When they talked they were between the ages of five and 15. When these things occurred to them, they were between the ages of, well birth, but of when memory enters in, I would say a year and a half to eight. So we are talking about very small children.... We are talking about children forming consciences at that time, learning right from wrong. These children do not know. They come out and do not know what is right. They are confused. What they did before, that they were rewarded for, is such a horror to anybody else, that they are shunned. And most often they have been in multiple placements. They will go to a home, they will steal, they will lie, they will hurt animals. One little guy would sharpen pencils and try to stab people. I don't mean poke, I mean stab. People don't like that in their homes. They don't have any idea what it is, they just think, \"We have a weird kid.\" Many are sent to psychiatric hospitals where they are labeled psychotics, schizophrenics, and who would want them in? I will begin with the first stories that we heard, which will seem horrible to you, but are very mild to me, because we have progressed and heard far worse things. The first story is about two little boys who were 7 and 9 when they talked, and they told about sexual abuse at one point, and were very grieved. We talked about good and bad touching and we thought we really had gotten to the bottom of it, and then** that afternoon the little one began to cry, and when we couldn't get the answer from him, the older brother said, \"He is probably crying because he was in the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:127:5edeca3d9a0e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13329, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 128, "text": "The first story is about two little boys who were 7 and 9 when they talked, and they told about sexual abuse at one point, and were very grieved.

And as they described that, they talked about that particular victim being brought into a room, hands and arms tied, mouth taped, and how there had been x's marked on his body, on his vital organs. That was bad enough. Within a very few weeks we learned that it was not the adults who had killed that child. It was this oldest boy, who was talking. The next person that we talked to was a little boy, who was very borderline mentally. He had language problems, it was very hard for him to explain himself. And when he began to come out of it, everyone was startled the way he talked. We were real sure ... he had not been around these other children and heard anything, but we began to question ourselves, \"Are we asking strange questions. Is there something odd about us which makes children come and dump these things on us?\" The part which made me believe this child's story, he talked about different babies being killed, but this particular one being stabbed, he curled up in a fetal position, he was 9 years old when he was telling the story. He curled up in a fetal position, and his eyes got real glazed, and he said, \"They cooked that baby on the grill.\" And I thought, he has really flipped out. I mean, I didn't know. And he said, \"Oh, gross, it smelled like rotten chicken, or rotten deer.\" He then went on to tell us how they would cut out the heart, or cut off the sex organs, and save them in the refrigerator. A very typical thing that these kids talk about. They *worship *the sex organs.... They kept it for another ceremony. I asked him where the bodies went. I did not get any answers from that child about what happened to the bodies, but the other two boys, who I spoke about first, eventually, they talked about throwing the babies in the fire. And I asked about that, \"You mean they were dead when they threw them in the fire?\" And the littlest one said, \"No, no. Them was alive and them threw them.\" And by this time we were really getting freaked out. What were we going to do? How can you help these kids?

Where do you find a therapist who can deal with this? ... But God set up a support system. Other families were helping us, and that really helped. The next child I will share about, and I am going sort of by categories here, how we learned, and the types of killings, this little girl is 11 today, she was nine when she first talked. It was a very painful thing when she first started to share the sex things. The sex things are so harmful to the children and they are so embarrassed and it is so personal to the children, and they know that they enjoyed that. They know that. We had been through all that. She began to draw pictures of cats, and the cats all had tails that were on the other side of the page, or their leg was someplace else. As we began to work with her and talk, she said that she had had to kill a pregnant cat. She first said that they had killed a pregnant cat. We said how did you know it was pregnant. Well, she could not explain that, but as we got into it, she confessed that she had had to kill the cat. And I asked her. And her description was, \"With a knife, I put it in her bottom, and twisted it.\" Now you tell me, does a kid know that? If I ask a kid how do you kill a cat, do you think they will say that? Those are the kinds of details these children tell us. Later, and they eventually cut the cat open, and that was how they knew the cat was pregnant. And they eat parts of the cat, and the feces and the blood. And again, this was just the beginning. It progressed, and the next time she had to kill a baby, the same way - put the knife in the bottom and twist. The baby was alive and he was screaming. And that child hears that, to this day, and has nightmares and flashbacks. And they cut the baby open, and they ate the baby. They do this, so there are no bodies left, and they bum what is left and grind up the bones. And she talked about that, pouring gasoline on the bodies and burning them in the back yard. And I used to think that was", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:129:d2a306e6d0ae", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13331, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 130, "text": "the bottom and twist.

And I used to think that was nuts, but I have heard it enough times now that I know it must be so.... We know there are mortuaries involved to cremate the bodies, and that makes sense.... The most horrible story about fire that I have to tell, and this is extremely, extremely disturbing, it was a little girl, she was a teenager when she was telling me. And she was describing a barn where they used to go to have their meetings and they used to gather outside the barn, and there would be chanting. And then as they went inside the barn they would be split into different groups. And she was never with any of her family, they all went to different places. And I asked her where she had to go and she said \"I was always in the burning room.\" And as she went on to describe the burning room, I thought, how she came out of this, with any sanity at all, I don't know. She was a very small child. They would take in children, probably pre-schoolers, and they would hang them from the rafters in this barn, and there would be as many as five or ten hung in a row. They would be fully clothed, which is unusual, because frequently they are naked. The children, like this girl, were all given candles. And you can picture the ceremony as she described it. And the candles were lit. Then the adults would go forward and would pour liquid from a cup on each of the children's clothing, which was obviously gasoline or kerosene. And then they would give a signal and the others would have to go forward and set the children on fire. When they were done they would cut them down. The first child that this girl had to kill was a cousin, a little cousin. What does that do to you? But you couldn't object, because the children that objected were killed. This child, about two years ago, just fell to the ground at Christmas time, everyone thinks that Christmas is such a wonderful time. And she confessed that she hated Christmas. She couldn't wait until everything was put away because all she could hear was babies crying. Christmas is the time when the most babies die. And she covered her ears and cried for hours, and screamed, \"Stop it, stop it, stop it!

And she covered her ears and cried for hours, and screamed, \"Stop it, stop it, stop it! Talk to God and make him stop it!\" All she could hear is the screams and the babies crying.... Christmas for the children I have talked to has been one of the worst times. I have had three children tell me about a very similar ceremony. I will kind of merge that and tell you how it went. They were taken to a church, and all the children, it is a very festive occasion, and they are taken to the front of the church, and a small child is now brought in, two of them talked about babies and they put them on a platform. The adults are all celebrating and dancing and singing, and the children are getting into the spirit of it. What they are doing is forming a circle around the child, and of course the child represents the child Jesus, and they begin mocking, and spitting, and calling names, and then they encourage the children to begin doing it. You can imagine how it gets out of control. And at some point they hand all of the children knives and then they are all hacking and slashing until the baby is dead. And then they all celebrate because the child Jesus is dead.\"473 **Kathleen Sorenson died in October 1989, shortly after this report was aired. On a long rural road returning to her home, a car heading in the opposite direction crossed lanes and caused a head-on collision.

But there is an historical precedent. Consider these two quotes from the works of Aleister Crowley, founder of the Church of Satan in the year 1900: \"Moreover, the beast 666 adviseth that all children shall be accustomed from infancy to witness every type of sexual act, and also the process of birth, lest falsehood fog, and mystery stupefy, their minds, whose error else might thwart and misdirect the growth of their subconscious system of soul-symbolism... **There are cases when seduction or rape may be emancipation or initiation to another.

The animal should therefore be killed within the circle, or the triangle, as the case may be, so that its energy cannot escape.** An animal should be selected whose nature accords with that of the ceremony... For the highest spiritual working one must accordingly choose the victim which contains the greatest and purest force. A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory and suitable victim.\" - Crowley, Magick in Theory and Practice475 474 Aleister Crowley, \"The Law is for All,\" [Excerpt available here](http://web.archive.org/web/20110319094209/http://hermetic.com/legis/new-comment/). 475 Aleister Crowley, \"Magick in Theory and Practice,\" [http://hermetic.com/crowley/book-4/chap12.html](http://hermetic.com/crowley/book-4/chap12.html)[Excerpt available here](http://hermetic.com/crowley/book-4/chap12.html). * * * * Empirical Evidence I**n 1996, three members of the American Psychological Association conducted a survey of their organization, receiving feedback from 2,709 clinical psychologists. 30% acknowledged seeing at least one case of \"ritualistic or religion-related abuse since January 1, 1980\".476 Two-thirds of these cases were described as 'religion related' and one-third were described as 'ritual abuse'. Of those who acknowledged seeing these cases, 93% of the clinical psychologists said that they believed the abuse did indeed occur. **The authors concluded that the psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers who responded to their survey \"overwhelmingly believed both the allegations of abuse and the allegations of ritual or religious elements of the abuse\". **Another study surveyed 810 members of the British Psychological Society who had patients who suffered from sexual abuse, and found that 15% had patients who reported satanic ritual abuse. Of these, 80% believed that their patient did indeed suffer from the reported abuse.477** One study examined 270 cases of substantiated sexual abuse involving day cares in England found that 13% of the cases included allegations of ritual abuse.478 One survey of the membership of the International Society for the Study of Multiple Personality and Dissociation concluded that 88% of 1185 respondents \"reported belief in ritual abuse, involving mind control and programming\".479 \"In 1992 alone, Childhelp USA logged 1,741 calls pertaining to ritual abuse, Monarch Resources of Los Angeles logged approximately 5,000, Real Active Survivors tallied nearly 3,600, Justus Unlimited of Colorado", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:132:e3f197d8d9a9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13334, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 133, "text": "abuse involving day cares in England found that 13% of the cases included allegations of ritual abuse.478 One survey of the membership of the International Society for the Study of Multiple Personality and Dissociation concluded that 88% of 1185 respondents \"reported belief in ritual abuse, involving mind control and programming\".479 \"In 1992 alone, Childhelp USA logged 1,741 calls pertaining to ritual abuse, Monarch Resources of Los Angeles logged approximately 5,000, Real Active Survivors tallied nearly 3,600, Justus Unlimited of Colorado received almost 7,000, and Looking Up of Maine handled around 6,000. Even allowing for some of these calls to have been made by people who assist survivors but are not themselves survivors, and for some survivors to have called more that one helpline or made multiple calls to the same helpline, these numbers suggest that at a minimum there must be tens of thousands of survivors of ritual abuse in the United States.\" - Catherine Gould, *The Journal of Psychohistory*480 In 2007, four researchers created an international online survey divided into three parts, available in English and German, called Extreme Abuse Surveys, in an effort to gather a large number of responses as preliminary data on the nature and prevalence of extreme abuse.481 The researchers were: Wanda Karricker, PhD, retired U.S. psychologist Bettina Overcamp, PhD, Thorsten Becker, the German social worker who won the \"German Child Protection Award\" in 1994 for his work with abused children, and [Carol Rutz](https://www.WantToKnow.info/nationbetrayed10pg), a survivor of extreme abuse and mind control. The surveys show repeated allegations of abuse used for the purposes of mind control, which will be explored in the next chapter. **1,471 participants from 31 countries answered at least one question on the survey listed for 'Adult Survivors',** and 451 people from 20 countries responded to at least one question listed for 'Professionals' who have worked with at least one adult survivor of extreme abuse. Of the adult survivors, 257 people from 15 countries responded that they had been victims of 'Government Mind Control' experimentation as a child, and 71 professionals from 6 countries responded that they had worked with at least 1 adult survivor of extreme abuse who reported to have been a victim of government mind control experimentation as a child. 166 survivors reported being experimented on by doctors who spoke German or with a heavy German accent. **Of the adult survivors, 236 reported to have been drugged against their will, 236 reported to have been sexually abused by multiple perpetrators, 228 reported being threatened with death if they ever discussed their experiences, 222 reported sensory deprivation experiments, 217 reported electroshock experiments, 197 witnessed murder by their perpetrators, 196 witnessed animal mutilations, 184 reported the use of feces in their abuse, 183 reported being used in child pornography, 178 reported starvation, 171 reported hypnosis, and 169 reported child prostitution.** **Of the 257 EAS respondents who reported that secret mind control", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:133:7210882b6fc3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13335, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 134, "text": "will, 236 reported to have been sexually abused by multiple perpetrators, 228 reported being threatened with death if they ever discussed their experiences, 222 reported sensory deprivation experiments, 217 reported electroshock experiments, 197 witnessed murder by their perpetrators, 196 witnessed animal mutilations, 184 reported the use of feces in their abuse, 183 reported being used in child pornography, 178 reported starvation, 171 reported hypnosis, and 169 reported child prostitution.** **Of the 257 EAS respondents who reported that secret mind control experiments were used on them as children, 69% (177) reported having been abused in a satanic cult. Of the 543 EAS respondents who reported that they had been abused in a satanic cult, 33% (179) reported having been used in secret mind control experiments as children.** 159 survivors had heard Greek letters being used during their abuse, and 160 experienced sexual mind control programming used for blackmail or personal use. 228 survivors answered 'yes' to the question: \"My perpetrator(s) deliberately created/programmed dissociative states of mind (such as alters, personalities, ego-states) in me.\" Research has consistently shown that false allegations of child sexual abuse by children are rare. One 1987 study examined 576 consecutive referrals of child sexual abuse to the Denver Department of Social Services, and categorized the reports as either reliable or fictitious. In only 8% of the total cases were children judged to have possibly advanced a fictitious allegation.482 In a more recent study, investigators reviewed case notes of all child sexual abuse reports to the Denver Department of Social Services over 12 months. Of the 551 cases reviewed, there were only 14 (2.5%) instances of erroneous concerns about abuse emanating from children. These consisted of three cases of allegations made in collusion with a parent, three cases where an innocent event was misinterpreted as sexual abuse and eight cases (1.5%) of false allegations of sexual abuse.483 Researchers into the phenomenon of Satanic Ritual Abuse have come to the conclusion that the phenomenon is widespread and transcends geographic boundaries.484 One such study, titled \"Multiple Personality Disorder and Satanic Ritual Abuse: The Issue of Credibility\" states: \"The comparability of both the child and adult accounts is said to transcend geographical and relationship boundaries, with descriptions emerging from both survivor groups revealing common themes, behaviors, symbols, and paraphernalia. Assuredly, the possibility of cross-contamination of accounts exists when, for example, a group of suspected or potential victims seems to be involved in a single day care case, or when adult contemporaries are aware of the details of others' reports. However, one can not discount the similarity of accounts given spontaneously and independently by individuals who are unrelated personally, geographically, or through shared knowledge.\" **The empirical evidence of ritual abuse for the purposes of mind control establishes that the phenomenon is widespread and international, and consistency between methods of abuse. Furthermore, the methods of abuse correlate both with known experimentation under MK-ULTRA", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:134:6df701dee2a6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13336, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 135, "text": "in a single day care case, or when adult contemporaries are aware of the details of others' reports.

Furthermore, the methods of abuse correlate both with known experimentation under MK-ULTRA and the testimonies of child abuse case studies such as Franklin and Presidio. It also reveals a solid consensus that psychiatrists who have been exposed to patients who have suffered from ritual abuse believe that the abuse did indeed occur. Its interesting to note that such a widespread consensus is relatively rare in the field of psychology, let alone for such a controversial topic.** 476 Bottoms, Bette L.; Shaver, Phillip R.; Goodman, Gail S. \"[An analysis of ritualistic and religion-related child abuse allegations.](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/lhb/20/1/1/)\" Law and Human Behavior, Vol 20(1), Feb 1996 477 Andrews, B., Morton, J., Bekerian, D.A., Brewin, C.R., Davies, G.M., & Mollon, P. \"[The recovery of memories in clinical practice: Experiences and beliefs of British Psychological Society practitioners.](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/125560/)\" *The Psychologist*, May, 1995 478 Finkelhor, D., Williams, L., & Burns, N. \"[Nursery crimes: Sexual abuse in day care](http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book2639).\" Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications. 1988 479 Perry, N.E. \"Therapists' experiences of the effects of working with dissociative patients.\" Paper presented at the 9th Annual Meeting of the International Society for the Study of Multiple Personality and Dissociation, Chicago, IL. 1992 480 Catherine Gould \"[Denying Ritual Abuse in Children](http://ritualabuse.us/ritualabuse/articles/denying-ritual-abuse-of-children-catherine-gould/),\" *The Journal of Psychohistory *Volume 22, 1995 481 [Extreme Abuse Survey](https://ritualabuse.us/mindcontrol/eas-studies/) 482 Jones, D.

Freyd initiated the founding of the FMSF after being accused of sexual abuse by his daughter, Jennifer. His behavior has been particularly suspect, such as accusing his daughter of being brain damaged, despite the fact that she holds a PhD in Psychology, graduated magna cum laude from Penn and is currently a tenured professor of psychology at the University of Oregon. Speaking to *The Oregonian, *Jennifer Freyd stated that \"I'm sometimes flabbergasted that my memory is considered 'false' and my alcoholic father's memory is considered rational and sane.\"485 **Peter Freyd once stated that \"With the help of Harold Lief and Martin Orne, the FMSF quickly gathered a respectable appearing advisory board, giving the new syndrome an aura of scientific acceptance.\"486 Interestingly, Dr. Martin T.

The [False Memory Syndrome] foundation is an aggressive, well-financed PR machine adept at manipulating the press, harassing its critics, and mobilizing a diverse army of psychiatrists, outspoken academics, expert defense witnesses, litigious lawyers, Freud bashers, critics of psychotherapy, and devastated parents.\"493** The FMSF has repeatedly cited a study presented at a Harvard conference where researchers were repeatedly able to implant the false memory of mundane tasks like grocery shopping, into their subjects using techniques such as hypnosis.494 It has been championed as proof that memories are easily manipulated. However, research has shown that memories of abuse function very differently than average memories. \"However, leading memory researchers such as Dr. Bessel van der Kolk of Harvard Medical School maintain that traumatic memories, which typically are engraved in the sensorimotor processes, are not subject to the same kinds of contamination that can affect normal memory. Traumatic amnesia, described in the DSM-III-R as psychogenic amnesia, is a phenomenon which has been known to mental health professionals for more than 100 years. The clinically observed characteristics of traumatic memory formation and retrieval match precisely the patterns of memory recovery exhibited by SRA [Satanic Ritual Abuse] survivors, and strongly confirm the reality of their cult abuse.\"495 **There is also the case of Paul and Shirley Eberle, who are famous for propagating the idea of a 'satanic panic', that the widespread reporting of ritual abuse is merely a social contagion.

Paul and Shirley Eberle edit a soft-core magazine in California called the L.A. Star that contains a mixture of nude photos, celebrity gossip, telephone sex ads, and promos for The Politics of Child Abuse. **In the 1970's, however, the Eberles were also publishing hard-core pornography. Their publication, Finger, depicted scenes of bondage, S & M, and sexual activities involving urination and defecation. A young girl portrayed with a wide smile on her face sits on top of a man whose penis is inside of her; a woman has oral sex with a young boy in a drawing entitled \"Memories of My Boyhood.\"** The Eberles were featured nude on one cover holding two life-size blow up dolls names \"Love Girl\" and \"Play Guy.\" No dates appear on the issues and the Eberles rarely attach their names, referring to themselves as \"The L.A. Star Family.\" **The Eberles were the distributors of Finger and several other underground magazines, says Donald Smith, a sergeant with the obscenity section of the Los Angeles Police Department's vice division** who followed the couple for years. LAPD was never able to prosecute for child pornography: \"There were a lot of photos of people who looked like they were under age but we could never prove it.\" The pictures of young children in Finger are illustrations, and child pornography laws were less rigid a decade ago than they are today. **\"Sexpot at Five,\" \"My First Rape, She Was Only Thirteen,\" and \"What Happens When Niggers Adopt White Children\" are some of the articles that appeared in Finger.** One letter states: \"I think it's really great that your mags have the courage to print articles & pixs [sic] on child sex... Too bad I didn't hear from more women who are into child sex... Since I'm single I'm not getting it on with my children, but I know of a few families that are.

A shocking segment from Australia's *60 Minutes* aired in July 2015 and titled \"[Spies, Lords, and Predators](https://www.WantToKnow.info/sexabuse/pedophiles-politicians)\" shows grown men expressing no remorse about being pedophiles. A March 2017 segment of the Dr. Phil Show featured the testimony of a girl named Kendall who was kept in cages, made to partake in bizarre rituals, and trafficked around the world to sexually serve the rich and famous. Short clips and an introduction are available on the [Dr. Phil website](http://www.drphil.com/videos/woman-claims-parents-sold-her-to-an-international-sex-trafficking-organization-at-birth/), while the entire show is [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJNrzYHE-2s).

In the context of psychopathy, the potential is at least recognizable. **Cults serve as a network for psychopaths who enjoy sadistic sexual practices and the potential for concealing knowledge.** The very concept of the occult is based in taking knowledge out of the circulation of the masses and reserving it for a select few. In other words, the purpose is to keep knowledge for personal gain and to use this knowledge to wield power over others. **Former members of the Church", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:139:ee2ed951fdc2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13341, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 140, "text": "the context of psychopathy, the potential is at least recognizable. **Cults serve as a network for psychopaths who enjoy sadistic sexual practices and the potential for concealing knowledge.** The very concept of the occult is based in taking knowledge out of the circulation of the masses and reserving it for a select few. In other words, the purpose is to keep knowledge for personal gain and to use this knowledge to wield power over others. **Former members of the Church of Satan and other similar cults have testified that the basic goal of 'occult knowledge' is to understand the human psyche, primary human motivations and how humanity functions. This knowledge is then used to exploit people. The worldview of these groups is extremely dark, and is based on controlling others, gaining knowledge to use as influence, and then partnering with like-minded individuals and groups to expand upon this knowledge and use it more effectively.** **The next step into the rabbit hole is that these groups act as 'psychopath filtration' centers. They deliberately target psychopaths for initiation and then use their resources to put them into positions of power in a variety of fields such as politics, law, business, education, science and more. Franklin, Dutroux, Savile, and the Presidio are all examples of psychopathic networks that have infiltrated institutions of power, and are each a small glimpse into the hierarchy of the Pathocracy.** The next chapter will explore the uses of extreme abuse for the purpose of mind control, and why so many men involved with MK-ULTRA would have a vested interest in hiding and marginalizing the existence of such abuse. * * * * Food for Thought: 1. How connected are occult groups with each other? 2. Is the CIA responsible for various cults as 'front groups' for MK-ULTRA and other projects? 3. Why is the discussion of the existence of cults marginalized from the mainstream? 4. How widespread are networks that abuse and sell children? 5. What are the profits from child pornography and prostitution earned by cults used for? 6. How much influence has Michael Aquino's 'MindWar' had on official Psychological Operation policy? 7. How much has technology discussed in 'MindWar' regarding the manipulation of the brain advanced in the more than 30 years of its publication? 8. Is it disturbing that Aquino's Temple of Set, and likely by extension other occult groups, have knowledge and access to this technology? 9.

Everything for saving the country. National security and the Cold War. In war, all is fair.'\" - CIA Director William Colby,** as related by John DeCamp, *Executive Intelligence Review, *Volume 26, Number 12, March 19, 1999497 \"He recalls one senior KGB man who told too many sexual jokes about young boys. 'It didn't take too long to recognize that he was more than a little fascinated by youths,' says the source. 'He was probably too good, too well-trained, to be either entrapped or to give away secrets. But he would have been tempted toward a compromising position by a preteen. I mentioned this, and they said, 'As a psychological observer, you're probably quite right. But what the hell are we going to do about it? Where are we going to get a twelve-year-old boy?' The source believes that if the Russian had had a taste for older men, U.S. intelligence might have mounted an operation, 'but the idea of a twelve-year-old boy was just more than anybody could stomach.'\" - John Marks498 The idea of using a child for entrapment might have been too much for some CIA operatives to stomach, but what about to the psychopathic leadership? **Connecting the dots between the use of hypnosis, drugs and entrapment under [MK-ULTRA](https://www.wanttoknow.info/050626mkultra), the abuse of children in [Franklin](https://www.wanttoknow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence), [Belgium](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#dutroux), and [Presidio](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#13), and the extreme abuse perpetrated by occult groups against children, a dark picture begins to emerge. One link that ties together many of these cases is the creation of multiple personality disorder, now known as dissociative identity disorder, in the victims of extreme abuse. ** Franklin's Paul Bonacci alleged that his condition was created deliberately by scientists operating out of Offutt Air Force Base outside of Omaha, Nebraska, beginning at the age of three.499 Later, he was introduced to the pedophile and child abuse ring of Larry King, where he became a child prostitute to wealthy men and politicians around the country, as well as acting as a drug courier on many of his trips. Dutroux's first victim-witness, X1, alleged that her multiple personalities were induced when she was introduced to a group of violent pedophiles at the age of two by", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:141:1a2ab19bbfab", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13343, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 142, "text": "Force Base outside of Omaha, Nebraska, beginning at the age of three.499 Later, he was introduced to the pedophile and child abuse ring of Larry King, where he became a child prostitute to wealthy men and politicians around the country, as well as acting as a drug courier on many of his trips. Dutroux's first victim-witness, X1, alleged that her multiple personalities were induced when she was introduced to a group of violent pedophiles at the age of two by her grandmother. **Indeed, Multiple Personality Disorder is a big part of the picture. The current understanding of the disorder is that its onset begins at a very young age, after a child suffers from horrific abuse, often sexual in nature, that in a very real sense 'shatters' the child's mind into a collection of coexisting personalities to deal with the abuse they have received.** **\"As many as 98% to 99% of individuals who develop dissociative disorders have recognized personal histories of recurring, overpowering, and often life-threatening disturbances at a sensitive developmental stage of childhood.\" - WebMD500** **The brain apparently dissociates exceptionally well: researchers have found that sufferers of Dissociative Identity Disorder will often have no memories of abuse they endured, and go as far as to vehemently deny their past experiences, despite extensive documentation by hospitals and courts of the abuse at the time it happened, and in addition, lifelong physical scars and symptoms that had arisen from the abuse. However, when an 'alter' was present as the dominant psyche, detailed memories of the abuse were present.501** The same study found that the 'alters' would have completely distinct personalities, with different handwriting, and often, different genders. It is very likely that the possibility of deliberately creating multiple personalities in a child was understood at least as early as the medical experiments undertaken during World War II by the Third Reich. A cursory reading of the available data regarding the work of certain doctors such as the notorious 'Angel of Death' Dr. Mengele shows that much of the research undertaken at concentration camps had to do with inflicting trauma and recording its various effects. A logical conclusion is that these psychopathic doctors attempted to understand and then exploit the condition. Remember G.H. Estabrooks, associate of the FBI and CIA, and World War II hypnotist who was discussed in the MKULTRA chapter? Here is a salient quote, taken from a 1968 article in the *Providence Evening Bulletin, *which will set a stage for the introduction to the topic of Dissociative Identity Disorder and hypnotism: \"The key to creating an effective spy or assassin rests in splitting a man's personality, or creating multiple personalities, with the aid of hypnotism... this is not science fiction. This has and is being done. I have done it.\"502 The CIA and Estabrooks conceded that only one in five people could be susceptible to hypnotism, and even less", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:142:f8322c867235", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13344, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 143, "text": "in the *Providence Evening Bulletin, *which will set a stage for the introduction to the topic of Dissociative Identity Disorder and hypnotism: \"The key to creating an effective spy or assassin rests in splitting a man's personality, or creating multiple personalities, with the aid of hypnotism... this is not science fiction. This has and is being done. I have done it.\"502 The CIA and Estabrooks conceded that only one in five people could be susceptible to hypnotism, and even less would be able to be subjected to the extreme dissociation and amnesia involved in the creation of multiple personalities. So research was conducted towards increasing the susceptibility of hypnotic mind control through the use of drugs and electroshock. The latter technique offers a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg into a variety of techniques involving using trauma to store memories in a sensitive part of the brain, with long-lasting recall potential but otherwise amnesiac effects in the primary personality. **The extension of this research is known as \"trauma-based mind control.\" The general idea is to subject children to horrific and unthinkable abuse at a sensitive age of development with the purpose of deliberately creating multiple personalities. The alternate personalities would then be programmed, through the use of hypnosis, drugs and further trauma, sometimes to store sensitive information, sometimes to create spies, assassins, prostitutes and more. ** The victim's primary personality would be completely unaware not only that they had programmed alternate personalities, but that they had been a victim of extreme abuse in the first place. Due to the associated trauma, the programming would be stored in a different part of the brain than normal memories, increasing both the power of the memory and the difficulty of recall.503 Using hypnotic suggestion, any designated person with the proper information, such as a code word, would be able to access a victims alternate personality and exploit the programming. 497 'Monarch' is the alleged name for the program of Trauma-Based Mind Control, most frequently given by the victims of the program themselves, although the legitimacy of this moniker has not been confirmed.

In this landmark speech titled \"Hypnosis in MPD: Ritual Abuse, he explained his experiences with patients suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder.\"504 **Before analyzing the speech, here are Dr. Corydon's credentials:** • B.S., M.S., Ph.D. (Counseling Psychology) from the University of Utah. • Licensed Psychologist, Licensed Marital Therapist, Licensed Family Therapist, State of Utah. **• Associate Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Utah School of Medicine.** **• Adjunct Associate Professor of Educational Psychology, University of Utah.** **• Director and Founder of the Sex and Marital Therapy Clinic, University of Utah.** • Editor, The American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis. • Advising Editor and Founding Member, Editorial Board, The Ericksonian Monograph. • Referee, The Journal of Abnormal Psychology. • Clinical Supervisor and Board Examiner, American Board of Sexology. • Diplomate in Marital and Sex Therapy, American Board of Family Psychology. • Diplomate in Clinical Hypnosis, the American Board of Psychological Hypnosis. • Diplomate in Sex Therapy, the American Board of Sexology. • 1989 Presidential Award of Merit, American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. • 1990 Urban Sector Award, American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. • President, American Society of Clinical Hypnosis.505 **Dr. Hammond had been examining patients with dissociative identity disorder (DID, formerly known as MPD) and came across some startling discoveries, which he verified with many of his peers. Many of them had undergone horrific ritual and sexual abuse as a child exactly as described in the case studies examined in previous chapters.** After a brief introduction, Dr. Hammond began with saying: \"In Chicago [in 1984], at the first international congress where ritual abuse was talked about, I can remember thinking, \"How strange and interesting.\" I can recall many people listening to an example given that somebody thought was so idiosyncratic and rare, and all the people coming up after saying, \"Gee, you're treating one, too? You're in Seattle ... Well, I'm in Toronto ... Well, I'm in Florida ... Well, I'm in Cincinnati.\" I didn't know what to think at that point. It wasn't too long after that I found my first ritual-abuse patient in somebody I was already treating and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:144:bfa796c8b1df", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13346, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 145, "text": "strange and interesting.\" I can recall many people listening to an example given that somebody thought was so idiosyncratic and rare, and all the people coming up after saying, \"Gee, you're treating one, too? You're in Seattle ... Well, I'm in Toronto ... Well, I'm in Florida ... Well, I'm in Cincinnati.\" I didn't know what to think at that point. It wasn't too long after that I found my first ritual-abuse patient in somebody I was already treating and we hadn't gotten that deep yet. Things in that case made me very curious about the use of mind control techniques and hypnosis and other brainwashing techniques... The fascinating thing was that as I did a telephone consult with a therapist that I'd been consulting with for quite a number of months on an MPD case in another state, I told her to inquire about certain things. She said, \"Well, what are those things?\" I said, \"I'm not going to tell you, because I don't want there to be any possibility of contamination. Just come back to me and tell me what the patient says.\" She called me back two hours later, and said, \"I just had a double session with this patient and there was a part of him that said, 'Oh, we're so excited. If you know about this stuff, you know how the cult programmers get on the inside and our therapy is going to go so much faster.' ...I've consulted in eleven states and one foreign country, in some cases over the telephone, in some cases in person, in some cases giving the therapist information ahead of time and saying, \"Be very careful how you phrase this. Phrase it in these ways so you don't contaminate.\" In other cases I didn't give the therapist information ahead of time so they couldn't contaminate the results. **When you start to find the same highly esoteric information in different states and different countries, from Florida to California, you start to get an idea that there's something going on that is very large, very well coordinated, with a great deal of communication and systematicness to what's happening.** **So I have gone from someone kind of neutral and not knowing what to think about it all, to someone who clearly believes ritual abuse is real and that the people who say it isn't are either naive like people who didn't want to believe the Holocaust or-they're dirty [involved in the programs]. \"** Immediately we get the understanding that these victims are not confined geographically, and in addition, an insight into how Dr. Hammond approached his investigation as to avoid 'hypnotic suggestion' and other techniques which the 'False Memory Syndrome Foundation' cites as the basis of all ritual abuse claims.

The last line, stating that those who deny the existence of ritual abuse are either naive or dirty, was met with lots of applause from the audience. **\"What they basically do is they will get a child and they will start this in basic forms, it appears, by about two and a half after the child's already been made dissociative. They'll make him dissociative not only through abuse, like sexual abuse, but also things like putting a mousetrap on their fingers and teaching the parents, \"You do not go in until the child stops crying. Only then do you go in and remove it.**\" They start in rudimentary forms at about two and a half and kick into high gear, it appears, around six or six and a half, continue through adolescence with periodic reinforcements in adulthood. Basically, in the programming the child will be put typically on a gurney. They will have an I.V. in one hand or arm. They'll be strapped down, typically naked. There'll be wires attached to their head to monitor electroencephalograph patterns. They will see a pulsing light, most often described as red, occasionally white or blue. They'll be given, most commonly I believe, Demerol. Sometimes it'll be other drugs as well, depending on the kind of programming. They have it, I think, down to a science where they've learned you give so much every twenty-five minutes until the programming is done. They then will describe a pain on one ear, their right ear generally, where it appears a needle has been placed, and they will hear weird, disorienting sounds in that ear while they see photic stimulation to drive the brain into a brain wave pattern with a pulsing light at a certain frequency, not unlike the goggles that are now available through Sharper Image and some of those kinds of stores. **Then, after a suitable period when they're in a certain brain wave state, they will begin programming oriented to self-destruction and debasement of the person. One patient about eight years old had gone through a great deal of early programming which took place on a military installation. That's not uncommon. I've treated and been involved with cases who are part of this original mind control project, as well as having their programming on military installations in many cases. We find a lot of connections with the CIA.\"** The victim testimony of the use of drugs and other techniques is similar to the available evidence regarding MK-ULTRA experiments such as Dr. Ewen Cameron's 'psychic driving'", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:146:a3edaf3f30b5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13348, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 147, "text": "a great deal of early programming which took place on a military installation. That's not uncommon. I've treated and been involved with cases who are part of this original mind control project, as well as having their programming on military installations in many cases. We find a lot of connections with the CIA.\"** The victim testimony of the use of drugs and other techniques is similar to the available evidence regarding MK-ULTRA experiments such as Dr. Ewen Cameron's 'psychic driving' and the documented search for drugs which help induce hypnosis. The references to this type of mind control being undertaken at military bases certainly seems absurd, as does Paul Bonacci's claim that he was victimized at Offutt Airforce Base. But remember the [*New York Times*article](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/16/us/army-will-close-child-care-center.html) cited earlier that referenced 30 different military institutions having sexual abuse scandals within a three year period, and the depths of horrors unleashed at West Point and Presidio? Another important aspect that Dr. Hammond mentions is the creation of certain brain wave state before the programming begins. When a mind control subject would be put into a certain brain wave state and hypnosis, then their programming could only be activated under that brain wave state, a type of 'state-dependent learning'. This increases the amnesiac effect of the abuse and programming from the primary personality of someone suffering from multiple personality disorder. Dr. Hammond goes on to describe the details of what a 'cult programming session' would entail for one of his subjects: **\"This particular child was in a a private cult school where several of these sessions occurred a week. She would be taken into a room to get all hooked up. When she was in the proper altered state, they no longer had to monitor with electroencephalographs. She also already had electrodes placed on her; one in the vagina, for example, four on the head. Sometimes they'll be on other parts of the body. They would then begin and would say to her, \"You are angry with someone in the group.\" She'd say, \"No, I'm not,\" and they'd violently shock her. They would say the same thing until she complied and didn't make any negative response. ** Then they would continue. \"When you are angry with someone in the group, you will hurt yourself. Do you understand?\" She answered, \"No,\" and they shocked her. They repeated again, \"Do you understand?\" \"Well, yes, but I don't want to.\" Shock her again until they get compliance. Then they keep adding to it. \"And you will hurt yourself by cutting yourself. Do you understand?\" Maybe she'd say yes, but they might say, \"We don't believe you,\" and shock her anyway. \"Go back and go over it again.\" They would continue in this sort of fashion. She said typically it seemed as though they'd go about thirty minutes, take a break for a smoke or something and come", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:147:b66bf6ddbb8b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13349, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 148, "text": "don't want to.\" Shock her again until they get compliance. Then they keep adding to it. \"And you will hurt yourself by cutting yourself. Do you understand?\" Maybe she'd say yes, but they might say, \"We don't believe you,\" and shock her anyway. \"Go back and go over it again.\" They would continue in this sort of fashion. She said typically it seemed as though they'd go about thirty minutes, take a break for a smoke or something and come back. They might review what they'd done and then stop, or go on to new material. She said the sessions might go half an hour, or as much as three hours. She estimated three times a week. ** Programming was done under the influence of drugs in a certain brainwave state, with these noises in one ear and the programmers speaking in the other ear, usually the left ear, which is associated with right hemisphere non-dominant brain functioning. All this while they were talking to her and therefore requiring her intense concentration, intense focusing. Often they would have to memorize and say certain things back, word perfect, to avoid punishment, shock, and other kinds of things that were occurring. This is basically how a lot of programming goes on.** Some of it will also use other typical brainwashing techniques. There will be very standardized types of hypnotic things done at times. There will be sensory deprivation which we know increases suggestibility in anyone. According to the research, suggestibility is significantly increased with total sensory deprivation. It's not uncommon before they do certain of these things for them to use this a great deal, including formal sensory-deprivation chambers.\" **It is possible that the series of revelations and inquiries such as the Joint Hearing of the Select Intelligence Committee during the 1970's prompted the CIA to discontinue their official relationship with these projects and instead contract them out to certain cults and [Michael Aquino's Temple of Set](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/mind_control/satanic_cults_geraldo_aquino_gunderson). Remember that official documents discussed in the MK-ULTRA chapter mentioned 6% of projects being too sensitive for any connections to the agency. ** **In addition to the lack of official connection to the CIA, which diminishes liability and culpability, there is a bonus effect: Plausible deniability. When these projects are uncovered, people are simply be disbelief that such atrocious acts could have occurred, let alone connected to the United States government.** Dr. Hammond goes on to describe the different brainwave states during which programming took place, which were consistent throughout all of his patients and those of his peers: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Gamma and Omega - a phenomenon noted by over 100 of the respondents to the Extreme Abuse Surveys. Each brainwave state was associated with a specific type of programming and seemed to be present in a specific 'alter', which was also mostly consistent among the patients. **\"Alphas appear to represent general", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:148:9c3c507e105c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13350, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 149, "text": "to describe the different brainwave states during which programming took place, which were consistent throughout all of his patients and those of his peers: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Gamma and Omega - a phenomenon noted by over 100 of the respondents to the Extreme Abuse Surveys. Each brainwave state was associated with a specific type of programming and seemed to be present in a specific 'alter', which was also mostly consistent among the patients. **\"Alphas appear to represent general programming, the first kind of things put in. Betas appear to be sexual programs. For example, how to perform oral sex in a certain way, how to perform sex in rituals, having to do with producing child pornography, directing child pornography, or prostitution. Deltas are killers trained in how to kill in ceremonies. There'll also be some self-harm stuff mixed in with that, assassination and killing.** Then there's Omega. I usually don't include that word when I say my first question about this or any part inside that knows about Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta, because Omega will shake them even more. **Omega has to do with self-destruct programming.** Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. This can include self-mutilation as well as killing-themselves programming. Gamma appears to be system protection and deception programming which will provide misinformation to you, try to misdirect you, tell you half-truths, protect different things inside. There can also be other Greek letters. I'd recommend that you go and get your entire Greek alphabet, and if you have verified that some of this stuff is present and they have given you some of the right answers about what some of this material is, and I can't underline enough: DO NOT LEAD THEM. Do not say, \"Is this killers?\" Get the answer from them, please. When you've done this and it appears to be present, I would take your entire Greek alphabet, and with ideomotor signals, go through the alphabet and say, \"Is there any programming inside associated with Epsilon, Omicron,\" and go on through. There may be a system to some of the other letters, but I'm not aware of it.** I found, for example in one case, that Zeta had to do with the production of snuff films that this patient was involved with. With another person, Omicron had to do with their linkage and associations with drug smuggling and with the Mafia, big business, and government leaders. **So there's going to be some individualism, I think, in some of those. Some are come-home programs, \"come back to the cult\" programs. \" One gets the impression that there is a very large, tightly connected network working through numerous organizations and institutions to undertake these experiments.

Some are come-home programs, \"come back to the cult\" programs. \" One gets the impression that there is a very large, tightly connected network working through numerous organizations and institutions to undertake these experiments. At one point, Dr. Hammond notes that while the programming seems to be widely systematic among victims with no personal or geographic relations, there is one factor that is always different: Erasure codes to remove certain aspects of programming. \"Here's the flaw in the system. They have built in shut-down and erasure codes, so if they got into trouble they could shut something down and they could also erase something. These codes will sometimes be idiosyncratic phrases, or ditties. Sometimes they will be numbers maybe followed by a word. There's some real individuality to that. At first I had hoped if we can get some of these, maybe they'll work with different people. No such luck. It's very unlikely, unless they were programmed at about the same point in time as part of the same little group. Stuff that I've seen suggests that the programmers carry laptop computers which still include everything that they did twenty, thirty years ago in terms of the names of alters, the programs, the codes, and so on. I remember a woman about twenty-four years old who came in and claimed her father was a Satanist. Her parents divorced when she was six. After that, her father had visitation, and he would take her to rituals sometimes up until age fifteen. She said, \"I haven't gone to anything since I was fifteen.\" Her therapist believed this at face value. We sat in my office. We did a two-hour inquiry using hypnosis. We found the programming present. In addition to that we found that **every therapy session was debriefed, and in fact they had told her to get sick and not come to the appointment with me.** Another one had been told that I was Cult and that if she came I would know that she'd been told not to come and I would punish her. If anything meaningful comes out in a patient who's being monitored like that, my belief is you can't do meaningful therapy other than being supportive and caring and letting them know you care a lot, and you'll be there to support them. But I wouldn't try to work with any kind of deep material or deprogramming with those being monitored, because I think it can do nothing but get them tortured and hurt unless they can get into a safe, secure inpatient unit for an extended period of time to do some of the work required. From what I've learned thus far, they're tortured with electric shocks. I have a feeling that when you make inquiries you're going to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:150:326e72eff5bf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13352, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 151, "text": "to support them.

From what I've learned thus far, they're tortured with electric shocks. I have a feeling that when you make inquiries you're going to find that probably greater than fifty percent of these patients, if they're bloodline, meaning mother or dad or both involved, will be monitored on some ongoing basis.\" Much of the rest of the speech deals with techniques for the therapists attending the conference to approach treatment of patients who have dissociative identity disorder and were victims of satanic ritual abuse. But Dr. Hammond doesn't hesitate to come to conclusions about the purpose of the programming or the perpetrators: \"**The way you create Manchurian Candidates is you divide the mind. It's part of what the intelligence community wanted. If you're going to get an assassin, you divide the mind. Cases like the assassination of Robert Kennedy fascinate me. Bernard Diamond, on examining Sirhan Sirhan, found that he had total amnesia of the killing of Robert Kennedy. Yet under hypnosis he could remember it. But after he was out of hypnosis, he could not remember a thing, despite suggestions he would be able to consciously remember.** **The interesting thing is how many people have described the same scenario, and how many people that we have worked with who have had relatives in NASA, in the CIA, and in the Military, including very high-ups in the Military.** **People ask, \"What's the purpose of it?\" My best guess is that they want an army of Manchurian Candidates, tens of thousands of mental robots who will do prostitution, child pornography, smuggle drugs, engage in international arms smuggling, do snuff films, and all sorts of other very lucrative things. These Manchurian Candidates will do the bidding of their masters, so that eventually the megalomaniacs at the top believe they can create a Satanic Order that will rule the world.\"** The end of Dr. Corydon's speech was met with long, sustained applause by the attendees of the conference who recognized the bravery of going public with this information, particularly as many had their long-held suspicions regarding the nature of mind control in their patients confirmed. ***[Editor's Note] **In his speech, Dr. Corydon also commented on being the first to speak publicly about this disturbing information and added, \"I and a few others that I'd shared it with were hedging out of concern because of personal threats and death threats. **I finally decided to hell with them.

The case of victim Claudia Mullen is particularly interesting. Claudia had been referred to Psychiatrist Valerie Wolf after experiencing a sexual assault, and was unresponsive in therapy for many months. Unlike many other therapists, Wolf did not use hypnosis or any other memory retrieval techniques with Mullen. \"It needs to be made clear that these clients have remembered these names and events spontaneously, with free recall and without the use of any memory retrieval technique such as hypnosis. As much as possible, we have tried to verify the memories. I have sent information from one of my clients to Alan Scheflin, Professor of Law at Santa Clara University Law School (and a judicially recognized expert on mind and behavior control). He has been able to confirm that the information that she has supplied is absolutely true, and that her memories could not have been derived from any published source.\" - Valerie Wolf, speaking to the Presidential Advisory Commission on Radiation.506 Here are some excerpts from Claudia Mullen's testimony, from which she has earned no money and named men who were still alive: \"Good afternoon. **Between the years 1957 and 1984 I became a pawn in the government's game. Its ultimate goal was mind control and to create the perfect spy, all through the use of chemicals, radiation, drugs, hypnosis, electric shock, isolation in tubs of water, sleep deprivation, brainwashing, verbal, physical, emotional and sexual abuse.

I was exploited unwittingly for nearly three decades of my life and the only explanations given to me were \"that the end justifies the means\" and \"I was serving my country in their bold effort to fight communism\".** I can only summarize my circumstances by saying they took an already abused seven year old child and compounded my suffering beyond belief. The saddest part is, I know for a fact I was not alone. **There were countless other children in my same situation** and there was no one to help us until now... In 1958 they told me I was to be tested by some important doctors from the Society, or the Human Ecology Society, and I was instructed to cooperate. I was told not to look at anyone's faces, and to try hard to ignore any names because this was a very secret project. I was told all these things to help me forget. Naturally, as most children do, I did the opposite and remembered as much as I could. A Dr. John Gittinger tested me, Dr. Cameron gave me the shock, and Dr. Greene the x-rays. Then I was told by [Sid Gottlieb](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-sidney-gottlieb-80-dies-took-lsd-cia) that \"I was ripe for the big A\" meaning ARTICHOKE. By the time I left to go home, just like every time from then on, I would remember only whatever explanations Dr. Robert G. Heath, of Tulane Medical University, gave me for the odd bruises, needle marks, burns on my head, fingers, and even the genital soreness. I had no reason to think otherwise. They had already begun to control my mind. **The next year I was sent to a lodge in Maryland called Deep Creek Cabins to learn how to sexually please men. I was taught how to coerce them into talking about themselves.** I was used to entrap many unwitting men including themselves, all with the use of a hidden camera. I was only nine years old when the sexual humiliation began. **Another time I heard Dr. Martin Orne, who was the director then of the Scientific Office and later head of the Institute for Experimental Research state that \"in order to keep more funding coming from different sources for radiation and mind control projects\", he suggested stepping up the amounts of stressors used and also the blackmail portions of the experiments.** He said, \"it needed to be done faster then to get rid of the subjects or they were asking for us to come back later and haunt", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:153:522c16040f03", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13355, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 154, "text": "who was the director then of the Scientific Office and later head of the Institute for Experimental Research state that \"in order to keep more funding coming from different sources for radiation and mind control projects\", he suggested stepping up the amounts of stressors used and also the blackmail portions of the experiments.** He said, \"it needed to be done faster then to get rid of the subjects or they were asking for us to come back later and haunt them with our remembrances. I would love nothing more than to say that I dreamed this all up and need to just forget it. But that would be a tragic mistake. It would also be lie. All these atrocities did occur to me and to countless other children, and all under the guise of defending our country. It is because of the cumulative effects of exposure to radiation, chemicals, drugs, pain, subsequent mental and physical distress that I have been robbed of the ability to work and even to bear children of my own. It is blatantly obvious that none of this was needed, nor should ever have been allowed to take place at all, and the only means we have to seek out the awful truth and bring it to light is by opening whatever files remain on all the projects, and through another Presidential Commission on Mind Control.\" In follow-up interviews, Mullen went into more details regarding the entrapment operations she was a part of. **\"The CIA kept hotel rooms in two of the best hotels in New Orleans, and year around they kept a suite. It was unique in that it had two bathrooms, and one bathroom was where they kept the hidden cameras. I was actually shown the hidden cameras by three men who handled that part of it. They called him Captain George White.** He was formerly a doctor. He used to be in the narcotics squad in California, and then he became a doctor and joined the CIA. And then there were two other men who worked with him. They would put me with the subjects who would be filmed (the men) and then when the men would come into town -** I am talking about local politicians, government officials - anybody who they needed to possibly get something on, keep on file for future reference - should they need to coerce this person into supporting the projects.** Senators, congressmen, anything like that - if they were in town, they were given this room. They had no reason to think there was anything strange about the room. It didn't look any different than any other room. It was just one of the better suites in the two hotels.

They would sit there and they would film it. **When I was first told this I ... was nine, and I went to the Deep Creek Cabins in Maryland. That's when I was taught I was going to be part of this project, I had been accepted into this project, that I had been accepted into this project that would help the government stop Communism. \"507** At another point, she stated that one man she was involved with as an entrapment operation was Frank Church. \"I think they were afraid they would talk about the projects, and so they had to use something to keep them quiet. For instance, there was a guy named Church - all I knew was, he would try, he was very important to them because he was going to convince other people to let the projects keep going and so they had to get something on this guy, Church. This was later, when I was in high school. Supposedly he ended up talking other people into letting the projects keep going. He was supposed to be investigating - to see if there was anything wrong being done by the CIA - and so he of course decided nothing wrong was being done because they had a film on him.\"508 **Senator Frank Church headed the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, popularly known as the 'Church Committee'.509 The committee was the first to investigate the CIA for their illegal actions under MK-ULTRA, Project Mockingbird and other enterprises. The alleged entrapment of Frank Church may explain how the CIA was able to escape any sort of reform from Congress and continued many illicit projects, albeit with more secrecy.** It is the perfect example of how important entrapment was to the agency and how effective it could be to their uninterrupted continuation. There is certainly the potential that Mullen's testimony is a lie. After all, many of the names she alleged to have been a part of her mind control program had been publicly named as a part of the MK-ULTRA program. At least one had not: Darwin Fenner, a 'high- society' socialite and MK-ULTRA institution Tulane administrator.510 Mullen has not seemed to make any money from her allegations, against many men who were still alive, given to a Presidential investigative committee.

In addition, her testimony was reviewed by Alan Scheflin, Professor of Law at Santa Clara University Law School and judicially recognized expert in mind and behavior control, who stated that her claims could not have been derived from any known publication, making her testimony worth discussing. One particularly disturbing sentence from Mullen's testimony is: \"[Dr. Martin T. Orne] said, 'it needed to be done faster then to get rid of the subjects or they were asking for us to come back later and haunt them with our remembrances.'\" The idea that trauma-based mind control victims would be 'disposed of' once they outlived their usefulness is truly terrifying, but certainly in the mind of a psychopath it would be a logical and necessary step to take. Perhaps it explains why only a handful of victims have been able to recover from their abuse and synthesize their memories coherently enough to present their case of being abused. 506 [The Testimony of Valerie B.

Extreme abuse at a young age has been revealed to be the most effective way of controlling the mind.** Psychopathic networks in both occult groups and clandestine agencies jumped at the opportunity to create a veritable army of mind controlled slaves using the most depraved and violent techniques at their disposal. ** **By using torture such as electric shock and sexual abuse, these psychopaths have found a way to literally create blank slate alternate personalities which can be programmed for all sorts of illicit activities. Child prostitution, pornography, snuff films, assassinations and drug running are all direct applications of mind control programming.** Another likelihood is programming among elite military units to undertake activities that would otherwise be balked at, such as death squads and terrorism. The documented MK-ULTRA interest in electric shock, hypnosis and sensory deprivation are collectively the forerunners to trauma-based mind control, with the only missing documented ingredient being sexual abuse. It is certainly horrifying to consider that groups, government or otherwise, would deliberately subject children to such abuse but in the context of psychopathy, where psychopaths are sexual deviants and sadists, it is actually quite logical. **It is unclear how much of an overlap there is between the CIA and occult groups. The most likely scenario", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:156:c7a7ab7e7135", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13358, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 157, "text": "in electric shock, hypnosis and sensory deprivation are collectively the forerunners to trauma-based mind control, with the only missing documented ingredient being sexual abuse. It is certainly horrifying to consider that groups, government or otherwise, would deliberately subject children to such abuse but in the context of psychopathy, where psychopaths are sexual deviants and sadists, it is actually quite logical. **It is unclear how much of an overlap there is between the CIA and occult groups. The most likely scenario is that occult groups infiltrated the MK-ULTRA program and began using the knowledge they learned for their own subversive plans. It is also possible that the leading researchers into MK-ULTRA were simultaneously members of occult groups themselves. ** **The crossover between occult groups and military occupations, such as the Presidio, Michael Aquino and Dr. Corydon's statement that \"The interesting thing is how many people have described the same scenario, and how many people that we have worked with who have had relatives in NASA, in the CIA, and in the military, including very high-ups in the military,\" certainly demands further investigation.** **Many of the victims discussed by Dr. Hammond and those who responded to the Extreme Abuse Surveys claimed to have been born into a 'direct bloodline', meaning that their families have been practicing in a satanic cult for as many as 12 generations.** These children have been essentially born for the purpose of being abused and exploited by cults. Some have referred to themselves as the 'chosen generation', perhaps indicating that they have a role to play in the 'end game' of the Pathocracy. Children outside of these bloodlines seem to be more expendable, and are likely killed once they enter adulthood, when they are no longer useful for child prostitution or pornography, and their programming begins to weaken. We can only speculate about the death toll. The two main groups involved in extreme abuse, the occult and clandestine intelligence agencies, seem to have distinct goals with significant overlap. The occult groups believe, in the vein of the writings of Aleister Crowley, that there are legitimate spiritual reasons for abuse and always perform their mind control operations during rituals. The CIA, on the other hand, seems more interested in espionage and entrapment. The overlap between the two is the goal of making money, and possibly the causing of violence and terror as part of a 'strategy of tension' campaign designed to steer the populace towards certain political goals and psychological states of terror, making manipulation of the populace easier. Some researchers have suggested that trauma-based mind control dates as far back as the ancient Egyptian Mystery Schools, with the *Book of the Dead *serving as a blueprint to torture and utilize drugs to exert control over that person, raising the possibility that occult groups have been practicing a form of mind control for millennia and used the laboratory settings", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:157:0399b4907c80", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13359, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 158, "text": "designed to steer the populace towards certain political goals and psychological states of terror, making manipulation of the populace easier.

These cults comprise only a portion of the occult groups operating within the Pathocracy and instead seem to be one arm of the psychopathic network, being concealed and protected for the use and creation of mind controlled slaves, profits from drug and child trafficking, and entrapment of pedophiles in government, military, finance and beyond. Ultimately, the full motivations of trauma-based mind control, the breadth of the operations and number of victims cannot fully be known until the pathocracy which is responsible for these crimes against humanity is brought down and dissected. There is no knowledge more important towards this end than the extent of pedophilia and child abuse at the hands of the government and elite. **The disbelief of trauma-based mind control is understandable, so we must collectively work together to bring further evidence to light. After all, before the liberation of Auschwitz, the general sentiment was that such atrocities were impossible and reports of mass murder were greatly exaggerated. Unfortunately, they did happen, and serve as a reminder that crimes against humanity at the hands of psychopaths are very real.** As the final word on trauma-based mind control, I would like to reiterate the conclusion of Dr. Corydon Hammond: People ask, \"What's the purpose of it?\" My best guess is that they want an army of Manchurian Candidates, tens of thousands of mental robots who will do prostitution, child pornography, smuggle drugs, engage in international arms smuggling, do snuff films, and all sorts of other very lucrative things. These Manchurian Candidates will do the bidding of their masters, so that eventually the megalomaniacs at the top believe they can create a Satanic Order that will rule the world.\" 511 Ron Patton, \"[Project Monarch, Nazi Mind Control.](http://www.whale.to/b/patton.html)\" * * * * Food for Thought: 1.

Just how dark does the crimes against humanity perpetrated by networks of psychopaths get? * * * * Chapter XV: The Pathocracy **On August 12, 1991, Investigative Journalist Danny Casolero was found dead in a bathtub at a hotel in West Virginia. He was in the state to meet a source on a story he was working on called \"The Octopus\", which referred to a sprawling international criminal cabal that was exerting influence over a multitude of world events, such as the Iran hostage crisis that helped get Ronald Reagan elected. Although his death was ruled a suicide, the Casolero family was adamant it was a murder, citing threats on Danny's life.512** **\"The Octopus\" that Danny Casolero was following is the Pathocracy. It has grown over the centuries, spreading its many tentacles across the globe, tightening it's grip on control of information, money, wars and beyond. The scope of this book was mostly kept within the context of the United States but the scope of the \"Octopus\" is truly international.** Of course, we cannot fully know the extent of the beast until it is starved and dissected. But until then, we can still reasonable construct the 'big picture' of our current situation. **The history recounted thus far is the history of institutions that have become saturated with psychopaths, who began to act ruthlessly on their desires to control and manipulate others. The process is called Ponerology,** a term coined by Polish psychologist Andrjez Lobaczewski, who studied how the governments of the Soviet bloc became increasingly evil. The term comes from the Greek word poneria, meaning lawlessness. Lobaczewski published his work in a book titled *Political Ponerology.*513 Lobaczewski had tremendous difficulty in publishing his book; At one point the manuscript was thrown in the furnace shortly before a raid by the secret police, and later the publication was blocked by none other than Zbigniew Brzezinski himself. He had hopes that by sending his manuscript to the Vatican, the word about Pathocracy would be heard on a global level. The manuscript was never returned. When he came to the United States, he figured that the freer society would be more accepting of his thesis; again, publication was blocked and his work was marginalized. What was so revolutionary about Lobaczewski's work that it was repressed by the elite worldwide?

What was so revolutionary about Lobaczewski's work that it was repressed by the elite worldwide? It is impossible to come to any conclusion from his work except that the development of Pathocracy is inevitable as long as the general population is ignorant about the *psychopathic other. ***Psychopaths have always existed, and they view the world of normal people, those with morality and conscience, as something to be looked down upon and exploited. Perhaps the most shocking revelation of his work is that psychopaths learn to recognize each other, even at a young age.514 ** The natural result is a network of psychopaths, a subset of the population that recognize their differences and feel not only contempt for the rest of society, but the need to control and manipulate them as well. Over time they become experts in our weaknesses and follies, watching from a distance with curiosity and amusement. The idea that Psychopaths can recognize each other is central to the Pathocracy. Imagine for millennia the process of evolution of a psychopathic cabal growing in power and numbers, increasingly manipulating society. You would think that the United States would think twice when in 2004 we had one presidential candidate who was a member of a powerful secretive society known as the Skull and Bones run against the Presidential incumbent who was also a member of the same secretive society.515 Tim Russert: You're both were members of Skull and Bones, a secret society of Yale. What does that tell us? Sen. John Kerry: Not much because it's a secret.516 These connections are not insignificant, rather they are the tip of the iceberg of a vast covert network of collusion, the result of the process of the ponerization. **This process of ponerization has happened to the major centers of covert power in our world. The CIA, FBI, NSA and the global financial elite all the way down to local police departments have all become *ponerized *institutions. Understanding the condition and development of ponerized networks is not just important, it is perhaps *the most *important information that society can have. It is the next step in evolution of society, the next grand paradigm shift.** **This is the context under which the Pathocracy operates.

When we read accounts of horrific extreme abuse perpetrated against children, understand that the *psychopathic other *enjoys this abuse. They derive pleasure from torture and murder.** These psychopaths recognize each other and over time they come to be key holders of power wherever it exists in an unadulterated form. Seemingly antagonistic institutions such as competing banks are actually operated by the same psychopathic cabal behind the scenes. In the same way that you and I naturally exclude social deviants from our social groups, psychopaths do with normal people. The result is a web of mutual conditioning of evil. Through a vast propaganda matrix, the Pathocracy is slowly *conditioning *humanity to conform to their sick standards such as endless war, resulting in a large portion of the population displaying 'secondary psychopathic' tendencies. This is the group that has subverted democracy not only in the United States but around the world, and are currently manipulating world events behind the scenes. 512 *Washington Post, *\"[Area Writer Investigating Inslaw Case Found Dead](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/08/13/area-writer-investigating-inslaw-case-found-dead/f395037a-f188-4a01-8e22-c065d2ffbd9d/?utm_term=.8e6ee7a32b74),\" August 13, 1991. 513 The book *Political Ponerology*, though dense and sometimes difficult to navigate, is one of the most important pieces of literature ever written.

The goal was a profoundly different landscape in the region, one where governments could do little to prevent the manipulation and control of indigenous resources and ideas.** One of these men was Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi businessman, who would maintain a relationship with the CIA for an extended period of time, coordinating Islamic radicals to promote the goals of the CIA through terrorism and indoctrination, and further acting as a scapegoat to cast out to the public as an enemy that, for some reason, evaded capture for decades. Bin Laden was not alone, but his organization, Al-Qaeda, would become the centerpiece of a contrived conflict known today as 'The War on Terror', which would eventually create trillions of profits for the very people tasked with ending it. **The United", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:161:adcf328c0f60", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13363, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 162, "text": "of time, coordinating Islamic radicals to promote the goals of the CIA through terrorism and indoctrination, and further acting as a scapegoat to cast out to the public as an enemy that, for some reason, evaded capture for decades. Bin Laden was not alone, but his organization, Al-Qaeda, would become the centerpiece of a contrived conflict known today as 'The War on Terror', which would eventually create trillions of profits for the very people tasked with ending it. **The United States made strong alliances with the very countries and people responsible for the funding and proliferation of terrorists such as Bin Laden, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The intelligence agencies of these countries are entirely corrupt, and have grown massively in power, to the point where they exert more control than the nominal governments of these states, becoming the 'Deep State', where the true power of a country resides in its covert operations and with people who's names are generally not known to the public. Each of these countries, including the United States, act as an arm of the Pathocracy, and are responsible for a vast majority of the terrorism in the world today.** To some extent they literally operate organizations such as the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. This relationship becomes crystal clear when we see that the objectives of Al-Qaeda are perfectly in line with those of the Pathocracy. In Middle East conflicts such as the Libyan 'Revolution', struggles in Kosovo and Serbia, the Syrian 'Civil War', we see Al-Qaeda and the United States fighting on the same side. **The lack of any tangible results from the War on Terror is a 'smoking gun' for it's uselessness. Terrorism today benefits the Pathocracy and those who serve it. The alleged true perpetrators of terrorism have their homelands bombed and ravished while it provides an excuse for continuous militarization and increasingly repressive domestic policies that do more to stifle legitimate domestic dissent than to curb foreign violence. Terrorism in countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq provide a convenient reason for increasing military presence, and to make the local governments dependent on the United States for protection. ** The resulting destabilization makes the economies and resources easier to exploit. It is not a coincidence that terrorism and destabilization seem to precede important geopolitical objectives in that region. Domestic terrorism serves to keep the populace in fear and justify increased infringement of civil rights. Tragic events such as school shootings are nearly universally followed by a push for an agenda that furthers the goal of the Pathocracy.

Former FBI agent turned whistleblower [Sibel Edmonds](https://www.WantToKnow.info/sibeledmondsnewsarticles) refers to it as 'Gladio B'. The 'Strategy of Tension' has proved to be one of the most useful tools of the Pathocracy. Across the world, they have assassinated leaders, terrorized populations, destroyed infrastructure and spread destructive propaganda, and it has worked. Where would Latin America be today had they not been terrorized by the Pathocracy? Decades of progress have been lost to repressive dictatorships propped up by the CIA spreading corruption and keeping the means of economic production in the hands of foreign powers. And what about the Middle East? The landscape would be radically different without decades of interference. **Minor differences between Islamic sects have been exploited to divide communities and nations. If even only a portion of the countries in this region united economically, the house of cards of the Pathocracy would tumble down.** They know this, and it is why the Middle East is such a hotbed of violence and destabilization today. * * * * The Agenda **The Pathocracy has been firmly in control of the United States democratic process for decades. As it stands, there are few significant differences between the two parties. To hide this fact, a variety of actors routinely circuit the mainstream media spitting vehemence towards their political 'rivals' while behind the scenes they joke about the smoke screen they have created.** The 'Agenda' that has evolved over the past decades is one of global hegemony, economic and military. Once distinct ideologies of liberalism and conservatism evolve into neo-liberalism and neo-conservatism, they share the same goals and differ only slightly in means of implementing them. The 'Agenda' is the agenda of the financial elite, using a manipulated democratic process, the United States military, and covert institutions as tools of maintaining their socially dominant position. When a foreign country threatens to upset the status quo, there is a regime change in nearly every single instance. In the few countries where this hasn't been accomplished, it is very likely that a regime change is in the works, a plan evolving behind the scenes as I write. **In the entire history of the United States, the country has not gone 40 months without a military conflict since at least 1963.517 There are long periods where the enemy is focused around one vague ideology.

What crises will be manufactured when the Trans-Pacific Partnership is ready to be officially revealed? 517 *Mother Jones, *\"[How the Rest of the World Views the American Military](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/08/how-rest-world-views-american-military),\" August 29, 2013 * * * * The Deep State **In the United States, and indeed many of the nations around the world, there exist two governments: one that operates out in the open, which the citizens are familiar with and interact with, and a parallel top secret government, whose existence is visible only to a select few and only occasionally exposed to the general public. This clandestine hybrid network of shadowy institutions and figures, both public and private, operates with its own intentions and its own power regardless of who is formally the Head of State.** \"The Deep State does not consist of the entire government. It is a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies: the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Justice Department.

It is the 'Deep State' that is responsible for endless war and the one-party state, effectively ensuring it's continued existence and importance by providing an impetus for war, surveillance and propaganda while simultaneously removing any possibility of civilian reform. The 'Deep State' is the vehicle from which the Pathocracy operates. It has expanded its operations into drug-running, child trafficking and more, so that it does not have to rely entirely on taxpayer money for its projects. For all intents and purposes, the rise of the 'Deep State' can be considered a silent coup on the United States of America. 518 BillMoyers.com, \"[Essay: Anatomy of the Deep State](http://billmoyers.com/2014/02/21/anatomy-of-the-deep-state/#1),\" February 21, 2014 519 *The Washington Post, *\"[Top Secret America](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/),\" an investigate project spanning from 2013 to 2014 * * * * Cults **When we peel back the layers of the Pathocracy and travel deeper into the rabbit hole, by exploring the depths of trauma-based mind control and child abuse that has become institutionalized among the elite, we are given a glimpse of the world of cults. The reality is that the Pathocracy sits on top of, and in the process conceals and protects, a 'black' network of Satanists and other occultists who explore the darkest evils imaginable. The Pathocracy conceals this arm of the octopus because it provides a valuable service to their goals and has a network of lots of influential people.** Furthermore, cults likely operate as 'psychopathic recruitment centers'. The whole idea of a cult revolves around hidden knowledge and the manipulation of the masses. Psychopaths are drawn to such ideologies, and are then recruited into the broader Pathocracy. **There is no topic that reveals the depths of depravity of the Pathocracy more than their [use of pedophilia](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#12) as a tool for control. It is how they conceal their biggest conspiracies, by holding over the heads of their subjects a type of blackmail that will ensure compliance. In addition, there is no topic more important that reveals the necessity of action than their abuse of children. And if the extent of this phenomenon can be exposed fully, no truth will bring down their reign quicker.** Unfortunately, it is necessary to paint such a dark picture because the reality is dark, and we cannot pretend that the 'endgame' of the Pathocracy does not exist.

If resistance to the Pathocracy grows, we must be prepared for the worst, such as a series of major terrorist attacks, wars between major world powers, and the collapse of fiat currency. This is the 'Big Picture': An agenda of total control, and events are accelerating as the Octopus tightens the grip of its tentacles around the globe. We are living in grand times, at no point in history has the current moment been so important for the future of humanity. Fortunately, the Pathocracy is doomed to fail. * * * * Chapter XVI: Solutions **The problem of the Pathocracy seems to be so vast and complex; it is certainly intimidating. We are fortunate that the solutions are relatively simple. It begins with education and non-participation. Ignorance is the key tool that keeps the Pathocracy afloat. It's truly this easy. An awake populace can collectively choose to stop holding the pyramid above their shoulders by refusing to oil the gears of the machine. We need to collectively move our money out of big banks, support local enterprise over multinational corporations, and be courageously vocal about the truth.** The time to start being as vocal as possible was decades ago. By this I mean that there is no time for anything else anymore. If you are awake, start making waking others up your number one priority. There are few things I desire to do more than to forget all of this and get lost in World of Warcraft. Yet the stakes are too high, there is something bigger going on than our selfish desires. Imagine yourself reflecting on the past in 20, 30 years. Will you be content with the impact you had on the awakening, or will you regret not doing more as the police state becomes fully entrenched around you and it is too late to make a difference? **The first step is to become educated yourself.** Be able to articulate the problem to even the most skeptical. Collect information and resources that effectively expose the abuses and inner workings of the Pathocracy. **Then take this knowledge and share it.** I know I have had reservations about sharing the truth with those who seem so content with their circumstances because shattering worldviews is not a pleasant experience by any means. But it is time to put these reservations aside. The building is on fire, and we need to evacuate before it is too late; those who will be momentarily angry for being slapped awake will be grateful once the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:166:14e97fe0aafd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13368, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 167, "text": "workings of the Pathocracy. **Then take this knowledge and share it.** I know I have had reservations about sharing the truth with those who seem so content with their circumstances because shattering worldviews is not a pleasant experience by any means.

While a personal discussion is certainly the most valuable tool, there are other means. For example, you can compile the sources and information you find most pertinent and send them out in an anonymous email to your contacts list.520 Perhaps begin your email with \"From a concerned friend, please read this information with an open mind\". If 1 out of 100 people is reached this way, the seed will be planted for an inevitable blossom. Ideas follow a pattern of being ridiculed until they reach a critical mass and are accepted. We must endeavor to reach this critical mass as soon as possible, before the grip of the Pathocracy is sufficiently tight enough to prevent the flow of information. 520 If you wish to use this book, please do. There is a reason it is free; so it can reach as many people as possible. * * * * One valuable tool we have is alternative currencies, especially crypto currencies. First off, it is a great way to avoid using traditional means of money transfer and bank holdings that prop up the beast. Yet there is another tremendously important value, especially with Bitcoin and potentially with future Bitcoin competitors: It has made the counterculture rich. There are thousands of people who are receptive to the type of information contained in this book who thanks to new found wealth from crypto currencies now have the means to proliferate the truth far and wide. If this applies to you, please consider using your assets for a positive impact, perhaps by placing relevant information in public places, by organizing protests, or supporting independent media. * * * * **The worst thing we can do is wait for someone else to step up and be a leader, for someone else to organize a movement for us to join, for someone else to take a stand against the Pathocracy.

Research where the materials you consume come from, and make smart purchasing choices. **Strive to minimize your 'corporate and government footprint'.** It is truly as simple as this, and this chapter can be complete while being one of the shortest in the book. Stop holding the pyramid above us and let it collapse around us, then we can put the important pieces back together without the potential for the massive centralization of covert power that we see today. One by one is how the awakening grows, until it is inevitable. * * * * Chapter XVII: The Awakening The date was December 21, 2012, one day after my graduation from the University of Illinois. I was sitting at home, contemplating life, exhausted from a frenzy of theses, finals and celebrations. I wondered what I would possibly do with a degree in History, a question I had been deftly avoiding throughout my time in school. I wondered if I could ride out my bartending gig into adulthood, wondered how quickly I could get myself out of the suburbs and out of the Midwest. That night, in my typical fashion of procrastinating instead of facing issues head on, I was lead to the dark corners of the internet. I was not a conspiracy theorist, but I found the topics interesting, and fell head first deep into the rabbit-hole of MKULTRA. A truth so dark and disgusting that I cried: a mountain of evidence that the cabal that I would eventually come to know as the Pathocracy is responsible for a global network of child trafficking and child abuse. My worldview was flipped upside down the moment it all sunk in. Some call it 'Waking Up'. I looked at the clock, and the time read 10:33. * * * * Synchronicity was described by Carl Jung as 'temporally coincident occurrences of acausal events'. In other words it means events that are causally unrelated yet experienced together in a meaningful manner, related conceptually with the chance of them occurring together being very small. That evening, I would look at the clock again at 11:33, 12:33 and 1:33. It was the beginning of a lengthy and profound series of synchronicity I would experience with the number. 33 had been my lucky number for quite some time. At age 10, it was the centerpiece of an inside joke for my camp counselors. I didn't understand the joke, of course, but I emulated them as any 10 year old would. It was the number of my Lacrosse jersey in High", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__liftingtheveil.txt:168:9710404be2b7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13370, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__liftingtheveil.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__liftingtheveil", "chunk_index": 169, "text": "look at the clock again at 11:33, 12:33 and 1:33.

At age 10, it was the centerpiece of an inside joke for my camp counselors. I didn't understand the joke, of course, but I emulated them as any 10 year old would. It was the number of my Lacrosse jersey in High School, and my standardized test score. It's labeled on the bottle of one of my favorite beers. Nothing seriously profound, but enough for it to be *my *number. I remember being quite hung over on December 21, not just because of celebrating my graduation, but because of a series of parties centered around the end of the Mayan calendar, which some believed predicted the end of the world. Neither my friends nor myself truly thought that the world was going to end, it was just another excuse to get hammered and party as if there was no tomorrow. Yet in hindsight, perhaps this date was not a coincidence. The end of the calendar didn't intend to predict the end of the world; rather, it reflected the Mayan belief that the end of the calendar era would usher in a new age: The Age of Enlightenment. In the months proceeding December 21, I would go days, sometimes even weeks at a time seeing :33 on the clock every single hour I was awake. I had been a committed atheist for much of my life. I still understand it to be one of the most rational worldviews. After all, the world is filled with evil and suffering, and the major religions are filled with corruption and hypocrisy. But this was a phenomenon I could not ignore, and decided to explore it further. It went deeper than just numbers on a clock: I would come to profound thoughts and insights at :33, I met a great friend who had the 33rd ticket at the pub I flipped burgers at to pay the bills, I have frequently and repeatedly published important writing at :33. Following insights from synchronicity brought me to South America, where I met my soulmate and spiritual partner at 6:33 p.m. I am having a direct communication with God and the experience has been phenomenal. My experience with synchronicity goes beyond numbers. **Reflecting on my life, I am fascinated by how events weaved their way together to put me in exactly the right place at the right time to wake up and to have developed the skills to synthesize this information and share it with others.

My whole life has been a series of 'learning the hard way'. I had to fail out of school to learn the value of learning. I had to spend weeks in a hospital with major burns to get a grip on my issues with drugs and alcohol. I had to get arrested to learn how my actions impact others. I had to experience obesity to learn the value of health and caring for my body. I had to experience deep and prolonged depression to appreciate happiness and action. A whole lot of experiences to synthesize in 23 years of living, but I am grateful for every one of them. They made me who I am today. **In the same sense, humanity is learning the hard way. We have to confront the Pathocracy in order to collectively evolve, to not just blindly follow the next paradigm shift but to actively construct it within ourselves. As the waning Pathocracy clashes with the rising Awakening, there will be a lot of suffering, but we should not be upset: Instead, we should be grateful for the catalyst that will be responsible for the inevitable beautiful renaissance that represents the light at the end of the tunnel.** * * * * **I absolutely wish I could lay out a comprehensive metaphysical thesis here but the truth is, I simply don't know what the truth is. I do know that at the very bottom of the conspiracy rabbit hole, is that each and every one of us is a powerful spiritual being.

Some have more layers than others, and that is OK: Not everyone began their journey at the same time, and eventually we will all finish it. ** There is a series of paradoxes: the present we are experiencing is but a blink of an eye along the path of evolution for our souls, yet simultaneously the road ahead of us is of the utmost importance.

Every once and awhile, I'll get a death threat from someone-like, 'if we don't like what you write, we'll hunt you down and kill you' kind of thing.\" The autopsy report found that neither drugs nor alcohol played a role in the crash.525 Why, then, have witnesses described Hastings' vehicle, a Mercedes C250 (a car not prone to bursting into flames) traveling at full speed down a suburban road, crossing a red light and then skipping over a median into a tree, exploding?526 Security footage from a gas station caught the speeding, the crash and the explosion, confirming the eyewitness testimony.527 \"Hastings was intensely interested in government surveillance of journalists. In May, the story broke about the Department of Justice obtaining the phone records of Associated Press reporters. A couple weeks later, Edward Snowden's revelations about the National Security Agency's massive surveillance program became public. Hastings was convinced he was a target.... One night in June, he came to Thigpen's apartment after midnight and urgently asked to borrow her Volvo. He said he was afraid to drive his own car. She declined, telling him her car was having mechanical problems. \"He was scared, and he wanted to leave town,\" she says. The next day, around 11:15 a.m., she got a call from her landlord, who told her Hastings had died early that morning. His car had crashed into a palm tree at 75 mph and exploded in a ball of fire.\" - *LA Weekly*528 The type of cyber attack that could have taken control of Hastings' vehicle is very real, confirmed by independent hackers to a *Forbes *journalist in a demonstration529, and by the government itself, in a presentation by DARPA, the Defense Advances Research Projects Agency.530 Rest in peace Michael Hastings, and to each and every victim of the Pathocracy.

On going through [lesson 14](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/trf14a), which focuses on mind control, I first hit the wall and was rudely awakened. But it took a few more years for me to be able to go deep enough to release myself and begin the hard work of breaking free of the programming. **Meditation was the first key that did it.** Meditation helped me to become aware of \"false identifications\" that I knew were not me, and that were buried deep in my unconscious. With practice, I developed a habit over the years of not reacting, of having equanimity whenever anything arose that might disturb the balance of my mind. I learned to welcome my peace, to be curious, and to inquire without judgment. I studied meditation and more with Tibetan Buddhist teachers, but one doesn't need to be a Buddhist to break free. I am a Truth Seeker and \"tend\" towards the light. ** So many times along the way, I was again reminded that I would have to [take full responsibility](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcourse/ttcourse03a) for what is in the contents of my own mind. I have continually had to let go of thinking that I am powerless to change and go deeper. I became ever more clear that I am not powerless. I am powerful - full of power.** I have no doubt now that there are infinite possibilities.

I am powerful - full of power.** I have no doubt now that there are infinite possibilities. There came a time when I was so tired of being unable to function fully, so tired of experiencing so much physical pain and anxiety, that I put my foot down and said NO! I will not have this! I can change. And I will change. Countless times I made this decision. I remembered fully back in January 2015 (though the path opened in 2003 when I had a [near death experience](https://www.weboflove.org/nde/near-death-experiences-nde)) that as a child I had been programmed at a certain time to die. I spent the few years after that time literally fighting for my life. I chose to live again and again. I chose to \"live\" hundreds of times, when it would have been easier to die. I spent many years trying to find the place inside that wanted to die, so that I could work with it, so that I could begin to find out who I am, so that I could ever more love and trust that inner space. Diving inward, I learned to embody my innocence and embrace my deep vulnerability. Ego eventually melts into the essence that was forced to split off. Even these many years later with my memories now more or less intact, I needed help. I needed a guide. So I moved to a new location and began a new life for myself. I engaged with the process of inquiry in a three-year study program. **I dove into the unconscious and built skillful means so that I could unravel my own beautiful inner mystery to become whole and complete.** Simple practices over time helped me have the power to transform my mental habits of withdrawing and disappearing into a desire to connect and show up fully as me. I've now started the second year of my program and am astonished at a key turning point: ** I stopped thinking about being controlled and let go of thinking (the belief) that I could not escape the mind control. I stopped identifying with being powerless. I instead focused on learning how to be in my body and present with the tension and the fears and terrors that ego (the pain body) needs in order to survive. Being in the present moment allowed me to move through all this to become who I really am. That changed everything.** I began to empower myself.

Ego structure is the same in complex trauma (mind control programming) as in any trauma. MY MIND CREATED THE EGO STRUCTURES AND MY MIND CAN UNCREATE THOSE EGO STRUCTURES. I am the source. And there is no spiritual bypass. The ancient Sufi teachings (just think about Rumi's poetry) are deeply hidden and protected, because they heal and invite us back into our bodies. Being embodied is the key, yet it is much easier said than done. One of the most important methods that I have used to heal is to transform the heavy dense ego state into light. When as children we split off, our light was dimmed. Our egos could not see. We were without the light. Ego splintered, filling in where we could not take it, where we could not tolerate the experience. Ego is not bad, we just need to teach ego to trust us, to trust the process. I got help. There is a man who can help deprogram. Without him I might not be where I am today. He said that I can refer others to him. He does matrix re-patterning and uses consciousness to help with deprogramming. **This mind control stuff goes all the way back to Babylon and unfortunately they have it down to a fine art and science. It is a lot about DNA. Everything is FREQUENCY. You must remember that frequencies can be broken and the patterns related to frequency can be changed. ** Lucid dreaming is another powerful tool that opens up my unconscious and reveals past scenarios that happened to me. I have remembered being drugged and sold into human trafficking rings for most of my first 18 years and beyond. I have gained access to a hidden past. It was heart rendering though, to discover the depth of betrayal from my \"family.\" It is not easy to go through the remembering. It nearly killed me to allow myself to wake up to this reality. It broke my heart, which I am continually mending. I believe the end goal of the force of negativity is to destroy everything good, innocent, and vulnerable, to destroy the feminine (in both women and men), the sacred feminine, our Mother Earth Goddess, and our ability to reproduce. The end goal is to destroy the cohesion of a healthy family and to undermine THE POWER OF LOVE.

Yet **once we fully understand how the frequencies of light operate, the darkness and its minions have no power over us.** I once heard a man who is also recovering from SRA (Satanic Ritual Abuse) say that the only thing his complicit father was afraid of was the Goddess. They are terrified of Truth, Love, and Light. And the Goddess is the embodiment of this truth. So, let's journey directly into this truth and claim our power. We need each other to break free. What the dark force did not consider is that there is something in each one of us and in the universe that can never be destroyed - the indestructible Truth. Truth cannot be destroyed. I am writing a handbook of how I have been deprogramming myself to share with others, \"Riding the Wind: Breaking Free of the Shackles of Ego.\" It is meant to deal with both simple trauma and complex. It is my offering to humanity. One day soon, I will share this... My heart opens to the suffering you have endured. I invite you to join me in becoming a beacon of light for others.

Declassified documents prove that young women were hypnotized and trained to plant bombs, kill people, and much more, yet they showed no memory of having done this after completing successful training. They became effective \"Manchurian Candidates\" - spies and assassins who were not consciously aware of their actions committed in altered states. Though Project MKULTRA was terminated in the late 1960s, numerous insiders have revealed that other even more sophisticated secret mind control programs continue to this day. Is there a deeper agenda behind all of this? Is it possible that factions of the world's power elite are secretly using MK-ULTRA tactics behind the scenes to manipulate global politics through the use of mind control? Read the excellent essay below and decide for yourself. **This essay uses easily verified facts that prove the CIA and American government were willing to secretly program unsuspecting young women in order to forward hidden global agendas. Yet our major media have sadly failed to give any incisive analysis of these highly unethical programs.** Explore what is written here and verify the links given to prove that things are not always as they seem. This essay is taken from the incredibly profound online book *[Lifting the Veil](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/liftingtheveil)*, which uses hundreds of footnotes with links to highly reliable sources which reveal countless political and economic manipulations carried out in secret worldwide by powerful, well-hidden groups for decades.

Chapter V: MK-ULTRA **\"In the 1950's and early 1960's, the agency [CIA] gave mind-altering drugs to hundreds of unsuspecting Americans in an effort to explore the possibilities of controlling human consciousness. Many of the human guinea pigs were mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts and prostitutes - 'people who could not fight back,' as one agency officer put it. In one case, a mental patient in Kentucky was dosed with LSD continuously for 174 days.\" - *New York Times*199** MK-ULTRA is the codename given to a CIA research operation into biological behavioral engineering, also known as mind control. Many people are familiar with the operation but incorrectly assume that it was limited to LSD research. While there were plenty of resources devoted to LSD research, it was only one area of a vast field of mind control operations. MK-ULTRA researcher Ike Feldman said himself that: **\"The LSD... that was just the tip of the iceberg... Espionage. Assassinations. Dirty tricks. Drug experiments. Sexual encounters and the study of prostitutes for clandestine use. That is what I was doing when I worked for George White and the CIA.\"200** MK-ULTRA had several precursors. There was Project Chatter in 1947, which tested drugs such as the infamous Scopolamine during interrogations.201 There was [Project Bluebird](https://www.wanttoknow.info/bluebird10pg) in 1949, which began studies into hypnosis.202 The document describing the initiation of Project Bluebird outlines these special problems, among many others, that they were hoping to address: • Can we in a matter of an hour, two hours, one day, etc., induce an hypnotic condition in an unwilling subject to such an extent that he will perform an act for our benefit? • Can we create by post-hypnotic control an action contrary to an individual's basic moral principles? • Can we guarantee total amnesia under any and all conditions? • Can we \"alter\" a person's personality? How long will it hold? • Can we devise a system for making unwilling subjects into willing agents and then transfer that control to untrained agency agents in the field by use of codes or identifying signs or credentials?203 Project Artichoke began in 1951, with a scope of ... \"Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self-preservation?\"204 All of the above projects were shuttled into MK-ULTRA in 1953, under the Technical Services Division, combining over 150 sub-projects205, undertaken at over 80 institutions206 such as universities, hospitals, prisons", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__mk-ultra.txt:1:0d847b3185c3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13382, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__mk-ultra.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__mk-ultra", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "the field by use of codes or identifying signs or credentials?203 Project Artichoke began in 1951, with a scope of ... \"Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self-preservation?\"204 All of the above projects were shuttled into MK-ULTRA in 1953, under the Technical Services Division, combining over 150 sub-projects205, undertaken at over 80 institutions206 such as universities, hospitals, prisons and pharmaceutical companies. Many of the projects were covertly run through front organizations without the knowledge of the institution that hosted them. **The experiments and operations under MK-ULTRA have been shrouded in extreme secrecy. When it was enacted, then-CIA Director Allen Dulles exempted the program from normal financial controls, allowed the Technical Services Staff to begin experiments without contracts or written agreements with leadership, and ordered the financial office to pay any cost blindly on the signature of Sidney Gottlieb.207 CIA Document 17748 states that:** **\"There are just two individuals in TSD who have full substantial knowledge of the program and most of that knowledge is unrecorded.

He would commute to the McGill University system in Canada to conduct experiments on brainwashing, 'psychic driving' and other forms of psychological torture. Cameron had a theory that a person with a psychological illness such as schizophrenia would benefit from having their brain essentially wiped clean, presuming the patient would redevelop their cognitive functions without the disorder. The CIA felt that brainwashing had obvious intelligence applications.211 **Dr. Cameron had a 'depatterning' program he used to erase the minds of his patients that began with 15 - 30 days of 'sleep therapy' (sometimes lasting as long as 65 days), where the patient would sleep all day and night, with the exception of three brief periods where a sleep-inducing drug cocktail and electroshock therapy would be administered. ** **Cameron's electroshock therapy has been documented to be between 20 - 40 times more intense than the professional standard at the time.** Instead of 110 volts", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__mk-ultra.txt:3:0f7bb5d2a00b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13384, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__mk-ultra.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__mk-ultra", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "he used to erase the minds of his patients that began with 15 - 30 days of 'sleep therapy' (sometimes lasting as long as 65 days), where the patient would sleep all day and night, with the exception of three brief periods where a sleep-inducing drug cocktail and electroshock therapy would be administered. ** **Cameron's electroshock therapy has been documented to be between 20 - 40 times more intense than the professional standard at the time.** Instead of 110 volts at a fraction of a second, Cameron used 150 volts for an initial shock lasting one full second, and then between five and nine additional shocks during the convulsions of the patient, using a muscle relaxant to prevent permanent damage. The next step was to play taped messages to a patient 16 hours a day for multiple months in an attempt to program the desired behavior.212 **Over half of his patients have suffered permanent amnesia of their lives before their 'depatterning'. They were not told that they would be participating in experiments prior to their admittance. A large group of Cameron's victims brought a lawsuit against the CIA in 1988 which was settled out of court, so the agency would not have to admit any official wrongdoing.** Why the interest in electroshock?

At various times, Dr. Cameron was President of the American, Canadian, and World Psychiatric Associations. He was also one of four co-founders of the World Psychiatric Association. The money was provided to Dr. Cameron as part of the C.I.A.'s effort in the 1950's and 60's to develop drugs or techniques that could control human behavior. Patients of Dr. Cameron were subjected to a regimen that included heavy doses of LSD and barbiturates, the application of powerful electric shocks two or three times a day, and prolonged periods of drug-induced sleep. According to Government records, the patients and their relatives were not told they were taking part in experiments. \"Joseph Rauh, another lawyer for the plaintiffs, said many of Dr. Cameron's patients 'were very greatly damaged by the experiments.'\" - *New York Times*214 **The use of 'fronts', meaning a private enterprise secretly owned by the CIA to conceal affiliations with the agency, is standard practice and widespread through MK- ULTRA.

The justification was that it was the only way to truly discover the reactions of the mind under stress and exposed to various mind control chemicals. **The policy was upheld even after it led to deaths. ** One high profile fatality was that of Dr. Frank Olson, a scientist from the Army Chemical Corps' Special Operations Division. During a joint Army-CIA gathering at Deep Creek Lodge in the woods of Northern Maryland, Sidney Gottlieb added LSD to the drinks of the few men in attendance, and did not inform them until the effects started to begin. Dr. Frank Olson was one of these men, and unlike his peers, he was not able to handle the effects of the psychedelic. His colleagues described his reaction as 'psychotic'. He survived the trip, but entered a deep depression and ended up jumping out a window of a New York hotel a week later. **The death of Dr. Olsen prompted an internal review by the CIA of surreptitious testing, but the policy was resumed just a few months later.** One CIA document, issued nearly a decade after Olsen's death, affirmed the internal consensus of unwitting administration of drugs: \"(Officers) argued for the continuation of unwitting testing, using as the principal point that controlled testing cannot be depended upon for accurate results. General Carter, Mr. Kirkpatrick, and I do not disagree with this point.\"216 Another aspect of unwitting testing involves experimentation of children. Although most of MK-ULTRA experiments on minors has been covered up, a *New York Times *article from 1995 reveals a disturbing glimpse, stating that: **\"About 9000 Americans, including children and newborns, were used in 154 radiation tests sponsored by the Atomic Energy Commission,** the Energy Department's Cold War predecessor, Government officials said today...

(PDF Warning) * * * * Entrapment One program uncovered during the internal CIA review centered around George White, a CIA associate who formally worked for the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. The CIA considered White's position ideal, as it gave him unrestricted access to a variety of drugs without suspicion. Under CIA auspices, George White set up 'safehouses' in New York and later San Francisco, fully equipped with covert video and audio surveillance equipment. The goal was to study the use of prostitutes for covert intelligence.218 **\"TSS officials wanted to find out everything they could about how to apply sex to spying, and the prostitute project became a general learning and then training ground for CIA carnal operations.** After all, states one TSS official, \"We did quite a study of prostitutes and their behavior.... At first nobody really knew how to use them. How do you train them? How do you work them? How do you take a woman who is willing to use her body to get money out of a guy to get things which are much more important, like state secrets. I don't care how beautiful she is-educating the ordinary prostitute up to that level is not a simple task.\" - John Marks In addition to studying the use of prostitutes for clandestine use, the safehouses were used to administer drugs to the unwitting solicitors, after which the various effects would be recorded. At least a couple CIA veterans were willing to discuss the use of these safehouses for a more sinister operation: entrapment. John Marks' research of the over 20,000 declassified documents into MK-ULTRA shortly after their release in the mid 70's revealed the following shocking information: \"Gottlieb did not limit his interest to drugs. He and other TSS officials wanted to try out surveillance equipment. CIA technicians quickly installed see-through mirrors and microphones through which eavesdroppers could film, photograph, and record the action. 'Things go wrong with listening devices and two-way mirrors, so you build these things to find out what works and what doesn't,' says a TSS source. 'If you are going to entrap, you've got to give the guy pictures [flagrante delicto] and voice recordings.

This TSS man notes that the Agency put to work in the bedrooms of Europe some of the techniques developed in the George White safehouse operation.\"219 James Keehner, a former CIA psychologist, recalled his involvement in one entrapment case, in which he analyzed a nurse who had 'offered her body' for her country: **Keehner noted that he became disillusioned with entrapment cases, but that other officers 'got their jollies' from this type of work. Regarding his typical assignment, Keehner stated:** **\"I was sent to deal with the most negative aspects of the human condition. It was planned destructiveness. First, you'd check to see if you could destroy a man's marriage. If you could, then that would be enough to put a lot of stress on the individual, to break him down. Then you might start a minor rumor campaign against him. Harass him constantly. Bump his car in traffic. A lot of it is ridiculous, but it may have a cumulative effect.**\" Knowing that some officers got their 'jollies' from entrapment operations, and that safehouses were installed in the United States, the question \"Were entrapment techniques ever used against United States officials or other domestic people of importance?\" is logically raised. \"We wanted her to sleep with this Russian... Either the Russian would fall in love with her and defect, or we'd blackmail him. I had to see if she could sleep with him over a period of time and not get involved emotionally. Boy, was she tough!\"220 218 [1977 Joint Hearing Before the Select Committee on Intelligence](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/19770803-senate-intelligence-committee-project-mkultra.pdf) (PDF Warning) 219 John Marks, \"The Search for the Manchurian Candidate,\" [PDF available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/search-manchurian-candidate.pdf) 220 Ibid * * * * Personality Assessment Although MK-ULTRA was originally devoted to biological mind control, it quickly evolved into a program dedicated to understanding all aspects of the human psyche. George White's experiments tested how people reacted to entrapment, and other experiments tested how different types of people responded to alcohol. It is with this context that the CIA contacted Psychologist John Gittinger to become an instrumental part of MK-ULTRA. Gittinger had developed the Personality Assessment System, a test which would be administered to give fascinating insights into a person's personality and had distinct variables that separated his work from other known personality tests at the time such as the famous Weschler exam. Like Ewen Cameron, Gittinger received funding through the Human Ecology Society to research what type of personality would be likely to defect from their country,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__mk-ultra.txt:7:d4247cd97d57", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13388, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__mk-ultra.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__mk-ultra", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "CIA contacted Psychologist John Gittinger to become an instrumental part of MK-ULTRA.

Like Ewen Cameron, Gittinger received funding through the Human Ecology Society to research what type of personality would be likely to defect from their country, both to target foreign agents and to weed out domestic ones. At one point, Gittinger traveled to work with George White to use his test on prostitutes and homosexuals to refine his assessment test to figure out what type of sexual orientation someone likely had, and to figure out who had sexually deviant tendencies. One of Gittinger's colleagues stated that he knew of cases where the Personality Assessment System was used to identify targets for entrapment, both heterosexual and homosexual.221 **One particularly useful application of the Personality Assessment System was to identify people who would be easily hypnotized. It has likely been used extensively to hand-pick subjects and employees on sensitive projects within and beyond MK-ULTRA, assessing peoples personalities to discover who would retain secrecy and loyalty.** Interestingly, Gittinger was familiar enough with his test that he was able to observe someone's behavior and then retroactively apply the attributes to determine their personality type. By observing how a man held his cigarette, handled his alcohol, or interacted with women, Gittinger could profile that person and determine their weaknesses and propensity for exploitation through entrapment or other means. One logical application of the Personality Assessment System is the ability to assign certain people to a program that required secrecy, by determining how loyal an agent or asset would be to the Agency. 221 John Marks, \"The Search for the Manchurian Candidate,\" [PDF available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/search-manchurian-candidate.pdf) * * * * Hypnotism In mainstream culture, hypnotism is viewed as a type of 'science fiction', confined to the realm of magic tricks and entertainment. The truth is that hypnotism is very real and used both in mainstream psychology and in military intelligence. Hypnotism was used by the United States military before the creation of the CIA, during World War II. Psychologist Dr. George H. Estabrooks recalled his involvement in the clandestine program to *Science Digest *in 1971, in an article titled \"Hypnotism Comes of Age\". \"One of the most fascinating but dangerous applications of hypnosis is its use in military intelligence. This is a field with which I am familiar through formulating guidelines for the techniques used by the United States in two world wars. Communication in war is always a headache. Codes can be broken.

A professional spy may or may not stay bought. Your own man may have unquestionable loyalty but his judgment is always open to question. The \"hypnotic courier,\" on the other hand, provides a unique solution. I was involved in preparing many subjects for this work during World War II. One successful case involved an Army Service Corps Captain whom we'll call George Smith. Captain Smith had undergone months of training. He was an excellent subject but did not realize it. **I had removed from him, by post hypnotic suggestion, all recollection of ever having been hypnotized.** First I had the Service Corps call the captain to Washington and tell him they needed a report on the mechanical equipment of Division X headquartered in Tokyo. Smith was ordered to leave by jet next morning, pick up the report and return at once. These orders were given him in the waking state. Consciously, that was all he knew, and it was the story he gave his wife and friends. Then I put him under deep hypnosis, and gave him-orally-a vital message to be delivered directly on his arrival in Japan to a certain colonel-let's say his name was Brown-of military intelligence. Outside of myself, Colonel Brown was the only person who could hypnotize Captain Smith. This is \"locking.\" I performed it by saying to the hypnotized Captain: \"Until further orders from me, only Colonel Brown and I can hypnotize you. We will use the signal phrase 'the moon is clear.' Whenever you hear this phrase from Brown or myself you will pass instantly into deep hypnosis.\" When Captain Smith re-awakened, he had no conscious memory of what happened in trance. All that he was aware of was that he must head for Tokyo to pick up the division report. On arrival there, Smith reported to Brown, who hypnotized him with the signal phrase. Under hypnosis, Smith delivered my message and received one to bring back. Awakened, he was given the division report and returned home by jet. There I hypnotized him once more with the signal phrase, and he spieled off Brown's answer that had been dutifully tucked away in his unconscious mind. The system is virtually foolproof. As exemplified by the case, the information literally was \"locked\" in Smith's unconscious for retrieval by the only two people who knew the combination. The subject had no conscious memory of what happened, so couldn't spill the beans. No one else could hypnotize him even if they might know the signal phrase...\" \"The potential for military intelligence has been nightmarish. **During World War", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__mk-ultra.txt:9:e53b6197c1ec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13390, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__mk-ultra.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__mk-ultra", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "Brown's answer that had been dutifully tucked away in his unconscious mind.

Under the watchful eye of Marine intelligence I split his personality into Jones A and Jones B. Jones A, once a \"normal\" working Marine, became entirely different. He talked communist doctrine and meant it. He was welcomed enthusiastically by communist cells, and was deliberately given a dishonorable discharge by the Corps (which was in on the plot) and became a card-carrying party member.** **The joker was Jones B, the second personality, formerly apparent in the conscious Marine. Under hypnosis, this Jones had been carefully coached by suggestion. Jones B was the deeper personality, knew all the thoughts of Jones A, was a loyal American and was \"imprinted\" to say nothing during conscious phases.** **All I had to do was hypnotize the whole man, get in touch with Jones B, the loyal American, and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp.** It worked beautifully for months with this subject, but the technique backfired. While there was no way for an enemy to expose Jones' dual personality, they suspected it and played the same trick on us later.\" - *Science Digest, *April 1971222 **It is pretty shocking to see that Estabrooks was willing to completely destroy the life of a marine by relegating his primary personality to an 'alternate' that would only appear when accessed through hypnosis.** It is more shocking that such an application of hypnotism is even possible. He noted that the potential for military intelligence was nightmarish but felt content that his knowledge was being used for the United States instead of the Nazis or the Russians. Unfortunately, corrupt elements in the United States, namely the CIA, would capitalize on this knowledge for illicit means in the near future. There are a variety of CIA documents released through the Freedom of Information Act that shed light on their hypnotism activities. One particularly disturbing example is MK-ULTRA document 190691. It describes an experiment where an unnamed CIA official hypnotized two subjects, both 19-year-old women.

[Redacted] carried out these suggestions to the letter, including firing the (unloaded pneumatic) pistol at [redacted] and then proceeding to fall into a deep sleep. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened and expressed complete amnesia for the entire sequence.\"** MK-ULTRA Document 190691 Not only was this CIA officer able to coerce otherwise peaceful subjects into violence, he was able to remove any memories of the event after they 'woke up' from the hypnotism. MK-ULTRA Document 190527 MK-ULTRA Document 190527 reveals that through hypnotic suggestion, one subject was coerced into setting up an incendiary bomb and leaving the device in a bathroom.224 The document states that even with unforeseen problems in location availability during the hypnotic state, the experiment was: \"...carried off without any difficulty or hesitation on the part of either of the girls... Throughout, their movements were easy and natural, and (bystanders) were, to all intents and purposes, completely unaware of what was taking place although they could clearly observe the movements of [redacted] and [redacted].\" Dr. Estabrooks once noted that only one in five people were susceptible to hypnotism in this manner. True to form, the CIA researched ways to improve to hypnotic susceptibility in their subjects, and found some success by combining techniques with administering drugs. A document titled *Continuation of Studies on Hypnosis and Suggestibility *states: \"Preliminary clinical research during 1955-56 has yielded promising leads in terms of knowledge of how hypnotizability can be influenced by pharmacological means. Several drugs have been identified that apparently are effective in speeding the induction of a hypnotic state...\"225 **The two cited CIA documents describe the unwitting hypnosis of two young women for the use of experimentation. What is the possibility that psychopaths would use this knowledge to exploit women sexually? Perhaps the most disturbing CIA document of all is numbered 140393 and details a CIA interview with a professional hypnotist who was asked to give an instructional course in hypnotism to CIA agents. It states:** **\"On July 2 1951 approximately 1:00 pm the instruction began with [redacted] relating to the student some of his sexual experiences.

[Redacted] further stated that many times while going home he would use hypnotic suggestion to have a girl turn around and talk to him and suggest sexual intercourse to him and that as a result of these suggestions he spent approximately five nights a week away from his home engaging in sexual intercourse.\"226** It is nothing short of terrifying to read how interested the CIA was in methods of rape. The fact that this was beyond any application to intelligence is an afterthought. The document finishes by describing how the student of the hypnotism instructor was able to successfully use his newly-learned techniques on new subjects, indicating that hypnotism was able to spread throughout the ranks of the CIA relatively effortlessly. When Operation Bluebird first began, marking the beginnings of research into hypnosis, one early document revealed a surprising goal: \"Can we \"condition\" by post-hypnotic suggestion agency employees (or persons of interest to this agency) to prevent them from giving information to any unauthorized source or for committing any act on behalf of a foreign or domestic enemy?\"227 This raises the distinct and disturbing possibility that the act of hypnotizing agency members for the purpose of altering their behavior became a common practice at the CIA under MK-ULTRA, with the power of what suggestions to induce at the hands of only two psychopathic men. 222 *Science Digest, *\"[Hypnotism Comes of Age](http://www.whale.to/b/estabrooks.html),\" April 1971 223 [Declassified CIA document 190691](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/foia_mind_control/190691_assassins_programmed_mind_control).

The available evidence clearly shows that this is a lie. From the documents that survived Director Helm's destruction order, we can already see the potential for a 'Manchurian candidate': a mind controlled assassin. ** So what happened to MK-ULTRA? 14 year CIA veteran Victor Marchetti has stated in numerous interviews that the claim MK-ULTRA was halted was merely a cover-story, and that the operation went completely black, in other words, research continued at the highest level of secrecy.228 **Is it possible that academic research into hypnosis and other organic forms of mind control have been deliberately marginalized from mainstream entertainment, media and academics in order to keep its potential use within a military-industrial complex a secret?** After all, MK-ULTRA researcher Dr. Ewen Cameron became the president of the World Psychiatric Association in 1961 and also served as presidents of the Canadian and American Psychiatric Associations.229 It is important to reiterate that not only does the available evidence of MK-ULTRA comprise a very small portion of the documents that were created, but many of the experiments were never recorded in the first place. The operation was presided over by only two individuals who had a complete knowledge of the operations. Not even the Director of the CIA had full access. When John F. Kennedy appointed John McCone as the new director in the wake of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Richard Helms declined to inform him about the more sensitive MK- ULTRA operations, such as George White's safehouses.230 Ultimately, the goal of MK-ULTRA was not to find the 'holy grail' of mind control but to map out a complete knowledge of human nature and the human mind, and then find ways to exploit it. This was done on both individual and group levels. We have no idea how much was accomplished towards this goal, or how much more developed the mind control research has gotten in the over 50 years that have passed since the available documents were last issued. After all, if this is what the CIA was able to accomplish in the 1950's, what are they capable of today? 228 *Telegraph,*\"[Histories Greatest Conspiracy Theories](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/howaboutthat/3477148/The-greatest-conspiracy-theories-in-history.html?image=20)\" 229 Research from Historian John Simpkin, [available here](http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKcameronDE.htm). 230 Church Committee's Assassination report, pp. 102-3 * * * * Food for Thought: 1.

John St Clair Akwei vs National Security Agency Ft George G. Meade, MD, USA (Civil Action 92-0449) The following document comprises evidence for a lawsuit filed at the U.S. Courthouse in Washington, DC, by John St Clair Akwei against the National Security Agency, Ft George G. Meade, Maryland (Civil Action 92-0449), constitutes his knowledge of the NSA's structure, national security activities proprietary technologies and covert operations to monitor individual citizens. **1. THE NSA'S MISSION AND DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE OPERATION** Communications Intelligence (COMINT) Blanket coverage of all electronic communications in the US and the world to ensure national security. The NSA at Ft Meade, Maryland has had the most advanced computers in the world since the early 1960s. NSA technology is developed and implemented in secret from private corporations, academia and the general public. Signals Intelligence (SICINT) The Signals Intelligence mission of the **NSA** has evolved into a program of decoding EMF waves in the environment for wirelessly tapping into computers and track persons with the electrical currents in their bodies. Signals Intelligence is based on fact that everything in the environment with an electric current in it has a magnetic flux around it which gives off EMF waves. The **NSA/DoD** [Department of Defense] developed proprietary advanced digital equipment which can remotely analyze all objects whether manmade or organic, that have electrical activity. Domestic Intelligence (DOMINT) The **NSA** has records on all US citizens. The NSA gathers information on US citizen who might be of interest to any of the over 50,000 NSA agents (**HUMINT**). These agents are authorized by executive order to spy on anyone. The NSA has a permanent national security anti-terrorist surveillance network in place. This surveillance network is completely disguised and hidden from the public. Tracking individuals in the US is easily and cost-effectively implemented with NSA's electronic surveillance network. This network (DOMINT) covers the entire US, involves tens of thousands of NSA personnel, and tracks millions of persons simultaneously . Cost-effective implementation of operations is assured by NSA computer technology designed to minimize operations costs.

Cost-effective implementation of operations is assured by NSA computer technology designed to minimize operations costs. NSA personnel serve in quasi-public positions in their communities and run cover businesses and legitimate businesses that can inform the intelligence community of persons they would want to track. NSA personnel in the community usually have cover identities such as social workers, lawyers and business owners. Individual Citizens Occasionally Targeted for Surveillance by Independently Operating NSA Personnel *NSA personnel* can control the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals in the US by using the NSA's domestic intelligence network and cover businesses. The operations independently run by them can sometimes go beyond the bounds of law. Long-term control and sabotage of tens of thousands of unwitting citizens by NSA operatives is likely to happen. *NSA DOMINT* has the ability to assassinate US citizens covertly or run covert psychological control operations to cause subjects to be diagnosed with ill mental health. **The above symptoms highlight a fraction of the vast array of Neuro-Electromagnetic Frequency Assaults perpetuated by the Police and Military Intelligence Agencies toward Remote Mind Control Experiments, Behavioral Manipulation and Murder. ** **2. NSA'S DOMESTIC ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE NETWORK** As of the early 1960s, the most advanced computers in the world were at the **NSA**, Ft Meade. Research breakthroughs with these computers were kept for the NSA. At the present time the NSA has nanotechnology computers that are 15 years ahead of present computer technology. The NSA obtains blanket coverage of information in the US by using advanced computers that use artificial intelligence to screen all communications, regardless of medium, for key words that should be brought to the attention of NSA agents/cryptologists. These computers monitor all communications at the transmitting and receiving ends. This blanket coverage of the US is a result of the *NSA's Signals Intelligence* (**SIGINT**) mission. The NSA's electronic surveillance network is based on a cellular arrangement of devices that can monitor the entire EMF (electromagnetic frequency) spectrum. This equipment was developed, implemented and kept secret in the same manner as other electronic warfare programs. Signals Intelligence Remote Computer Tampering The NSA keeps track of all PCs and other computers sold in the US. This is an integral part of the Domestic Intelligence network. The NSA's EMF equipment can tune in **RF** (remote frequency) emissions from personal computer circuit boards (while filtering out emissions from monitors and power sup- plies). The RF emission from PC circuit boards contains digital information in the PC. Coded RF waves from the NSA's equipment can resonate PC circuits and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__nsa-covert-operations-akwei.txt:1:96a3f757f4d0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13398, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__nsa-covert-operations-akwei.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__nsa-covert-operations-akwei", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Signals Intelligence Remote Computer Tampering The NSA keeps track of all PCs and other computers sold in the US.

The NSA's EMF equipment can tune in **RF** (remote frequency) emissions from personal computer circuit boards (while filtering out emissions from monitors and power sup- plies). The RF emission from PC circuit boards contains digital information in the PC. Coded RF waves from the NSA's equipment can resonate PC circuits and change data in the PCs. Thus the NSA can gain wireless modem-style entry into any computer in the country for surveillance or anti-terrorist electronic warfare. Detecting EMF Fields in Humans for Surveillance A subject's bioelectric field can be remotely detected, so subjects can be monitored anywhere they are. With special **EMF** equipment NSA cryptologists can remotely read evoked potentials (from EEGs). These can be decoded into a person's brain-states and thoughts. The subject is then perfectly monitored from a distance. NSA personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the Signals Intelligence EMF scanning network and the NSA's computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day. The **NSA** can pick out and track anyone in the US. **3. NSA SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE USE OF EMF BRAIN STIMULATION ** *NSA Signals Intelligence* uses *EMF Brain Stimulation* for *Remote Neural Monitoring* (**RNM**) and *Electronic Brain Link* (**EBL**). EMF Brain Stimulation has been in development since the [MKULTRA program](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050626mkultra) of the early 1950s, which included neurological research into radiation (non-ionizing EMF) and bioelectric research and development. The resulting secret technology is categorized at the National Security Archives as \"*Radiation Intelligence*\", defined as, \"information from unintentionally emanated electromagnetic waves in the environment, not including radioactivity or nuclear detonation\". Signals Intelligence implemented and kept this technology secret in the same manner as other electronic warfare programs of the US Government. The NSA monitors available information about this technology and withholds scientific research from the public. There are also international intelligence agreements to keep this technology secret. The NSA has proprietary electronic equipment that analyze electrical activity in humans from a distance. NSA computer generated brain mapping can continuously monitor all of the electrical activity in the brain continuously. The NSA records and decode individual brain maps (of hundreds of thousands of persons) for national security purposes. EMF Brain Stimulation is also secretly used by the military for brain-to-computer link (in military fighter aircraft, for example). For electronic surveillance purposes, electrical activity in the speech center of the brain can be translated into the subject's verbal thoughts. RNM can send encoded signals to the brain's auditory cortex, thus allowing audio communications direct to the brain (bypassing the ears). NSA operatives can use this covertly to debilitate subjects by simulating auditory hallucinations characteristic of paranoid schizophrenia. Without any contact with the subject, Remote Neural Monitoring can map out electrical activity from the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__nsa-covert-operations-akwei.txt:2:4e4f271de1b1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13399, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__nsa-covert-operations-akwei.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__nsa-covert-operations-akwei", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "military fighter aircraft, for example).

RNM can send encoded signals to the brain's auditory cortex, thus allowing audio communications direct to the brain (bypassing the ears). NSA operatives can use this covertly to debilitate subjects by simulating auditory hallucinations characteristic of paranoid schizophrenia. Without any contact with the subject, Remote Neural Monitoring can map out electrical activity from the visual cortex of a subject's brain and show images from the subject's brain on a video monitor. NSA operatives see what the surveillance subject's eyes are seeing. Visual memory can also be seen. RNM can send images direct to the visual cortex, bypassing the eyes and optic nerves. NSA operatives can use this surreptitiously to put images into a surveillance subject's brain while they are in REM sleep for brain-programming purposes. Capabilities of NSA Operatives Using RNM There has been a Signals Intelligence network in the US since the 1940s. The NSA, Ft Meade has in place a vast two-way wireless RNM system which is used to track subjects and non-invasively monitor audio-visual information in their brains. This is all done with no physical contact with the subject. RNM is the ultimate method of surveillance and domestic intelligence. Speech, 3D sound and subliminal audio can be sent to the auditory cortex of the subject's brain (bypassing the ears), and images can be sent into the visual cortex. RNM can alter a subject's perceptions, moods and motor control. Speech cortex/auditory cortex link has become the ultimate communications system for the intelligence community. RNM allows for a complete audio-visual brain-to-brain link or brain-to-computer link. **The above is a simple flowchart of Nuero-Electromagnetic Frequency Assaults ** **showing methods that can be perpetuated by Police and Military Intelligence Agencies ** **toward Remote Mind Control Experiments, Behavioural Manipulation and Murder. ** **4. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE ELECTRONIC BRAIN LINK TECHNOLOGY ** *NSA SIGINT* can remotely detect, identify and monitor a person's bioelectric fields. The NSA's Signals Intelligence has the proprietary ability to monitor remotely and non-invasively information in the human brain by digitally decoding the evoked potentials in the 30-50 Hz, 5 milliwatt electromagnetic emissions from the brain. Neuronal activity in the brain creates a shifting electrical pattern that has a shifting magnetic flux. This magnetic flux puts out a constant 30-50 Hz, 5 milliwatt electromagnetic (EMF) wave. Contained in the electromagnetic emission from the brain are spikes and patterns called \"evoked potentials\".

Contained in the electromagnetic emission from the brain are spikes and patterns called \"evoked potentials\". Every thought, reaction, motor command, auditory event and visual image in the brain has a corresponding \"evoked potential\" or set of \"evoked potentials\". The EMF emission from the brain can be decoded into the current thoughts, images and sounds in the subject's brain. NSA SIGINT uses EMF-transmitted Brain Stimulation as a communications system to transmit information (as well as nervous system messages) to intelligence agents and also to transmit to the brains of covert operations subjects (on a non-perceptible level). EMF Brain Stimulation works by sending a complexly coded and pulsed electromagnetic signal to trigger evoked potentials (events) in the brain, thereby forming sound and visual images in the brain's neural circuits. EMF Brain Stimulation can also change a person's brain-states and affect motor control. Two-way electronic Brain Link is done by remotely monitoring neural audio-visual information while transmitting sound to the auditory cortex (bypassing the ears) and transmitting faint images to the visual cortex (bypassing the optic nerves and eyes). The images appear as floating 2D screens in the brain. Two-way electronic Brain Link has become the ultimate communications system for CIA/NSA personnel. Remote neural monitoring (**RNM**, remotely monitoring bioelectric information in the human brain) has become the ultimate surveillance system. It is used by a limited number of agents in the US Intelligence Community. **The above is a simple flowchart of Nuero-Electromagnetic Frequency Assaults ** **showing methods that can be perpetuated by Police and Military Intelligence Agencies toward Remote Mind Control Experiments, Behavioral Manipulation and Murder. ** **5. [NO HEADING IN ORIGINAL DOCUMENT] ** RNM requires decoding the resonance frequency of each specific brain area. That frequency is then modulated in order to impose information in that specific brain area. The frequency to which the various brain areas respond varies from 3 Hz to 50 Hz. Only NSA Signals Intelligence modulates signals in this frequency band. (See *Table 1* below) This modulated information can be put into the brain at varying intensities from subliminal to perceptible. Each person's brain has a unique set of bioelectric resonance/entrainment frequencies. Sending audio information to a person's brain at the frequency of another person's auditory cortex would result in that audio information not being perceived. The Plaintiff learned of RNM by being in two-way RNM contact with the Kinnecome group at the NSA, Ft Meade. They used RNM 3D sound direct to the brain to harass the Plaintiff from October 1990 to May 1991. As of 5/91 they have had two-way RNM communications with the Plaintiff and have used RNM to attempt to incapacitate the Plaintiff and hinder the Plaintiff from going to the authorities about their activities against the Plaintiff in the last 12 years.

NSA TECHNIQUES AND RESOURCES ** Remote monitoring/tracking of individuals in any location, inside any building, continuously, anywhere in the country. A system for inexpensive implementation of these operations allows for thousands of persons in every community to be spied on constantly by the NSA. Remote RNM Devices NSA's RNM equipment remotely reads the evoked potentials (**EEGs**) of the human brain for tracking individuals, and can send messages through the nervous systems to affect their performance. RNM can electronically identify individuals and track them anywhere in the US. This equipment is on a network and is used for domestic intelligence operations, government security and military base security, and in case of bioelectric warfare. Spotters and Walk-Bys in Metropolitan Areas Tens of thousands of persons in each area working as spotters and neighbourhood/business place spies (sometimes unwittingly) following and checking on subjects who have been identified for covert control by NSA personnel. Agents working out of offices can be in constant communication with spotters who are keeping track of the NSA's thousands of subjects in public. NSA agents in remote offices can instantly identify (using~ RNM) any individual spotted in public who is in contact with surveillance subject. Chemicals and Drugs into Residential Buildings with Hidden NSA Installed and Maintained Plastic Plumbing lines. The NSA has kits for running lines into residential tap water and air ducts of subjects for the delivery of drugs (such as sleeping gas or brainwashing-aiding drugs). This is an outgrowth of CIA pharmapsychology (psychopharmacology).

Chapter XV: The Pathocracy **On August 12, 1991, Investigative Journalist Danny Casolero was found dead in a bathtub at a hotel in West Virginia. He was in the state to meet a source on a story he was working on called \"The Octopus\", which referred to a sprawling international criminal cabal that was exerting influence over a multitude of world events, such as the Iran hostage crisis that helped get Ronald Reagan elected. Although his death was ruled a suicide, the Casolero family was adamant it was a murder, citing threats on Danny's life.512** **\"The Octopus\" that Danny Casolero was following is the Pathocracy. It has grown over the centuries, spreading its many tentacles across the globe, tightening it's grip on control of information, money, wars and beyond. The scope of this book was mostly kept within the context of the United States but the scope of the \"Octopus\" is truly international.** Of course, we cannot fully know the extent of the beast until it is starved and dissected. But until then, we can still reasonable construct the 'big picture' of our current situation. **The history recounted thus far is the history of institutions that have become saturated with psychopaths, who began to act ruthlessly on their desires to control and manipulate others. The process is called Ponerology,** a term coined by Polish psychologist Andrjez Lobaczewski, who studied how the governments of the Soviet bloc became increasingly evil. The term comes from the Greek word poneria, meaning lawlessness. Lobaczewski published his work in a book titled *Political Ponerology.*513 Lobaczewski had tremendous difficulty in publishing his book; At one point the manuscript was thrown in the furnace shortly before a raid by the secret police, and later the publication was blocked by none other than Zbigniew Brzezinski himself. He had hopes that by sending his manuscript to the Vatican, the word about Pathocracy would be heard on a global level.

He had hopes that by sending his manuscript to the Vatican, the word about Pathocracy would be heard on a global level. The manuscript was never returned. When he came to the United States, he figured that the freer society would be more accepting of his thesis; again, publication was blocked and his work was marginalized. What was so revolutionary about Lobaczewski's work that it was repressed by the elite worldwide? It is impossible to come to any conclusion from his work except that the development of Pathocracy is inevitable as long as the general population is ignorant about the *psychopathic other. ***Psychopaths have always existed, and they view the world of normal people, those with morality and conscience, as something to be looked down upon and exploited. Perhaps the most shocking revelation of his work is that psychopaths learn to recognize each other, even at a young age.514 ** The natural result is a network of psychopaths, a subset of the population that recognize their differences and feel not only contempt for the rest of society, but the need to control and manipulate them as well. Over time they become experts in our weaknesses and follies, watching from a distance with curiosity and amusement. The idea that Psychopaths can recognize each other is central to the Pathocracy. Imagine for millennia the process of evolution of a psychopathic cabal growing in power and numbers, increasingly manipulating society. You would think that the United States would think twice when in 2004 we had one presidential candidate who was a member of a powerful secretive society known as the Skull and Bones run against the Presidential incumbent who was also a member of the same secretive society.515 Tim Russert: You're both were members of Skull and Bones, a secret society of Yale. What does that tell us? Sen. John Kerry: Not much because it's a secret.516 These connections are not insignificant, rather they are the tip of the iceberg of a vast covert network of collusion, the result of the process of the ponerization. **This process of ponerization has happened to the major centers of covert power in our world. The CIA, FBI, NSA and the global financial elite all the way down to local police departments have all become *ponerized *institutions. Understanding the condition and development of ponerized networks is not just important, it is perhaps *the most *important information that society can have. It is the next step in evolution of society, the next grand paradigm shift.** **This is the context under which the Pathocracy operates.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__pathocracy.txt:2:2eb49f8f692a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13408, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__pathocracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__pathocracy", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "has happened to the major centers of covert power in our world.

A system of government hidden from the public view and operated by a psychologically distinct subset of the population whom do not feel empathy, have no conscience, and derive pleasure from the manipulation and abuse of the mass of the population they view as inferior. When we read accounts of horrific extreme abuse perpetrated against children, understand that the *psychopathic other *enjoys this abuse. They derive pleasure from torture and murder.** These psychopaths recognize each other and over time they come to be key holders of power wherever it exists in an unadulterated form. Seemingly antagonistic institutions such as competing banks are actually operated by the same psychopathic cabal behind the scenes. In the same way that you and I naturally exclude social deviants from our social groups, psychopaths do with normal people. The result is a web of mutual conditioning of evil. Through a vast propaganda matrix, the Pathocracy is slowly *conditioning *humanity to conform to their sick standards such as endless war, resulting in a large portion of the population displaying 'secondary psychopathic' tendencies. This is the group that has subverted democracy not only in the United States but around the world, and are currently manipulating world events behind the scenes. 512 *Washington Post, *\"[Area Writer Investigating Inslaw Case Found Dead](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/08/13/area-writer-investigating-inslaw-case-found-dead/f395037a-f188-4a01-8e22-c065d2ffbd9d/?utm_term=.8e6ee7a32b74),\" August 13, 1991. 513 The book *Political Ponerology*, though dense and sometimes difficult to navigate, is one of the most important pieces of literature ever written.

The goal was a profoundly different landscape in the region, one where governments could do little to prevent the manipulation and control of indigenous resources and ideas.** One of these men was Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi businessman, who would maintain a relationship with the CIA for an extended period of time, coordinating Islamic radicals to promote the goals of the CIA through terrorism and indoctrination, and further acting as a scapegoat to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__pathocracy.txt:3:5eca63fc6681", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13409, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__pathocracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__pathocracy", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "important figures in the Middle East.

Bin Laden was not alone, but his organization, Al-Qaeda, would become the centerpiece of a contrived conflict known today as 'The War on Terror', which would eventually create trillions of profits for the very people tasked with ending it. **The United States made strong alliances with the very countries and people responsible for the funding and proliferation of terrorists such as Bin Laden, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The intelligence agencies of these countries are entirely corrupt, and have grown massively in power, to the point where they exert more control than the nominal governments of these states, becoming the 'Deep State', where the true power of a country resides in its covert operations and with people who's names are generally not known to the public. Each of these countries, including the United States, act as an arm of the Pathocracy, and are responsible for a vast majority of the terrorism in the world today.** To some extent they literally operate organizations such as the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. This relationship becomes crystal clear when we see that the objectives of Al-Qaeda are perfectly in line with those of the Pathocracy. In Middle East conflicts such as the Libyan 'Revolution', struggles in Kosovo and Serbia, the Syrian 'Civil War', we see Al-Qaeda and the United States fighting on the same side. **The lack of any tangible results from the War on Terror is a 'smoking gun' for it's uselessness. Terrorism today benefits the Pathocracy and those who serve it. The alleged true perpetrators of terrorism have their homelands bombed and ravished while it provides an excuse for continuous militarization and increasingly repressive domestic policies that do more to stifle legitimate domestic dissent than to curb foreign violence. Terrorism in countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq provide a convenient reason for increasing military presence, and to make the local governments dependent on the United States for protection. ** The resulting destabilization makes the economies and resources easier to exploit. It is not a coincidence that terrorism and destabilization seem to precede important geopolitical objectives in that region. Domestic terrorism serves to keep the populace in fear and justify increased infringement of civil rights. Tragic events such as school shootings are nearly universally followed by a push for an agenda that furthers the goal of the Pathocracy.

That the last known meeting of [Operation Gladio](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#6) coordinators was in 1990 ought to have been, and still should be, front page news. A variety of the actors involved with Gladio are still in significant positions of power today. Gladio has evolved from a localized European campaign of terrorism into a global network. Former FBI agent turned whistleblower [Sibel Edmonds](https://www.WantToKnow.info/sibeledmondsnewsarticles) refers to it as 'Gladio B'. The 'Strategy of Tension' has proved to be one of the most useful tools of the Pathocracy. Across the world, they have assassinated leaders, terrorized populations, destroyed infrastructure and spread destructive propaganda, and it has worked. Where would Latin America be today had they not been terrorized by the Pathocracy? Decades of progress have been lost to repressive dictatorships propped up by the CIA spreading corruption and keeping the means of economic production in the hands of foreign powers. And what about the Middle East? The landscape would be radically different without decades of interference. **Minor differences between Islamic sects have been exploited to divide communities and nations. If even only a portion of the countries in this region united economically, the house of cards of the Pathocracy would tumble down.** They know this, and it is why the Middle East is such a hotbed of violence and destabilization today. * * * * The Agenda **The Pathocracy has been firmly in control of the United States democratic process for decades. As it stands, there are few significant differences between the two parties. To hide this fact, a variety of actors routinely circuit the mainstream media spitting vehemence towards their political 'rivals' while behind the scenes they joke about the smoke screen they have created.** The 'Agenda' that has evolved over the past decades is one of global hegemony, economic and military. Once distinct ideologies of liberalism and conservatism evolve into neo-liberalism and neo-conservatism, they share the same goals and differ only slightly in means of implementing them. The 'Agenda' is the agenda of the financial elite, using a manipulated democratic process, the United States military, and covert institutions as tools of maintaining their socially dominant position. When a foreign country threatens to upset the status quo, there is a regime change in nearly every single instance. In the few countries where this hasn't been accomplished, it is very likely that a regime change is in the works, a plan evolving behind the scenes as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__pathocracy.txt:5:594a6f0cd2b4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13411, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__pathocracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__pathocracy", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "of implementing them.

In the few countries where this hasn't been accomplished, it is very likely that a regime change is in the works, a plan evolving behind the scenes as I write. **In the entire history of the United States, the country has not gone 40 months without a military conflict since at least 1963.517 There are long periods where the enemy is focused around one vague ideology. Yesterday's communism is today's Islamic radicalism: the 'Red Scare' is alive and well, it has found a new face to demonize. Today's wars show no sign of ending.** The Pathocracy has repeatedly exploited crises to implement new legislation with applause that would otherwise be universally panned. 9/11 brought us the Patriot Act and Continuity of Government, which has laid the groundwork for a vast surveillance state and indefinite detention. What crises will be manufactured when the Trans-Pacific Partnership is ready to be officially revealed? 517 *Mother Jones, *\"[How the Rest of the World Views the American Military](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/08/how-rest-world-views-american-military),\" August 29, 2013 * * * * The Deep State **In the United States, and indeed many of the nations around the world, there exist two governments: one that operates out in the open, which the citizens are familiar with and interact with, and a parallel top secret government, whose existence is visible only to a select few and only occasionally exposed to the general public. This clandestine hybrid network of shadowy institutions and figures, both public and private, operates with its own intentions and its own power regardless of who is formally the Head of State.** \"The Deep State does not consist of the entire government. It is a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies: the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Justice Department. I also include the Department of the Treasury because of its jurisdiction over financial flows, its enforcement of international sanctions and its organic symbiosis with Wall Street. All these agencies are coordinated by the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council.\" - Mike Lofgren518 **The 'Deep State' is also largely privatized. *The Washington Post *has reported that the number of private contractors with top-secret clearances has reached 854,000, a mind-blowing number in itself, and greater than the number of top-secret clearances among civilian employees of the government.519 Wall Street is also a main component of the 'Deep State', by which the very grease that allows the cogs of the machine to run originates.

If there is any one thing that the 'Deep State' requires, it is silent and uninterrupted cash flow.** The 'Deep State' was legalized on September 11, 2001 after George W. Bush declared a state of emergency and enacted the Continuity of Government operations. It is the natural result of the progressive number of power grabs by various intelligence agencies detailed throughout the previous chapters. It is the 'Deep State' that is responsible for endless war and the one-party state, effectively ensuring it's continued existence and importance by providing an impetus for war, surveillance and propaganda while simultaneously removing any possibility of civilian reform. The 'Deep State' is the vehicle from which the Pathocracy operates. It has expanded its operations into drug-running, child trafficking and more, so that it does not have to rely entirely on taxpayer money for its projects. For all intents and purposes, the rise of the 'Deep State' can be considered a silent coup on the United States of America. 518 BillMoyers.com, \"[Essay: Anatomy of the Deep State](http://billmoyers.com/2014/02/21/anatomy-of-the-deep-state/#1),\" February 21, 2014 519 *The Washington Post, *\"[Top Secret America](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/),\" an investigate project spanning from 2013 to 2014 * * * * Cults **When we peel back the layers of the Pathocracy and travel deeper into the rabbit hole, by exploring the depths of trauma-based mind control and child abuse that has become institutionalized among the elite, we are given a glimpse of the world of cults. The reality is that the Pathocracy sits on top of, and in the process conceals and protects, a 'black' network of Satanists and other occultists who explore the darkest evils imaginable. The Pathocracy conceals this arm of the octopus because it provides a valuable service to their goals and has a network of lots of influential people.** Furthermore, cults likely operate as 'psychopathic recruitment centers'. The whole idea of a cult revolves around hidden knowledge and the manipulation of the masses. Psychopaths are drawn to such ideologies, and are then recruited into the broader Pathocracy. **There is no topic that reveals the depths of depravity of the Pathocracy more than their [use of pedophilia](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#12) as a tool for control. It is how they conceal their biggest conspiracies, by holding over the heads of their subjects a type of blackmail that will ensure compliance.

In addition, there is no topic more important that reveals the necessity of action than their abuse of children. And if the extent of this phenomenon can be exposed fully, no truth will bring down their reign quicker.** Unfortunately, it is necessary to paint such a dark picture because the reality is dark, and we cannot pretend that the 'endgame' of the Pathocracy does not exist. If resistance to the Pathocracy grows, we must be prepared for the worst, such as a series of major terrorist attacks, wars between major world powers, and the collapse of fiat currency. This is the 'Big Picture': An agenda of total control, and events are accelerating as the Octopus tightens the grip of its tentacles around the globe. We are living in grand times, at no point in history has the current moment been so important for the future of humanity. Fortunately, the Pathocracy is doomed to fail. * * * * Chapter XVI: Solutions **The problem of the Pathocracy seems to be so vast and complex; it is certainly intimidating. We are fortunate that the solutions are relatively simple. It begins with education and non-participation. Ignorance is the key tool that keeps the Pathocracy afloat. It's truly this easy. An awake populace can collectively choose to stop holding the pyramid above their shoulders by refusing to oil the gears of the machine. We need to collectively move our money out of big banks, support local enterprise over multinational corporations, and be courageously vocal about the truth.** The time to start being as vocal as possible was decades ago. By this I mean that there is no time for anything else anymore. If you are awake, start making waking others up your number one priority. There are few things I desire to do more than to forget all of this and get lost in World of Warcraft. Yet the stakes are too high, there is something bigger going on than our selfish desires. Imagine yourself reflecting on the past in 20, 30 years. Will you be content with the impact you had on the awakening, or will you regret not doing more as the police state becomes fully entrenched around you and it is too late to make a difference? **The first step is to become educated yourself.** Be able to articulate the problem to even the most skeptical. Collect information and resources that effectively expose the abuses and inner workings of the Pathocracy. **Then take this knowledge and share it.** I know I have had reservations about sharing the truth with those", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__pathocracy.txt:8:cab61e48c8d2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13414, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__pathocracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__pathocracy", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "the awakening, or will you regret not doing more as the police state becomes fully entrenched around you and it is too late to make a difference? **The first step is to become educated yourself.** Be able to articulate the problem to even the most skeptical. Collect information and resources that effectively expose the abuses and inner workings of the Pathocracy. **Then take this knowledge and share it.** I know I have had reservations about sharing the truth with those who seem so content with their circumstances because shattering worldviews is not a pleasant experience by any means. But it is time to put these reservations aside. The building is on fire, and we need to evacuate before it is too late; those who will be momentarily angry for being slapped awake will be grateful once the gravity of the situation becomes clear. While a personal discussion is certainly the most valuable tool, there are other means. For example, you can compile the sources and information you find most pertinent and send them out in an anonymous email to your contacts list.520 Perhaps begin your email with \"From a concerned friend, please read this information with an open mind\". If 1 out of 100 people is reached this way, the seed will be planted for an inevitable blossom. Ideas follow a pattern of being ridiculed until they reach a critical mass and are accepted. We must endeavor to reach this critical mass as soon as possible, before the grip of the Pathocracy is sufficiently tight enough to prevent the flow of information. 520 If you wish to use this book, please do. There is a reason it is free; so it can reach as many people as possible. * * * * One valuable tool we have is alternative currencies, especially crypto currencies. First off, it is a great way to avoid using traditional means of money transfer and bank holdings that prop up the beast. Yet there is another tremendously important value, especially with Bitcoin and potentially with future Bitcoin competitors: It has made the counterculture rich. There are thousands of people who are receptive to the type of information contained in this book who thanks to new found wealth from crypto currencies now have the means to proliferate the truth far and wide. If this applies to you, please consider using your assets for a positive impact, perhaps by placing relevant information in public places, by organizing protests, or supporting independent media. * * * * **The worst thing we can do is wait for someone else to step up and be a leader, for someone else to organize a movement for us to join, for someone else to take a stand against the Pathocracy.

A true paradigm shift has to start from within ourselves. An organization or institution has too much propensity to be led astray or infiltrated. After all, 'preventing the rise of a messiah' is a documented top priority of the Pathocracy.** Be the change you want to see in the world, and educate others to do the same. Research where the materials you consume come from, and make smart purchasing choices. **Strive to minimize your 'corporate and government footprint'.** It is truly as simple as this, and this chapter can be complete while being one of the shortest in the book. Stop holding the pyramid above us and let it collapse around us, then we can put the important pieces back together without the potential for the massive centralization of covert power that we see today. One by one is how the awakening grows, until it is inevitable. * * * * Chapter XVII: The Awakening The date was December 21, 2012, one day after my graduation from the University of Illinois. I was sitting at home, contemplating life, exhausted from a frenzy of theses, finals and celebrations. I wondered what I would possibly do with a degree in History, a question I had been deftly avoiding throughout my time in school. I wondered if I could ride out my bartending gig into adulthood, wondered how quickly I could get myself out of the suburbs and out of the Midwest. That night, in my typical fashion of procrastinating instead of facing issues head on, I was lead to the dark corners of the internet. I was not a conspiracy theorist, but I found the topics interesting, and fell head first deep into the rabbit-hole of MKULTRA. A truth so dark and disgusting that I cried: a mountain of evidence that the cabal that I would eventually come to know as the Pathocracy is responsible for a global network of child trafficking and child abuse. My worldview was flipped upside down the moment it all sunk in. Some call it 'Waking Up'. I looked at the clock, and the time read 10:33. * * * * Synchronicity was described by Carl Jung as 'temporally coincident occurrences of acausal events'. In other words it means events that are causally unrelated yet experienced together in a meaningful manner, related conceptually with the chance of them occurring together being very small. That evening, I would look at the clock again at 11:33, 12:33 and 1:33.

That evening, I would look at the clock again at 11:33, 12:33 and 1:33. It was the beginning of a lengthy and profound series of synchronicity I would experience with the number. 33 had been my lucky number for quite some time. At age 10, it was the centerpiece of an inside joke for my camp counselors. I didn't understand the joke, of course, but I emulated them as any 10 year old would. It was the number of my Lacrosse jersey in High School, and my standardized test score. It's labeled on the bottle of one of my favorite beers. Nothing seriously profound, but enough for it to be *my *number. I remember being quite hung over on December 21, not just because of celebrating my graduation, but because of a series of parties centered around the end of the Mayan calendar, which some believed predicted the end of the world. Neither my friends nor myself truly thought that the world was going to end, it was just another excuse to get hammered and party as if there was no tomorrow. Yet in hindsight, perhaps this date was not a coincidence. The end of the calendar didn't intend to predict the end of the world; rather, it reflected the Mayan belief that the end of the calendar era would usher in a new age: The Age of Enlightenment. In the months proceeding December 21, I would go days, sometimes even weeks at a time seeing :33 on the clock every single hour I was awake. I had been a committed atheist for much of my life. I still understand it to be one of the most rational worldviews. After all, the world is filled with evil and suffering, and the major religions are filled with corruption and hypocrisy. But this was a phenomenon I could not ignore, and decided to explore it further. It went deeper than just numbers on a clock: I would come to profound thoughts and insights at :33, I met a great friend who had the 33rd ticket at the pub I flipped burgers at to pay the bills, I have frequently and repeatedly published important writing at :33. Following insights from synchronicity brought me to South America, where I met my soulmate and spiritual partner at 6:33 p.m. I am having a direct communication with God and the experience has been phenomenal.

My whole life has been a series of 'learning the hard way'. I had to fail out of school to learn the value of learning. I had to spend weeks in a hospital with major burns to get a grip on my issues with drugs and alcohol. I had to get arrested to learn how my actions impact others. I had to experience obesity to learn the value of health and caring for my body. I had to experience deep and prolonged depression to appreciate happiness and action. A whole lot of experiences to synthesize in 23 years of living, but I am grateful for every one of them. They made me who I am today. **In the same sense, humanity is learning the hard way. We have to confront the Pathocracy in order to collectively evolve, to not just blindly follow the next paradigm shift but to actively construct it within ourselves. As the waning Pathocracy clashes with the rising Awakening, there will be a lot of suffering, but we should not be upset: Instead, we should be grateful for the catalyst that will be responsible for the inevitable beautiful renaissance that represents the light at the end of the tunnel.** * * * * **I absolutely wish I could lay out a comprehensive metaphysical thesis here but the truth is, I simply don't know what the truth is.

King, one of the fastest rising Republican stars of the 1980's.** He was a public figure in Franklin, Nebraska who ran the Franklin Federal Credit Union, along with a series of restaurants and bars. These various businesses apparently furnished King's lavish lifestyle of private jets, extravagant parties and an entourage of assistants and bodyguards. Larry King, as he was known, was accused by seven children of child abuse and prostitution before he sang the National Anthem at the 1988 Republican National Convention. But despite various petitions to local police and the FBI, no official investigations were ever undertaken.358 One of the allegations began from the serious abuse of children at the hands of Jarret and Barbara Webb, the former a member of the Franklin Credit Union board; the latter a cousin of King, who adopted various foster children and would proceed to subject them to horrific physical, emotional and sexual abuse. The girls housed at the Webbs told of being taken to various parties in the Franklin area where Larry King and other important local figures sexually abused them.

The girls housed at the Webbs told of being taken to various parties in the Franklin area where Larry King and other important local figures sexually abused them. One of the girls, Eulice Washington, recalled being flown on King's private jets to be abused across the country. \"Among the first accusers was Eulice Washington, who claimed King flew her to out-of-state pedophilic orgies. She had been adopted by relatives of King's in the 1970s. Her new 'mother' was King's cousin Barbara Webb, and her new 'father' was husband Jarrett Webb, who sat on the board of the Franklin Federal Credit Union. To Eulice Washington, King had been Uncle Larry. 'Larry King set up the pedophile ring,' says Eulice. 'From my knowledge and from what I saw go down, he was the man who got it moving and rolling. Everything went through him. He loves boys. He loves them like he shouldn't.'\" - *The Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse and Betrayal*359 Despite Eulice passing various lie detector tests, charges were never pressed against the Webbs.360 **The Foster Care Review Board (FCRB) was the first organization to come across various cases of abuse, from Eulice Washington and others. They wrote numerous letters to Nebraska's Attorney General Robert Spire urging an investigation, but their pleas were ignored.** The FCRB testified to the State Legislature's Investigative Executive Review Board Subcommittee in 1988 that: FCRB Chairman Dennis Carlson: The nature of these allegations are something that is going to shock the Committee. They deal with cult activities. They deal with sexual abuse. And there's a correlation between these two different reports. We have, the Boys' Town report ... prepared by a worker from Boys' Town named Julie Walters [which] contains the allegations of the children that were in the Webb foster home, Nelly primarily. Years later, well, two years later, we have Loretta Smith in Richard Young Hospital who's making allegations against Larry King, and as far as we know there is no relationship between Nelly and Loretta Smith... Both reports talk about the Omaha Girls Club, both reports mention a specific individual who is the superintendent of schools. State Senator Remmers: The question that came into mind, it's been in my mind since you've been testifying, and I think you've answered part of it just now, is you're talking about these abuses from children from Boys' Town and Girls' Club and so forth. Now is there a common thread that goes over here to the Credit Union deal that we are investigating? In other words to the Franklin Credit Union? Is there a common thread there that kind of leads to that?", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__pedophocracy.txt:4:2ca94ba65911", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13425, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__pedophocracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__pedophocracy", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "question that came into mind, it's been in my mind since you've been testifying, and I think you've answered part of it just now, is you're talking about these abuses from children from Boys' Town and Girls' Club and so forth.

Is there a common thread there that kind of leads to that? FCRB Member Carol Stitt: Well, the common thread is Larry King. Remmers: Yes, that's what I mean. It all goes back to him? OK. Stitt: Yes, he seems to be more the organizer, or the high-class pimp, I mean if that helps fit this together.361 **Larry King would also be linked to embezzlement before he sang the National Anthem at the 1988 Republican National Convention, but again avoided an investigation.** The facade unraveled in November 1988, when an IRS investigation revealed that King had stolen over $40 million from the coffers of the Franklin Federal Credit Union. The financial corruption alone shocked the city, but soon reports started circulating that in addition to various fraudulent accounting documents, investigators found a huge stash of child pornography as well.362 More rumors of sexual abuse began to arise, with multiple allegations that Larry King was using children from Boys Town, the nearby Catholic charitable institution for orphaned youth.363 His yellow sports car was notorious on the Boys Town campus, where he would drive around and pick up minors for his pedophilic activities. The Catholic management denied any connection to King, but financial records showed that Boys Town had a close-knit relationship to the Franklin Federal Credit Union.364 Federal and local authorities immediately moved to close the investigation and seal evidence, claiming that allegations of child abuse were unfounded.365 The authorities backtracked and stated that they had done everything in their power to investigate these claims. Attorney General Robert Spire said: \"We did receive some sensitive information in July. My office acted promptly and professionally and nothing was sat on.\" However, it would later be revealed that no authorities ever interviewed Eulice Washington and other children noted by the FCRB until three years later, after they made their report public.366 Despite this, **Omaha Chief of Police Robert Wadman stated to the press that \"Every step that should have been taken, was taken.\"367 However, Wadman would later confess that he had never contacted Eulice Washington, one of the children abused at the hands of Webb, nor the Child Protective Services department that handled Washington's claims.368 Wadman would later be identified as a child abuser at King's parties by four different victims.369** 358 FranklinCase.org, \"[Franklin Timeline](https://web.archive.org/web/20150420152057/http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11&Itemid=9)\" 359 Nick Bryant, \"[The Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse and Betraya](http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Scandal-Story-Powerbrokers-Betrayal-ebook/dp/B005H3AUIC/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1446853076&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=%E2%80%9CThe+Franklin+Scandal%3A+A+Story+of+Powerbrokers%2C+Child+Abuse+and+Betrayal%E2%80%9D.+Nick+Bryant)l\".

Nebraska Foster Care Review Board official Dennis Carlson related Omaha Police Officer Carmean's testimony to the Legislature's Executive Board hearing: \"[Officer Carmean] told me some things which I found to be somewhat startling. I asked if he was interested in information regarding Larry King and he said, yes we are, we're conducting what he called a supersensitive investigation of Larry King and he said this investigation was so supersensitive that they were not even using the steno pool in the Omaha Police Department. They were handwriting their police reports, and he also told me that Chief Wadman had come to their unit and directly asked if they were investigating Larry King.... Investigator Carmean told me, we lied to the Chief and we said, no, we are not investigating Larry King. That conversation took place on July 20th of 1988.\"370 Shortly afterward, Officer Carmean was transferred out of the Robbery and Sex unit and the investigation stalled. On July 5, 1989, in a lengthy \"Inter-Office Communication\" to Omaha Public Safety Director Pitmon Foxall (a cousin of Larry King), Wadman announced that Carmean needed a mental health evaluation.371 **Many were not convinced of the Police Department's conclusion that there was no substance to the abuse allegations, including a group of 12 State Senators who decided to create their own parallel commission to investigate", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__pedophocracy.txt:6:23160ef0fd46", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13427, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__pedophocracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__pedophocracy", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "Officer Carmean was transferred out of the Robbery and Sex unit and the investigation stalled.

Following the money trail, Schmit and his team quickly found that it could be traced directly to the sex parties and child abuse. It became clear to Schmit that he was uncovering some serious 'dirty laundry':** \"I received a phone call on the floor of the legislature. The caller would not identify himself, but he said, Loren, you do not want to have an investigation of the Franklin Federal Credit Union. And I asked, who am I speaking to? And they said, that doesn't matter, but you shouldn't have that investigation. And I said, well, why not? And he said, it will reach to the highest levels of the republican party, and we're both good republicans.\" - Loran Schmit372 **Schmit wasn't the only one to receive threats. The lead investigator of the State Senator's Committee, Gary Caradori, had also specified that he had received a series of threats, such as obvious tampering with his vehicle, as to send a message. In early July 1990, Caradori made a trip to Chicago to meet with a secret informant who had evidence which would 'blow the lid' off the case. He reportedly confided to a friend that he was one step ahead of those who wanted to squash the investigation, saying that if 'they' knew what information he had, he would be killed.373** **On returning from Chicago, Caradori's private plane crashed, killing him and his son. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation found that the wreckage was scattered over a radius between 3/4 to 1 mile, indicating without a doubt that the plane broke up in the air, instead of upon impact. Certain items were missing from the crash, most notably Caradori's briefcase.

It turns out he was meeting with Russell 'Rusty' Nelson, a photographer for Larry King, who attended King's parties with the intention of photographing powerful men in compromising positions with minors, in order to blackmail them later.375** Like Craig Spence, King was known to throw lavish parties for the Republican elite, with underage prostitutes allegedly in attendance. Rusty Nelson was in hiding for an entire decade after the Franklin Scandal broke, but ended his silence under oath during a court hearing in 1999, in order to 'set the record straight'. He revealed that he had a very close relationship with King and kept hundreds of thousands of photographs of King's business dealings and parties in various locations. Most of the evidence had been confiscated, and more had been destroyed in Gary Caradori's plane crash. **Rusty's testimony to the District Court was very interesting. Among other events, he revealed that he personally saw Larry King place a direct call to then-president Ronald Reagan when other associates could not resolve a specific problem. He also claimed to have seen and taken pictures of the Chief of Police of Omaha Robert Wadman at various parties, engaged in various sexual acts with minors, and had once seen Wadman accept a large envelope full of bearer bonds from King.** While most of Rusty's evidence was confiscated, he was able to provide the court with photographs that corroborated his close relationship to King, such as photographs of King inside his private jet and limousine, and alongside male strippers.376 The District Court hearing was not about Rusty Nelson, but rather for compensation for one of the victims, Paul Bonacci, who had first made accusations of abuse against Larry King in 1986, two years before there was even a *Franklin Scandal. *The testimony given was so convincing that the judge awarded Bonacci with $1 million. The plan was to donate the proceeds to charitable organizations dealing with child abuse, but King has never paid. Paul Bonacci suffered from Multiple Personality Disorder, a diagnosis confirmed by three different state-appointed psychiatrists, from extreme abuse he had received beginning at the age of 3. At the age of 8, he became associated with Larry King and began attending his parties as a child prostitute. The type of abuse Bonacci underwent at the hands of Larry King is shocking: Bonacci: \"They put guns up to my head. They put guns in my mouth... Larry King sent out boys, men, to jump me.

If they wanted to get something passed in the legislature, he would put some people that were against it in a compromising position, by using us boys and girls.\"377 One of the men in Washington that Paul Bonacci claimed abused him is Democratic Senator Barney Frank. Bonacci was also taken on the very same midnight tours of the White House hosted by Craig Spence that journalist Paul Rodriguez wrote about in the *Washington Times, *as a child. He claimed that immediately after the tours of the White House, he was taken to another place to be sexually abused.378 375 [Court Transcripts, \"Paul Bonacci vs. Lawrence E. King\"](https://vdocuments.mx/paul-bonacci-court-transcripts-from-larry-king-lawsuit.html) 376 Ibid. 377 Ibid. 378 Ibid. * * * * The Grand Jury Coverup **Before his untimely death, Gary Caradori had compiled a leads list of 271 victims of sexual abuse in the Franklin area. His death precluded interviewing most, and others recanted their stories under pressure from Federal authorities, often accompanied by the threat of jail time for perjury. Along with Paul Bonacci, the investigation proceeded with three other primary witnesses, Troy Boner, Danny King (no relation to Larry), and Alisha Owens.** Both Boner and Owens recounted tales, after passing multiple state-sponsored lie detector tests,379 of attending hundreds of parties hosted by Larry King where they were abused by King and other prominent men in Lincoln and Omaha. The three would repeatedly corroborate each other in interviews taken under oath by Gary Caradori, initially without knowledge of each others participation in the investigation.380 Most of the victims claimed that they were used to transport drugs across state lines, at the demand of Larry King and Alan Baer, a prominent Omaha millionaire. Gary Caradori once followed a lead of Alisha Owens where she claimed that she was often abused at The French Café in Omaha. He talked to the former manager on the telephone, Sheila McGuire, who told Gary that: \"We had parties in my apartment above the French Cafe. Larry King would wine and dine potential investors downstairs at the Cafe.

If Larry King investors wanted drugs, booze, children or hookers (male or female), we'd get them. While these guests of Kings took their pleasures with the kids or whoever, King would sit and watch while he drank, did coke and played with his young boys. One time, when this guy Irv from NYC wanted Sandra who was about 12 or 13 years old and getting her 1st period, Larry intervened when Sandra refused. King pulled out a roll of $100.00 bills and gave Sandra 5 of them. King then pulled out a small gram of coke and gave that to Sandra. Sandra finally agreed and went off to bed with Irv. King took good care of the local and out of town high rollers. If you had the money to invest at Franklin, King would cater to your most deranged perversion. And, let me tell you another thing. The boys in the board rooms around Omaha are shitting in their Brogans. If this case gets cracked open, the list of involved will read like Who's Who. King and his crew have ruined a lot of children's lives.\"381 **The [*New York Times*confirmed](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/18/us/a-lurid-mysterious-scandal-begins-taking-shape-in-omaha.html) that both the FBI and state investigators received numerous reports regarding sexual abuse from children and testimonies from people involved in the foster care system.382 What happened next is amazing. Instead of indictments of the accused perpetrators to develop cases against them, both Douglas County and Federal Grand Juries ordered all files to be sealed, declined to interview dozens of witnesses, and then brought charges of perjury against Alisha Owens.383** Both Grand Juries concluded that Troy Boner and Alisha Owens had indeed been abused, but claimed that the adults they testified against were innocent! Alisha Owens was later found guilty of perjury, and sentenced to between 9 and 15 years. She ended up spending two years in solitary confinement, more than any other woman in Nebraska history, and a clear message to other victims: Stay silent.384 **\"This is unprecedented, probably in the history of the United States.

It has to be noted that a Grand Jury is a special type of proceeding where the attorney chooses all of the witnesses and what evidence is presented; there is no presentation of the defense or cross examination. A former Chief Judge of New York State once quipped that a special prosecutor could persuade a grand jury to \"indict a ham sandwich.\"388 There are shocking irregularities with the Grand Jury proceedings. First, it never called Larry King to testify. In fact, the evidence of child abuse and child pornography has never been presented against King in *any *court of law. One member of the Douglas County Grand Jury claimed that the Van Pelt helped write the final report, which is illegal. The report contained some very peculiar statements, such as \"children do have the right to expect that *if they exhibit reasonable behavior, *they will not be abused.\" (Emphasis added). It also contained blatant lies, such as the claim that Paul Bonacci's doctor said that Bonacci was not capable of the truth, even though not only was the doctor not called to testify, he said elsewhere that he believed Bonacci's story.389 Owen's attorney, Henry Rosenthal, found that the evidence shown to the Grand Jury was deliberately tampered with. The video testimony taken by Gary Caradori was edited to remove sections where Troy Boner and Alisha Owens corroborated each others claims.390 The lawyer representing Owens, Boner and (Danny) King originally claimed to have had over 100 clients who had suffered sexual abuse in relation to King and Boys Town, but then later claimed that their testimonies were all fabrications.391 **There is also the curious trend of upward mobility for a group of men who were instrumental in rigging the Grand Juries:392** 1.

Shortly after these threats, Troy's brother Shawn was found dead from a gunshot wound.** The official story was a game of Russian Roulette.394 Troy cites this as a primary motivating factor in coming forward with the truth in his affidavit. \"Maybe the most important thing any honest investigator should do is to ask me, Troy Boner, or any of the other kids such as Alisha or Paul Bonacci, to take polygraph, lie detector tests SIDE BY SIDE ON THE SAME QUESTIONS WITH THE PEOPLE WE ARE ACCUSING OF THESE THINGS. Example, ask Alan Baer if he shot mainline drugs into me and if he is a major drug dealer and if he had sex with me.

Ask [redacted] to take a polygraph test on whether he is a big time drug dealer.\" - Troy Boner's Affidavit (Emphasis retained) **The polygraph tests never happened. In 2004, Troy Boner entered an Omaha hospital visibly shaken and adamant that he was being targeted because of his testimony. The next day, he was found in a hospital room dead, drugged and beaten.395 The timing might be related to the reelection campaign of George W.

It was called \"Conspiracy of Silence.\" Yet shortly before it was set to air, it was pulled.** No explanation has ever been given, though there are rumors that an anonymous person paid the Discovery Channel $500,000 to revoke the television rights to the film. It would only be unofficially released two years later, when someone who helped produce the video and felt it was so important it needed to be public, leaked a rough draft from the copy room to attorney and former State Senator John DeCamp. **It is now [widely available for viewing online](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence).** Overall, eight high profile Omaha figures would be accused of sexual assault, with testimonies corroborated between victims.

How could such a massive and orchestrated coverup take place? It involved the FBI withholding all sensitive files, including explicit videos and pictures of the relationships between King and his associates and young children. It involved a campaign of denial by the Omaha Police Department, whose chief was a primary member of the child abuse ring, and a disinformation campaign by Nebraska's media, who also had important members implicated in the ring. ** It involved zealous FBI agents who were self-expressed 'good friends' with Robert Wadman. And it involved a campaign of suspicious deaths designed to silence testimony. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it involved an American public unwilling to believe that powerful men could be implicated in child abuse, child prostitution and drug running.** 397 Discovery Channel, \"[Conspiracy of Silence](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence).\" * * * * The Dutroux Affair **In the summer of 1995, a wave of disappearances of young girls in Belgium grabbed national headlines. The series of kidnappings would continue through the next year, with the Belgium BOB (FBI equivalent) unable to develop any leads. ** **Then in the summer of '96, an anonymous tip about a suspicious white van led investigators to the doorsteps of Marc Dutroux, a known pedophile who had only recently been released from prison after serving three years of a 13 year sentence, despite warnings from various professionals and even his own mother that he was likely to be a repeat offender.398 The man who let Dutroux out of prison, Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet, would soon be promoted to serve as a judge at the European Court of Justice at the Hague.399** Various stories soon emerged in the press regarding how the BOB had repeatedly, and suspiciously, failed to implicate Dutroux during the previous years. For example, BOB officer Rene Michaux once searched Dutroux's house, but failed to investigate yells that he heard in the house, claiming the voices were coming from children outside. Nor did he find the odd construction of Dutroux's basement, shaped in an L with one wall much newer than the others, reason for inquiry.400 **At the time, Dutroux, though unemployed and receiving welfare from the state, owned seven homes and lived quite lavishly from his involvement in selling children and child porn.401 Michaux ignored reports from an informant who claimed to have been made an offer by Dutroux to kidnap young girls in exchange for about €4000.402** He once had in his possession a video tape of Dutroux constructing", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__pedophocracy.txt:15:dcb051616f85", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13436, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__pedophocracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__pedophocracy", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "shaped in an L with one wall much newer than the others, reason for inquiry.400 **At the time, Dutroux, though unemployed and receiving welfare from the state, owned seven homes and lived quite lavishly from his involvement in selling children and child porn.401 Michaux ignored reports from an informant who claimed to have been made an offer by Dutroux to kidnap young girls in exchange for about €4000.402** He once had in his possession a video tape of Dutroux constructing his makeshift basement dungeon and raping a 14 year old girl, but the tape was returned to Dutroux's wife, apparently unviewed.403 Michaux's failures likely directly led to the death of two girls who were held captive by Dutroux at the time of the investigation and reportedly died of starvation. The arrest of Dutroux did not come until a new lead investigator, Jean-Marc Connorette, was assigned to the case. For the first time, many victims of child abuse and trafficking in Belgium felt that they had someone they could trust, and began to come forward with their stories. The case quickly spiraled to the point where Dutroux was no longer the focus. During the investigation, these victims were each assigned a number, appended after an X. For example, X1 was first sexually abused at the age of two, at the hands of her grandmother, who owned a hotel frequented by pedophiles. At the age of 4, she was introduced to a 'pimp' who would take her out to other locations for abuse and torture. She was diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder, now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder. Even after getting married and moving away at the age of 19, she was never able to fully leave the 'network': Occasionally, when her husband was out of town, her old pimp would show up and take her back to places she was abused as a child, and she would be raped.404 **She named and described in great detail, to a specially assembled police team, the people and places involved in the pedophile ring.

Most had developed Multiple Personality Disorder, and had been turned over to the 'network' by family members. Many accurately and independently verified locations and members of the network who were their abusers.409 Perhaps most importantly, they all claimed that high profile members of society were involved.410** X1 also corroborated that one of Dutroux's associates, Jean-Michel Nihoul, was instrumental in the abuse parties. **Nihoul had significant connections among Belgian political and financial elite. He later confessed to organizing an orgy at a Belgian chateau attended by government officials, described by the press as a 'Policeman's Orgy'.411 It emerged that Dutroux and Nihoul were part of a long distance child trafficking ring that imported children from Slovakia, among other places. Nihoul would later be found not guilty, a decision made by the judges who overruled a 'guilty' verdict by the jury.** **Just as the investigation was heating up and began to show promise, it was completely dismantled from higher powers. Jean-Marc Conorrette was dismissed from the case, which drew huge criticism from across the nation.412 It prompted the event known as the 'White March', in which 300,000 Belgians from the nation of just 10 million took to the streets to protest the dismissal.413 414 **Conorette would later break down in tears in court while describing the death threats he received when he was still involved with the investigation.415 A second change that greatly affected the proceedings was the introduction of a strict hierarchy to the examinations of the witnesses, which was previously undertaken by BOB officers working independently, overseen by Gendarmerie Commandant Jean-Luc Duterme. Duterme would conduct abusive interrogations which emotionally devastated the witnesses who were suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder. In addition, the prosecutor that replaced Conorette, Jacques Langlois, deliberately obfuscated the investigation. He sent police out on false tips and helped spread disinformation in the media.

He claimed that magistrates and police were officially told to not answer certain questions, in what he described as a 'characteristic smothering operation'. He was further quoted as saying \"For me, the Dutroux affair is a question of organized crime.\"418 **A parliamentary panel revealed the names of 30 government officials it said were complicit in the hiding of Dutroux's misdeeds, none of whom have been punished.419** **As the trial came to an end in 2004 and faded from the public spotlight, Dutroux adamantly claimed that he was not a lone pedophile, but instead was acting on behalf of a large pedophile ring.420** \"Marc Dutroux insisted yesterday that he was not a 'lone predator' who kidnapped and raped young girls, but part of a wider paedophile ring. Dutroux portrayed himself as a victim, a 'puppet in a show trial' who had to be put away to 'hide the truth' and serve the interests of 'organised corruption'. Only 10% of the case had been examined, he said, asking why independent-minded policemen had been removed from the investigating team.

The files are sealed, with the presiding judge claiming he saw no reason to reopen them. ** **The Dutroux affair follows a shockingly similar pattern to the events in Franklin, Nebraska. The local police have no interest in uncovering the child abuse ring and even go to seemingly absurd lengths to keep it a secret. The courts are hostile towards the witnesses and the trials are deliberately obfuscated. Charges of perjury are brought against those who refuse to recant their stories. The Federal investigators withheld proof of the claims of the witnesses, including the names of high profile members of the child abuse ring and visual evidence of their crimes.** ***[Editor's Note]**** An excellent, disturbing documentary titled ** \"[Imperium](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/child-trafficking-documentary)\" uses engaging major media footage to show how the investigation into the Dutroux affair was corrupted by individuals and groups at the highest levels. This important film leaves no doubt as to the gravity of the problem and the need for us to come together for the sake of these abused children. * 398 *BBC, *\"[Profile: Marc Dutroux](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3522367.stm),\" June 17, 2004 399 [Wikipedia article on Melchior Wathelet.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160927112641/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melchior_Wathelet) 400 *Fox News, *\"[Court keeps convicted pedophile killer Marc Dutroux in prison in Belgium](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/02/18/court-keeps-convicted-pedophile-killer-marc-dutroux-in-prison-in-belgium/),\" February 18, 2013 401 *NBC, *\"[Belgium Begins High-Profile Pedophile Trial](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4422016/#.UW5SDyc3uqY)\", March 1, 2004 402 TruTV's Crime Library, \"[Marc Dutroux, A Pedophile and Child-Killer](https://web.archive.org/web/20130401111036/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/dutroux/evil_1.html).\" 403 *The Guardian, *\"[Police admit Dutroux video bungle,](http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jun/17/stephenbates)\" June 17, 1999 404 Marie-Jeanne Van Heeswyck, Annemie Bulté and Douglas De Coninck ,*[The X Dossiers](http://www.whale.to/c/dutroux_case5.html)*, 1999 405 *BBC, *\"[Regina Louf's Testimony](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent_europe/1962244.stm),\" May 2, 2002 406 Ibid. 407 Regina Louf, \"[Zwijgen is voor daders : de getuigenis van X1](http://www.librarything.com/work/7563984/get).\" Unfortunately, I have been unable to find an English version of this book. 408 Ibid. 409 Annemie Bulte, \"de X-Dossiers: Wat Belgie Niet Mocht Weten Over de Zaak-Dutroux.\" 410 *New York Times, *\"[275,000 in Belgium Protest Handling of Child Sex Scandal](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/21/world/275000-in-belgium-protest-handling-of-child-sex-scandal.html),\" October 21, 1996 411 *The Telegraph, \"*[Belgians Shocked By Tale of Policeman's Orgy,](http://www.whale.to/c/belgians_shocked.html)\" March 16, 1990 412 *New York Times, *\"[Belgian Hero Dismissed](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/15/world/belgian-hero-dismissed.html),\" October 15, 1996 413 *New York Times, *\"[275,000 in Belgium Protest Handling of Child Sex Scandal](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/21/world/275000-in-belgium-protest-handling-of-child-sex-scandal.html),\" October 21, 1996 414 Wikipedia article on the [White March](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_March) 415 *The Telegraph, *\"[Judge tells of murder plots to block Dutroux investigation,](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/1456107/Judge-tells-of-murder-plots-to-block-Dutroux-investigation.html)\" March 5, 2004 416 *Humo, *\"War in Neufchateau: examining magistrate Connerotte speaks about the Dutroux dossier for the first time,\" December 3, 2002. 417 *Los Angeles Times, *\"[Kidnap Deaths", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__pedophocracy.txt:19:53557f22557b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13440, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__pedophocracy.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__pedophocracy", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "of Policeman's Orgy,](http://www.whale.to/c/belgians_shocked.html)\" March 16, 1990 412 *New York Times, *\"[Belgian Hero Dismissed](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/15/world/belgian-hero-dismissed.html),\" October 15, 1996 413 *New York Times, *\"[275,000 in Belgium Protest Handling of Child Sex Scandal](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/21/world/275000-in-belgium-protest-handling-of-child-sex-scandal.html),\" October 21, 1996 414 Wikipedia article on the [White March](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_March) 415 *The Telegraph, *\"[Judge tells of murder plots to block Dutroux investigation,](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/1456107/Judge-tells-of-murder-plots-to-block-Dutroux-investigation.html)\" March 5, 2004 416 *Humo, *\"War in Neufchateau: examining magistrate Connerotte speaks about the Dutroux dossier for the first time,\" December 3, 2002. 417 *Los Angeles Times, *\"[Kidnap Deaths Plunge Belgium Into Guilt](http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-02/news/mn-39974_1_death-penalty),\" September 2, 1996 418 *The Guardian, *\"[Cover-up claims revive sex scandal](http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/21/stephenbates),\" April 21, 1999 419 *Los Angeles Times, *\"[Grisly Crimes Undermine Belgian Unity](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-jan-03-mn-4579-story.html),\" January 3, 1998 420 *The Guardian, *\"[Dutroux insists he was part of paedophile ring,](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/11/dutroux.ianblack)\" June 11, 2004 * * * * The British Aristocracy Pedophocracy \"Officers in London were inquiring into allegations made by a teenage rent boy that a Cabinet minister had been abusing him. The youth claimed to be one of a number of boys regularly having sex with rich and powerful men in the 1980s - some of whom would fly to the illegal orgies from Europe. As well as the Cabinet minister - who is still alive - he pointed the finger at judges, European bigwigs and senior civil servants. He told his story to detectives, who are understood to have received other allegations against the minister. But a former detective who worked on the case revealed they were suddenly told to halt the probe. **The furious ex-policeman said: \"It wasn't that we ran out of leads, but it reached a point where a warning to stop came. It was a case of 'get rid of everything, never say a word to anyone'. It was made very clear to me that to continue asking questions would jeopardise my career.\"** - *The Sunday Daily Star*421 **The passing of Sir Jimmy Savile in October 2011, entertainer, socialite and personal friend of the royal family, opened the floodgates of a myriad of revelations, with hundreds of victims coming forward claiming they were abused at the hands of Savile in esteemed institutions such as BBC and various hospitals. It seemed that many people where aware of the transgressions, but no one acted. **Years later, new revelations were still coming to light on a weekly basis. One interesting story was published in January of 2013 which read, \"Jimmy Savile was part of satanic ring\".422 \"Dr Sinason told the *Sunday Express* she first spoke to the victim in 1992.

Over 30 years ago in 1981, Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens warned parliament against a pedophile ring he had uncovered, claiming that the network involved \"big, big names - people in positions of power, influence and responsibility\" and threatened to expose them in Parliament.423** **Dickens made waves regarding the pedophile ring and dossiers he received for four years in parliament before backing down in the face of harassment and death threats. It seems that no one took him seriously at the time, but new evidence shows that his claims had merit: In January 2013, Scotland Yard reopened their investigation.** \"Last month Metropolitan Police began Operation Fernbridge into allegations that residents of a children's home in Richmond, west London, were taken to the nearby Elm Guest House in Barnes, where they were abused. Pornography involving adults having sex with children was allegedly shot at the property and then circulated commercially. Sir Peter was among the visitors to the property. Others, according to a list seized by Scotland Yard last month, were the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith, the former Russian spy Sir Anthony Blunt, a Sinn Fein politician, a Labour MP, and several Conservative politicians. After neighbours complained about the arrival of children, the police raided the guesthouse in 1982 but the operation was mysteriously cut short. A 2003 investigation also failed.\" - *The Independent*424 The new inquiry was prompted by MP Tom Watson, who requested the original dossier collected by Dickens, but Scotland Yard has been unable to produce it.

In Wrexham, North Wales, the tale is a familiar one. Boys from the Bryn Estyn home would be taken to parties throughout the city where they acted as child prostitutes for socialites and were severely sexually abused. **\"Over the years, twenty seven police inquiries failed to disclose the scale of the alleged abuse. Thirteen reports by social services went unpublished. Several journalists reached out for the truth and ended up scorched by libel actions. When police finally launched a major inquiry, in 1991, they secured the conviction of only four care workers and concluded that there was no evidence of a paedophile ring. Clwyd County Council then commissioned its own independent inquiry but decreed that its report could not be published.\"** - *The Guardian*426 Celebrated investigative journalist Nick Davies, writing for *The Guardian*, nails the concept and motivation behind these various sex abuse scandals with the following statement: \"Power is the fabric of a paedophile ring, essential first to subjugate the children, whose passivity is essential for the adults' indulgence; and second, where possible, to neutralise the authorities who might otherwise frustrate its activities.\" **Writing about a new tribunal launched into the Wrexham case in 1997, Davies noted that over 300 men and women had come forward, naming 148 different abusers.** **The official Wrexham inquiry concluded that widespread abuse of boys did indeed occur at Bryn Estyn and other nearby children's homes, and that dozens of potential inquiries were completely suppressed by administrators.** \"During the period under review there was a paedophile ring in the Wrexham and Chester areas in the sense that there were a number of male persons, many of them known to each other, who were engaged in paedophile activities and were targeting young males in their middle teens. The evidence does not establish that they were solely or mainly interested in persons in care but such youngsters were particularly vulnerable to their approaches.\"427 After the Savile revelations, 76 new victims came forward in North Wales, and the investigation has been reopened.

We are unable to identify the overall extent of the allegations received by the police in the many witness statements which they took.'' • **Some 130 boxes of material handed over by the council to the police were not made available to the panel.** • The council did not allow the inquiry to place a notice in the local press seeking information. \"This was considered to be unacceptable to the insurers,'' says the report. • \"There were numerous claims and suggestions that senior public figures including the police and political figures might have been involved in the abuse of young people,'' the report said. - *The Independent*429 After his death, Jimmy Savile would be repeatedly linked to the North Wales home. One victim claimed to have been repeatedly raped by the deputy head of the home, Peter Howarth, while Savile watched for entertainment.430 \"Howarth pulled down my pyjama bottoms in front of Savile. I was helpless as Jimmy watched. He thought it funny entertainment. This happened to a number of boys.\" According to \"Ben\", Savile would ask him: \"What do you want me to do?

After that I went to bed but he had other children brought up to him.\" - *The Telegraph* **The phrase \"Can I fix it for you\" is a sick play on Jimmy Savile's popular TV show, 'Jim'll Fix It', where Savile would put underprivileged or sick kids into contact with celebrities, or take them on trips, as a psuedo-charitable charade.

Yesterday he told Channel 4 News that he passed photographs of children being abused, including himself, to the police but they failed to act. He also said the men who abused him as a teenager frequently threatened him, saying: 'If you tell anyone, I'll have you killed.'\" - *The Telegraph* **The Haut de la Garrene children's home in Jersey has similar evidence of a massive coverup. Jersey, not subject to European Union regulations, has long been a haven of tax dodgers and secrecy. In 2008, more than 200 victims came forward with tales of rape and torture.431** It soon became clear that many of the accused were Tory officials and aides, prompting a swift response by Prime Minister David Cameron to address the claims.432 After his death, it was revealed that Jimmy Savile was a regular visitor of the children's home.433 **In 2008, after being replaced as the lead of the investigation, Police Chief Lenny Harper blasted the road blocks he encountered during his tenure and accused an 'Old Boys' network of obstructing his investigation.** **In his most outspoken criticism of the Jersey authorities, Mr Harper told the *Telegraph*: \"I can quite clearly say that the investigation is being held up. There are people on the island who just don't want us going down the route of this inquiry.\" ** Mr Harper, who handed over the reins of the investigation to his successor on Thursday and officially leaves the Jersey force at the end of the month, also revealed fresh details of why he is so convinced that someone deliberately concealed the bones and teeth of five children, perhaps after murdering them. Mr Harper has repeatedly said that because some of the 100 bone fragments had been cut, and because the 65 milk teeth found at the home had roots on them, meaning they did not come out naturally, children were either murdered or their bodies were illegally concealed.\" - *The Telegraph*434 Jimmy Savile pictured with 30 children from the Haut de la Garrene Home Jimmy Savile was also linked to Haut de la Garenne.

It was revealed in October 2012 that his name had come up numerous times in a police investigation four years earlier, but he was not investigated further.435 Lenny Harper, the lead investigator into the Garenne home, told the *Telegraph *in 2012: \"Savile chose his victims with great care; vulnerable and often troubled youngsters many in care homes. If they complained they were labeled troublemakers, or brutally put down. We know from court cases and statements made to my team [during the 2008 inquiry] that children in Jersey care homes were 'loaned out' to members of the yachting fraternity and other prominent citizens on the pretense of recreational trips but during which they were savagely abused and often raped. **\"When these children complained they were beaten and locked in cellars [at Haut de la Garenne], which the Jersey authorities denied existed in 2008, but which can still be seen on YouTube footage.** What chance did they have? This would have been the perfect hunting ground for Savile. The great and good of Jersey fawn over anyone with even loose connections to British royalty. Saville would have been a VIP to them and children would not have stood a dog's chance of complaining about him. It would have been so easy for him.\" - *The Telegraph*436 Regarding the statement about the 'yachting fraternity', Rupert Murdoch's famous tabloid *News of the World *launched an investigation and found that children were \"loaned out to rich pedophile yachtsmen\".437 They alleged that Jimmy Savile personally delivered the boys to the club. Jimmy Savile is certainly a weird character. He once gave an interview to *Esquire *Magazine where he stated: \"I guess I am like Forrest Gump.

As bizarre as it may seem, through remote viewing and other secret projects, the U.S. government has dabbled in ESP and the psychic realm for many decades. Though the existence of remote viewing projects was officially denied until 1995, secret documents now declassified show the first government-sponsored remote viewing program began in 1970. **[Remote viewing](http://www.fas.org/irp/program/collect/stargate.htm) is a technique whereby trained individuals enter into a meditative state to access subtle levels of consciousness in which they are able to sense remote locations and describe what they see there, sometimes with a remarkable degree of accuracy.** The ability to view objects remotely has clear advantages for intelligence gathering. A good example of how this is done can be seen in the four-minute news clip on remote viewing at the link below. [**www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/remote_viewing_helicopter_video**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/remote_viewing_helicopter_video) For a more detailed description of remote viewing and how it is accomplished, see the excellent explanation on the website of the International Remote Viewing Association [available here](http://irva.org/remote-viewing/definition.html). Think of the possibilities if anyone were able to develop remote viewing abilities. If you lost your car keys, you might be able to then find them. An abducted child or stolen car could be found. And if remote viewing is possible, what other psychic abilities might also be accessible to us all? **Could it be that our consciousness has much more power than we might have imagined, and that life is far grander than most would ever suspect?** Note that if you research remote viewing in any depth, besides finding excellent information supporting this exciting phenomenon, you will also likely encounter numerous statements like that of the [wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing) on the subject to the effect that \"the [remote viewing] program was terminated in 1995 after it failed to produce any useful intelligence information.\" Government disinformation campaigns don't want us to believe that remote viewing was successful, despite the fact that their own declassified documents show without a doubt the amazing results of some top remote viewers. Many remote viewers involved in these secret programs have also gone public stating that the program was a mind-boggling success. For a nine-page sample from one declassified remote viewing document which shows astounding accuracy in an experiment conducted on a submarine, read the October 1978 document [available here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mk/remote-viewing-submersible-1978.pdf).

His personal website with lots more on remote viewing is [available here](http://www.mceagle.com/remote-viewing/). This and so much more shows that **just as the U.S. government officially denied the existence of the remote viewing program for decades, current claims that the program was ineffective are almost certainly disinformation.** The original impetus for U.S. remote viewing programs was the discovery by military and intelligence services in the 1960s that the Soviets were spending millions of dollars and having considerable success in using ESP and psychic spies to break through U.S. security barriers. Not wanting to be left behind in any spying or intelligence capability, no matter how exotic, top government officials [contracted in 1972 with SRI](http://www.fas.org/irp/program/collect/stargate.htm) (Stanford Research Institute) to develop the first of several remote viewing programs which operated under code names such as Project Scanate, Project Grill Flame, and the [Stargate Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project). Kept top secret for national security reasons, many thousands of pages of remote viewing documents were carefully stored away as the nation's remote viewers gradually refined their ability to produce drawings of what they saw at a distant location. Some of the best remote viewers were able to consistently describe remote viewings with an accuracy above 80 percent. For a website which makes available more than 100,000 pages worth of declassified remote viewing documents, see below: [**http://www.dojopsi.info/stargateCIAdocs/**](http://www.dojopsi.info/stargateCIAdocs/) ** CIA Director [Admiral Stansfield Turner](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/directors-and-deputy-directors-of-central-intelligence/turner.html) and several top generals eventually became strong supporters", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__remote-viewing.txt:1:4dc67cdc950b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13452, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__remote-viewing.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__remote-viewing", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "of remote viewing documents were carefully stored away as the nation's remote viewers gradually refined their ability to produce drawings of what they saw at a distant location.

Through remote viewing programs, a set of scientifically based protocols were developed by which many people, even those without prior psychic abilities, were able to describe remote objects with some accuracy.

MICROWAVE HARASSMENT AND MIND-CONTROL EXPERIMENTATION ***By Julianne McKinney *** ***Director, Electronic Surveillance Project *** ***Association of National Security Alumni December 1992 *** Whither the KGB? In February 1974, Georgetown University's Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) hosted discussions on the plight of dissenters in the Soviet Union, and on the means by which the U.S. Government might most effectively intervene. Highlights of these discussions are reported in *Understanding the Solzhenitzyn Affair: Dissent and its Control in the USSR* (CSIS, 1974). KGB strategies were addressed in some detail during these discussions. It was noted that the KGB's success depended on the extensive use of informant networks and *agents provocateurs;* and, following Brezhnev's rise to power, on the use of drugs and psychiatrists for further purposes of manipulation and control. Shadowing, bugging, slandering, blacklisting and other related tactics were also cited as serving KGB purposes. **Participants in the conference agreed that the KGB's obvious intent was to divide and isolate the populace, to spread fear, and to silence dissenters. ** ** Agencies of our own government are on record as having employed precisely these same tactics on a recurrent basis. The Church and Rockefeller Committee Hearings in the mid-1970's purportedly put an end to these practices. Based on recent developments, it would appear that the CIA's and FBI's Operations [MKULTRA](https://www.wanttoknow.info/050626mkultra), [MHCHAOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_CHAOS) and [COINTELPRO](https://www.wanttoknow.info/ia/cointelpro-fbi) (the focus of these Senate Committee and Vice-Presidential-level Hearings) were instead merely driven underground. ** We are now in contact with a total of 25[*](#_ftn1) individuals, scattered throughout the United States, who firmly believe they are being harassed by agencies of the U.S. Government.

Others have been brought to our attention whom we will be contacting in the future. The majority of these individuals claim that their harassment and surveillance began in 1989. The methods reportedly employed in these harassment campaigns bear a striking resemblance to those attributed to the CIA and FBI during Operations MKULTRA, MHCHAOS and COINTELPRO. The only difference now is that [electronic harassment](https://www.wanttoknow.info/voicesinheadelectronicharassment) and experimentation also appear to be (more blatantly) involved. The Berlin Wall is down, Communism is in the midst of a death rattle, and the KGB no longer poses the threat which purportedly served to justify the U.S. Government's resort to such operations as MKULTRA, MHCHAOS and COINTELPRO. The KGB, since 1989, has been reduced to an increasingly distant memory. Reactivation of surveillance/harassment/mind-control operations in this country suggests that the KGB, as an institution, was never the real threat. A KGB \"mentality,\" with its underlying pragmatic contempt for civil liberties, appears, instead, to have been the driving force behind MKULTRA, MHCHAOS and COINTELPRO, and the operations now being reported to us. The KGB \"mentality\" is a matter of personal predilection, not ideology. Its objective is power and control, regardless of human cost. It is a corrupting, cancerous influence, which feeds on fear, conformity and government funding. Four months ago, when this Project commenced, we approached these complaints of government harassment and experimentation with an admitted \"high degree of caution.\" We are no longer skeptical. The growing numbers of independent complaints and the similarities between those complaints cannot be ignored. Under the circumstances, the KGB should be proud of itself. As a \"mentality,\" the KGB appears to be accomplishing more in \"burying this country\" from within, than it could ever have hoped to have achieved as an institution. It would appear that this country has a serious problem on its hands which needs to be resolved. Part I of this report, which is reprinted from the June-July 1992 edition of the Association's publication, *Unclassified,* preliminarily addresses the complaints brought to our attention as of July 1992. Our objective, as noted, was to weigh the legitimacy of those complaints in terms of the directed-energy technologies reportedly involved. Part II discusses the overt and covert patterns of harassment identified as a result of our investigations, to date. A part of our objective, here, is to limit the success of such operations in the future, by according them widespread publicity.

A part of our objective, here, is to limit the success of such operations in the future, by according them widespread publicity. In Part II, we do not identify individuals by name, both to honor their privacy and because our investigations have not been completed. Part II, like Part I, is a preliminary finding. Our focus is on the similarities of the complaints being received-similarities which Federal and State legislators, the courts, the FBI, local law enforcement agencies, the medical and psychiatric professions, and organizations such as the ACLU and Amnesty International have so far chosen to ignore. **We frankly find it curious that more attention and credibility is being accorded purported victims of UFO experiences and spectral visitations, than to persons who complain of systematic harassment and experimentation by the U.S. Government, involving technologies which the U.S. Government is only now grudgingly admitting to possess. **These complaints require investigation. In due course (and provided financial support is obtained), we hope to be able to acquire the technology and supportive medical expertise to substantiate the claims being made. We also hope to alter the institutional mindset that U.S. Intelligence can be trusted. History, repeatedly, has proven otherwise. PART I - THE PROBLEM SURFACES [*Reprinted from the June-July 1992 edition of UNCLASSIFIED (Vol. IV, No. 3), * * published by The Association of National Security Alumni, Washington, D.C.*]* * The August-September 1991 issue of *UNCLASSIFIED* reviewed Hamline University's *Public Administration* report on the resolution of MKULTRA cases in 1988. Although the shocking details of medical ethics abuses by the U.S. and Canadian governments were amply detailed, Washington and Ottawa-citing national security and government privilege-stalled for so long that the cases never came to trial. The surviving victims settled for a pittance in an out-of-court settlement. Since no individuals or agencies were held legally accountable, the door was left open for possible resumption of similar \"mind-control\" activities. In the context of that article, we mentioned briefly that some half-dozen people had contacted us with appeals for assistance in ending what they believe to be electronic harassment and mind-control experimentation, possibly involving the CIA. We decided to take a closer look at this situation. We are now in touch with approximately a dozen individuals located throughout the United States who appear to be targets of harassment and mind-control experimentation involving directed-energy technologies. [By mid-November 1992, that number had increased to 25.] Typically, persons who complain of being \"zapped by radio waves\" and of \"hearing voices\" are stigmatized as psychotic, delusional or schizophrenic.

Being mindful of this, as well as aware of the treatment accorded UFO and psychic phenomena \"freaks,\" we approach this subject with a high degree of caution. Based on our preliminary investigation, including interviews with the affected individuals, we conclude that the matter is serious and should be pursued further. The Existing Directed-Energy Arsenal Our first step was to determine what, if any technology exists which might be used for electronic harassment. That information was found in a \"white paper\" published in 1991 by the U.S. Global Strategy Council-a Washington-based organization, under the chairmanship of Ray Cline, former Deputy Director of the CIA, who maintains very close ties with the U.S. Intelligence community. The \"white paper\" describes the foreign and domestic uses foreseen for laser weapons, isotropic radiators, infrasound, non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse generators, and high-power microwave emitters. ** The term, \"non-lethal,\" used to describe this technology is misleading. The energy emitted from all of these weapons can kill when appropriately amplified. At lower levels of amplification, they can cause extreme forms of physical discomfort and debilitation. ** The Department of Army (DA) identifies these same weapons as \"non-conventional.\" They were so identified in an exhibit at a DA-sponsored symposium on \"The Soldier As A System,\" in Crystal City, VA, on June 30, 1992. Beta wave incapacitators were separately mentioned during the symposium as being of particular interest to the U.S. Marine Corps. We discussed these \"non-conventional\" directed-energy weapons with Mr. Vernon Shisler, manager of the exhibit and the Army's delegate to NATO in matters pertaining to \"The Soldier As A System.\" Mr. Shisler acknowledged not only that directed-energy weapons are in DoD's arsenal, but also that the American soldier will remain vulnerable to their effects, should they be employed in the battlefield. The U.S. Global Strategy Council recognizes the issue of vulnerability, as well, and urges ongoing research into effective countermeasures. Interested readers may want to send for the U.S. Global Strategy Council's complete project proposal on this subject: (Title: *Nonlethality: Development of a National Policy and Employing Nonlethal Means in a New Strategic Era*, prepared by Janet Morris). A number of references in this Proposal to unidentified, elusive \"enemies\" of the U.S. Government and to the potential domestic applications of this \"non-lethal\" technology invite serious consideration by the public at large.

Bioeffects of Microwave Radiation Research into the biological and psychological effects of exposure to microwave radiation is voluminous. The U.S. public has been led to believe that the former Soviet Union leads in this research. The fact is, the CIA and DoD [Department of Defense] have jointly pursued precisely the same research since commencement of Project Pandora in the 1950's. The current primary users of this research appear to be the CIA, DoD, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Energy (DoE). ** The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) has participated in this research since Project Pandora. In 1973, WRAIR discovered that externally-induced auditory input could be achieved by means of pulsed microwave audiograms, or analogs of spoken words' sounds. The effect on the receiving end is the (schizophrenic) sensation of \"hearing voices\" which are not part of the recipients' own thought processes. ** The experiment prompted the following comment in *The Body Electric: Electromagnetism and the Foundation of Life,* by Robert O. Becker, M.D., and Gary Selden (Wm. Morrow & Company, NY, 1985): \"Such a device has obvious applications in covert operations designed to drive a target crazy with 'voices' or deliver undetectable instructions to a programmed assassin.\" This research has continued, and the results are published in various publicly available scientific and technical journals. Interested readers might consult, for example: Lin, James C., *Electromagnetic Interaction With Biological Systems* (Plenum Press, NY, 1989). Professor Lin, then with the Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, has published a number of books and articles on this subject. [He has more recently informed us that he had designed the experiment referenced above in Dr. Becker's book.] WRAIR has more recently been studying the biological effects of exposure to high-power microwave radiation. WRAIR presented a paper on this subject to a DoD-sponsored symposium on \"MW [microwave] Weapons\" at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA, in mid-1989. A matter of interest to us is why WRAIR should be experimenting with auditory effects of pulsed microwave audiograms. Also, recent statements by an Army psychiatrist assigned to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) suggest that WRAIR may be experimenting upon select psychiatric inpatients with microwaves. This, too, is a matter of interest to us. Congressional Oversight The Government's past record of abuses in the area of civil rights is well documented.

This, too, is a matter of interest to us. Congressional Oversight The Government's past record of abuses in the area of civil rights is well documented. Within the past 30 years alone, we have witnessed the effects of Operations MKULTRA, MHCHAOS and COINTELPRO. Primarily because of MKULTRA, MHCHAOS and COINTELPRO, Executive Orders and implementing regulations were published which prohibited military and CIA domestic covert intelligence operations. Experiments on involuntary human subjects, and the surveillance of/collection of personal information on U.S. citizens, except under strictly regulated conditions were also prohibited. Congressional committees were created to oversee compliance with these (quasi‐) legal prohibitions. We have evidence that this is not being done. Moreover, where there are laws and, in this case, no laws enacted, there are loopholes, as well as individual and institutions who deliberately capitalize upon the existence of loopholes. Iran-Contra is one of the more blatant recent examples. Loopholes are also found in government resort to \"black\" intelligence and weapons programs, in the use of contractors, and in the absence of clear definitions of such terms as \"national security\" and \"national security risk.\" ** Executive Orders and regulations which currently limit official U.S. Intelligence activities do not extend to non-intelligence government agencies or to their contractors. In fact, Executive Order 12333 specifies that government contractors do not need to know that their services support U.S. Intelligence objectives. ** In its report of July 8, 1992, the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management addresses the problem of tracking funds granted to government-contracted research and development (R&D) centers. The report notes that the problem is compounded by DoD's penchant for creating hard-to-monitor \"shell\" contractors as disbursement centers for funding programs. ** ****Neither shell contractors nor their subcontractors are directly accountable to Congress. Being beyond Congressional oversight, they have the license to operate as Government surrogates in intelligence operations about which, \"officially\" they know nothing. ** In this context, a publication disseminated at DA's \"The Soldier As A System\" symposium noted that the Army's Research and Technology Program sponsors 42 laboratories and R&D centers, employing approximately 10,000 scientists and engineers. The annual budget of $1.3 billion is only a small part of overall DoD research spending. Weapons research, which includes the development and testing of \"non-lethal\" weapons, is not governed by laws restricting the activities of U.S. Intelligence agencies, though it may be presumed that these agencies contribute to and benefit from such research.

Neither Congress nor the courts appear willing to look closely into \"black\" intelligence and weapons procurement programs. 6. A number of U.S. Government agencies might have interest in testing directed-energy technologies on U.S. citizens under non-clinical/non-controlled circumstances-DoD, to test ranges and degrees of \"non-lethality\"; DoE, to explore \"safety\" limits; CIA, to test \"mind-control\" capabilities, and NSA, for technological refinement. PART II - OVERT AND COVERT HARASSMENT Since publication of the preceding article less than four months ago, the association of National Security Alumni/Electronic Surveillance Project has heard from an additional 13[*](#_ftn2) individuals who report both overt harassment and a range of symptoms which coincide with the known effects of exposure to microwaves, electromagnetic/radio frequency (RF) radiation and/or infrasound. The similarity of these symptoms will be addressed in greater detail in future Project reports. Suffice it to say, at this point, that the physical and psychological symptoms being reported to us are consistent with the effects which [directed-energy weapons](https://www.wanttoknow.info/nonlethalweaponsnewsarticles) are designed to produce. Indeed, the numerous afflictions (or \"inflictions\") being reported appear to parallel standard torture \"sequelae,\"[[1]](#_edn1) (aftereffects). Overt Harassment Overt Harassment-which obviously is *meant* to be observed-may be intended to \"precondition\" individuals for eventual long-term electronic harassment. Persons terrified by unexplained overt harassment are not likely to cope with the sudden onset of electronic harassment in any more reasoned fashion. This phased pattern of harassment is apparent in all of the cases now being investigated. **The fact that the overt harassment continues in these cases even after the electronic targeting commences suggests that the objective is to maintain long-term extremes of stress. ** Many of the overt harassment tactics discussed below are surfacing in cases which (so far) have *not* involved discernible forms of electronic harassment. These are cases involving so-called \"whistleblowers\" who, because of their inside knowledge of certain potentially newsworthy events, pose particular threats of embarrassment to the Government or to government-affiliated employers. We have noticed that electronic harassment is beginning to surface as a form of retaliation against persons who try to assist electronic \"harassees.\" Retaliation suggests loss of control.

Under the circumstances, we are not entirely confident that \"whistleblowers\" will continue to be exempted from this type of harassment in the long term. The individuals now in touch with the Project describe their circumstances as involving most, if not all, of the following overt forms of harassment: · Sudden, bizarrely-rude treatment, isolation and acts of harassment and vandalism by formerly friendly neighbors. · Harassing telephone calls, which continue even after the targeted individual obtains new, unlisted telephone numbers. · Mail interception, theft and tampering. · Noise campaigns. While unrelenting harassing telephone calls might be considered in this context, other tactics are employed. Blaring horns, whistles, sirens, garbage disposal (run concurrently in apartment settings, for excessively prolonged periods of time), and amplified transmissions of recorded \"general racket\" have been used on a recurrent basis under circumstances intended to persuade the individual that he or she is under surveillance. In all of these cases, the individuals' neighbors apparently pretend to be oblivious and/or indifferent to these sudden, continuous explosions of noise. Door slamming is also a popular pastime, particularly in apartment buildings. One individual reported that, during a peak period of harassment, the neighbor across the hall began entering and leaving his apartment every 10 minutes, slamming his door loudly on each occasion. This was a daily occurrence, encompassing periods of several hours, over a period of several months. It apparently served to trigger a door-slamming \"chain reaction\" on the part of neighbors both on that floor and on the floors immediately above and below. When our contact politely asked her immediate neighbor to close his door more quietly, he slammed the door in her face. Prior to commencement of this harassment, that neighbor had apparently been quite friendly and courteous. In another case, the primary door-slammer is an employee of Radix Systems, Inc., Rockville, MD, a DoD contractor engaged in the \"super-secret\" research and development of some type of electronic equipment. Several individuals reported recurrent, loud, strange noises in their ventilation systems during the preliminary stages of their harassment. One individual complained of being recurrently awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of wires being fed into his (independent) ventilation system. On checking further, he found that a tubular construction had been built into his vent system which appears to lead to the apartment upstairs. His upstairs neighbor is employed by the Department of Justice.

His upstairs neighbor is employed by the Department of Justice. A number of individuals report that occupants of upstairs and downstairs apartments appear to follow them from room to room, tapping on the floor or engaging in other activities which appear intended to advertise an ongoing surveillance. The Justice Department employee mentioned above went so far as to offer an unsolicited apology to her downstairs neighbor for the all-night \"pacing about\" in her bedroom (in the event he had happened to notice it). She claimed to be an insomniac. That pacing-about continued during her recent 36-hour absence from the area. When our contact politely alerted her to the fact that her apartment had apparently been entered during her absence, she told him, in effect, to mind his own business and then immediately complained to the building manager that he was stalking her. She conveniently forgot to inform the building manager that she had assiduously \"courted\" this individual for several months, without success; and that she had been stealing his newspapers on a regular basis. (On one occasion, she handed him a week's accumulation of those papers, claiming that they had been left outside the door of another apartment. Her reason for collecting and saving newspapers which had not been delivered to her directly is unknown.) · Recurrent confrontations by unusually hostile strangers; and comments by strangers which appear intended to evoke \"paranoid\" reactions. In this context, we note that several individuals have reported confrontations with \"homeless\" people who, on closer examination, were found to be fastidiously clean, though garbed in offbeat fashion (wigs included). The same \"eccentric\" confronted two of the individuals in contact with us, at separate distant locations. He is reported as having feigned mental illness on both occasions, and as having apparently enjoyed creating a public scene. · Entries into the individual's residence, during late-night hours while he/she is sleeping, and/or during the day when the individual is elsewhere. In virtually all such cases, the burglars leave evidence of their visits, such as by relocating objects, or by committing petty and not-so-petty acts of vandalism. In two cases, the burglar's \"calling card\" was to slaughter caged pets, leaving the mangled carcasses inside their locked cages. In one case, the burglar stole several pieces of correspondence and left a packet of crack cocaine behind as a \"calling card.\" Our contact in this case-an individual who has no criminal record and no history of experimentation with drugs-is also being harassed (stalked) by a police officer in her community. One of his recent acts was to \"frame\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:8:27a12d11403b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13463, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "vandalism. In two cases, the burglar's \"calling card\" was to slaughter caged pets, leaving the mangled carcasses inside their locked cages. In one case, the burglar stole several pieces of correspondence and left a packet of crack cocaine behind as a \"calling card.\" Our contact in this case-an individual who has no criminal record and no history of experimentation with drugs-is also being harassed (stalked) by a police officer in her community. One of his recent acts was to \"frame\" her with a drug possession charge. After pulling her off the road (a frequent pastime) and subjecting her to an illegal search (done, twice, so far), he conveniently managed to find a glassine packet of cocaine eight feet away, in front of his squad car. He retrieved the packet with his fingers and then charged her with Possession. Our contact found the packet of crack cocaine in her apartment shortly after this investigator reminded the attorney handling her case that the police officer had smudged his only piece of evidence with his own fingerprints. It would appear that someone is interested in correcting that police officer's oversight. In another case, the individual reports that a tremendous amount of money had been stolen from a hiding place in her apartment, within hours after she had withdrawn the money from her bank. There were no obvious signs of entry into her apartment. The police conducted a cursory inquiry which failed to produce evidence of a crime worthy of investigation. (This case is an anomaly. Money is not usually stolen. Documents appear to be the preferred objects of theft, when thefts occur.) In another case, the burglars replaced installed lightbulbs with \"exploding\" bulbs, many of which were *Made in Hungary.* The lightbulbs are now in our possession. · Rapidly deteriorating health, generally of a digestive nature. In two cases of the cases reported, massive rectal bleeding accompanied the sudden onset of severe gastrointestinal disturbances. One of these individuals abruptly terminated the deteriorative process simply by changing the locks on her door. · Sleep disruption/deprivation. This is achieved by means of both overt and electronic harassment. Sleep deprivation, as a tactic, invariably surfaces when the targeted individual begins exhibiting a strong emotional and irrational response to the other forms of harassment. · Vandalism of privately-owned vehicles. Vehicles invite peculiarly ferocious attacks in these harassment campaigns-slashed tires, smashed windows, oil drainage, oil contamination, destruction of electronic components and batteries (frequently involving wildly fluctuating, grounded fuel gages, often within range of weapons research facilities and/or other microwave emitters); and suddenly failed brakes and clutches (possibly involving anti-traction polymers, which are also in DoD's \"non-lethal\" weapons arsenal). Recurrent auto thefts have also been reported. Two individuals reported finding their oil contaminated immediately after having the oil changed by reputable mechanics.

Recurrent auto thefts have also been reported. Two individuals reported finding their oil contaminated immediately after having the oil changed by reputable mechanics. In one of these cases, the oil viscosified (thickened) while the individual was driving through a remote rural area. Her car ground to a halt. Getting the \"gunk\" cleaned out of her engine proved to be an expensive ordeal. (Viscosification agents are also lauded by the U.S. Global Strategy Council as serving \"non-lethal\" strategic purposes-a topic discussed in Part I of this publication. Had this woman been assaulted while awaiting help in the said isolated area, the \"non-lethal\" attributes of viscosification agents might have required redefinition.) Most of those who have experienced these attacks on a recurring basis have abandoned driving all together-an objective apparently sought by their tormentors as a means of increasing their isolation. · Staged accidents. The majority of those in touch with us have reported these types of experiences. One individual, for example, was tailgated at a high rate of speed by two vehicles, while concurrently being threatened with a gun by one of the vehicles' occupants. Two others narrowly avoided what appeared to be deliberately attempted collisions by drivers who quickly sped away from the scene. One avoided three attempts in four days at being run off the road. One survived being run off the road in two incidents within a one-week period, which resulted in \"totaling\" of her two vehicles. Another narrowly avoided being crushed into an expressway retaining wall, on four occasions, by an off-duty metro bus, as well as, within the same time frame, being \"fried\" by two suddenly-malfunctioned household appliances which subsequently repaired themselves. It should be noted that, in some of these cases, \"accidental\" deaths do occur. One individual in contact with us reported that his mother drove off a cliff to her death, during a period when he was researching evidence that a still-respected, high level State Department official had passed A-bomb secrets to the Soviet Government during World War II. The accident occurred shortly after her car had undergone routine maintenance. She was returning from a dental appointment when the accident occurred. Witnesses state that it appeared that she had suddenly stepped on the accelerator before running off the road. The accident served to terminate this person's research project. We are also currently looking into the recent death of a woman in Lexington, MO, who was killed when the brakes on her tractor failed. We are informed that she had been collecting affidavits from persons who believe they are the targets of government harassment and experimentation when her \"accident\" occurred. We are also informed that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:10:43de3fa1b801", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13465, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "it appeared that she had suddenly stepped on the accelerator before running off the road.

We are informed that she had been collecting affidavits from persons who believe they are the targets of government harassment and experimentation when her \"accident\" occurred. We are also informed that those affidavits have disappeared. **Suicides might also qualify as \"staged accidents,\" particularly where \"plausibly deniable\" government involvement has been surfaced. **We are currently looking into the recent suicide of a man in Trappe, PA, who, as early as 1981, had asked the FBI and CIA to intervene in his case. We have copies of that early correspondence. The man, a former U.S. Army radar technician, had a highly technical and-given the date of his correspondence-\"precocious\" grasp of the experimental objectives apparently being sought in his case. It is apparent from his correspondence that he had wanted to believe that the Soviets were conducting these experiments. The FBI and CIA, of course, did not intervene. We are informed that members of his family have also been targets of this experimentation. · Isolation of* *the individual from members of his/her immediate family-virtually assured when highly focused forms of electronic harassment commence. The exception to this is when elderly parents and young children in the family become targets for apparent purposes of intimidation. This situation has been reported in eight of our cases, to date. One individual (driven to extremes of stress by ongoing electronic harassment focusing on her children) killed one child in an effort to protect her from further pain.[[2]](#_edn2) It appears that lasers were being used in this individual's case. The targeting intensified after she called the Soviet Embassy to report the harassment, which she believed to be U.S. Government-sponsored. It became even more deadly when, in a further show of defiance, she then called the representative of the Iraqi Government to portray the U.S. Government's war in the Middle East as \"hypocritical.\" She is now hospitalized in a midwestern psychiatric facility, where, apparently, the experimentation is now continuing. (That psychiatric facility is in a State where a disproportionate number of complaints of electronic harassment are beginning to surface. It is also within range of a U.S. Air Force base which houses a \"super secret\" research facility. We are currently looking into information that spouses and children of persons employed on that USAF base may be the targets of involuntary experimentation involving directed-energy weapons technologies.) Another individual, during a telephone conversation, was told by an employee of a local power company that, if she valued the lives of her children, she would drop her public opposition to the company's installation of high power lines. Since receiving that threat, the individual's", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:11:e824a60669f0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13466, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "which houses a \"super secret\" research facility. We are currently looking into information that spouses and children of persons employed on that USAF base may be the targets of involuntary experimentation involving directed-energy weapons technologies.) Another individual, during a telephone conversation, was told by an employee of a local power company that, if she valued the lives of her children, she would drop her public opposition to the company's installation of high power lines. Since receiving that threat, the individual's 11-year-old daughter has been reduced to extremes of pain, resulting in her recurrent hospitalization for treatment of illnesses which cannot be diagnosed. It is now also apparent to this individual that her three-year-old son is on the receiving end of externally-induced auditory input. (DoE figures prominently in this case.) · Progressive financial impoverishment, brought on by termination of the individual's employment, and compounded by expenses associated with the harassment. ** The majority of those now in contact with the Project-educated, white-collar professionals-have lost their jobs. Termination of employment in many of these cases involved prefatory harassment by the employer and co-workers, which coincided with the other overt forms of harassment discussed above. ** The overt harassment tactics are being described as recurrent, non-sequential and overlapping. As noted above, the overt harassment continues even after the electronic harassment commences. Failure of \"Establishment\" Support Systems Those individuals who have tried to resolve their respective situations through resort to \"establishment\" channels have invariably encountered the following: · Apathy, indifference and/or professed helplessness on the part of members of Congress and state legislators. · Dismissal and/or attempted discrediting by psychiatrists who refuse to include the terms, \"government harassment,\" \"mind-control experimentation\" and \"torture\" in their vocabulary. **Several individuals, thinking that psychiatrists might help to alleviate the extreme stress associated with their harassment, were accorded \"treatment\" which clearly pointed to cooperation between their psychiatrists and members of the U.S. Intelligence community. One such psychiatrist, in fact, bragged about being a member of the U.S. Intelligence \"inner circle,\" informing our contact that her harassment was a \"Pavlovian Experiment,\" intended to \"break\" her. ** · Lack of interest, courage and/or competency in legal circles. Few of those in contact with us have been able to acquire legal assistance-not helped by their straitened financial circumstances. Most have found that few attorneys are willing to risk their careers by pursuing cases involving what is believed to be government-sponsored harassment and experimentation. A few attorneys reportedly engaged in egregious violations of codes of professional conduct, in what appear to have been deliberate efforts at sabotaging our contacts' cases. Subsequent attempts by two individuals at obtaining legal redress were met with stonewalling, obstruction, and high-level denials of wrongdoing. · Refusal of the mass media to address this topic, except in those cases where suspected experimentees have been driven to the point of committing murder or suicide. Such cases (particularly where an individual", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:12:aaec3ecfeccb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13467, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "experimentation. A few attorneys reportedly engaged in egregious violations of codes of professional conduct, in what appear to have been deliberate efforts at sabotaging our contacts' cases. Subsequent attempts by two individuals at obtaining legal redress were met with stonewalling, obstruction, and high-level denials of wrongdoing. · Refusal of the mass media to address this topic, except in those cases where suspected experimentees have been driven to the point of committing murder or suicide. Such cases (particularly where an individual has claimed to be the victim of CIA-directed mind-control involving auditory input) are treated by the press as \"curiosities.\" An example of this is the individual who shot a Navy officer outside the Pentagon in mid-1991.[[3]](#_edn3) He claimed to be a victim of CIA mind control, involving auditory input. According to the press, \"he worried 'about being run over by trains'...\" (ref. incident described in following paragraph). He is now permanently residing in a psychiatric facility. He, being institutionalized, and others in the preliminary stages of his predicament are no longer of interest to the media. Another recent case which received short-lived press attention[[4]](#_edn4) involved a woman diagnosed as having \"suffered from periods of confusion\" who climbed over a fence onto a railroad track and walked into an oncoming train. Because the incident occurred in a community in which an unusually large number of these mind-control experiments have been reported, we are looking into the situation. The woman was reportedly \"under a physician's care\" because of her \"periods of confusion.\" A family member described the physician to this investigator as \"a psychiatrist.\" We find that the alleged \"psychiatrist\" is a General Practitioner, otherwise non-accredited, practicing out of his home. We find also that the suicide may have been witnessed under peculiarly-timed circumstances by an alleged \"homeless\" person who has since disappeared. Needless to say, our interest has been whetted. · Refusal and/or inability of local police to intervene. The tendency of local police is to dismiss an individual's complaints of government harassment as the ravings of a \"fruitcake.\" In one case, discussed above, it is apparent that one police officer is actively cooperating in the harassment.** Some police agencies, while acknowledging the reality of the situation, hesitate to intervene in cases involving what they believe to be U.S. Intelligence. **On a few occasions, certain police officials did attempt to intervene, based on what they perceived to be evidence of a systematic harassment/illegal surveillance campaign. Absent a clear mandate to prosecute \"stalkers\" acting under the aegis of U.S. Intelligence, the police obviously had their hands tied. · Refusal of the FBI to intervene in any of the cases brought to our attention thus far. FBI spokesmen do acknowledge that they have received a large number of requests for assistance from \"mentally disturbed persons\" who believe that they are being \"zapped by radio waves\" and/or \"are hearing voices...\" \"from Mars, that is.\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:13:5927a09bcc6a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13468, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "systematic harassment/illegal surveillance campaign. Absent a clear mandate to prosecute \"stalkers\" acting under the aegis of U.S. Intelligence, the police obviously had their hands tied. · Refusal of the FBI to intervene in any of the cases brought to our attention thus far. FBI spokesmen do acknowledge that they have received a large number of requests for assistance from \"mentally disturbed persons\" who believe that they are being \"zapped by radio waves\" and/or \"are hearing voices...\" \"from Mars, that is.\" In one case, an FBI spokesman reacted in an angry, defensive and bizarre fashion when our contact briefly alluded to PROJECT SLAMMER as possibly being related to her surveillance. (PROJECT SLAMMER is a CIA-funded study, managed by CIA and FBI behavioral scientist, which explores the \"mental make-up\" of alleged security risks, along with their family members and close associates. Participants in PROJECT SLAMMER include NSA, DIA, and Army, Navy and Air Force Intelligence.) Until PROJECT SLAMMER was mentioned, the FBI spokesman's approach in this case was to politely and redundantly explain that the law, as currently constructed, prevents the FBI's intervening in this individual's case. When she briefly pointed out that the surveillance activities might fall under the purview of PROJECT SLAMMER, the spokesman's response was to abruptly and angrily declaim, \"**You** don't know who is conducting that surveillance! **You** don't know if that is a state police surveillance! ...or a local police surveillance! It could be a totally unrelated operation! **You** don't know who is conducting that surveillance! [etc., etc.]!\" It was apparent from this response that the FBI was at least acknowledging the existence of a surveillance, if in somewhat emotional fashion. The individual in question subsequently furnished acquired evidence to the local police, who made it clear that they are not participants in the surveillance which, based on the evidence, pointedly suggest that our contact is the target. · Refusal or inability of the ACLU and Amnesty International to intervene. Both organizations acknowledge receiving many complaints from persons claiming to be the targets of some type of electronic harassment. An ACLU spokes-woman characterized the complaints as appearing to be rational, except in a few cases. The complaints are not being investigated, she said, because of \"limited resources.\" We have to wonder, of course, why the ACLU could recently find resources to defend the rights of prostitutes and the Ku Klux Klan, yet remains incapable of intervening in cases such as we are now pursuing. Amnesty International recently informed one of our contacts that they could not intervene in her case because their focus is on the U.S. Government's treatment of prison inmates. While incarceration does appear to be one sought-for objective in these harassment/mind control experiments, we would like to think that protections by such organizations as Amnesty International can be achieved beforehand.

Related Covert Methodologies The persons engaged in this harassment tend to become careless, possibly the result of arrogance born of an assumption that nobody can stop them. \"Harassees\" who have noted this carelessness have furnished us with the following insights into the covert side of these harassment activities. · Impersonation of military officers. One individual found that her next-door neighbor had claimed to be a military intelligence officer, assigned to a space technology unit in California, on year-long \"TDY\" (temporary duty) in the individual's apartment building. It was subsequently determined that this alleged officer is not in fact a member of the U.S. Armed Forces; and that he had used this bogus status to acquire information from a major defense contractor. Our contact is certain that this person's apartment was used as a base of harassment operations. · Use of concealment devices, and emitters detected to date. Several individuals and supportive associates report having seen some of the electronic devices being used in these harassment campaigns. One saw electronic equipment concealed inside a false-front upright piano being moved out of her apartment building. She had previously noted that all of her surrounding neighbors had identical upright pianos in their apartments, not one of which was ever played. Other suspected participants in the harassment may be concealing devices in oversized stereo speakers, measuring approximately 5' in height x 3' x 3'. Several of our contacts have noted the presence of such speakers in adjacent dwellings. One individual was told by a resident of her building that her upstairs neighbor has \"microwave ovens\" in his bedroom and livingroom, but none in the kitchen. Another individual, while standing outside, looked into her neighbor's window to find that her bedroom appeared to be the target of a gray-colored, elongated box-like device, measuring approximately 1' in length x 5\" in height (side view). A large, black-framed lens protruded from the end facing her window. The electrical cord, if any, was not visible from that vantage point. The equipment was being operated by a stranger in a three-piece suit, who appeared to be quite startled to find that he was being observed. Another was given strong reason to believe that portable emitters are being concealed in oversized, extremely heavy, sometimes expandable \"briefcases\" for use in places of public assembly, such as meeting halls, auditoriums and restaurants. Smaller varieties are apparently being used on aircraft.

Smaller varieties are apparently being used on aircraft. On one 3-hour flight, our contact noticed that the man sitting next to her seemed peculiarly intent on keeping the attaché case on his lap propped open with his fingertips, while he gazed \"blankly\" into the distance during the entire flight. She believed that she was being electronically harassed while on the flight (a common complaint, in most of the cases now being investigated). Our contact reports that, when they prepared to land, the man opened his attaché case to hastily check its contents, thus disclosing the presence of a raised, built-in \"concealment device\" covering the entire bottom surface of the attaché case. The low-slung, lift-off cover did not appear to be capable of concealing a laptop computer. At one point during the flight -apparently aware that his \"reverie\" was inviting attention, -the man devoted approximately ten minutes to scribbling assorted entries on a sheet of lined paper, which he had placed on top of his briefcase two hours previously. He devoted roughly ten minutes to the effort (obviously preferring a pen to a laptop computer). His attaché case remained ajar during this process.[[5]](#_edn5) One individual reports that mobile emitters may be installed in certain oversized, non-attributable medical emergency vehicles, possibly for eventual use in civil disturbances. Her unsuccessful attempts at following the \"medical emergency\" vehicle which had surfaced in her case ended with a high-speed chase. The phony military intelligence officer, when recently moving out of our contact's apartment building, was found to possess a device which resembles an oversized microwave oven, measuring approximately 4' in width x 2' in height x 2 1/2' in depth. A subsequent examination of his apartment revealed that he had tapped numerous additional lines into existing, in-house telephone and TV cables; and that he had gone to great pains to conceal a major excavation into one wall abutting the \"harassee's.\" Judging from photographs taken immediately after this person's departure, the wiring suggests that he was hooked by modem into a computer network, and that at least some of his electronic equipment was situated in a large walk-in closet, again abutting the \"harassee's.\" When the alleged officer moved out, his equipment (except for the oversized \"microwave oven\") was packaged in boxes identifying the contents only as stereo components. During his year-long residency in this building, no sounds emanated from his apartment to indicate use of this \"stereo\" equipment. · Use of modified license plates and vehicle look-alikes. Some individuals have noted that their neighbors' vehicles are periodically replaced (during peak", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:16:d13eac8b654b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13471, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "electronic equipment was situated in a large walk-in closet, again abutting the \"harassee's.\" When the alleged officer moved out, his equipment (except for the oversized \"microwave oven\") was packaged in boxes identifying the contents only as stereo components. During his year-long residency in this building, no sounds emanated from his apartment to indicate use of this \"stereo\" equipment. · Use of modified license plates and vehicle look-alikes. Some individuals have noted that their neighbors' vehicles are periodically replaced (during peak periods of harassment) by others which qualify as \"rough look-alikes.\" The tags on these latter closely resemble those on the homeowners' vehicles, with a difference being noted in only one digit or one letter. These modified plates appear to have been acquired through State DMV channels, thus suggesting government/intelligence agency involvement. In one case, where the individual has obtained police assistance, tracking of one plate surfaced evidence of a drug connection. That plate rapidly disappeared from the vehicle in question, to be replaced by another, again bearing a one-letter modification. · Use of neighbors' residences as bases of operation and training. One individual recently saw a team of \"technicians\" in the house behind hers-a consequence of the team's failure to close the curtains and/or dim lighting when puttering around in the kitchen at 5:00 in the morning. The three men (strangers to this individual, all stripped down to their T-shirts) behaved as if they were unaware that they were being watched. Their observer had long suspected that this house was being used as a base of electronic harassment operations. The harassment had been ongoing throughout the night. To provoke a response from these men, the individual eventually commented aloud on their activities. They responded immediately by turning the lights off and switching to the use of flashlights. Why they failed to close the curtains is unknown. This individual is working with the police in an effort at ending this surveillance and harassment, with mixed results. * * * Another individual, paying a surprise visit to the apartment upstairs, overheard one of her own telephone conversations being played on a tape recorder inside that apartment. Lacking both a legitimate pretext to enter the apartment and the support of the building's management personnel and/or the police, she was prevented from pursuing this further. Her upstairs neighbor is purportedly employed by Stanford University Hospital, in Stanford, CA. The target of surveillance and harassment in this case is still *also* trying to recover from the effects of exposure to potentially lethal doses of radiation, administered in the 1970's by a dangerously \"incompetent\" dentist. This might explain the involvement of alleged Stanford University Hospital personnel in her situation. **The government is on record as having experimented on unwitting U.S. citizens with radioactive materials during the 1970's (and earlier).****[[6]](#_edn6) **The House Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce based their investigation into this matter on a 30-year accumulation", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:17:b8919a07e5e2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13472, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "in this case is still *also* trying to recover from the effects of exposure to potentially lethal doses of radiation, administered in the 1970's by a dangerously \"incompetent\" dentist.

Under the circumstances, it will come as no surprise if it is ultimately found that DoE has been involved in this woman's surveillance and harassment. * * * Another individual paid a surprise visit to the apartment immediately beneath hers, in an attempt to identify the source of a tremendous racket in her ventilation system. Standing outside the door, she could hear an individual moving around, a short distance from the door. She also heard the sound of rustling paper and the steady, sonar-like \"pinging\" of some type of electronic device. In response to her repeated knockings on the door, the person inside simply stopped moving about. The sound of rustling paper (perhaps a printout of some type) and the steady \"...pin-ng! ...pin-ng!\" sound continued. The occupant of this apartment resumed moving about only after it was (incorrectly) believed that our contact had departed the area. Typically, this situation could not be pursued further. * * * All of those who live in apartment buildings report unusual patterns of occupancy in the apartments surrounding their own; i.e., upstairs, downstairs and on all sides. They have become quite convinced-if only because of the highly focused nature of the symptoms being experienced-that these surrounding apartments are being used as bases of operation. Perhaps this encirclement facilitates studies of holographic human telemetries; or perhaps it is intended to increase the prospect of brain entrainment by electronic means (\"entrainment\" being one published objective sought in mind control experiments).[[7]](#_edn7) In examining this situation more closely, a number of individuals have found that surrounding apartments are either permanently vacant, for unknown reasons, or that they have been \"sub-let\" by the original occupants to persons who are purportedly unknown to the buildings' management personnel. In one case, the surrounding renters all list two residences in the local telephone book. Not one lives in the apartment building in question, though the address is identified as one of the renters' places of residence. One individual suspects that the original occupants of apartments surrounding hers have simply been relocated to other apartments in the same (large) building. Another suspects that an adjacent apartment, which has been permanently rented to the U.S. Government for use by \"visitors\" is also being used as a base of operations. One individual found that an immediate neighbor's housemate has the same (unusual) name of a university professor", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:18:8d3c9360dee9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13473, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "the address is identified as one of the renters' places of residence.

One individual found that an immediate neighbor's housemate has the same (unusual) name of a university professor who has engaged in extensive research on behalf of the government, studying the bioeffects of exposure to microwave radiation. · Use of informants/*agents provocateurs,* frequently members of the opposite sex. As noted in the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Interior and Insular Affair's draft report, *Alyeska Pipeline Service Company Covert Operation* (July 1992), the Wackenhut Corporation's Special Investigations Division adopted this tactic when pursuing Alyeska's critics. ** A number of individuals in touch with us report a range of experiences with new \"friends\" who-apparently posing as confidants-used acquired personalia to abruptly end these \"friendships\" under deliberately degrading and humiliating circumstances. When taken in the context of the ongoing surveillances and harassment, these exercises appear intended to heighten emotional trauma, perhaps to provoke an uncontrolled response and/or to enforce isolation. ** · Misuse of covert intelligence personnel (possible former case officers). One individual, while under contract to the U.S. Government, properly reported what he believed to be an approach by a hostile intelligence service. Within a few weeks, alleged U.S. Intelligence officers contacted this individual. In addition to questioning him about his background, these alleged intelligence officers asked that he keep in constant touch with them, particularly when planning to travel. It soon became apparent that the alleged intelligence officers were intent only on forcing this individual to report to them as directed, and to account for his activities. He was not asked to assist the U.S. Government in any form of intelligence operation; he was not asked to execute any form of secrecy affirmation statement acknowledging the classified nature of these meetings; nor was he told why these meetings-involving a total of seven alleged case officers-were necessary. When he began to balk at a continuation of this process, one of his \"handlers\" conveyed a threat, suggesting that his continued compliance might be \"enforced.\" Finally, when this individual adamantly refused to cooperate further, massive overt harassment commenced and is currently ongoing. The operation (clearly intended to bully this individual into submissive compliance for purposes which are still unknown) involved crude tactics formerly prized by the KGB. Whether or not legitimate U.S. Intelligence case officers were involved in this activity remains to be determined. Some private firms retain former U.S. Intelligence case officers for contracting out as \"security specialist.\" The founder and CEO of one such firm (Gerald P. Burke, The Parvus Company, Silver Spring, MD) has informed us that the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:19:a746ed8670b7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13474, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 20, "text": "ongoing.

Burke, The Parvus Company, Silver Spring, MD) has informed us that the activities of contract case officers are neither monitored nor subject to formal restraint. · Use of psychotropic drugs by cooperative physicians. Shortly after resigning from the CIA, one of our contacts underwent a range of experiences which suggested that she had been massively drugged. One of the alleged perpetrators, whom we have met, alternately claims to be employed by NASA and/or by a firm in Miami, handling, \"microwave equipment.\" NASA has no record of this person under the name furnished. The \"experimentee\" ultimately sought the assistance of a psychiatrist, whom her parents had located as a referral. The psychiatrist treated her reported \"flashbacks\" by immediately placing her on a regimen of Stelazine, which quickly aggravated her condition. He also made comments to this individual which suggested that he had a foreknowledge of her situation, and that he was cooperating with U.S. Intelligence. On one occasion the psychiatrist intimated that our contact might be employable as an assassin; and he repeatedly urged her to move to Great Britain where, he said, she would be put in touch with an unidentified Member of Parliament. Interestingly, he had a tremendous computer system in his office suite, which he explained as being connected by modem into a national level system which, in turn, connected into private residences. When showing her this equipment, this psychiatrist informed our contact that she had been \"CAT scanned,\" pointing out that she was the subject of the vast series of \"A's\" and \"B's\" being printed out by one of the many terminals at his disposal. Our contact also found that this psychiatrist kept a military uniform in his closet which bore the rank and insignia of a three-star general. The individual ultimately sought psychiatric support elsewhere. Her new psychiatrist, formerly employed by DoD, immediately put her on a regimen of Haldol Decanoate, Klonopin and Benzatropine. The combined effect of these drugs was loss of memory and a state of mind which, under other circumstances, might be diagnosed as Depersonalization or Dissociative Disorder. All three drugs proved to be highly addictive. Our contact, since severing contact with this psychiatrist as well, has finally successfully overcome the addiction. * * * Another individual-the one whose psychiatrist had informed her of her role in a \"Pavlovian Experiment\"-was subjected to attempted drugging by Trazodone, one of the strongest sedatives on the market. The psychiatrist in question kept no record of the individual's outpatient", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:20:8be11fbbeb3c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13475, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "mind which, under other circumstances, might be diagnosed as Depersonalization or Dissociative Disorder.

Our contact, since severing contact with this psychiatrist as well, has finally successfully overcome the addiction. * * * Another individual-the one whose psychiatrist had informed her of her role in a \"Pavlovian Experiment\"-was subjected to attempted drugging by Trazodone, one of the strongest sedatives on the market. The psychiatrist in question kept no record of the individual's outpatient visits, nor of her Trazodone prescriptions. Being unaware that the individual was not adhering to his regimen, the psychiatrist urged her to rapidly increase her dosage, renewing her 30-day prescription after a period of only 11 days. Though aware of her heart condition, he failed to monitor her condition, dismissing her complaints of (electronically-induced) pains in her heart as inconsequential. Trazodone is known to aggravate heart conditions. Perhaps the intent was to have this individual succumb to a \"heart attack\" as the result of \"imagined\" government harassment. Neither the appropriate psychiatric society nor the FBI would touch this case. * * * Another individual (a clear target of retaliation) sought medical assistance to counter sudden massive headaches and recurrent attacks of vomiting-effects which can be produced by infrasound. The physician to whom she was referred (an alleged specialist in Internal Medicine) placed her on a combination of Compazine and Xanax, prescribing dosages which the Physicians' Desk Reference warns against. Compazine, in addition to being an anti-emetic, is used in the treatment of psychotic disorders. It can also cause tardive dyskinesia, an irreversible syndrome involving loss of motor control. Xanax is known to induce vomiting. Both drugs can lead to dependency and a worsening of the patient's condition. The effects of all such drugs, in fact, can be mutated in high-energy fields, thus increasing the likelihood of adverse reactions. We have recently found that this prescribing \"physician\" is not licensed to practice medicine in the State in which she has been practicing since at least 1989. Our contact, being concerned about the long-term effects of Xanax and Compazine, consulted another physician in that same office. This physician immediately prescribed Prozac, failing to concurrently recommend that her patient discontinue the Xanax and Compazine prescriptions. When our contact refused to take any psychotropic drugs, the doctor became upset and asked, \"Don't you want to get well?\" This second physician is a licensed practitioner in Internal Medicine, with no background in Psychiatry. We have also found that she apparently refers her patients to yet a third physician in the office who claims to be a psychiatrist. She, too, is licensed to practice Internal Medicine, only. Her receptionist described this third physician as having a psychiatric \"sub-specialty,\" ... \"as an internist.\" The receptionist also informed us that this internist \"is treating a number of psychiatric patients.\" On pursuing this further, we find that these physicians", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:21:adcaf0c9ceea", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13476, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "in Internal Medicine, with no background in Psychiatry.

Her receptionist described this third physician as having a psychiatric \"sub-specialty,\" ... \"as an internist.\" The receptionist also informed us that this internist \"is treating a number of psychiatric patients.\" On pursuing this further, we find that these physicians are in a small \"medical group\" which is not listed by specialty in standard regional telephone directories. The group bears the same name as one of the CIA's most infamous recruited physicians (perhaps best described as \"the Mengele of MKULTRA\"). The doctor's offices are located in a bank building, which, we have found, is a favored hiding place for security-oriented businesses and government agencies. Two computer firms, co-located with an attorney who represents \"Island Resort Development, Ltd.,\" are situated immediately beneath the doctors' offices. The prospect of our finding island resort developments within 500 miles of this attorney's office is limited. Our contact, being apprised of these findings, is seeking medical help elsewhere. * * * In two of our cases, urologists took it upon themselves to play the role of \"psychiatrist\"; i.e., they rendered psychiatric diagnoses and prescribed psychotropic drugs. One of these urologists, employed by The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, prescribed Haldol, informing our contact that he perceived her to be \"psychotic.\" His efforts at getting a Clinic psychiatrist to confirm this diagnosis were unsuccessful. The psychiatrist, apparently a rare individual who subscribes to codes of medical ethics, found nothing wrong with this woman, even given the nature of her complaints. The urologist's response to this was to issue his own Haldol prescription. Sensing that something was amiss, the woman refused to have the prescription filled. * * * Yet another individual ended up in the hands of a psychiatrist who, as a purported means of ending the stress associated with her harassment, offered to put her under hypnosis. She described the hypnotic state as \"equivalent to floating\" and (based on her overall experiences with this physician) has not ruled out the possibility that drugs may have been surreptitiously administered. The psychiatrist claimed to be interested in psychic phenomena and demonstrated an apparently remarkable ability to read this individual's mind. While in her \"hypnotic state, the individual felt a sharp, painful pressure inside her nose, as if something were being shoved up her nostrils to the sinus cavities. She awoke to find blood pouring out of her nostrils. The psychiatrist casually dismissed this as owing to a probable cold. Shortly after that experience, the individual began to hear loud tones in her head, followed in due coarse by auditory input. Brain scans have failed to yield evidence of an implanted device.

Shortly after that experience, the individual began to hear loud tones in her head, followed in due coarse by auditory input. Brain scans have failed to yield evidence of an implanted device. (We have recommended that she undergo a scan by means of a suitably adapted non-linear junction detector, as a preliminary.) Suffice it to say, this individual has severed contact with the psychiatrist and is continuing to cope with ongoing overt and electronic harassment by other non-medical means. · Use of medical implant devices. The situation just described is not our first encounter with the apparent use of medical implant devices in these harassment/mind-control cases. Another of our contacts began receiving auditory input roughly 15 years after she had 4 mm. cochlear implants placed in her ears. The \"voices\" claimed to be affiliated with the CIA and, among other things, expressed intentions of running this woman as an agent in denied areas by \"piggybacking\" their audio transmissions onto standard FM frequencies to avoid detection. We have been unable to locate the surgeon who implanted these devices, though we do have a copy of his operative reports. A recent CAT scan of this individual failed to disclose the presence of the cochlear implants. Several years ago, the individual (now a psychologist) applied for a position with the CIA. She was interviewed by four Langley-based, purported psychologist, who allegedly informed her that her job would involve the assessment of certain criminals for purposes of weighing their prospects for loyalty to this agency. During these interviews, she was told to read several books by such persons as Philip Agee, Stansfield Turner and Ralph McGehee, all of whom were unknown to her. The alleged psychologist claimed that these authors had described the CIA \"as it really is.\" Our contact was not asked to execute a secrecy affirmation statement acknowledging the classified nature of these proceedings. The unconventional manner of this interview process suggests that this individual was being toyed with, for reasons which remain to be determined. She did not get the job and in fact more recently lost her job with a state penitentiary. She was fired on the recommendation of the prison's psychiatrist, because of her insistence that she is receiving auditory input from CIA personnel who persist in feeding her classified information. Interestingly, though this individual was deemed unfit to function as a psychologist in the penitentiary system, the State has rehired her, assigning her to a mental health facility where, apparently, she is to develop a behavioral modification program for retarded adults with diagnosed mental illnesses. This individual claimed to be receiving and responding to externally-induced auditory", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:23:0a169336b0d1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13478, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "of the prison's psychiatrist, because of her insistence that she is receiving auditory input from CIA personnel who persist in feeding her classified information.

This individual claimed to be receiving and responding to externally-induced auditory \"advice\" while working with prison inmates. It may be presumed that the process will continue. Under the circumstances, we have to wonder if this case qualifies as a benchmark in mind-control experimentation; i.e., employment of a mind-controlled psychologist to run the equivalent of mind-control experiments on mentally-ill retarded adults. We will continue to monitor the situation. * * * The individual whom we previously identified as having challenged a local power company also appears to have been \"tagged\" by some type of implant device. During a recent symposium, she was approached by a man whose business card identifies him as \"Program Manager, Electromagnetic Radiation Division,\" DoE. His approach was suitably sympathetic. Our contact ultimately accepted the man's invitation to continue discussing their common ranges of interest in his hotel room. During this meeting, she accepted the offer of a drink, blacked out after consuming it, and awoke four hours later, still in this man's hotel room, to find that the back of her ear had been punctured and was bleeding. There was no evidence of a sexual assault. The man glibly evaded this woman's requests for an explanation. She has since found two adjacent puncture marks behind her ear, which are not healing properly, and between which she can feel the presence of a \"wire\" measuring approximately 1/4\" in length. We are pursuing this further. The said DoE Project Manager has more recently initiated contact with yet another activist in touch with this Association. His call was unsolicited. He apparently wanted to know if this woman would be attending an upcoming conference. We have warned the individual to avoid any form of private meeting with the said Project Manager. * * * To date, we are aware of three cases involving clandestine behavior on the part of alleged DoE employees. The CIA figures prominently (if peculiarly) in the majority of our other cases. Two of those have been discussed above. In another, also involving auditory input, the individual is certain that the current Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) participated in the \"voice transmission\" process on at least one occasion. She claims to have recognized his voice. When she commented aloud on the DCI's perceived involvement in this experimentation, the \"voice\" responded with stuttered and stammered denials. We are told that this particular \"voice\" has not been heard from since. * * * In yet another case involving auditory input, the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:24:124fd92b377a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13479, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "In another, also involving auditory input, the individual is certain that the current Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) participated in the \"voice transmission\" process on at least one occasion.

We are told that this particular \"voice\" has not been heard from since. * * * In yet another case involving auditory input, the individual has allegedly been informed by her \"voices\" that the technologies being used against her were stolen from the CIA by a maverick employee, whose group is now targeting her from a distance of 2,000 miles. She reported this to the DCI's office and was allegedly informed by the Deputy DCI that she will be awarded millions of dollars if she can produce the equipment and any of the personnel involved in her harassment. One unusually-candid CIA spokesman also allegedly informed this individual that, \"while the CIA does not deny having this equipment,\" they \"do not use it in this country.\" Perhaps this explains why a number of our contacts have also been electronically harassed while traveling overseas. This woman has also been repeatedly assured by CIA DDS (security) personnel of the Agency's sincere concern for her welfare. During a recent telephone conversation with that Office, we confirmed that she is indeed known to the CIA. Based on this, we asked that the Agency \"put its money where its mouth is,\" so to speak, by conducting a long-term electronic sweep of this individual's premises. That was two months ago. No sweep has been conducted, though CIA spokesmen continue to \"sympathize\" with her predicament. * * * Another individual, a target of harassment and experimentation since 1952 (apparently singled out because of his student activism while at Penn State University) began hearing \"voices\" after having most of his teeth capped. He has more recently been informed by his \"handlers\" that implanted devices are no longer used for purposes of inducing auditory input. No explanation was offered. He was quite visibly surprised when informed by this investigator that auditory input can be achieved solely by means of pulsed microwave audiograms (discussed in Part I of this report). This individual's \"handlers\" allegedly have also stated that their experiments on U.S. citizens are in pursuit of a variety of objectives; viz., (1) develop an effective means for creating a perfect, \"robotized\" soldier; (2) alter individual sexual preferences, such as by turning heterosexuals into homosexuals (they allegedly claim to be having \"difficulties\" reversing the process): and (3) enhance or destroy levels of academic achievement, at will, such as by degrading the performance of otherwise brilliant students, and by drastically improving the performance of poor students. Given the technology at the government's disposal and a predisposition on the part of certain governmental agencies to \"play God\"", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:25:2db7fc15d1dc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13480, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 26, "text": "effective means for creating a perfect, \"robotized\" soldier; (2) alter individual sexual preferences, such as by turning heterosexuals into homosexuals (they allegedly claim to be having \"difficulties\" reversing the process): and (3) enhance or destroy levels of academic achievement, at will, such as by degrading the performance of otherwise brilliant students, and by drastically improving the performance of poor students. Given the technology at the government's disposal and a predisposition on the part of certain governmental agencies to \"play God\" in experimental fashion with citizens' lives, these purported projects do not come across as being totally far-fetched. * * * Another case involves a woman whose experiences suggest that she, too, is an MKULTRA experimentee being kept on the books, so to speak. The woman, apparently a \"pet\" experimentee, found herself being introduced to a wide array of prominent individuals whose connections with the CIA she believed to be quite apparent. One of those she states, was Robert Jay Lifton, a well-known author and expert on brainwashing, whose books include *The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide* (Basic Books, 1986). Her experiences included a voluntary (\"referral\") admission to Hollywood Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in 1973, during an era when MKULTRA experiments at the Alan Memorial Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, were only beginning to capture the attention of the U.S. Senate.[[8]](#_edn8) More recently, in 1990, she was transported to New York University's Cameron Medical Center, in Westchester, NY (under circumstances which qualify as an abduction), where she was forcibly wrestled to the ground by approximately six Center staffers and forcibly confined for a period of approximately three weeks. She was neither psychiatrically counseled nor formally tested while in that facility. The psychiatrists assigned to her case appeared more intent on forcing her to take a combination of neuroleptic drugs, to include Haldol, Navane, and Cogentin. (Haldol and Navane can cause tardive dyskinesia.) She resisted those attempts. A court ultimately ordered this woman released from the Center, stipulating that she was not to be administered drugs. On subsequently acquiring her medical records, under conditions which prevented censoring or doctoring of those records, she found that her psychiatrists had planned to inject her with drugs (in defiance of the court order) on the day of her release. As luck would have it, she was released a day early. This woman states also that she has met Budd Hopkins, of the Intruders Foundation, and that she had a long-term, confiding relationship with John E. Mack, Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, and founding Director of the Center for Psychological Studies in the Nuclear Age (previously named, Research Program for the Study of Human Continuity; and, still previously, rumored to have cooperated with the CIA in studies of \"human ecology\"). At one point in their relationship, Professor Mack apparently accompanied this woman to a \"support group\" meeting of UFO abductees,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:26:05fdf5bf44e1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13481, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "of the Intruders Foundation, and that she had a long-term, confiding relationship with John E.

At one point in their relationship, Professor Mack apparently accompanied this woman to a \"support group\" meeting of UFO abductees, who, she observed bemusedly, \"spent their time comparing [extraterrestrially] implanted devices.\" Professor Mack is on record as promoting the perception that UFO abductions are legitimate.[[9]](#_edn9) We frankly doubt that extraterrestrials who have a means to commute intergalactically would stoop to implanting comparatively primitive devices in human beings. However, should it be proved that the psychiatrist, surgeon and DoE Project Manager discussed above are extraterrestrials posing as humans, we will be happy to weigh that information. If it is similarly established that the vehicular \"abduction\" of the woman discussed above was the work of an extraterrestrial named Kaplan, who is posing as a human with Cornell Medical Center connections, we will be happy to ponder that as well. In the meantime, it would seem reasonable that the government would want the public to believe that extraterrestrial visitations are on the upswing. Mind-altering drugs, externally-induced auditory input, holographic projections (also a DoD capability),[[10]](#_edn10) appropriately focused directed-energy targeting, device implantations, special effects and abductions are all within this government's capabilities and can be used for purposes of creating illusions of UFO experiences. Persons not cognizant of this might be more inclined to fall for the UFO mythologies now being officially \"legitimized.\" * * * Other cases, possibly involving U.S. Navy Intelligence, NSA, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and, peripherally, members of former Soviet Bloc intelligence services will be discussed in future reports. Harassment Objectives In his book, *Psychiatry and the CIA: Victims of Mind Control,* Dr. Harvey Weinstein quotes the following passage from a book entitled, *Battle for the Mind: A Physiology of Conversion and Brainwashing,* by William Sargant (Greenwood Press, Westport, CT, 1957): \"By increasing or prolonging stresses in various ways, or inducing physical debilitation, a more thorough alteration of the person's thinking processes may be achieved. ...If the stress or the physical debilitation, or both, are carried one stage further, it may happen that patterns of thought and behavior, especially those of recent acquisition, become disrupted. New patterns can then be substituted, or suppressed patterns allowed to reassert themselves; or the subject may begin to think or act in ways that precisely contradict his former ones. \"'...If a complete sudden collapse can be produced by prolonging or intensifying emotional stress, the cortical slate may be wiped clean temporarily of its more recently implanted patterns of behavior, perhaps allowing others to be substituted more easily.'\" Dr. Weinstein then comments: \"The parallel with", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt:27:1db340399ac3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13482, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__targeted-individuals-harrassment-report", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "of recent acquisition, become disrupted. New patterns can then be substituted, or suppressed patterns allowed to reassert themselves; or the subject may begin to think or act in ways that precisely contradict his former ones. \"'...If a complete sudden collapse can be produced by prolonging or intensifying emotional stress, the cortical slate may be wiped clean temporarily of its more recently implanted patterns of behavior, perhaps allowing others to be substituted more easily.'\" Dr. Weinstein then comments: \"The parallel with [Dr. Ewen] Cameron's theory of differential amnesia is striking, and the relationship to brainwashing is abundantly clear.\"[[11]](#_edn11) Dr. Cameron, employed by McGill University's Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, between 1943 and 1964, conducted brainwashing experiments upon select, non-volunteer psychiatric patients on behalf of the CIA. Dr. Weinstein's father was one of Cameron's victims. Sargant's theorems and Cameron's associated experimental findings appear to be the driving force behind the harassment and experimentation now being reported to this Association. All of these individuals are being subjected to a series of overlapping circumstances which apparently are meant to induce and sustain long-term extremes of stress. All of these individuals have been effectively isolated. Unethical psychiatrists and physicians are involved in the majority of these cases. Mind-altering prescription drugs are being used for clearly non-therapeutic purposes. Evidence of LSD use is also beginning to surface (one of Cameron's favored mind-altering substances). And \"psychic driving\" techniques-Cameron's pet brainwashing method-are involved in all these cases, to a much greater and more potentially effective degree where auditory input is involved. ** The long-term objectives of these harassment and experimentation campaigns appear to be quite fundamental; viz., ** **(1) induce a sense of perverted \"loyalty\" toward the very agencies engaged in the individual's harassment, to confuse his or her priorities where the possibility of obtaining legal redress might be concerned; ** ** (2) redirect the targeted individual's feelings of hopelessness, anger and frustration toward racial and ethnic groups, and toward select, prominent political figures, to include the President of the United States; and ** ** (3) force the individual to commit an act of violence, whether suicide or murder, under conditions which can be plausibly denied by the government. ** An operation's ultimate success apparently hangs on this latter objective. We have successfully obstructed this process in a number of cases now being investigated. The \"Stalker\" Phenomenon In recent weeks, considerable publicity has been given the trauma suffered by victims of \"stalkers\" (persons who obsessively surveil, harass and, in some cases, kill targeted individuals for assorted, unfathomable reasons).

Movie stars who have been stalked recurrently make the news. Stalking, as a problem, is in fact becoming widespread, to the point where, in some States, the activity has finally been specifically proscribed by law. The individuals in contact with our Association are reporting the same terrifying ranges of experiences as are now being reported in the press on behalf of other victims of stalkers. The only difference in the cases reported to us is that the stalkers operate in groups over extremely prolonged periods of time, and (it would appear) with the blessing of certain agencies of the U.S. Government. The laws being passed to protect victims of stalkers are clearly being selectively applied. We hope to put an end to this situation; that is, in addition to achieving the objectives discussed above. It should be noted that the FBI, though unwilling to intervene in the cases described above recently intervened on a massive scale to protect Joy Silverman, a Bush-appointed trustee of the J.F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, from the ardent \"stalkings\" of her estranged paramour, Sol Wachtler, Chief Justice, Court of Appeals for the State of New York.[[12]](#_edn12) Wachtler had apparently threatened to kidnap Silverman's daughter if not paid $20,000. Since no kidnapping had occurred, and the case qualified merely as an attempted extortion, a question arises as to why the New York State Police could not have handled this investigation. Mrs. Silverman resides in New York. It would appear that the FBI devoted more than 100 agents and technicians to the effort, resolving the case within approximately 30 days. On November 7, 1992, the day of his arrest, Wachtler ran a gauntlet of 80 FBI special agents on the Long Island Expressway. Apparently the FBI does not have enough to do, if staking out a lone stalker is their top priority. We have to wonder, of course, if the FBI's massive response was prompted by what was perceived to be Wachtler's usurpation of governmental stalking prerogatives. Mrs. Silverman's $300,000 donations to Republican Party causes could be considered a basis for the FBI's solicitous concern for her welfare. It would appear, under the circumstances, that the \"stalking victims\" discussed above-being by now quite poverty-stricken-should abandon all hope of FBI intervention in their respective situations.

'It didn't take too long to recognize that he was more than a little fascinated by youths,' says the source. 'He was probably too good, too well-trained, to be either entrapped or to give away secrets. But he would have been tempted toward a compromising position by a preteen. I mentioned this, and they said, 'As a psychological observer, you're probably quite right. But what the hell are we going to do about it? Where are we going to get a twelve-year-old boy?' The source believes that if the Russian had had a taste for older men, U.S. intelligence might have mounted an operation, 'but the idea of a twelve-year-old boy was just more than anybody could stomach.'\" - John Marks498 The idea of using a child for entrapment might have been too much for some CIA operatives to stomach, but what about to the psychopathic leadership? **Connecting the dots between the use of hypnosis, drugs and entrapment under [MK-ULTRA](https://www.wanttoknow.info/050626mkultra), the abuse of children in [Franklin](https://www.wanttoknow.info/060501conspiracyofsilence), [Belgium](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#dutroux), and [Presidio](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#13), and the extreme abuse perpetrated by occult groups against children, a dark picture begins to emerge. One link that ties together many of these cases is the creation of multiple personality disorder, now known as dissociative identity disorder, in the victims of extreme abuse. ** Franklin's Paul Bonacci alleged that his condition was created deliberately by scientists operating out of Offutt Air Force Base outside of Omaha, Nebraska, beginning at the age of three.499 Later, he was introduced to the pedophile and child abuse ring of Larry King, where he became a child prostitute to wealthy men and politicians around the country, as well as acting as a drug courier on many of his trips. Dutroux's first victim-witness, X1, alleged that her multiple personalities were induced when she was introduced to a group of violent pedophiles at the age of two by her grandmother. **Indeed, Multiple Personality Disorder is a big part of the picture.

The current understanding of the disorder is that its onset begins at a very young age, after a child suffers from horrific abuse, often sexual in nature, that in a very real sense 'shatters' the child's mind into a collection of coexisting personalities to deal with the abuse they have received.** **\"As many as 98% to 99% of individuals who develop dissociative disorders have recognized personal histories of recurring, overpowering, and often life-threatening disturbances at a sensitive developmental stage of childhood.\" - WebMD500** **The brain apparently dissociates exceptionally well: researchers have found that sufferers of Dissociative Identity Disorder will often have no memories of abuse they endured, and go as far as to vehemently deny their past experiences, despite extensive documentation by hospitals and courts of the abuse at the time it happened, and in addition, lifelong physical scars and symptoms that had arisen from the abuse. However, when an 'alter' was present as the dominant psyche, detailed memories of the abuse were present.501** The same study found that the 'alters' would have completely distinct personalities, with different handwriting, and often, different genders. It is very likely that the possibility of deliberately creating multiple personalities in a child was understood at least as early as the medical experiments undertaken during World War II by the Third Reich. A cursory reading of the available data regarding the work of certain doctors such as the notorious 'Angel of Death' Dr. Mengele shows that much of the research undertaken at concentration camps had to do with inflicting trauma and recording its various effects. A logical conclusion is that these psychopathic doctors attempted to understand and then exploit the condition. Remember [G.H. Estabrooks](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/mind_control_articles/estabrooks_hypnosis), associate of the FBI and CIA, and World War II hypnotist who was discussed in the [MKULTRA chapter](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#5)? Here is a salient quote, taken from a 1968 article in the *Providence Evening Bulletin, *which will set a stage for the introduction to the topic of Dissociative Identity Disorder and hypnotism: \"The key to creating an effective spy or assassin rests in splitting a man's personality, or creating multiple personalities, with the aid of hypnotism... this is not science fiction. This has and is being done. I have done it.\"502 The CIA and Estabrooks conceded that only one in five people could be susceptible to hypnotism, and even less would be able to be subjected to the extreme dissociation and amnesia involved in the creation of multiple personalities.

So research was conducted towards increasing the susceptibility of hypnotic mind control through the use of drugs and electroshock. The latter technique offers a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg into a variety of techniques involving using trauma to store memories in a sensitive part of the brain, with long-lasting recall potential but otherwise amnesiac effects in the primary personality. **The extension of this research is known as \"trauma-based mind control.\" The general idea is to subject children to horrific and unthinkable abuse at a sensitive age of development with the purpose of deliberately creating multiple personalities. The alternate personalities would then be programmed, through the use of hypnosis, drugs and further trauma, sometimes to store sensitive information, sometimes to create spies, assassins, prostitutes and more. ** The victim's primary personality would be completely unaware not only that they had programmed alternate personalities, but that they had been a victim of extreme abuse in the first place. Due to the associated trauma, the programming would be stored in a different part of the brain than normal memories, increasing both the power of the memory and the difficulty of recall.503 Using hypnotic suggestion, any designated person with the proper information, such as a code word, would be able to access a victims alternate personality and exploit the programming. 497 'Monarch' is the alleged name for the program of Trauma-Based Mind Control, most frequently given by the victims of the program themselves, although the legitimacy of this moniker has not been confirmed.

In this landmark speech titled \"Hypnosis in MPD: Ritual Abuse, he explained his experiences with patients suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder.\"504 **Before analyzing the speech, here are Dr. Corydon's credentials:** • B.S., M.S., Ph.D. (Counseling Psychology) from the University of Utah. • Licensed Psychologist, Licensed Marital Therapist, Licensed Family Therapist, State of Utah. **• Associate Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Utah School of Medicine.** **• Adjunct Associate Professor of Educational Psychology, University of Utah.** **• Director and Founder of the Sex and Marital Therapy Clinic, University of Utah.** • Editor, The American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis. • Advising Editor and Founding Member, Editorial Board, The Ericksonian Monograph. • Referee, The Journal of Abnormal Psychology. • Clinical Supervisor and Board Examiner, American Board of Sexology. • Diplomate in Marital and Sex Therapy, American Board of Family Psychology. • Diplomate in Clinical Hypnosis, the American Board of Psychological Hypnosis. • Diplomate in Sex Therapy, the American Board of Sexology. • 1989 Presidential Award of Merit, American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. • 1990 Urban Sector Award, American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. • President, American Society of Clinical Hypnosis.505 **Dr. Hammond had been examining patients with dissociative identity disorder (DID, formerly known as MPD) and came across some startling discoveries, which he verified with many of his peers. Many of them had undergone horrific ritual and sexual abuse as a child exactly as described in the case studies examined in previous chapters.** After a brief introduction, Dr. Hammond began with saying: \"In Chicago [in 1984], at the first international congress where ritual abuse was talked about, I can remember thinking, \"How strange and interesting.\" I can recall many people listening to an example given that somebody thought was so idiosyncratic and rare, and all the people coming up after saying, \"Gee, you're treating one, too? You're in Seattle ... Well, I'm in Toronto ... Well, I'm in Florida ... Well, I'm in Cincinnati.\" I didn't know what to think at that point. It wasn't too long after that I found my first ritual-abuse patient in somebody I was already treating and we hadn't gotten that deep yet. Things in that case made me very curious about the use of mind control techniques and hypnosis and other brainwashing techniques...

It wasn't too long after that I found my first ritual-abuse patient in somebody I was already treating and we hadn't gotten that deep yet. Things in that case made me very curious about the use of mind control techniques and hypnosis and other brainwashing techniques... The fascinating thing was that as I did a telephone consult with a therapist that I'd been consulting with for quite a number of months on an MPD case in another state, I told her to inquire about certain things. She said, \"Well, what are those things?\" I said, \"I'm not going to tell you, because I don't want there to be any possibility of contamination. Just come back to me and tell me what the patient says.\" She called me back two hours later, and said, \"I just had a double session with this patient and there was a part of him that said, 'Oh, we're so excited. If you know about this stuff, you know how the cult programmers get on the inside and our therapy is going to go so much faster.' ...I've consulted in eleven states and one foreign country, in some cases over the telephone, in some cases in person, in some cases giving the therapist information ahead of time and saying, \"Be very careful how you phrase this. Phrase it in these ways so you don't contaminate.\" In other cases I didn't give the therapist information ahead of time so they couldn't contaminate the results. **When you start to find the same highly esoteric information in different states and different countries, from Florida to California, you start to get an idea that there's something going on that is very large, very well coordinated, with a great deal of communication and systematicness to what's happening.** **So I have gone from someone kind of neutral and not knowing what to think about it all, to someone who clearly believes ritual abuse is real and that the people who say it isn't are either naive like people who didn't want to believe the Holocaust or-they're dirty [involved in the programs]. \"** Immediately we get the understanding that these victims are not confined geographically, and in addition, an insight into how Dr. Hammond approached his investigation as to avoid 'hypnotic suggestion' and other techniques which the 'False Memory Syndrome Foundation' cites as the basis of all ritual abuse claims. The last line, stating that those who deny the existence of ritual abuse are either naive or dirty, was met with lots of applause from the audience. **\"What they basically do is they will get a child and they will start this in basic forms, it appears, by about two and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt:5:55153921ed9a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13493, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "how Dr. Hammond approached his investigation as to avoid 'hypnotic suggestion' and other techniques which the 'False Memory Syndrome Foundation' cites as the basis of all ritual abuse claims. The last line, stating that those who deny the existence of ritual abuse are either naive or dirty, was met with lots of applause from the audience. **\"What they basically do is they will get a child and they will start this in basic forms, it appears, by about two and a half after the child's already been made dissociative. They'll make him dissociative not only through abuse, like sexual abuse, but also things like putting a mousetrap on their fingers and teaching the parents, \"You do not go in until the child stops crying. Only then do you go in and remove it.**\" They start in rudimentary forms at about two and a half and kick into high gear, it appears, around six or six and a half, continue through adolescence with periodic reinforcements in adulthood. Basically, in the programming the child will be put typically on a gurney. They will have an I.V. in one hand or arm. They'll be strapped down, typically naked. There'll be wires attached to their head to monitor electroencephalograph patterns. They will see a pulsing light, most often described as red, occasionally white or blue. They'll be given, most commonly I believe, Demerol. Sometimes it'll be other drugs as well, depending on the kind of programming. They have it, I think, down to a science where they've learned you give so much every twenty-five minutes until the programming is done. They then will describe a pain on one ear, their right ear generally, where it appears a needle has been placed, and they will hear weird, disorienting sounds in that ear while they see photic stimulation to drive the brain into a brain wave pattern with a pulsing light at a certain frequency, not unlike the goggles that are now available through Sharper Image and some of those kinds of stores. **Then, after a suitable period when they're in a certain brain wave state, they will begin programming oriented to self-destruction and debasement of the person. One patient about eight years old had gone through a great deal of early programming which took place on a military installation. That's not uncommon. I've treated and been involved with cases who are part of this original mind control project, as well as having their programming on military installations in many cases. We find a lot of connections with the CIA.\"** The victim testimony of the use of drugs and other techniques is similar to the available evidence regarding MK-ULTRA experiments such as Dr. Ewen Cameron's 'psychic driving' and the documented search for drugs which help induce hypnosis.

The references to this type of mind control being undertaken at military bases certainly seems absurd, as does Paul Bonacci's claim that he was victimized at Offutt Airforce Base. But remember the [*New York Times*article](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/16/us/army-will-close-child-care-center.html) cited earlier that referenced 30 different military institutions having sexual abuse scandals within a three year period, and the depths of horrors unleashed at West Point and Presidio? Another important aspect that Dr. Hammond mentions is the creation of certain brain wave state before the programming begins. When a mind control subject would be put into a certain brain wave state and hypnosis, then their programming could only be activated under that brain wave state, a type of 'state-dependent learning'. This increases the amnesiac effect of the abuse and programming from the primary personality of someone suffering from multiple personality disorder. Dr. Hammond goes on to describe the details of what a 'cult programming session' would entail for one of his subjects: **\"This particular child was in a a private cult school where several of these sessions occurred a week. She would be taken into a room to get all hooked up. When she was in the proper altered state, they no longer had to monitor with electroencephalographs. She also already had electrodes placed on her; one in the vagina, for example, four on the head. Sometimes they'll be on other parts of the body. They would then begin and would say to her, \"You are angry with someone in the group.\" She'd say, \"No, I'm not,\" and they'd violently shock her. They would say the same thing until she complied and didn't make any negative response. ** Then they would continue. \"When you are angry with someone in the group, you will hurt yourself. Do you understand?\" She answered, \"No,\" and they shocked her. They repeated again, \"Do you understand?\" \"Well, yes, but I don't want to.\" Shock her again until they get compliance. Then they keep adding to it. \"And you will hurt yourself by cutting yourself. Do you understand?\" Maybe she'd say yes, but they might say, \"We don't believe you,\" and shock her anyway. \"Go back and go over it again.\" They would continue in this sort of fashion. She said typically it seemed as though they'd go about thirty minutes, take a break for a smoke or something and come back. They might review what they'd done and then stop, or go on to new material. She said the sessions might go half an hour, or as much as", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt:7:124d92adcb3c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13495, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "say yes, but they might say, \"We don't believe you,\" and shock her anyway. \"Go back and go over it again.\" They would continue in this sort of fashion. She said typically it seemed as though they'd go about thirty minutes, take a break for a smoke or something and come back. They might review what they'd done and then stop, or go on to new material. She said the sessions might go half an hour, or as much as three hours. She estimated three times a week. ** Programming was done under the influence of drugs in a certain brainwave state, with these noises in one ear and the programmers speaking in the other ear, usually the left ear, which is associated with right hemisphere non-dominant brain functioning. All this while they were talking to her and therefore requiring her intense concentration, intense focusing. Often they would have to memorize and say certain things back, word perfect, to avoid punishment, shock, and other kinds of things that were occurring. This is basically how a lot of programming goes on.** Some of it will also use other typical brainwashing techniques. There will be very standardized types of hypnotic things done at times. There will be sensory deprivation which we know increases suggestibility in anyone. According to the research, suggestibility is significantly increased with total sensory deprivation. It's not uncommon before they do certain of these things for them to use this a great deal, including formal sensory-deprivation chambers.\" **It is possible that the series of revelations and inquiries such as the Joint Hearing of the Select Intelligence Committee during the 1970's prompted the CIA to discontinue their official relationship with these projects and instead contract them out to certain cults and [Michael Aquino's Temple of Set](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/mind_control/satanic_cults_geraldo_aquino_gunderson). Remember that official documents discussed in the MK-ULTRA chapter mentioned 6% of projects being too sensitive for any connections to the agency. ** **In addition to the lack of official connection to the CIA, which diminishes liability and culpability, there is a bonus effect: Plausible deniability. When these projects are uncovered, people are simply be disbelief that such atrocious acts could have occurred, let alone connected to the United States government.** Dr. Hammond goes on to describe the different brainwave states during which programming took place, which were consistent throughout all of his patients and those of his peers: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Gamma and Omega - a phenomenon noted by over 100 of the respondents to the Extreme Abuse Surveys. Each brainwave state was associated with a specific type of programming and seemed to be present in a specific 'alter', which was also mostly consistent among the patients. **\"Alphas appear to represent general programming, the first kind of things put in. Betas appear to be sexual programs. For example, how to perform oral sex in a certain way, how to perform sex", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt:8:fa38281035af", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13496, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "Gamma and Omega - a phenomenon noted by over 100 of the respondents to the Extreme Abuse Surveys. Each brainwave state was associated with a specific type of programming and seemed to be present in a specific 'alter', which was also mostly consistent among the patients. **\"Alphas appear to represent general programming, the first kind of things put in. Betas appear to be sexual programs. For example, how to perform oral sex in a certain way, how to perform sex in rituals, having to do with producing child pornography, directing child pornography, or prostitution. Deltas are killers trained in how to kill in ceremonies. There'll also be some self-harm stuff mixed in with that, assassination and killing.** Then there's Omega. I usually don't include that word when I say my first question about this or any part inside that knows about Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta, because Omega will shake them even more. **Omega has to do with self-destruct programming.** Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. This can include self-mutilation as well as killing-themselves programming. Gamma appears to be system protection and deception programming which will provide misinformation to you, try to misdirect you, tell you half-truths, protect different things inside. There can also be other Greek letters. I'd recommend that you go and get your entire Greek alphabet, and if you have verified that some of this stuff is present and they have given you some of the right answers about what some of this material is, and I can't underline enough: DO NOT LEAD THEM. Do not say, \"Is this killers?\" Get the answer from them, please. When you've done this and it appears to be present, I would take your entire Greek alphabet, and with ideomotor signals, go through the alphabet and say, \"Is there any programming inside associated with Epsilon, Omicron,\" and go on through. There may be a system to some of the other letters, but I'm not aware of it.** I found, for example in one case, that Zeta had to do with the production of snuff films that this patient was involved with. With another person, Omicron had to do with their linkage and associations with drug smuggling and with the Mafia, big business, and government leaders. **So there's going to be some individualism, I think, in some of those. Some are come-home programs, \"come back to the cult\" programs. \" One gets the impression that there is a very large, tightly connected network working through numerous organizations and institutions to undertake these experiments. At one point, Dr. Hammond notes that while the programming seems to be widely systematic among victims with no personal or geographic relations, there is one factor that is always different: Erasure codes to remove certain aspects of programming. \"Here's the flaw in the system. They have built in shut-down and erasure codes, so if they got into", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt:9:a2aca472ccb9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13497, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "gets the impression that there is a very large, tightly connected network working through numerous organizations and institutions to undertake these experiments.

They have built in shut-down and erasure codes, so if they got into trouble they could shut something down and they could also erase something. These codes will sometimes be idiosyncratic phrases, or ditties. Sometimes they will be numbers maybe followed by a word. There's some real individuality to that. At first I had hoped if we can get some of these, maybe they'll work with different people. No such luck. It's very unlikely, unless they were programmed at about the same point in time as part of the same little group. Stuff that I've seen suggests that the programmers carry laptop computers which still include everything that they did twenty, thirty years ago in terms of the names of alters, the programs, the codes, and so on. I remember a woman about twenty-four years old who came in and claimed her father was a Satanist. Her parents divorced when she was six. After that, her father had visitation, and he would take her to rituals sometimes up until age fifteen. She said, \"I haven't gone to anything since I was fifteen.\" Her therapist believed this at face value. We sat in my office. We did a two-hour inquiry using hypnosis. We found the programming present. In addition to that we found that **every therapy session was debriefed, and in fact they had told her to get sick and not come to the appointment with me.** Another one had been told that I was Cult and that if she came I would know that she'd been told not to come and I would punish her. If anything meaningful comes out in a patient who's being monitored like that, my belief is you can't do meaningful therapy other than being supportive and caring and letting them know you care a lot, and you'll be there to support them. But I wouldn't try to work with any kind of deep material or deprogramming with those being monitored, because I think it can do nothing but get them tortured and hurt unless they can get into a safe, secure inpatient unit for an extended period of time to do some of the work required. From what I've learned thus far, they're tortured with electric shocks. I have a feeling that when you make inquiries you're going to find that probably greater than fifty percent of these patients, if they're bloodline, meaning mother or dad or both involved, will be monitored on some ongoing basis.\" Much of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt:10:6a6db0a04398", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13498, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "get them tortured and hurt unless they can get into a safe, secure inpatient unit for an extended period of time to do some of the work required.

But Dr. Hammond doesn't hesitate to come to conclusions about the purpose of the programming or the perpetrators: \"**The way you create Manchurian Candidates is you divide the mind. It's part of what the intelligence community wanted. If you're going to get an assassin, you divide the mind. Cases like the assassination of Robert Kennedy fascinate me. Bernard Diamond, on examining Sirhan Sirhan, found that he had total amnesia of the killing of Robert Kennedy. Yet under hypnosis he could remember it. But after he was out of hypnosis, he could not remember a thing, despite suggestions he would be able to consciously remember.** **The interesting thing is how many people have described the same scenario, and how many people that we have worked with who have had relatives in NASA, in the CIA, and in the Military, including very high-ups in the Military.** **People ask, \"What's the purpose of it?\" My best guess is that they want an army of Manchurian Candidates, tens of thousands of mental robots who will do prostitution, child pornography, smuggle drugs, engage in international arms smuggling, do snuff films, and all sorts of other very lucrative things. These Manchurian Candidates will do the bidding of their masters, so that eventually the megalomaniacs at the top believe they can create a Satanic Order that will rule the world.\"** The end of Dr. Corydon's speech was met with long, sustained applause by the attendees of the conference who recognized the bravery of going public with this information, particularly as many had their long-held suspicions regarding the nature of mind control in their patients confirmed. ***[Editor's Note] **In his speech, Dr. Corydon also commented on being the first to speak publicly about this disturbing information and added, \"I and a few others that I'd shared it with were hedging out of concern because of personal threats and death threats. **I finally decided to hell with them.

The case of victim Claudia Mullen is particularly interesting. Claudia had been referred to Psychiatrist Valerie Wolf after experiencing a sexual assault, and was unresponsive in therapy for many months. Unlike many other therapists, Wolf did not use hypnosis or any other memory retrieval techniques with Mullen. \"It needs to be made clear that these clients have remembered these names and events spontaneously, with free recall and without the use of any memory retrieval technique such as hypnosis. As much as possible, we have tried to verify the memories. I have sent information from one of my clients to Alan Scheflin, Professor of Law at Santa Clara University Law School (and a judicially recognized expert on mind and behavior control). He has been able to confirm that the information that she has supplied is absolutely true, and that her memories could not have been derived from any published source.\" - Valerie Wolf, speaking to the Presidential Advisory Commission on Radiation.506 Here are some excerpts from Claudia Mullen's testimony, from which she has earned no money and named men who were still alive: \"Good afternoon. **Between the years 1957 and 1984 I became a pawn in the government's game. Its ultimate goal was mind control and to create the perfect spy, all through the use of chemicals, radiation, drugs, hypnosis, electric shock, isolation in tubs of water, sleep deprivation, brainwashing, verbal, physical, emotional and sexual abuse.

I was exploited unwittingly for nearly three decades of my life and the only explanations given to me were \"that the end justifies the means\" and \"I was serving my country in their bold effort to fight communism\".** I can only summarize my circumstances by saying they took an already abused seven year old child and compounded my suffering beyond belief. The saddest part is, I know for a fact I was not alone. **There were countless other children in my same situation** and there was no one to help us until now... In 1958 they told me I was to be tested by some important doctors from the Society, or the Human Ecology Society, and I was instructed to cooperate. I was told not to look at anyone's faces, and to try hard to ignore any names because this was a very secret project. I was told all these things to help me forget. Naturally, as most children do, I did the opposite and remembered as much as I could. A Dr. John Gittinger tested me, Dr. Cameron gave me the shock, and Dr. Greene the x-rays. Then I was told by [Sid Gottlieb](https://www.WantToKnow.info/a-sidney-gottlieb-80-dies-took-lsd-cia) that \"I was ripe for the big A\" meaning ARTICHOKE. By the time I left to go home, just like every time from then on, I would remember only whatever explanations Dr. Robert G. Heath, of Tulane Medical University, gave me for the odd bruises, needle marks, burns on my head, fingers, and even the genital soreness. I had no reason to think otherwise. They had already begun to control my mind. **The next year I was sent to a lodge in Maryland called Deep Creek Cabins to learn how to sexually please men. I was taught how to coerce them into talking about themselves.** I was used to entrap many unwitting men including themselves, all with the use of a hidden camera. I was only nine years old when the sexual humiliation began. **Another time I heard Dr. Martin Orne, who was the director then of the Scientific Office and later head of the Institute for Experimental Research state that \"in order to keep more funding coming from different sources for radiation and mind control projects\", he suggested stepping up the amounts of stressors used and also the blackmail portions of the experiments.** He said, \"it needed to be done faster then to get rid of the subjects or they were asking for us to come back later and haunt them with our remembrances.

I would love nothing more than to say that I dreamed this all up and need to just forget it. But that would be a tragic mistake. It would also be lie. All these atrocities did occur to me and to countless other children, and all under the guise of defending our country. It is because of the cumulative effects of exposure to radiation, chemicals, drugs, pain, subsequent mental and physical distress that I have been robbed of the ability to work and even to bear children of my own. It is blatantly obvious that none of this was needed, nor should ever have been allowed to take place at all, and the only means we have to seek out the awful truth and bring it to light is by opening whatever files remain on all the projects, and through another Presidential Commission on Mind Control.\" In follow-up interviews, Mullen went into more details regarding the entrapment operations she was a part of. **\"The CIA kept hotel rooms in two of the best hotels in New Orleans, and year around they kept a suite. It was unique in that it had two bathrooms, and one bathroom was where they kept the hidden cameras. I was actually shown the hidden cameras by three men who handled that part of it. They called him Captain George White.** He was formerly a doctor. He used to be in the narcotics squad in California, and then he became a doctor and joined the CIA. And then there were two other men who worked with him. They would put me with the subjects who would be filmed (the men) and then when the men would come into town -** I am talking about local politicians, government officials - anybody who they needed to possibly get something on, keep on file for future reference - should they need to coerce this person into supporting the projects.** Senators, congressmen, anything like that - if they were in town, they were given this room. They had no reason to think there was anything strange about the room. It didn't look any different than any other room. It was just one of the better suites in the two hotels. I was shown how the cameras were set up behind mirrors - behind the mirrors which are in every hotel room, behind the dresser. They would sit there and they would film it. **When I was first told this I ... was nine, and I went to the Deep Creek Cabins in Maryland. That's when", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt:14:c15272d6ff0b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13502, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "strange about the room.

That's when I was taught I was going to be part of this project, I had been accepted into this project, that I had been accepted into this project that would help the government stop Communism. \"507** At another point, she stated that one man she was involved with as an entrapment operation was Frank Church. \"I think they were afraid they would talk about the projects, and so they had to use something to keep them quiet. For instance, there was a guy named Church - all I knew was, he would try, he was very important to them because he was going to convince other people to let the projects keep going and so they had to get something on this guy, Church. This was later, when I was in high school. Supposedly he ended up talking other people into letting the projects keep going. He was supposed to be investigating - to see if there was anything wrong being done by the CIA - and so he of course decided nothing wrong was being done because they had a film on him.\"508 **Senator Frank Church headed the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, popularly known as the 'Church Committee'.509 The committee was the first to investigate the CIA for their illegal actions under MK-ULTRA, Project Mockingbird and other enterprises. The alleged entrapment of Frank Church may explain how the CIA was able to escape any sort of reform from Congress and continued many illicit projects, albeit with more secrecy.** It is the perfect example of how important entrapment was to the agency and how effective it could be to their uninterrupted continuation. There is certainly the potential that Mullen's testimony is a lie. After all, many of the names she alleged to have been a part of her mind control program had been publicly named as a part of the MK-ULTRA program. At least one had not: Darwin Fenner, a 'high- society' socialite and MK-ULTRA institution Tulane administrator.510 Mullen has not seemed to make any money from her allegations, against many men who were still alive, given to a Presidential investigative committee.

In addition, her testimony was reviewed by Alan Scheflin, Professor of Law at Santa Clara University Law School and judicially recognized expert in mind and behavior control, who stated that her claims could not have been derived from any known publication, making her testimony worth discussing. One particularly disturbing sentence from Mullen's testimony is: \"[Dr. Martin T. Orne] said, 'it needed to be done faster then to get rid of the subjects or they were asking for us to come back later and haunt them with our remembrances.'\" The idea that trauma-based mind control victims would be 'disposed of' once they outlived their usefulness is truly terrifying, but certainly in the mind of a psychopath it would be a logical and necessary step to take. Perhaps it explains why only a handful of victims have been able to recover from their abuse and synthesize their memories coherently enough to present their case of being abused. 506 [The Testimony of Valerie B. Wolf](http://www.tulanelink.com/mind/testimony_04a.htm) 507 [Interview available here.](http://www.tulanelink.com/mind/interview_04a.htm) 508 [Interview available here.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160415235933/http://www.smilenow.de/textlibmc/html/t006.htm) 509 [Wikipedia article on the Church Committee.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee) 510 [Tulanelink.com](http://www.tulanelink.com/tulanelink/fenner_box.htm) * * * * Conclusion All in all, trauma-based mind control has become a widespread program expanded from the original MK-ULTRA research. Extreme abuse at a young age has been revealed to be the most effective way of controlling the mind.** Psychopathic networks in both occult groups and clandestine agencies jumped at the opportunity to create a veritable army of mind controlled slaves using the most depraved and violent techniques at their disposal. ** **By using torture such as electric shock and sexual abuse, these psychopaths have found a way to literally create blank slate alternate personalities which can be programmed for all sorts of illicit activities. Child prostitution, pornography, snuff films, assassinations and drug running are all direct applications of mind control programming.** Another likelihood is programming among elite military units to undertake activities that would otherwise be balked at, such as death squads and terrorism. The documented MK-ULTRA interest in electric shock, hypnosis and sensory deprivation are collectively the forerunners to trauma-based mind control, with the only missing documented ingredient being sexual abuse. It is certainly horrifying to consider that groups, government or otherwise, would deliberately subject children to such abuse but in the context of psychopathy, where psychopaths are sexual deviants and sadists, it is actually quite logical. **It is unclear how much of an overlap there is between the CIA and occult groups. The most likely scenario is that occult groups infiltrated the MK-ULTRA program and began using the knowledge they learned for their own subversive plans. It is also possible that the leading researchers into", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt:16:ba53d8dafcf4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13504, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "consider that groups, government or otherwise, would deliberately subject children to such abuse but in the context of psychopathy, where psychopaths are sexual deviants and sadists, it is actually quite logical. **It is unclear how much of an overlap there is between the CIA and occult groups. The most likely scenario is that occult groups infiltrated the MK-ULTRA program and began using the knowledge they learned for their own subversive plans. It is also possible that the leading researchers into MK-ULTRA were simultaneously members of occult groups themselves. ** **The crossover between occult groups and military occupations, such as the Presidio, Michael Aquino and Dr. Corydon's statement that \"The interesting thing is how many people have described the same scenario, and how many people that we have worked with who have had relatives in NASA, in the CIA, and in the military, including very high-ups in the military,\" certainly demands further investigation.** **Many of the victims discussed by Dr. Hammond and those who responded to the Extreme Abuse Surveys claimed to have been born into a 'direct bloodline', meaning that their families have been practicing in a satanic cult for as many as 12 generations.** These children have been essentially born for the purpose of being abused and exploited by cults. Some have referred to themselves as the 'chosen generation', perhaps indicating that they have a role to play in the 'end game' of the Pathocracy. Children outside of these bloodlines seem to be more expendable, and are likely killed once they enter adulthood, when they are no longer useful for child prostitution or pornography, and their programming begins to weaken. We can only speculate about the death toll. The two main groups involved in extreme abuse, the occult and clandestine intelligence agencies, seem to have distinct goals with significant overlap. The occult groups believe, in the vein of the writings of Aleister Crowley, that there are legitimate spiritual reasons for abuse and always perform their mind control operations during rituals. The CIA, on the other hand, seems more interested in espionage and entrapment. The overlap between the two is the goal of making money, and possibly the causing of violence and terror as part of a 'strategy of tension' campaign designed to steer the populace towards certain political goals and psychological states of terror, making manipulation of the populace easier. Some researchers have suggested that trauma-based mind control dates as far back as the ancient Egyptian Mystery Schools, with the *Book of the Dead *serving as a blueprint to torture and utilize drugs to exert control over that person, raising the possibility that occult groups have been practicing a form of mind control for millennia and used the laboratory settings of the Nazis and the CIA to enhance and refine their techniques.511 I want to state emphatically that the entirety of the evidence does not necessarily point to a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt:17:217d407a703f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13505, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mk__trauma-based-mind-control", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "as far back as the ancient Egyptian Mystery Schools, with the *Book of the Dead *serving as a blueprint to torture and utilize drugs to exert control over that person, raising the possibility that occult groups have been practicing a form of mind control for millennia and used the laboratory settings of the Nazis and the CIA to enhance and refine their techniques.511 I want to state emphatically that the entirety of the evidence does not necessarily point to a world with comprehensive and full subversion by satanic cults. These cults comprise only a portion of the occult groups operating within the Pathocracy and instead seem to be one arm of the psychopathic network, being concealed and protected for the use and creation of mind controlled slaves, profits from drug and child trafficking, and entrapment of pedophiles in government, military, finance and beyond. Ultimately, the full motivations of trauma-based mind control, the breadth of the operations and number of victims cannot fully be known until the pathocracy which is responsible for these crimes against humanity is brought down and dissected. There is no knowledge more important towards this end than the extent of pedophilia and child abuse at the hands of the government and elite. **The disbelief of trauma-based mind control is understandable, so we must collectively work together to bring further evidence to light. After all, before the liberation of Auschwitz, the general sentiment was that such atrocities were impossible and reports of mass murder were greatly exaggerated. Unfortunately, they did happen, and serve as a reminder that crimes against humanity at the hands of psychopaths are very real.** As the final word on trauma-based mind control, I would like to reiterate the conclusion of Dr. Corydon Hammond: People ask, \"What's the purpose of it?\" My best guess is that they want an army of Manchurian Candidates, tens of thousands of mental robots who will do prostitution, child pornography, smuggle drugs, engage in international arms smuggling, do snuff films, and all sorts of other very lucrative things. These Manchurian Candidates will do the bidding of their masters, so that eventually the megalomaniacs at the top believe they can create a Satanic Order that will rule the world.\" 511 Ron Patton, \"[Project Monarch, Nazi Mind Control.](http://www.whale.to/b/patton.html)\" * * * * Food for Thought: 1.

Doctor Ewan Cameron, who became one of the world's leading psychiatrists, developed techniques used by Nazi scientists to wipe out the existing personalities of people in his care. Cameron, who graduated from Glasgow University, was recruited by the CIA during the cold war while working at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. He carried out mind-control experiments using drugs such as LSD on hundreds of patients, but only 77 of them were awarded compensation. Now a landmark ruling by a Federal Court judge in Montreal will allow more than 250 former patients, whose claims were rejected, to seek compensation. Gail Kastner, who underwent electroshock treatment at a Montreal psychiatric institute in 1953, and whose claim was rejected 10 years ago, successfully appealed the judgment. Last week, Alan Stein, of Montreal law firm Stein and Stein, which represented Kastner, confirmed he was in the process of contacting former clients who could now renew their appeal. \"There are about 200 people still due compensation,\" he said. \"This judgment should send out strong signals to the Canadian government. Those who have previously missed out should have a strong case for appealing.\" Using techniques similar to those portrayed in the celebrated novel the Manchurian Candidate, it was believed that people could be brainwashed and reprogrammed to carry out specific acts.

Cameron developed a range of depatterning \"treatments\" while director of the Allan Memorial Institute at McGill University. Patients were woken from drug-induced stupors two or three times a day for multiple electric shocks. In a specially designed \"sleep room\" made famous by Anne Collins's book of the same name, Cameron placed a speaker under the patient's pillow and relayed negative messages for 16 hours a day. Kastner was a 19-year-old honours student suffering from mild depression when she first underwent \"treatment\" in 1953. On returning home she sucked her thumb, demanded to be fed from a bottle, talked in a baby voice and urinated on the floor. She was ostracised by her affluent family, who were unable to cope with her changed state, and her marriage in 1955 quickly broke down due to her difficulties. Cameron, who was born in Bridge of Allan in 1901, rose to become the first president of the World Psychiatric Association. It took two decades and the persistence of Joseph Rauh, the distinguished American civil liberties lawyer, to uncover what happened and secure compensation for some of Cameron's victims.

From deeply shaping the U.S. civil rights movement to courageously giving voice to the devastating impacts of militarism and war, he served as a galvanizing moral force for healing hate and violence in all its forms. From his earliest speeches, King spoke repeatedly about the Greek concept of agape, a social concept that sustained him throughout his career. Agape is a moral imperative defined by King as an \"understanding, creative, redemptive good will for all men.\" *We rise to the position of loving the person who does the evil deed while hating the deed he does ... **If I respond to hate with a reciprocal hate, I do nothing but intensify the cleavage in broken community. **I can only close the gap in broken community by meeting hate with love ... Agape is a willingness to go to any length to restore community. * ~~ Martin Luther King Jr. King once said that the \"means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.\" Even though King believed that justice is on our side, **he also recognized that we are products of our society, and must do the courageous work of transforming the violence within ourselves and in our relationships, in order to transform the violence in the world. **King was also one of the greatest disciples of Mohandas Gandhi, who emphasized the power of a nonviolent mass movement to awaken social conscience and seek real, systemic change. As we honor his powerful contributions to society, we explore King's core nonviolent teachings below, as well as an eye-opening and shocking investigation into the real story behind his assassination.

He described his book as \"the chronicle of 50,000 Negroes who took to heart the principles of nonviolence, **who learned to fight for their rights with the weapon of love, and who, in the process, acquired a new estimate of their own human worth.\" ** Below is an articulate excerpt, where he reveals the six principles of nonviolent activism: \"First, it must be emphasized that nonviolent resistance is not a method for cowards; it does resist. If one uses this method because he is afraid or merely because he lacks the instruments of violence, he is not truly nonviolent. This is why Gandhi often said that if cowardice is the only alternative to violence, it is better to fight ... **The method is passive physically, but strongly active spiritually.** It is not passive nonresistance to evil, it is active nonviolent resistance to evil. A second basic fact that characterizes nonviolence is that** it does not seek to defeat or humiliate the opponent, but to win his friendship and understanding.** The nonviolent resister must often express his protest through noncooperation or boycotts, but he realizes that these are not ends themselves; they are merely means to awaken a sense of moral shame in the opponent ... The aftermath of nonviolence is the creation of the beloved community, while the aftermath of violence is tragic bitterness. A third characteristic of this method is that **the attack is directed against forces of evil rather than against persons who happen to be doing the evil** ... We are out to defeat injustice and not white persons who may be unjust. A fourth point that characterizes nonviolent resistance is** a willingness to accept suffering without retaliation, to accept blows from the opponent without striking back. **'Rivers of blood may have to flow before we gain our freedom, but it must be our blood,' Gandhi said to his countrymen. The nonviolent resister ... does not seek to dodge jail. If going to jail is necessary, he enters it 'as a bridegroom enters the bride's chamber...' \"What is the nonviolent resister's justification for this ordeal to which he invites men, for this mass political application of the ancient doctrine of turning the other cheek?\" The answer is found in the realization that unearned suffering is redemptive. **Suffering, the nonviolent resister realizes, has tremendous educational and transforming possibilities.** A fifth point concerning nonviolent resistance is that **it avoids not only", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:mlkjr-nonviolence-plottokillking.txt:1:9b5a25d1da85", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13512, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "mlkjr-nonviolence-plottokillking.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "mlkjr-nonviolence-plottokillking", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "jail.

A man of enormous courage. **No matter how much money it cost him no matter how much his life became increasingly in danger, he stood firm on behalf of values, that he thought were essential human values.** And he thought: to be silent in the face of this type of criminality, war criminality in particular, was in factunconscionable. So, he was a man of enormous courage, depth, and integrity, and determined to have an impact on the structure of American democracy. ~ William Pepper, personal friend to King and attorney for the King Family * Audiences of corporate media may not have heard of bestselling author and human rights lawyer [Dr. William Pepper](https://williampepper.com/), and the decades of effort to discover and expose the real story behind the assassination of King. He represented the King family in the 1999 civil trial in Memphis, where it was discovered that various agencies of the U.S. government were found guilty of conspiring to kill Dr. King. In 2016, Pepper published a complete volume on the 1968 assassination of King, *[The Plot to Kill King: The Truth Behind the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr](https://www.amazon.com/Plot-Kill-King-Behind-Assassination/dp/1536682195).* **Pepper's investigation points to a conspiracy to silence King's growing criticism of the Vietnam War and his anti-poverty campaign by then FBI director J.

But it did. **And it took a jury 59 minutes to find that James Earl Ray had no involvement, knowing involvement, in the killing.**\" *~ William Pepper Given the ties to special interests embedded in our own government, it is no surprise that there was media censorship and indifference, orders for the [King files to be sealed for 50 years](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZNweAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VVsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5450%2C14915), and reports that sensitive documents related to the murder case [were being destroyed](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZNweAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VVsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5450%2C14915).

Later in the program, Mickey and Kenn discuss the annual Gandhi-King Season for Nonviolence that celebrates the teachings behind King's activism. See below key excerpts of the trial that were mentioned in the radio show interview: \"**Well, they had determined that they were going to kill him because of the two issues we've just been discussing. The [Vietnam] War was a very important monetary issue for major American corporations. **You know; at one point, John Downey(sp?), who was head of the military intelligence group, the 902nd Military Intelligence Group, used to brief [Lyndon] Johnson, President Johnson, on a very regular basis. And every time he would come back from Vietnam, he would brief him. And he would ask him: Why are we there? Why are we losing blood and treasure? What's behind all of this? What is the reason for it? It doesn't make any sense. And Johnson would ignore him for the most part. And, then, finally, one day-I guess he'd had too much or whatever-**he pounded the table; and he said: John, I can't get out of Vietnam.

Given the recent verdict, we are able to state the following: (1). We initially requested that a comprehensive investigation be conducted by a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, independent of the government, because we do not believe that, in such a politically-sensitive matter, the government is capable of investigating itself. (2). The type of independent investigation we sought was denied by the federal government. But in our view, it was carried out, in a Memphis courtroom, during a month-long trial by a jury of 12 American citizens who had no interest other than ascertaining the truth. (Kings v.Jowers). (3). After hearing and reviewing the extensive testimony and evidence, which had never before been tested under oath in a court of law, it took the Memphis jury only one hour to find that a conspiracy to kill Dr. King did exist. Most significantly, this conspiracy involved agents of the governments of the City of Memphis, the state of Tennessee and the United States of America.

He represented the King family in the 1999 civil trial in Memphis, where it was discovered that various agencies of the U.S. government were found guilty of conspiring to kill Dr. King. In 2016, Pepper published a complete volume on the 1968 assassination of King, *[The Plot to Kill King: The Truth Behind the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr](https://www.amazon.com/Plot-Kill-King-Behind-Assassination/dp/1536682195).* **Pepper's investigation points to a conspiracy to silence King's growing criticism of the Vietnam War and his anti-poverty campaign by then FBI director J.

Pepper discusses key information from the civil rights trial. Later in the program, Mickey and Kenn discuss the annual Gandhi-King Season for Nonviolence that celebrates the teachings behind King's activism. See below key excerpts of the trial, as quoted by Pepper in the interview: * \"**Well, they had determined that they were going to kill him because of the two issues we've just been discussing. The [Vietnam] War was a very important monetary issue for major American corporations. **You know; at one point, John Downey, who was head of the military intelligence group, the 902nd Military Intelligence Group, used to brief [Lyndon] Johnson, President Johnson, on a very regular basis. And every time he would come back from Vietnam, he would brief him. And he would ask him: Why are we there? Why are we losing blood and treasure? What's behind all of this? What is the reason for it? It doesn't make any sense. And Johnson would ignore him for the most part.

The experiments, conducted on monkeys, are the first to demonstrate that animal behaviour can be permanently changed, turning the subjects from aggressive to \"compliant\" creatures. The genes are identical in humans and although the discovery could help to treat depression and other types of mental illness, it will raise images of the Epsilon caste from Aldous Huxley's futuristic novel Brave New World. The experiments -- detailed in the journal Nature Neuroscience this month -- involved blocking the effect of a gene called D2 in a particular part of the brain. This cut off the link between the rhesus monkeys' motivation and reward. Instead of speeding up with the approach of a deadline or the prospect of a \"treat,\" the monkeys in the experiment could be made to work just as enthusiastically for long periods. The scientists say the identical technique would apply to humans. \"Most people are motivated to work hard and well only by the expectation of reward, whether it's a paycheque or a word of praise,\" said Barry Richmond, a government neurobiologist at the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:monkeydrones.txt:0:d67cfa863972", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13523, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "monkeydrones.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "monkeydrones", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Instead of speeding up with the approach of a deadline or the prospect of a \"treat,\" the monkeys in the experiment could be made to work just as enthusiastically for long periods.

Normally they work hardest and fastest with the fewest mistakes if they think a reward for the \"work\" is imminent. However, Mr. Richmond's team found that they could make the monkeys work their hardest and fastest all the time, without any complaint or sign of slacking, just by manipulating D2 so that they forgot about the expectation of reward. The original purpose of the research was to find ways of treating mental illness, but the technicalities of permanently altering human behaviour by gene manipulation are currently too complex, he said. However, he and other scientists acknowledge that methods of manipulating human physical and psychological traits are just around the corner, and the technology will emerge first as a lucrative add-on available from in vitro fertilization clinics. \"There's no doubt we will be able to influence behaviour,\" said Julian Savulescu, a professor of ethics at Oxford University. \"Genetically manipulating people to become slaves is not in their interests, but there are other changes that might be. We have to make choices about what makes a good life for an individual.\" In a presentation at a Royal Society meeting titled Designing Babies: What the Future Holds, Yuri Verlinsky, a scientist from the University of Chicago who is at the forefront of embryo manipulation, said: \"As infertility customers are investing so much time, money and effort into having a baby, shouldn't they have a healthy one and what is to stop them picking a baby for its physical and psychological traits?\" Gregory Stock, author of Redesigning Humans and an ethics specialist from the University of California, agrees. \"I don't think these kind of interventions are exactly round the corner, they are a few years away, but I don't think they are going to be stopped by legislation,\" he said.

Below are excerpts from a fascinating article written by the Dalai Lama (Tenzin Gyatso) and published in the *New York Times*. I meditate every morning upon awakening and most nights before sleep. I find it to be very calming and to help me stay focused as I move through each day. As mentioned, meditation does not have to be related to any particular religion or belief system. It is simply time set aside to communicate with our inner spirit and with whatever spiritual guidance we are open to. May your days be filled with calmness, clarity, and purpose. With sacred love and very best wishes for inner peace, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for the inspiring and educational [PEERS websites](https://www.peerservice.org/) ** The Monk in the Lab By Tenzin Gyatso (*New York Times* Op-Ed) 1107 words ** DHARAMSALA, India - These are times when destructive emotions like anger, fear and hatred are giving rise to devastating problems throughout the world. While the daily news offers grim reminders of the destructive power of such emotions, the question we must ask is this: What can we do, person by person, to overcome them? Of course such disturbing emotions have always been part of the human condition. Some - those who tend to believe nothing will ''cure'' our impulses to hate or oppress one another - might say that this is simply the price of being human. But this view can create apathy in the face of destructive emotions, leading us to conclude that destructiveness is beyond our control. **I believe that there are practical ways for us as individuals to curb our dangerous impulses - impulses that collectively can lead to war and mass violence. As evidence I have not only my spiritual practice, but now also the work of scientists.** For the last 15 years I have engaged in a series of conversations with Western scientists. We have exchanged views on topics ranging from quantum physics and cosmology to compassion and destructive emotions. It may seem odd that a religious leader is so involved with science, but Buddhist teachings stress the importance of understanding reality, and so we should pay attention to what scientists have learned about our world", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:monkinlab.txt:0:43dd375847f3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13525, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "monkinlab.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "monkinlab", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "only my spiritual practice, but now also the work of scientists.** For the last 15 years I have engaged in a series of conversations with Western scientists. We have exchanged views on topics ranging from quantum physics and cosmology to compassion and destructive emotions. It may seem odd that a religious leader is so involved with science, but Buddhist teachings stress the importance of understanding reality, and so we should pay attention to what scientists have learned about our world through experimentation and measurement. It is for this reason that I visited the neuroscience laboratory of Dr. Richard Davidson at the University of Wisconsin. Using imaging devices that show what occurs in the brain during meditation, Dr. Davidson has been able to study the effects of Buddhist practices for cultivating compassion, equanimity or mindfulness. For centuries Buddhists have believed that pursuing such practices seems to make people calmer, happier and more loving. At the same time they are less and less prone to destructive emotions. According to Dr. Davidson, there is now science to underscore this belief. Dr. Davidson tells me that the emergence of positive emotions may be due to this: **Mindfulness meditation strengthens the neurological circuits that calm a part of the brain that acts as a trigger for fear and anger. This raises the possibility that we have a way to create a kind of buffer between the brain's violent impulses and our actions. ** Experiments have already been carried out that show some practitioners can achieve a state of inner peace, even when facing extremely disturbing circumstances. Dr. Paul Ekman of the University of California at San Francisco told me that jarring noises (one as loud as a gunshot) failed to startle the Buddhist monk he was testing. Dr. Ekman said he had never seen anyone stay so calm in the presence of such a disturbance. Another monk, the abbot of one of our monasteries in India, was tested by Dr. Davidson using electroencephalographs to measure brain waves. According to Dr. Davidson, the abbot had the highest amount of activity in the brain centers associated with positive emotions that had ever been measured by his laboratory. Of course, the benefits of these practices are not just for monks who spend months at a time in meditation retreat. Dr. Davidson told me about his research with people working in highly stressful jobs. These people - non-Buddhists - were taught mindfulness, a state of alertness in which the mind does not get caught up in thoughts or sensations, but lets them come and go, much like watching a river flow by. After eight weeks, Dr. Davidson found that in these people, the parts of their brains that help to form positive emotions became increasingly active. The implications of all this are clear: the world today needs citizens and leaders who can work toward ensuring stability and engage in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:monkinlab.txt:1:58e1fbe55cb7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13526, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "monkinlab.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "monkinlab", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "were taught mindfulness, a state of alertness in which the mind does not get caught up in thoughts or sensations, but lets them come and go, much like watching a river flow by.

The implications of all this are clear: the world today needs citizens and leaders who can work toward ensuring stability and engage in dialogue with the ''enemy'' - no matter what kind of aggression or assault they may have endured. **It's worth noting that these methods are not just useful, but inexpensive. You don't need a drug or an injection. You don't have to become a Buddhist, or adopt any particular religious faith. Everybody has the potential to lead a peaceful, meaningful life.** We must explore as far as we can how that can be brought about. The calamity of 9/11 demonstrated that modern technology and human intelligence guided by hatred can lead to immense destruction. Such terrible acts are a violent symptom of an afflicted mental state. To respond wisely and effectively, we need to be guided by more healthy states of mind, not just to avoid feeding the flames of hatred, but to respond skillfully. We would do well to remember that the war against hatred and terror can be waged on this, the internal front, too. I try to put these methods into effect in my own life. When I hear bad news, especially the tragic stories I often hear from my fellow Tibetans, naturally my own response is sadness. However, by placing it in context, I find I can cope reasonably well. And feelings of helpless anger, which simply poison the mind and embitter the heart, seldom arise, even following the worst news. **If humanity is to survive, happiness and inner balance are crucial.

[Spread the news](https://www.WantToKnow.info/emailmk).** **Preface** The Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] bought my services at the tender age of four from my grandfather in 1952. Over the next 12 years, I was tested, trained, and used in various ways. Electroshock, drugs, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, and other types of trauma were used to make me compliant and split my personality (create multiple personalities for specific tasks). Each *alter* or personality was created to respond to a post-hypnotic trigger, then perform an act and not remember it later. This \"Manchurian Candidate\" program [[1]](#_edn1) was just one of the operational uses of the mind control scenario by the CIA. Your hard earned tax dollars supported this. P. xvii The CIA financed research project code-named MKULTRA was established to counter Soviet and Chinese advances in brainwashing and interrogation techniques. It consisted of 149 subprojects contracted out to at least 80 institutions. It was designed to study the use of biological and chemical materials in altering human behavior. CIA Director Allen Dulles approved MKULTRA on April 13, 1953. Twenty years after the conception of the MKULTRA project, all known files pertaining to it were ordered destroyed by [then CIA Director] Richard Helms before he retired. In 1977, through a Freedom of Information Act [FOIA] request, 16,000 pages of mind control documents were found, held as part of the Agency's financial history. Most of the important details were conveniently destroyed to conceal their wrongdoing. p. xvi, xvii As a survivor of CIA programs Bluebird/Artichoke [[2]](#_edn2) and MKULTRA, I began my intense search to document some of the mind control experiments that I was made part of. 48 years after I was first experimented on, through a series of FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] requests to various departments of the government, I found solid proof of my memories-nearly 18,000 pages of declassified documents from the Bluebird/Artichoke and MKULTRA programs that validate my personal experiences. P. xvii One of the documents states, [[3]](#_edn3) \"Learning studies will be instituted in which the subject will be rewarded or punished for his overall performance and reinforced in various ways-with electric shock, etc. In other cases drugs and psychological tricks will be used to modify attitudes. The experimenters will be particularly interested in dissociative states [multiple personalities or *alters*], and an attempt will be made to induce a number of states of this kind,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nationbetrayed10pg.txt:0:e8bb09c8e591", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13531, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nationbetrayed10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nationbetrayed10pg", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "that validate my personal experiences.

The experimenters will be particularly interested in dissociative states [multiple personalities or *alters*], and an attempt will be made to induce a number of states of this kind, using hypnosis.\" The government had finally handed me the validation I had been searching for. P. xvii, xviii My goal in writing this book is to expose the misuse of power that took place in this country during the Cold War. Thousands of innocent children who have now grown into adults are silently suffering from the effects of experiments that were done to them by their own government. Many have been diagnosed incorrectly and institutionalized. Some died because they knew too much. Others, like myself, were able to obtain competent medical help, and are struggling to heal from the physical and mental ravages upon our beings. P. xviii For skeptics, no proof will be enough. For others, like myself, unraveling the bizarre nature of my memories has allowed me to regain control of my life. My greatest gift of healing has been to no longer operate out of fear, but from a rational, logical based reality. Will we let this story lay in the shadows forever, or do we have the courage to address these wrongs and give survivors back their voices? You be the judge. P. xix **A Star is Born** It was May of 1944. Daddy was barely out of basic training when our baby brother got sick with pneumonia causing daddy to go AWOL, at least that's the story he always told. When the Navy caught up with him, he was thrown in the brig. Experiments like those under MKULTRA subproject 39 at the Ionia State Prison in Michigan were instituted to see if you could hypnotize a child molester and get him to divulge his ugly little secrets. They were looking for a \"Truth Drug\" that could be used on spies. A combination of drugs and hypnosis were used for interrogation. [[4]](#_edn4) Tests in the brig indicated Daddy was holding very dark secrets. The government knew that at some later date this could be useful information. Blackmail was the oldest game in the book. P. 1, 2 The Reich surrendered on May 7, 1945. In 1946, President Truman authorized Project Paperclip [[5]](#_edn5)[[6]](#_edn6) to exploit German scientists for American research, and to deny these intellectual resources to the Soviet Union. A 1999 report to the Senate and the House said that \"between 1945 and 1955, 765 scientists, engineers, and technicians were brought to the US under Paperclip and similar programs.

A 1999 report to the Senate and the House said that \"between 1945 and 1955, 765 scientists, engineers, and technicians were brought to the US under Paperclip and similar programs. [[7]](#_edn7) Some of the reports bluntly pointed out that they were \"ardent Nazis.\" Some of the experts were accused of participating in murderous medical experiments on human subjects at concentration camps. P. 2, 3, xi In 1947, President Truman specifically assigned the CIA responsibility for covert psychological operations. CIA personnel were not opposed to working with Nazi doctors who had proven to be proficient in breaking the mind and rebuilding it. In some cases military bases were used to hide these covert activities. P. 7, xvii In December of 1947, I was born. P. 7 Since I was just a baby in diapers when my dad started abusing me, I learned to go someplace else in my head to preserve my sanity. After awhile, when my grandfather started doing the same things and worse, I learned to dissociate even more. I began creating separate parts of personalities to hold the memories of this trauma. The technical term is *alters*. P. 13 Grandpa brought with him the pedophilic traits of his forefathers. I was not the first child to star in his pornographic films, which were distributed to some very wealthy, notable figures, probably through the mob. Having found this out, the CIA took advantage of this to enlist grandpa's cooperation. When I was four, this big shot from the CIA paid a visit to grandpa. They were looking for children who had the ability to disassociate from reality for a project named Bluebird/Artichoke. He talked about patriotism and how grandpa could become a big shot and get money for helping to rid the world of Commies. He just had to let the CIA perform a few little experiments on me. National security was at stake. That day, it was decided that in exchange for some money and freedom from prosecution for making child pornography, I would become the government's little experiment. P. 11 - 13 In a memo [[8]](#_edn8) six months before I was first used in experiments, Bluebird states that practical research was to be conducted. The nature of this research [was] to include these specific problems: Can we create by post-[hypnotic] control an action contrary to an individual's moral principles? Can we \"alter\" a person's personality? What would be the fastest way to induce SI and H conditions? Can we \"condition\" by post-H [hypnotic] suggestion agency employees to prevent them from giving information to any unauthorized source? Can we by H and SI techniques force", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nationbetrayed10pg.txt:2:7c1f0b4e9d0a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13533, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nationbetrayed10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nationbetrayed10pg", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "experiments, Bluebird states that practical research was to be conducted.

Can we \"condition\" by post-H [hypnotic] suggestion agency employees to prevent them from giving information to any unauthorized source? Can we by H and SI techniques force a subject to travel long distances, commit specified acts and return to us or bring documents or materials? Can we in a matter of an hour, one day, etc., induce an H condition in an unwilling subject to such an extent that he will perform an act for our benefit? Could we seize a subject and in the space of an hour or two by post-H control have him crash an airplane, wreck a train, etc.? Can we guarantee total amnesia under any and all conditions? Can we devise a system for making unwilling subjects into willing agents, and then transfer control to agency agents in the field by use of codes or identifying signs? P. 13, 14 Many of the mind control experiments that were carried out under MKULTRA were done out of fear that the Russians were in the forefront of this field. In a CIA report made public in the late 60s, they estimated the technical staff of one Soviet parapsychology laboratory at 300 physicists, doctors, biochemists, and electrical engineers. The \"Red Scare\" promoted by Joe McCarthy was the overriding theme of why \"Anything Goes\" when it came to these experiments. P. 66 The following day, I was put in a white panel van with my little suitcase. [After arriving somewhere in Detroit] intense electroshock was delivered [[9]](#_edn9) in order to allow my mind to dissociate and create Samantha who would never feel pain. In the future, whenever I was to be put through a torturous painful experience, Samantha would automatically be the *alter* who took over the body. She would hide the memory and the pain from the rest of my system. P. 15, 18 Guy was created, and in the coming years would display psychic abilities [[10]](#_edn10) that the CIA found very useful. Guy was taught to store all the anger and hatred accumulated during abuse and use it psychically. The CIA proposed a three to five year research project for exceptionally gifted individuals who could obtain perfect and scattered ESP test performance. Since I displayed psychic abilities, they trained Guy to use these abilities in a way they hoped would benefit the agency. The CIA then made sure that this project would never be made known. The document says, \"It would be necessary to be exceedingly careful about thorough cloaking of the undertaking.\" [[11]](#_edn11) P. 19, 20 My Baby part grew to love and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nationbetrayed10pg.txt:3:b56fefdd69fc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13534, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nationbetrayed10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nationbetrayed10pg", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "to five year research project for exceptionally gifted individuals who could obtain perfect and scattered ESP test performance.

A deep bonding took place with Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, Directorate of Operations of the Technical Services Staff (TSS) of CIA in charge of their behavioral program through MKULTRA. [[12]](#_edn12) No matter what experiment he was to make me a part of, I would love and remain loyal to the man who my baby alter considered sole supplier of the basics of life, food, and love. P. 19 **Men Behind the Shadow Government** 1953 proved to be an important year for mind control when Allen Dulles [[13]](#_edn13) was confirmed Director of the CIA. Dulles authorized Operation MKULTRA. Originally established as a supplementary funding mechanism to the ARTICHOKE project, MKULTRA quickly grew into a mammoth undertaking that outflanked earlier mind control initiatives. In 1978, Admiral Stansfield Turner, Director of the CIA, testified that 140 Subprojects appeared to have connection with research into behavioral modification, drug acquisition and testing or administering drugs surreptitiously. P. 28 Among the 15 categories of subprojects were: Effects of behavior drugs & alcohol: 6 subprojects involving tests on unwitting human beings. Hypnosis: 8 subprojects, including two involving hypnosis and drugs in combination. Single subprojects in such areas as the effects of electroshock, harassment techniques, analysis of extrasensory perception [ESP], and gas propelled sprays and aerosols. [[14]](#_edn14) P. 29 Under Dulles, MKULTRA funneled funds to 185 non-government researchers and assistants working for 80 institutions. These institutions included 44 colleges or universities, 15 research foundations or chemical or pharmaceutical companies, 12 hospitals or clinics, and 3 penal institutions. [[15]](#_edn15) Dulles cared little for the methods that were used to accomplish the secret projects he funded. His brother John Foster Dulles was US Secretary of State from 1953-1959. In *Containing Communism,* Mr. Dulles was quoted as saying, \"President Eisenhower surrendered all his power to me.\" [[16]](#_edn16) As long as John Foster Dulles was Secretary of State, Allen Dulles had no need to \"chafe under political control.\" [[17]](#_edn17) P. 29, 30 In January 1951, high commissioner of occupied Germany John McCloy [[18]](#_edn18) announced that only five of the 15 death sentences from the Nuremberg judgments would be carried out. He then reduced the sentences of 64 out of the remaining 74 war criminals. One third of these were to be released immediately. He also reduced the sentences of all remaining convicted doctors who had experimented on concentration camp inmates. McCloy", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nationbetrayed10pg.txt:4:757ce06688aa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13535, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nationbetrayed10pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nationbetrayed10pg", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "no need to \"chafe under political control.\" [[17]](#_edn17) P. 29, 30 In January 1951, high commissioner of occupied Germany John McCloy [[18]](#_edn18) announced that only five of the 15 death sentences from the Nuremberg judgments would be carried out. He then reduced the sentences of 64 out of the remaining 74 war criminals. One third of these were to be released immediately. He also reduced the sentences of all remaining convicted doctors who had experimented on concentration camp inmates. McCloy had sat in Adolf Hitler's box at the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin. P. 31 Prior to the war, McCloy was a senior partner with Milbank, Tweed, whose most important client was the Rockefeller family's bank, Chase National. In 1947, McCloy was named to head the World Bank. McCloy and two other board members spent three months in Nelson Rockefeller's personal home organizing the bank along commercial lines. [[19]](#_edn19) In the 50s, McCloy became chairman of Chase National Bank and David Rockefeller became his protégé. P. 32 Nelson Rockefeller [[20]](#_edn20) was appointed Special Assistant for Psychological Strategy in 1954. Officially, Nelson was to give advice and assistance in the development of increased understanding and cooperation among all peoples. Unofficially, the nature of the post was Presidential Coordinator for the CIA. As part of Nelson's responsibilities, he attended meetings of the Cabinet, the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, and the National Security Council-the highest policy making body in the government. He also functioned as the head of a secret unit called the Planning Coordination Group, consisting of himself, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the head of the CIA. [[21]](#_edn21) P. 34 In 1979, John Loftus, working for the Office of Special Investigations, made a trip to Maryland to search the classified files for information on Nazi's that had been brought into the country. He was astounded to find 20 underground vaults crammed floor to ceiling with classified files. [[22]](#_edn22) Loftus says that Nelson Rockefeller and Vice President Nixon supervised the cover-up and burial of these files so that President Eisenhower could claim \"plausible deniability.\" [[23]](#_edn23) In fact, years later when President Gerald Ford established a presidential commission to investigate the CIA, Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller was named to head it. [[24]](#_edn24) P. 34 A 1951 declassified document [[25]](#_edn25) clarifies the kind of people that were employed by the CIA to teach hypnotism. \"On 2 July 1951, instruction began with [deleted] relating some of his sexual experiences. [Deleted] stated the he had constantly used hypnotism as a means of inducing young girls to engage in sexual intercourse with him.

Shadow Government was indeed an appropriate name for the people who would move behind the scenes to enlist children to fight their Cold War for them by making them guinea pigs, and in some cases hypnotized operatives, couriers, spies, and assassins. P. 35 **Training for the Agency** \"Precautions must be taken not only to protect operations from exposure to enemy forces, but also to conceal these activities from the American public in general. The knowledge that the Agency is engaging in unethical and illicit activities would have serious repercussions in political circles, and would be detrimental to the accomplishment of its mission.\" Quote from the CIA Inspector General in assessing the benefits of Mind Control Research. [[26]](#_edn26) P. 37 I was told that I worked for \"The Agency.\" It was in actuality, key men and women in the CIA and other branches of the government, in league with certain extremely wealthy individuals who wanted to remain in the shadows shaping the outcome of world events. As Lt. Col. Roberts said when he testified before a special joint committee of the Wisconsin State Legislature, \"The most secret knowledge, a science which outdates history, is the science of control over people, governments and civilizations. The foundation of this ultimate discipline is the control of wealth. Through the control of wealth comes the control of public information. Through the control of news media comes thought control. A significant portion of the American public is yet to become aware of the Invisible Government of Monetary Power.\" P. 37 Early on, an information hot line was established between the people of money and power-people like Allen Dulles, Sid Gottlieb, Richard Nixon, and others. This hotline enabled them to be kept informed of the content of these experiments, and who was participating. They, in turn, found ways of blackmailing certain of these politicians, doctors, and scientists, so that they could control and manipulate some of the experiments. Many of the experiments started in MKULTRA continued behind the scenes independent of most of our government Black Projects.

P. 38 Former CIA/DIA deep-cover agent \"Chip\" Tatum [[29]](#_edn29) takes this a step further when he speaks of a group he calls \"Pegasus.\" He says that this group operated on behalf of the US and other governments, undertaking tasks that ranged from narcotics smuggling to assassinations. The mission of Pegasus, Tatum explains is \"to align world leaders and financiers to our [US] policies and standards.\" P. 38 Less you dismiss this as just another conspiracy theory, in November 1998 in an interview with *The Observer*, [[30]](#_edn30) former US Ambassador to Chile Edward Korry told a remarkable story. Korry described still classified cables, and information censored in papers, but now available under the FOIA. He had served under Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. He told how US companies from Cola to copper used the CIA as an international debt collection agency and investment security force. *The Observer* reported that the CIA's Oct. 1970 plot to overthrow Chile's Allende was the result of a plea for action a month earlier by PepsiCo chairman Kendall to the company's former lawyer, President Nixon. P. 39 The mind-controlled parts of me were told they had a \"Nobler Purpose\" and that they \"must survive at any cost.\" Yet, suicide programs were layered into my system in the event that I should start to heal and tell.

I was forced to participate in a traumatizing initiation rite of manhood for my 12-year-old brother on Grandfather's pool table. I was to totally lose my sexual self to a new persona created from the trauma I was forced to endure. Grandfather gave the new part the name Carlotta. From that day, he trained her in various ways to please one particular man. He was a very wealthy man who I knew as Rocky. He contributed large sums of money to the \"Cause.\" Consequently, whatever he wanted, he got. P. 41, 42 Two years later my grandfather and an uncle used the basement for their kiddy porn productions. One afternoon, Grandfather walked over to the incinerator door and motioned for me to come over. He proceeded to push my head into the opening. He made it very clear that ashes were all that would remain of me if I didn't cooperate. Sometimes I would be alone and asked to pose in what I now know were provocative poses. Other times Grandfather would have some of the other grandchildren there with me. The fear he was able to produce guaranteed cooperation. P. 42 Momma ran away from home. Daddy told us that if we would only be better children, she wouldn't run away. Guilt was a wonderful control mechanism and daddy used it effectively every chance he got. He had such control over momma that she never had a chance. He tracked momma down at her sister's home several hundred miles away where she thought she had escaped him. He brought her home, and into the mental hospital she went. P. 43, 44 I was a physical and emotional wreck from the nightly molestations. My hands shook uncontrollably all of the time, and I was unable to eat or sleep. My brothers took to calling me \"Jervous and Nerky.\" Momma had undergone a series of electric shocks that left her a walking zombie. So much of her memory was gone that she had to relearn a lot of personal information she had forgotten. P. 44, 45 Momma wasn't alone in receiving electroshock to make her more submissive and alter her personality. Dr. Ewen Cameron of McGill University in Montreal, Canada was doing MKULTRA experiments with electroshock and drugs for the CIA. Dr. Cameron was later elected president of the American Psychiatric Association in 1953 and went on to become the first president of the World Psychiatric Association. Such a notable list of accomplishments for a heartless man whose experiments would rival some that took place in Nazi Germany.

Such a notable list of accomplishments for a heartless man whose experiments would rival some that took place in Nazi Germany. P. 46 Cameron's experiments funded under MKULTRA Subproject 68 were called depatterning or \"psychic driving.\" He combined electro convulsive therapy [ECT] with chemically induced sleep therapy. The intensive electroshocks used in these experiments were not the same form of ECT used routinely in the treatment of depression. Both the voltage and the number of shocks administered were greatly increased. Instead of stopping after the procedure had induced one grand mal seizure, the subjects were shocked again and again until no further seizures could be elicited. There was no question that this was a profoundly intrusive and destructive form of electroshock, which was far different from that which was conventionally used for therapeutic purposes. [[31]](#_edn31) P. 46, 47 While sleeping, patients would be forced to listen to messages designed to reprogram their behavior. Cameron wrote that psychic driving provided a way to make \"direct, controlled changes in personality.\" Working with his assistant Leonard Rubenstein, Cameron experimented with sensory deprivation combined with drugs to break down the subject's will and leave them open to the taped messages. In an August 2, 1977 *New York Times* interview, Rubenstein admitted that their work was directly related to brainwashing. P. 47 I was about 12 years old, and what Dr. Cameron did to me became burned in my mind. First, I was given a shot of curare and placed in a box in a converted stable behind the hospital that housed a behavioral laboratory. Then snakes were put over my body and the lid was closed in the box. I was completely conscious, but unable to move as a result of the curare. This was to insure that I would never speak about what was to come later. [[32]](#_edn32) At the end of my programming by Dr. Cameron, a [taped] voice gave me trigger codes for self-destruction. This was done to prevent me from telling about the nature of this experiment in the event I would ever begin to remember. P. 48, 52 From January 1957 until September 1960, Dr. Cameron's project received $64,242.44 in CIA funds. [[33]](#_edn33) When the CIA stopped funding him, Cameron received $57,750 from the Canadian government to continue his research.

[[36]](#_edn36) P. 52, 53 John Gittinger, CIA agent and psychologist, was Ewen Cameron's project officer. In testimony before Congress on August 3, 1977, Gittinger responds to Senator Kennedy's questions on his involvement. \"The general idea ... is that brainwashing was largely a process of isolating a human being, keeping him out of contact, putting him out of control, putting him under long stress in relationship to interviewing and interrogation, and that they could produce any change that way.\" P. 53 In one of the experiments, I was forced to lie on a table with my head immobilized. Dr. Penfield inserted an electrode into the sleeve guides that were already imbedded in my head. I do not remember who put the sleeve guides in. I only know that the methods had been developed by Dr. John Lilly. P. 60, 61 Dr. Lilly said that his experiments had proven that electrical stimuli in specific areas of the brain could cause either intense rewarding or intense punishing experiences in humans. He summarized, \"At any time an adult human being can be reduced to the childish level. Such a state can be induced by lack of sleep, by starvation, by torture, by isolation, by profound confinement, by drugs, by direct electrical stimulation. An adult can be forced to learn by means almost thoroughly beyond his control. I am speaking here of powerful means used ruthlessly with few scruples.\" [[37]](#_edn37) P. 62 Dr. Lilly describes the technique of electrode implantation. [[38]](#_edn38) \"Electrodes could be implanted in the brain without using anesthesia. During the process of implantation, there was no more pain than that of a needle prick in the scalp. Short lengths of hypodermic needle tubing equal in length to the thickness of the skull were quickly pounded through the scalp into the skull. These stainless steel guides furnished passageways for the insertion of electrodes into the brain to any desired distance. Because of the small size of the sleeve guides, the scalp quickly recovered from the small hole made in it, and the sleeve guide remained imbedded in the bone for months to years.

P. 62, 67 Most survivors seem to have more than one level of programming. [[39]](#_edn39) P. 67 Alpha is general programming within the control personality. Beta is sexual programming, i.e. child pornography, prostitution, and sexual training used for the benefit of a handler for blackmail or personal use. This programming eliminates all learned moral conviction from the survivor, so that the function can be carried out without inhibition. Delta is a trained killer, a sleeping assassin. Delta survivors feel no fear and have been trained in the use of specialized arms and alternative methods of disposal. Theta is psychic killing. Most survivors with Theta programming exhibit an unusually high level of ESP in their day-to-day lives. Omega is self-destruct programming installed in the event a survivor would start remembering. It was used to prevent them from going public. There generally is self-destruct programming associated with Delta assassin programming if the survivor is captured. P. 67 As explained in *Secret Weapons*, [[40]](#_edn40) Gottlieb turned children into warriors who would be perfect Manchurian candidates, perfect spies and assassins ignorant of their orders, fitting into society easily and anonymously, until a code is used to awaken them and send them into action. P. 68 **Dr. Black** Mind control survivors have identified doctors used by the CIA under Project MKULTRA as having used different aliases. I have personally spoken and corresponded with many of these child Cold War survivors. It seems colors were one of the most commonly used themes. Many survivors have identified Josef Mengele as using the aliases Dr. Green, Dr. Black, Dr. Swartz (black in German), Father Joseph, or Vaterchen (daddy) when he did their programming. The experiments and programming he used on us were of such a heinous nature, that they were not unlike some of those performed at Auschwitz. P. 69 In 1937, Mengele [[41]](#_edn41) was appointed research assistant at the Third Reich Institute for Heredity, Biology, and Racial Purity. Mengele provided \"experimental materials\" to the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology from twins including eyes, blood, and other body parts from Auschwitz.

According to the French, Mengele \"was released without explanation by the Americans on November 19, 1946.\" The French claimed that American authorities confirmed the Mengele arrest and release on Feb. 29, 1947. [[44]](#_edn44) P. 70, 71 This is [one] survivor's account of contact with this escapee from Nazi Germany. \"The insidious part of his work with me was the love thing. He would love me and torture me. One of Mengele's favorite phrases was, 'Pain is pleasure, and pleasure is pain, my dear. I am here to make you very happy! You will love me forever!' I remember being on the floor with him playing piano in nothing but his boots and a tuxedo coat with tails, as he ordered the men working with him to shock me with cattle prods while he played. It was sort of like musical chairs. When he stopped playing, they stopped shocking; or when he played, they stopped, according to which rules he used that week!\" P. 80 I, too, was privy to Mengele's torture in 1956 when I was almost nine years old. I was placed in one of these cages, and like the others, deprived of food and water. I became very cold and continually hunched over to hide my nakedness. Every time I tried to sleep, someone with a cattle prod reached through the bars and poked me. The purpose of all this torture was to prepare us for programming. There was a hospital where each of us was taken after the torture made us compliant. P. 81, 82 Another survivor reports \"abuse to create many traumatized alters to use in programming more specific functions later on. Mengele split the alters so that one would remember him being very loving, but it included a lot of sexual abuse, and other parts would experience terror at his cruelty. With the first alter, he created the experience that he was inside our mind being very nurturing and teaching her [the alter] that she will always want only him. With another alter, he was mean, creating a rage alter by killing a little boy she had felt bonded with as her little protector.\" P. 84 Another survivor says, \"Using me as their guinea pig, Dr. Black taught dad how to create alter states in children.

He would begin by traumatizing the host personality, and then traumatize each resulting alter state until it went 'under.' Each time a part went under, and a new part with no memory emerged, dad assigned this part of the broken personality a name. He recorded the names and traits each alter-state [had]. Being an engineer, he usually used flowcharts and blueprints.\" P. 84 \" Yet another survivor, \"Dr. Black somehow attached chains to my wrists and ankle. He inserted the object into me 'down there' from behind. When the charge hits the nervous system, everything hurts and contracts in a hellish fashion. I did start saying aloud over and over again, 'I'm sorry' (for what, it didn't matter) and 'I'll be a good girl, I promise, I promise....' He may have hypnotized me, because his eyes got darker as I looked up at them, and I heard his left fingers snap and the shackles were gone. I thought he was a magician. That made him seem all the more powerful to me. After that, he told me that only with him would I be safe. I understood that if I stayed loyal to him, I would not be hurt again. The doctor told dad the he, the doctor, and others worked on each person until they were ready to do whatever they were told. He said the final test had been for friends and close relatives of the prisoners to be brought there. The prisoners were then ordered to attack their loved ones and kill them. He also talked about breeding. Dad was considered 'closer' to perfection because he had the blond hair and gray-blue eyes and was in excellent physical condition.\" P. 87 - 89 In 1998, Congress passed a law requiring declassification of Nazi war criminals files held by US intelligence agencies. The CIA had refused to acknowledge the existence of these records up, not unlike their continued denial of many other things until they are faced with irrefutable evidence from outside sources. 10,000 pages of declassified CIA files were released on April 27, 2001, detailing working relationships with some of the same Nazi's that were wanted for war crimes. P. 97 The web of secrecy that made the Holocaust possible is the same web that allowed innocent children in the US to become victims of their government's fear of communism.

If we allow that web of secrecy to continue because it is too painful and horrifying to read about and believe, nothing will prevent it from happening again. Too many children, including myself, were systematically brainwashed. Our minds became our concentration camp. Only now by healing and speaking out, have we become liberated. P. 98 **Conclusion** Four years into marriage, my programming started to deteriorate and my memories began to haunt me. My struggle to free myself was the most difficult road I had walked. Many times I survived solely because others believed I could. I cried enough tears in the last ten years to turn the Sahara desert into an oasis. As the healing continued, I found a new person hiding beneath the splintered diamonds of my personality. Integrating the facets of these troubled pieces of myself came as I understood that I no longer had to walk the trail of tears from the past. I could at last be free to choose my path. It was all such a marvelous discovery-this freedom of mind, this tranquility, this peace. P. 102 My handlers no longer contact me. The last time they tried by phone to activate an alter with preprogrammed cues, they failed. The man who phoned was extremely upset. He and so many others believed our programming would never break down. What they could never foresee was the indomitable fighting nature that perhaps they themselves had instilled. The need to find the truth and expose it was much larger than the fear they used to control me. P. 103 I don't believe I'm special. I'm just one of many Cold War children who were convenient lab rats for a group of despicable people. I thank God for the accountants of the world and the records they keep. Without those MKULTRA, Bluebird, and Artichoke documents, my story would sound like just science fiction. By exposing the truth, I have at last been able to free much of my own hatred and pain. Understanding, speaking the truth, and forgiveness frees. The truth can set us free.

A child who is removed from a hostile environment and then placed in an environment where it receives protection, can recover and lead a productive life. P. 101 We too, as a nation, can recover form the horrendous effects of this abuse of power, if we will only speak out. We must not let this lay dormant in the shadows of secrecy any longer. We can bury the hardships and deceit of the past by building a government that is worthy of our trust. The foundation of that trust must be built on truth, not secrecy.

Originally an atheist, Dr. Newton was convinced by dramatic healing experiences several decades ago with two of his hypnotherapy clients that past lives are real and can even influence our current lives. Once he became convinced of this, Dr. Newton was determined to find out what happens to souls from the moment they die until the moment they are reborn. Becoming known and respected worldwide for his research in this field, he worked with thousands of patients to uncover a map of the afterlife that is as profound as it is inspiring. **This book is in [my top five](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mostinspiringtransformational#books) of all time favorite books.** I highly recommend reading the whole book. And for those with limited time, read the key excerpts below so you can at least get a rich taste of what Dr. Newton's work has to offer. Take care and enjoy your explorations! With very best wishes for a transformed world, [Fred Burks](https://www.WantToKnow.info/aboutus#burks) for the [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org) empowerment websites **Note:** I personally have had several profoundly transformative experiences with hypnotherapy.

This book is an intimate journal about the spirit world. It provides a series of actual case histories which reveal in explicit detail what happens to us when life on Earth is over. You will be taken beyond the spiritual tunnel and enter the spirit world itself to learn what transpires for souls before they finally return to Earth in another life. Michael Duff Newton holds a doctorate in Counseling Psychology, is a certified Master Hypnotherapist and a member of the American Counseling Association. **The Death Experience** In my practice ... I stumbled on to a discovery of enormous proportions. I found it was possible to see into the spirit world through the mind's eye of a hypnotized subject who could report back to me of life between lives on Earth. **The astounding thing I found as I progressed with my research was that once subjects were regressed back into their soul state, they all displayed a remarkable consistency in responding to questions about the spirit world. People even use the same words and graphic descriptions in colloquial language when discussing their lives as souls.** I am not a religious person, but [through this research] I found the place where we go after death to be one of order and direction. I have come to appreciate that there is a grand design to life and afterlife. My clients say after recalling former death experiences they are so filled with rediscovered freedom from their earthbound bodies that they are anxious to get started on their spiritual journey to a place of peace and familiarity. All these people report a euphoric sense of freedom and brightness around them. Some of my subjects see brilliant whiteness totally surrounding them at the moment of death, while others observe the brightness is farther away from an area of darker space through which they are being pulled. This is often referred to as the tunnel effect, and has become well known with the public. Dr. N: And what does the process of moving out of your body actually feel like to you? S: Well, it's as if I shed my skin ... peeling a banana. I just lose my body in one swoosh! Dr. N: Is the feeling unpleasant? S: Oh no! It's wonderful to feel so free with no more pain, but ... I am ... disoriented ... I didn't expect to die... **The location of the tunnel in relation to the Earth has some variations between the accounts of my subjects.

I am ... disoriented ... I didn't expect to die... **The location of the tunnel in relation to the Earth has some variations between the accounts of my subjects. Some newly dead people see it opening up ... right over their bodies, while others say they move high above the Earth before they enter the tunnel.** S: I'm not scared. When I was in the tunnel, I was more ... disoriented. Yes, I feel secure ... I'm aware of thoughts reaching out to me... of caring ... nurturing. It is strange, but there is also the understanding around me of just who I am and why I am here now. Dr. N: Do you see any evidence of this around you? S: (in a hushed tone) No, I sense it-a harmony of thought everywhere. I enjoy hearing from subjects about their first images of the spirit world. People may see fields of wildflowers, castle towers rising in the distance, or rainbows under an open sky when returning to this place of adoration after an absence. The most common type of reaction I hear is a relieved sigh followed by something on the order of, \"Oh, wonderful, I'm home in this beautiful place again.\" When the soul sees images in the spirit world which relate to places they have lived or visited on Earth, there is a reason. An unforgotten home, school, garden, mountain, or seashore are seen by souls because a benevolent spiritual force allows for terrestrial mirages to comfort us by their familiarity. Our planetary memories never die-they whisper forever into the soul-mind on the winds of mythical dreams, just as images of the spirit world do so within the human mind. **Guides and the Reception Committee** New arrivals in the spirit world have little time to float around wondering where they are or what is going to happen to them next. Our guides and a number of soulmates and friends wait for us close to the gateway to provide recognition, affection, and the assurance we are all right. Our reception committee is planned in advance for us as we enter the spirit world. Most of my subjects report the first person they see in the spirit world is their personal guide. However, after any life we can be met by a soulmate. The size of welcoming parties not only changes for everyone after each life, but is drastically reduced to almost nothing for more advanced souls where spiritual comfort becomes less necessary. **The emotional meetings which take place between souls at this interval in a spiritual passage are only a prelude to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__journey-of-souls-life-between-lives.txt:2:e8290dc21936", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13553, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__journey-of-souls-life-between-lives.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__journey-of-souls-life-between-lives", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "world.

The first type we call ghosts. These spirits refuse to go home after physical death and often have unpleasant influences on those of us who would like to finish out our own human lives in peace. [The second type are] souls who have been so severely damaged they are detached from the mainstream of souls going back to a spiritual home base. Compared to all returning entities, the number of these abnormal souls is not large. However, what has happened to them on Earth is significant because of the serious effect they have on other incarnated souls. The concept of souls having fallibility comes as a surprise to some people. The statements of [my] clients indicate most of us are still far from perfect beings in the spirit world. The essential purpose of reincarnation is self-improvement. [And] we still have free will, even in death. **Does hell exist to permanently separate good souls from bad ones? All my case work with the spirits of my subjects has convinced me there is no residence of terrible suffering for souls, except on Earth. I am told all souls go to one spirit world after death where everyone is treated with patience and love.** **The Space of Healing and Life Evaluation** After those entities who meet us during our homecoming have dispersed, we are ready to be taken to a space of healing. In this place we are often examined by our guide. I think of the healing station as a field hospital, or MASH unit, for damaged souls coming off Earth's battlefields. Dr. N: Give me as much detail as possible about what you experience here. S: I'm propelled in and I see a bright warm beam. It reaches out to me as a stream of liquid energy.

There is a ... vapor-like ... steam swirling around me at first ... then gently touching my soul as if it were alive. Then it is absorbed into me as fire and I am bathed and cleansed from my hurts. My essence is being bathed ... restoring me after my exposure to Earth. **This place I have come to call the shower of healing is only a prelude for the rehabilitation of returning souls. The orientation stage which immediately follows (especially with younger souls), involves a substantial counseling session with one's guide. The newly refreshed soul arrives at this station to undergo a debriefing of the life just ended.** People in hypnosis who discuss the type of counseling which goes on during orientation say their guides are gentle but probing. There is no such thing here as punishment-that's an Earth condition. Imagine your favorite elementary school teacher and you have the idea. And no subterfuge or deception exists in [this] telepathic world. Yet the stupid things we did in life hit us hard in orientation. Dr. N: Now that you are near [your guide] Clodees, do you think he is as upset as you are over this past life? S: No, I'm more upset with myself over what I did and didn't do, and he knows that. Advisors can be displeased but they don't humiliate us. They are too superior for that. [So] at the end of every life, rather than having a monster waiting to devour our souls, we serve as our most severe critic in front of teacher-guides. Perpetrators of harm to others will do penance by setting themselves up as future victims in a karmic cycle of justice. [And] from what I have seen, no negative karma remains attached to a soul who is willing to work during their many lives on this planet. **Both positive and negative emotions are valued. If a soul only knew love and peace, it would gain no insight and never truly appreciate the value of these positive feelings. A soul grows by trying to overcome all negative emotions connected to fear through perseverance in many lifetimes, often returning to the spirit world bruised or hurt. Some of this negativity can be retained, even in the spirit world, and may reappear in another life with a new body. The test of reincarnation for a soul coming to Earth is the conquering of fear in a human body. ** Our eternal identity never leaves us alone.

In reflection, meditation, or prayer, the memories of who we really are do filter down to us in selective thought each day. In small, intuitive ways-through the cloud of amnesia-we are given clues for the justification of our being. **Soul Groups** All souls, regardless of experience, eventually arrive at a central port in the spirit world which I call the staging area. One of my clients described the staging area as resembling \"the hub of a great wagon wheel, where we are transported from a center along the spokes to our designated places.\" Dr. N: Explain to me how this pulling process works which will take you to your destination? S: I am riding on a wave ... a beam of light. Dr. N: Is this beam electromagnetic, or what? S: Well ... it's similar to the bands of a radio with someone turning the dial and finding the right frequency for me. Dr. N: Are you saying you are being guided by an invisible force without much voluntary control and that you can't speed things up as you did right after death? S: Yes. I must go with the wave bands of light ... the waves have direction and I'm flowing with it. It's easy. They do it all for you. It is at this vantage point in their return that souls begin to anticipate meeting others who wait for them. Souls consider themselves having finally arrived home when they rejoin familiar classmates in group settings. The souls represented in these cluster groups are intimate old friends who have about the same awareness level. Peer members have a sensitivity to each other which is far beyond our conception on Earth. S: Here no one is a stranger. There is a total lack of hostility toward anyone. Dr. N: You mean every spirit is friendly to every other spirit, regardless of prior associations in many settings? S: That's right, and it's more than just being friendly. Dr. N: In what way? S: We recognize a universal bond between us which makes us all the same. There is no suspicion toward each other. **The smaller sub-group primary clusters vary in number, containing anywhere from three to twenty-five souls.

As in any classroom situation, some students connect well with teachers and others less so. The analogy of spiritual schools directed by teacher-guides is used so often by people under hypnosis that it has become a habit for me to use the same terminology. Dr. N: Now would you explain to me what you and your friends actually do in this library setting? S: I go to my table and we all look at the books. Dr. N: Books? What sort of books? S: The life books. Dr. N: Describe them as best you can for me. S: They are picture books-thick white edges-two or three inches thick-quite large ... Dr. N: Open one of the life books for me and explain what you and your friends at the table see. S: (pause, while the subject's hands come together and move apart as though she were opening a book) There is no writing. Everything we see is in live pictures. Dr. N: Action pictures-different than photographs? S: Yes, they are multi-dimensional. They move ... shift ... from a center of ... crystal ... which changes with reflected light. Dr. N: So, the pictures are not flat, the moving light waves have depth? S: That's right, they are alive. Dr. N: Tell me how you and your friends use the books? S: Well, at first it's always out of focus when the book is opened. Then we think of what we want, the crystal turns from dark to light and ... gets into alignment. Then we can see ... in miniature ... our past lives and the alternatives. Dr. N: How is time treated in these books? S: By frames ... pages ... time is condensed by the life books. **The Council of Elders** After souls arrive back into their soul groups, they are summoned to appear before a Council of Elders. My subjects report that the initial orientation session with their guides prepares them to go before [this] panel of superior beings. A number of my cases have called these wise beings, directors and even judges, but most refer to them as a Council of Masters or Elders.

All soul evaluation conferences, be they with our guides, peers, or a panel of masters have one thing in common. The feedback and past life analysis we receive in terms of judgment is based upon the original intent of our choices as much as the actions of a lifetime. Our motivations are questioned and criticized, but not condemned in such a way as to make us suffer. **Our spiritual masters constantly remind us that because the human brain does not have an innate moral sense of ethics, conscience is the soul's responsibility. Nevertheless, there is overwhelming forgiveness in the spirit world. This world is ageless and so too are our learning tasks. We will be given other chances in our struggle for growth.** **Soul Creation, Growth, Guides, and Other Worlds** Learning begins with our creation as a soul and then accelerates with the first physical life assignment. With each incarnation, we grow in understanding, although we may slip back in certain lives before regaining our footing and advancing again. I have had many cases where a client has been incarnating for up to 30,000 years on Earth and is still in the lower levels of I and II. All beginner souls are assigned to a new group of souls at their level of understanding. There appears to be a systematic selection procedure for homogeneous groupings of souls. Similarities of ego, cognitive awareness, expression, and desire are all considerations. Cluster members [eventually work] together for such a long time in earth years that entities become accountable to each other and the group as a whole. This fosters a great sense of belonging in all spiritual groups. The important thing is to recognize our faults, avoid self-denial, and have the courage and self-sufficiency to make constant adjustments in our lives. It is important to understand that while we may suffer the consequences of bad choices in our educational tasks, we are always protected, supported, and directed ... by master souls.

I find some guides constantly helping their students on Earth, while others demand their charges work out lessons with little overt encouragement.** **My clients express all sorts of sentiments about their guides, but fear is not among them. On the contrary, people are more worried about being abandoned by spiritual advisors during difficult periods in their lives. Our relationship with guides is one of students and teachers rather than defendants and judges.** Dr. N: (To the client's guide) Begin by telling me in what way a company member on Earth can signal to get your attention. S: (after a long pause) First, they have to calm their minds and focus attention away from their immediate surroundings. Dr. N: How would they do this? S: By silence ... reaching inward ... to fasten on their inner voice. The energy of directed thought must override human emotion. Every soul has a spiritual higher power linked to its existence. [All souls are part of the same divine essence](https://www.wanttoknow.info/wingmakers) generated from one oversoul. This intelligent energy is universal in scope and so we all share in divine status. **Without addressing and overcoming pain you can never really connect with who you are and build on that. I must tell you, the more pain and adversity which come to you as a child, the more opportunity to expand your potential.** Dr. N: Earth is considered severe? S: Yes. On some worlds you must overcome physical discomforts-even suffering. Others lean toward mental contests. Earth has both. We get kudos for doing well on the hard worlds. (smiling) We are called the adventurous ones by those who don't travel much. S: Humans are egocentric but vulnerable. They can make their character mean and yet have a great capacity for kindness. There is weak and courageous behavior on Earth. It's always a push-me pull-you tug-of-war going on with human values. Dr. N: Do animals have souls? S: Yes, all living things do-but they have very simple fragments of mind energy. **I am repeatedly told that the soul itself is androgynous, and yet, in the same breath, clients declare sex is not an unimportant factor. ****Most of my subjects select the bodies of one gender over another 75 percent of the time.

A gender preference by a majority of earthbound souls does not mean they are unhappy the other 25 percent of the time as males or females.** Dr. N: [What about] advanced souls who keep coming back to life on Earth when they could stay in the spirit world. S: Oh, you mean the Sages? Dr. N: Yes, the Sages-tell me about them. S: (with admiration) They are the true watchers of Earth, you know ... to be here and keep watch over what is going on. They choose to stay and help people directly because they are dedicated to Earth. (wistfully) They live simple lives. I first came to know some of them thousands of years ago. Today it's hard to see them ... they don't like cities much. Dr. N: Perhaps the word Sage could also be applied to souls like [your master guide] Kumara, or even with the entities to whom she turns for knowledge? S: (pause) No, they are different ... they are beyond the Sages. We call them the Old Ones. Dr. N: Are there many Old Ones working with souls at Kumara's level and above? S: I don't think so ... but we feel their influence. Dr. N: What do you feel in their presence? S: (pensive) A ... concentrated power of enlightenment ... and guidance ... Dr. N: Could the Old Ones be embodiments of the source itself? S: It is not for me to say, but I don't think so yet. They must be close to the source. The Old Ones represent the purest elements of thought. Learning rates are different between souls because of character and integrity. Each soul is driven by its integrity. S: Intensity of desire is part of character. Dr. N: If character is the identity of a soul, where does desire come in? S: The drive to excel is internal to each soul, but this too can fluctuate between lives. Dr. N: So where does a soul's integrity fit into this? S: The extension of desire. Integrity is the desire to be honest about Self and motives to such an extent that full awareness of the path to the source is possible.

By that change new ingredients are added to the collective intelligence of every soul. Dr. N: And this is what incarnation on Earth is all about? S: Incarnation is an important tool, yes. **Some souls are driven more than others to expand and achieve their potential, but all of us will do so in the end. Being in many physical bodies and different settings expands the nature of our real self. Dr. N: And this sort of self-actualization of the soul identity is the purpose of life on our world? S: On any world.** A small percentage of my subjects, usually the older, advanced souls, are able to recall being in strange, non-human intelligent life-forms on other worlds. Their memories are rather fleeting and clouded about the circumstances of these lives. S: The Earth school is insecure, still. It is filled with resentment of many people over being led and antagonism of the leaders toward each other. There is so much fear to overcome here. It is a world in conflict because there is too much diversity among too many people. Earth's population has outpaced its mental development. Other worlds have low populations with more harmony. While speaking of a \"paradise planet\" with few people and a quieter, simpler version of Earth, he added this world was not far from Earth. \"Oh,\" I interrupted, \"then it must only be a few light years from Earth?\" He patiently explained that the planet was not in our universe, but closer to Earth than many planets in our own galaxy. [And] when a world dies, those entities with unfinished business move on to another world which has a suitable life form for the kind of work they have been doing. Cycles of incarnation for the eternal soul seem to be regulated more by the internal desires of a particular soul, than by the urgency of host bodies evolving in a universe of planets.

[Yet] there is a change when I take them into superconsciousness and the spirit world. Here they see the now of time as one homogeneous unit of past, present, and future. Dr. N: Can you describe the creator in more human terms? S: As the ultimate selfless being which we strive to be. Dr. N: If the source represents all the spirit world, how does this mental place differ from physical universes with stars, planets, and living things? S: Universes are created-to live and die-for the use of the source. In the beginning there is an outward migration of our soul energy from the source. Afterward, our lives are spent moving inward ... toward cohesion and the uniting S: ... There is an explosive release ... then a returning ... yes, the source pulsates. Dr. N: And you are moving toward the center of this energy source? S: There really is no center. The source is all around us, as if we were ... inside a beating heart. **S: Nothing is collapsing ... the source is endless. As souls we will never die-we know that, somehow. As we coalesce, our increasing wisdom makes the source stronger. Dr. N: So the source starts out by deliberately creating imperfect souls and imperfect life forms for these souls and watches what happens in order to extend itself? S: Yes, and we have to have faith in this decision and trust the process of returning to the origin of life. One has to be starving to appreciate food, to be cold to understand the blessings of warmth, and to be children to see the value of the parent. The transformation gives us purpose.** When I study the incarnation chronology of a client, I find there is usually a long span of hundreds, even thousands, of years between their lives in Paleolithic nomadic cultures. With the introduction of agriculture and domesticated animals in the Neolithic Age, from 7,000 to 5,000 years ago, my subjects report living more frequent lives. Still, their lives are often spaced as much as 500 years apart. With the rise of cities, trade, and more available food, I see the incarnation schedules of souls increasing with a growing population.

By the 1900s, living more than one life in a century is common among my cases. **Return to Earth** The rejuvenation of our energy and personal assessment of one's Self takes longer for some souls than others, but eventually the soul is motivated to start the process of incarnation. While our spiritual environment is hard to leave, as souls we also remember the physical pleasures of life on Earth with fondness and even nostalgia. **Once a soul has decided to incarnate again, the next stage in the return process is to be directed to the place of life selection. Souls consider when and where they want to go on Earth before making a decision on who they will be in their new life.** We start by having the opportunity of viewing how we might fit into certain environments in future time segments. Then our attention is directed to people living in these places. The space of orientation for incoming souls could be contrasted to the space of life selection for those who are leaving. Both involve life evaluations for souls in transit which include scenes from Earth, but there the resemblance ends. Orientation spaces are said to be small, intimate conference areas designed to make a newly arrived soul comfortable, but our mental attitude in this space can be somewhat defensive. This is because there is the feeling we might have done better with life. [And] a guide is always directly interacting with us. On the other hand, when we enter the space of life selection, we are full of hope, promise, and lofty expectations. Here souls are virtually alone, with their guides out of sight, while evaluating new life options. This hectic, stimulating place is described as being much larger than other spiritual study areas. [One client] considered it a world unto itself, where transcendent energy alters time to allow for planetary study. **While some spiritual locales are difficult for my subjects to describe, most love to talk about the place of life selection. They use remarkably similar descriptions. I am told it resembles a movie theater which allows souls to see themselves in the future playing different roles in various settings.

The screens come alive with images and there is color ... action ... full of light and sound. Dr. N: Keep reporting to me. Where is your soul in relation to the screens? S: I am hovering in the middle, watching the panorama of life all around me ... places ... people. My mind connects with the scanner to control the movement of the scenes I am watching. I suspend the scene on the screens so I can enter it. Dr. N: What? Are you saying you become part of the scene yourself? S: Yes, now I have direct access to the action. Dr. N: In what way? Do you become a person in the scene, or does your soul hover overhead while people move around? S: Both. I can experience what life is like with anyone in the scene, or just watch them from any vantage point.

Even as victims, we are beneficiaries because it is how we stand up to failure and duress which really marks our progress in life. **We don't need to change who we are in relation to life's experiences, only our negative reactions to these events. Souls returning from the place of life selection must not only sort out the best choice of who they are going to be in their next life, but coordinate this decision with other players in the coming drama. The space souls go to for this in the spirit world is commonly called the place of recognition, or recognition class. **Relationships between people are the most vital part of our lives. The lesson we must learn from human relationships is accepting people for who they are without expecting our happiness to be totally dependent upon anyone.** One of the last requirements before embarkation for many souls is to go before the Council of Elders for the second time. While some of my subjects see the Council only once between lives, most see them right after death and just before rebirth. The Elders want to reinforce the significance of a soul's goals for the next life. Apparently, everyone in a soul group respects the intensely private nature of these proceedings. They all see their individual Council of Elders as godly. Even senior guides are thought to be a couple of steps below the developmental level of the omnipotent beings who make up their councils. The Elders are bathed in bright light and the whole setting has an aura of divinity. A subject put it this way, \"when we are taken into the presence of these superior beings who exist in such a high spiritual realm, it validates our feelings about the source of creation.\" Sometimes my clients tell me they return to their spirit group after this meeting to say goodbye while others say they leave immediately for reincarnation. The latter procedure was used by a subject who described this exit meeting in the following manner. \"My guide, Magra, escorts me to a soft, white space which is like being", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__journey-of-souls-life-between-lives.txt:14:5b7fe56bfd74", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13565, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__journey-of-souls-life-between-lives.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__journey-of-souls-life-between-lives", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "into the presence of these superior beings who exist in such a high spiritual realm, it validates our feelings about the source of creation.\" Sometimes my clients tell me they return to their spirit group after this meeting to say goodbye while others say they leave immediately for reincarnation.

And then, as a final act to bolster my confidence when I am about to leave, they raise their arms and send a power bolt of positive energy into my mind to take with me.\" Dr. N: So you have mixed emotions about leaving the spirit world? S: Most of us do, as our time draws near. I have second thoughts before some lives ... but Pomar knows when I am lagging behind my schedule-you can't hide anything here, you know. All my subjects tell me the transition of their souls from the spirit world to the mind of a baby is relatively more rapid than the passage back [after death]. As souls who enter babies, we come from a state of all-knowing and thus are mentally able to adjust more quickly to our surroundings than at the end of a physical life. [Yet] my subjects say if they were to compare the moment of birth with that of death, the physical shock of being born is much greater. **At the moment of first entry, chronological time begins for the soul. Depending upon the inclinations of the particular soul involved, the connection may be early or late in the mother's pregnancy. I have had cases where souls timed their arrival at the last minute during delivery, but this is unusual. My findings indicate [that] those souls who join the baby early seem to do a lot of traveling outside the mother's womb during her term.** Dr. N: All right, let's take this current situation inside your mother and allow some time to pass. What do you do when you are not with the unborn baby? S: (laughs with delight) You want the truth? I'll tell you. Me-I play! It's a fine time to leave and purely goof off ... when the baby is less active. I have fun with my friends who are doing the same thing. We bounce around Earth to visit with each other ... and go to interesting places ... where we have once lived together in former lives. S: Once I attach to a child it is necessary to bring my mind into synchronization with the brain.

S: At about five or six years of age. Usually we get fully operational when the child starts school. Dr. N: So, will you have fleeting thoughts of other lives as a child? S: Yes ... we daydream ... the way we play as children ... creating stories ... having imaginary friends who are real ...but it fades. In the first few years of life babies know more than they are given credit for. **Final Thoughts** The information contained in this book about the existence of souls after physical death represents the most meaningful explanation I have found in my life as to why we are here. All my years of searching to discover the purpose of life hardly prepared me for that moment when a subject in hypnosis finally opened the door to an eternal world. Looking back, I suppose it was no accident in my own life that people would eventually come to me for hypnosis-a medium of truth I could believe in-to tell me about guides, heavenly gateways, spiritual study groups, and creation itself. Even now, I sometimes feel like an intruder in the minds of those who describe the spirit world and their place in it, but their knowledge has given me direction. Still, I wonder why I am the messenger for the spiritual knowledge contained in this book, when someone with less original cynicism and doubt would surely have been much better suited. Everything I have learned about who we are and where we come from, I owe to those who were drawn to me for help. They have taught me that a major aspect of our mission on Earth as souls is to mentally survive being cut off from our real home. While in a human body, the soul is essentially alone. A soul's relative isolation on Earth during a temporary physical life is made more difficult on a conscious level by thoughts that nothing exists beyond this life.

A soul's relative isolation on Earth during a temporary physical life is made more difficult on a conscious level by thoughts that nothing exists beyond this life. Our doubts tempt us into finding attachments solely in a physical world we can see. From my work I have come to believe that we live in an imperfect world by design. Earth is one of countless worlds with intelligent beings, each with its own set of imperfections to bring into harmony. **When I ask my subjects how a loving God could permit suffering, surprisingly there are few variations in their responses. My cases report our souls are born of a creator which places a totally peaceful state deliberately out of reach so we will strive harder. We learn from wrongdoing. That which is not good is testing us, otherwise we would have no motivation to better the world through ourselves, and no way to measure advancement.** At a wat temple in the mountains of Northern Thailand, a Buddhist teacher once reminded me of a simple truth. \"Life,\" he said, \"is offered as a means of self-expression, only giving us what we seek when we listen to the heart.\" The highest forms of this expression are acts of kindness. Our soul may be traveling away from a permanent home, but we are not just tourists. We bear responsibility in the evolution of a higher consciousness for ourselves and others in life. Thus, our journey is a collective one. We are divine but imperfect beings who exist in two worlds, material and spiritual. It is our destiny to shuttle back and forth between these universes through space and time while we learn to master ourselves and acquire knowledge. **Perhaps the most gratifying feature of my work in uncovering the existence of a spirit world in the minds of my subjects is the effect this conscious knowledge has on them. The most significant benefit which comes from knowing we have a home of everlasting love waiting for us, is being receptive to the higher spiritual power within our minds. The awareness that we do belong somewhere is reassuring and offers us peace, not merely as a haven from conflict, but to unify ourselves with a universal mind.** **Final Note:** To order *Journey of Souls* see [this webpage](https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Souls-Studies-Between-Lives/dp/1567184855/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531028418).

Not long after the experience, I wrote down everything I could remember, yet it was years before I shared the account with anyone, and even then it was only with a few family members. For many months preceding the birth, I had had a prolonged illness that was eventually diagnosed as a rare tropical parasite. I had dwindled to some 90 pounds and was quite weak when I went into labor. After many hours in labor, fatigue had begun to set in. When the time came to deliver, the doctor told me to push, so I began the process of pushing with each contraction. This went on for a long time. I kept expecting the baby to come any minute. However, after extended efforts, I was not making progress and I began to lose my strength. I still continued to push, but after endless rounds still yielding no results, I finally fell back in exhaustion. The doctor instructed me to keep going but my body, in its weakened state, refused to cooperate. I began to feel panicky. It was clear that my prolonged efforts had failed to further any progress towards the birth. As my muscles went flaccid, I felt my entire body tremble violently. I could barely speak. **Realizing my battery had gone dead", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-account-nde.txt:0:a03ac1e3d2a6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13570, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-account-nde.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-account-nde", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "strength.

I could barely speak. **Realizing my battery had gone dead and I had no control over my body, I was overcome with fear and felt as if the last drop of blood had seeped out of me. I thought, \"I'm going to die.\"** Seeing that I had no strength left, the nurse turned to the doctor and said, \"She can't push anymore.\" At that point, there was a sudden change in the room. The previous sense of alarm seemed to turn to crisis. Everything happened very fast. I had no idea what had gone wrong; only that it seemed to be an emergency. My last hold on myself started to go, and I could hear urgency in the doctor's voice. This was followed by an acute wrenching sensation, as if I had been split in half, and then I went unconscious. The light went out and I slipped away. There was a moment of darkness. Then part of me rose and floated up to the corner of the room. I hovered there briefly, observing the scene below. **I saw my body lying on the delivery table, surrounded by people in white coats who seemed to be in great commotion.** Then slowly, I floated upward out of the room and building, above the trees, and up into a black, star-filled sky. In this studded darkness, I was carried gently into the distance like a petal drifting on the surface of a stream. Eventually I came to rest in a dense, velvet-black space that enveloped me in tranquility. **In this peaceful place, I had no fear. I became aware that there was no time. There was no yesterday or tomorrow. There were no boundaries. There was no pain. ** While I floated in the darkness, the Earth appeared far below me and gradually came into my vision. Suddenly I knew without a shadow of doubt that I had entered another existence that was neither a dream nor a hallucination. I knew it was real: as true, as palpable, and as certain as had been my life on Earth. I became aware that although I had left my body behind, whatever constituted \"I\" was still alive and remained unchanged. I sensed that this other form in which I now existed was like a transparent encasing for my soul, for the consciousness that was the essence of myself.

In this body-less state, **I was suddenly struck by the realization that I had been here before my life on Earth. **I was remembering something I had forgotten, something that had been erased from memory when I was born. This was where I had originally come from. I had come home. Some invisible, silent source of infinite knowledge seemed to surround me, with answers to things like \"where do we go when we die?\", \"how was life and the world created?\", and so on. It was never clear to me why I became separated from this source and its infinite knowledge at birth. **Earth Pangs** Looking down, the Earth came clearly into my vision as if I had telescopic sight. I saw a dark vision of suffering and entrapment that was like a distillation of the human condition over millennia. It seemed this condition led history to repeat itself in an endless cycle of war, bloodshed, torture, deprivation, insanity, illness, and alienation. It seemed as if all the pain mankind had suffered through the ages had been distilled to its essence and funneled into one collective cry to be released from this prison. From the chaos of destructiveness, faces advanced into the darkness, then receded back into their private hells, calling, \"Help me!\" I felt like I was looking directly into peoples' souls to the raw fear beneath their protective shells. I felt great compassion for all those in pain. I wanted some miracle to release them all from their misery, but I perceived that nothing could deliver them from it as long as they remained there, separated, through ignorance and fear, from their source. I sensed that the only thing that would release them from that condition was to break through the shield of separateness that divided them from themselves, from others, and from the infinite creative power behind this vast universe of space in which I now found myself floating. **I was deeply troubled by this dark vision, for it appeared that humans were destined to remain imprisoned in their suffering as long as they inhabited the Earth, and that only death would release them from this condition. Yet a thought passed through my mind: \"If they could break through their sense of separation, look, and see this other realm here that exists beyond them, they would be released from bondage.\" ** Slowly the voices faded, the faces receded, the Earth fell away, and again there was only soothing darkness.

Then I felt myself drifting again, farther away into the beyond, gently lifted towards a light in the far distance. I seemed to be carried further and further out into the universe at the speed of light, as if swept by a gentle, yet rapid current. I was drawn to the magnetic force of the light like a river is drawn toward the sea. Then I came again to a resting place. I became aware of a compassionate presence that held me as I saw my life of 27 years on Earth unfold. I had lived and traveled extensively in India amid conditions of poverty, disease, destitution, and death that were all-pervasive and inescapable. As a result of my exposure to these conditions, I had become seriously ill. I had also struggled with my own personal demons from a troubled childhood. As negative thoughts and emotions arose, they were simply acknowledged and held by the presence, without judgment, with complete forgiveness. **Divine Light** Then I heard a voice. It was so gentle and tender, so full of love and compassion; I realized I had never experienced these qualities in my lifetime. **The voice said: \"If you had only known I was here, you never would have had to go through this.\" Hearing this, I felt suddenly free of all that had held me chained like a stone to a condition of human bondage.** While the negative states of my earthly life played out before this presence, it surrounded me with total acceptance and loving-kindness. The next thing I experienced was being drawn into the Light itself. Now the Earth was so far away that it seemed to disappear from my consciousness. The intensity of this light and my direct experience of it transcends expression in words. It was a brilliant, white gold transparency, radiating warm and pure luminescence. It seemed to be a nucleus of energy that was the essence of life itself; that charged all matter, animating it with its life-giving power. Cradled in this Light, I was suffused with a sense of joy, calm, peace, and beauty that were, until then, unknown to me. Unlike the beauty I had experienced on Earth, this beauty was eternally renewing and all-encompassing. It seemed to synthesize all opposing elements, dissolving them into the whole of itself. I perceived this light as the essence of divine love. **Inside this presence, I felt an indescribable sense of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-account-nde.txt:3:c744581881d9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13573, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-account-nde.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-account-nde", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "charged all matter, animating it with its life-giving power.

It seemed to possess a universal spirit that was the consciousness and creative force behind human life. Bathed in its luminous warmth, I felt no longer separate but enveloped by a feeling of unconditional love. Here there was no desire, no pain, no fear. This was the final liberation, an experience of pure bliss. On Earth, I had feared death. Now I saw that death was not an end but a beginning. It was a return to the home from which I had come. My soul had entered the divine consciousness of eternal life, where all wisdom and knowledge resided. As I lay cradled in this loving light, a phrase came to me: \"Now I know.\" This was where my true self belonged. I knew I had come to my final resting place, back to the source from which I had come, and to the end of all suffering. Then the light communicated again. The ensuing communication was like a sonic energy penetrating directly into my soul. Thoughts were transmitted without words, silently and directly as if an extension of the Light itself, passing through me by osmosis. **The Light was both inside and around me. I was aware that I was both a separate, individual entity while being simultaneously subsumed by the presence of this other entity. Its voice was distinctly its own, separate from me, yet I heard my own unspoken thoughts expressed by it, as if it were inside my mind. **A conversation ensued, transmitted like air passing through my cells. Held within this Light, I saw the essence of my life experience in a flash. It had become dominated by a deepening depression: nightmares, guilt, shame, fear, self-recrimination, and illness. I had been conditioned by the concept of \"original sin\" to expect recrimination, judgment, and punishment for my sins. As a result, I had anticipated the same response from this spirit of Light. But there was no judgment. There was only unqualified acceptance and forgiveness. This came as a shock to me. It seemed impossible that I could be loved and accepted just as I was in that moment.

Released from the burden of self-punishment, embraced in the wholeness of this forgiving presence, I was enveloped in joy. I seemed to become transparent, the light of divine love flowing through me. Then I heard the sound of soft, benevolent laughter, which felt like the wise and gentle smile of the Buddha. Again, I was surprised and perplexed. I had not expected to hear laughter from a divine force. It rained over me like soft petals. Then it said: \"My child, you mustn't take things so seriously. You are just part of an evolutionary chain, in which all life evolves at different stages of development. You are only human. You need not judge yourself so harshly. Be gentle with yourself.\" I had gotten only the slightest glimpse of the limitless realms beyond the finite boundaries of the world we inhabit. I was eager to learn more. At the same time, I was content to float in the peace and joy of the Light, where I had come to know the certainty of love. **This yearning of humans to be connected, to love and be loved, was so clear and profoundly felt that I could not face the thought of a return to a world in which this simple truth remained, to so many, unknown, unrealized, or buried. I wanted to stay forever in the presence of Light.** **Rebirth** The Light knew my thoughts and said simply, \"You must return.\" Upon being told I must return, I feared being sent back to the same world I had observed from afar, steeped in its suffering, sent back to my human form, where once again I would be bound by the same conditions and limitations I had left behind. \"Please,\" I begged. \"Please let me stay. Don't send me back.\" A hand appeared in the Light, with beautiful, slender white fingers. \"My child,\" I heard it say with a tenderness that would haunt me forever, \"I have given you the gift of love.\" I tried to hold on to the hand, but with a wrenching in my heart, I felt it slip away forever, as it said, \"Your life is not completed.\" **The next thing I knew I was back in my body.

No time had been granted to make the adjustment of having traversed a span of time and space so immense it would affect me for the rest of my life. Having passed through stars, beyond planets and galaxies, into the far reaches of a universe in which time as we know it did not exist, my soul was not prepared to return to the limited confines of my body. It felt constrained and bereft of the freedom it had known, like a prisoner returned to a cell. I wanted desperately to hold on to what I had left behind, to remember clearly every sacred moment before I lost it. But the world drew me back into its countless challenges. I found myself lying on something hard. Slowly I came into half-consciousness, into a glaring light. As I tried to adjust to my return, it seemed a hostile place. Someone was doing something to me, but I could not feel my body. Someone came to lift me and prop something soft beneath my back. **Suddenly a woman appeared with a bundle, which she put in my arms, saying, \"You have a son.\"** Then she was gone as suddenly as she had appeared, and I wondered why she had been so brusque and left so suddenly. I had barely had a chance to hold him before the nurse returned to whisk him away. While holding him, I had seen that his head looked mangled, swollen, and bruised, with two red gashes that were like craters on each side of his crown. Shortly after, I was told that his badly injured head needed immediate surgery. While my son was in surgery, I woke up in a dark room. In the deep quiet of the darkness, I felt the presence of the Light. It was alive and palpable in the room, infusing it with the same supernatural aura of joy and love I had experienced in that other world that now seemed so far away, beyond my reach. Though I had left it and some part of me behind, it now filled the room with a sacred light. **Through the birth of my son, it had \"given me the gift of love.\" ** A connection existed between the experience of the Light I had left behind and the birth of my son.

He was linked to it, as I had been, and he had brought it with him. I had gone full circle - from life, to what was like death, and back to life again. I had revisited my home of origin. And he had made his journey with me from that home, bringing with him the gift of life and love. Lying in the room, I was afraid that if I moved, the Light would stop flowing into me and be gone forever. I wished I could sustain the joy and beauty of the love I had left behind, the radiant bliss from which my son and I had been wrenched. I had come falling like a meteor to the gravity of Earth, felt its leaden density and weight. Back in the prison of my small self, I was constrained by my human limitations, never to see the light again. I was left for a brief time between two worlds. **Already I felt the Light slipping away. Now there remained the problem of bridging the gap between the two worlds and trying to comprehend all that had happened. I only knew that it had changed my life forever. I would never be the same again.** During my stay at the hospital, I learned what had taken place during my son's birth. The American doctor from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi had flown down to investigate the case. He informed us that the doctor who had performed the delivery was unable to deal properly with the complications. The delivery had left two cavernous depressions on each side of my son's crown, which had put pressure on the brain and had to be relieved to eliminate the possibility of brain damage. The doctor said it would be a year before my husband and I would know if the post-natal surgery had reversed the trauma and prevented serious repercussions. A year later, when we returned to the United States to have my son examined for possible brain damage, we learned to our immense relief that the surgery had yielded perfect results. No damage had been done. We both wondered what might have happened if the neurologist, who was normally away on an international lecture circuit, had not been in Madras on that fateful day to perform the surgery. I give thanks daily for the miracle of that positive outcome and the blessing of my son's life. **2012 -", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-account-nde.txt:7:990b6c556b25", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13577, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-account-nde.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-account-nde", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "States to have my son examined for possible brain damage, we learned to our immense relief that the surgery had yielded perfect results.

I give thanks daily for the miracle of that positive outcome and the blessing of my son's life. **2012 - Forty Years Later: Changes and Effects** My journey some 40 years ago changed my life by leading me on a spiritual path of inquiry that continues to this day. At the time it occurred in 1973, I was not aware of the extensive literature that has since emerged on the subject of NDEs. Many years passed before I felt safe enough to reveal the experience to anybody. It felt too sacred and private, and I was also afraid people would either not believe me or think I was delusional. Although I never found out exactly what happened to me medically at the time I went unconscious or perceived that experience as a clinical death, I had no doubts that I had glimpsed the experience of death in some form. **It was years before I learned that thousands of other people had been on similar journeys in varying degrees and documented them. When I first read these accounts, I was incredulous, feeling as if I had found members of a lost family who would understand what I had experienced. For the first time, I felt less alone and isolated.** The phrase, \"within a distant light\" came to me because often, back on Earth, the Light seemed like a 'distant' power beyond my reach, while at the same time I believed at a deeper level that it existed 'within' me and all humans as our true essence or higher self. **I continued to struggle with self-judgment and the conflict between feelings of unworthiness and fear versus feelings of love and self-acceptance. ** This conflict became the source of a continued search to integrate more qualities of the Light into my life. I sought out spiritual communities, workshops, literature, and alternative healing therapies. I began to see adversities as opportunities to tap into the Light for spiritual transformation and to help others find their own inner light. As part of my spiritual path, I undertook volunteer jobs to try to help others undergoing adversities. **The periodic depressions I experienced when feeling disconnected from the Light allowed me to empathize with others through their pain and help them see the healing power that existed within them.** I worked as a hotline crisis counselor to provide intervention for people struggling with suicide, domestic violence, and other crises, and counseled runaway youths.

I also trained and volunteered as an expressive arts therapist providing stress management to individuals and varied population groups in the community, including mental health centers, cancer and pain support groups, and senior rehabilitation centers. As an expressive arts facilitator, I discovered I could tap into the Light to find perspective and compassion in my own life, and help others find their own inner source of wisdom and healing. As an artist, I drew from the Light to overcome creative blocks and become more fulfilled in my creative life. **The Divine Light and Unconditional Love** **One of the most important things I gained from the NDE was the feeling that there is a greater spirit of unconditional love to which we can turn continually for wisdom, comfort, and guidance through life's challenges. The experience led to a belief that the Light of divinity exists within all of us, and that all discord arises from a sense of separation from this Light. As we align our minds and hearts with the Light, we can experience its qualities in the forms of peace, love, joy, compassion, and well-being.** Relative to that belief, my higher purpose has been to engage in practices that help me and others re-align our human personality with the light of our higher spirit. My mission is to continue to try to understand and integrate the lessons of the Light; to learn greater self-acceptance, non-judgment, forgiveness, and compassion; and to seek and find the joy that comes from being connected to the Light. Over time, I experienced a marked increase in my commitment to the inner life and spiritual practices such as prayer, meditation, mindfulness, visualization, healing arts therapy, gratitude, and journaling. I came to see the greater meaning behind the message of the \"gift of love\": that the most important thing in life is to grow in love - love of self, love of others, love of life. I came to give less significance to such things as material wealth, fame, prestige, or power, seeing them increasingly as transient and ephemeral, unable to bring true and lasting fulfillment and happiness. **Self-understanding became an important part of my spiritual journey as I came to see that peace and love can only come through careful self-examination and transformation of the things that block it - hatred, resentment, anger, fear, etc. - so each individual must begin with him or herself, go through the darkness, and make the changes within, in order to effect change", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-account-nde.txt:9:0be1a9400609", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13579, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-account-nde.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-account-nde", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "or power, seeing them increasingly as transient and ephemeral, unable to bring true and lasting fulfillment and happiness. **Self-understanding became an important part of my spiritual journey as I came to see that peace and love can only come through careful self-examination and transformation of the things that block it - hatred, resentment, anger, fear, etc. - so each individual must begin with him or herself, go through the darkness, and make the changes within, in order to effect change without.** After the experience, I wondered if there was some purpose or mission, I was meant to fulfill. Over time, as I engaged in spiritual practices to examine and transform the dark sides within myself, I developed an increased consciousness that a greater spirit was operating in my life, as opposed to viewing life as a series of random, meaningless events. I came to see my purpose as a call to awaken to the presence of spirit as an active and constant player in my life. This required attunement to the existence of spirit at work in every aspect of my life, seeing people, places, and things as teachers and as channels by which the Light was trying to communicate with me, offer guidance, and teach me what I needed to learn. For example, early on, while still in India, I came across a leper with missing limbs and half his face gone. At first I felt repelled. But then I reached down to give him a rupee. When I looked into his only eye, I felt an overwhelming sense of connection and compassion that transcended appearances. Much later, back in the U.S., a woman who was terminally ill with cancer came into my life at a time when I was struggling with questions about how to integrate the lessons of my experience more effectively in my life. Shortly after meeting, my friend declared with prophetic certainty that we were similar, that we were meant to meet, and that we had been put on our path together for a reason. As we grew to know each other during the brief remaining year of her life, it became clear that we were both struggling with the problem of judgment - particularly of harsh self-judgment, as well as judgment of others, an issue she was struggling to overcome while she was dying. **During my experience, the primary lesson that was revealed for me to learn was to be less harsh with myself, to learn greater [acceptance and compassion](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#acceptance) for myself and others.** During my friend's lifetime, our get-togethers were focused almost exclusively on our spiritual growth, letting go of negative thoughts and judgments, learning to love more deeply and live in the present moment. She led me to groups, workshops, books, and tapes, the first being Eckhart Tolle' \"Power Of Now,\" to help us learn a more mindful approach to life that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-account-nde.txt:10:df7b66defd9a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13580, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-account-nde.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-account-nde", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "me to learn was to be less harsh with myself, to learn greater [acceptance and compassion](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#acceptance) for myself and others.** During my friend's lifetime, our get-togethers were focused almost exclusively on our spiritual growth, letting go of negative thoughts and judgments, learning to love more deeply and live in the present moment. She led me to groups, workshops, books, and tapes, the first being Eckhart Tolle' \"Power Of Now,\" to help us learn a more mindful approach to life that would free us from the limitations and fears of dark thoughts and feelings. I felt certain that the Light was communicating with me through this relationship. Through her life and her death, \"G\" accelerated my spiritual growth as a guide who had made her own spiritual growth the primary focus of her life. I had shared my NDE experience with her and was present as a source of love and compassion for her through her dying process to her death, offering her my vision of the Light of unconditional love that would await her after her death. From her, I also came to see that the emphasis I had placed on achievement was misguided, and that love is the most important thing in human life. \"G\" introduced me to a beech tree she perceived as a channel for eternal consciousness whose voice can only be heard in stillness. We visited the tree frequently to listen to its messages. After her death, the tree became a symbol of life and love where her soul came to rest and loved ones came to visit her there in lieu of a grave. As I grew in awareness of the Light within, I saw my life move from unhealthy patterns to healthier, more productive and spiritually-oriented ones. Yet in spite of all this, I still find that it is not always so easy or simple turn to the Light when I need to. When fear arises, I often forget the existence of the Light, my ability to access it and the knowledge that it is an ever-present source of wisdom and love that is capable of dispelling all negative states. **The other very important effect of the NDE was that it changed my view of death and the afterlife, taking away my fear of the unknown regarding what happens after we die.** It convinced me that life does not cease to exist when the body dies; that we have a soul that is connected to a greater consciousness that continues to live in spirit form in another dimension - a realm where a higher intelligence of unconditional love exists. While I still fear the process of dying and the loss of loved ones, I find peace in the belief that our souls live on and are embraced in unconditional love. Trying to integrate the Light into my life has been a lifelong process.

Trying to integrate the Light into my life has been a lifelong process. After the shock of returning to a confined body, I experienced periodic depressions about returning from a heaven of unconditional love to a world of discord and suffering. I still struggle with periods when it seems that the healing power of the Light is beyond my reach. I have often wished I could go back or re-experience the bliss of that enlightened moment in time. **But I know now that I was sent back to learn more and grow spiritually. I know that the adversities I have encountered and those needing help who have been put on my path have been part of that growth.** It was through the most difficult and painful times in my life and those I shared with others that I was brought closer to the Light. Through them my faith and trust deepened. My intuition was sharpened as I was led to cultivate an awareness that was open and attentive to receiving any messages that might be trying to reach me. **There has been an increase in moments of heightened perception in which I sense the greater spirit operating in my life. I have often felt led through certain people, books, or situations to solutions or resolutions that further my growth. Very frequently, when trying to find an answer to a question or resolution to a problem, I have been led directly to a specific book, sometimes a chapter, in which the answer lies. Also, because I have learned to be open to messages from the Light, they come with great frequency through people in my life.** For example, while I was struggling with resolving aspects of my experience, my son helped me see things from the Light's perspective so that I could gain new insight on unresolved issues. It was clear to me that the Light was speaking through him. I came to see more clearly that the NDE, at least for me, was not a panacea that changed my life from one day to the next. Rather it served as a guide through the dark side of life, struggles and imperfections, which are an ongoing part of life's journey.

I have found that the resolution is invariably quickly forthcoming. Until now, I have reserved sharing my experience with a select few. Among the people with whom I have shared it are my son, who was so integral a part of the experience, and who has since often served as a channel for the Light, offering messages I needed to hear. My second husband, sister, and a couple of friends also supported me. **Comfort in the Light** On rare occasions, I felt the grace of the Light's presence in my life. Once, in the pit of despair, while I was lying sick in bed, I felt its force so strongly that it jolted me upright to sit on the edge of the bed. A vision of the Light and a hand appeared; the same hand with the long slender fingers that had guided me back to Earth, and it repeated the words: \"My child, I have given you the gift of love.\" On another occasion in India, not long after my NDE, I had climbed to a Himalayan mountaintop with my first husband and son. I was sitting by a stream in a paradisiacal meadow with wildflowers while my son played in the stream. After months of having been steeped in self-doubt and anxiety I suddenly felt the Light, fill me with a sense of unconditional love, freeing me from the bondage of all my dark thoughts and feelings. Everything that had tormented me on the plains far below the mountain peak vanished, leaving me with a sense that I had come home to my true self, which belonged with the Light. The Light carried me forward through my deepest fears and sorrows, through illness, divorce, and the death of loved ones. It gave me strength to go on when I thought all was lost. It helped me learn to accept the frailties I share with my fellow human beings, and to learn to continue to forgive myself and others. I believe that this, and the common experience of the thousands who have shared their passage beyond this world, is testament to the existence of a spirit greater than ourselves. **The crux of the Light's messages to me was that our souls live on after we die, our relationships are eternal, and we must love ourselves as it loves us: here in this very moment, unconditionally, just", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-account-nde.txt:13:5e56b14b5335", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13583, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-account-nde.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-account-nde", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "fellow human beings, and to learn to continue to forgive myself and others.

I have come to believe that the divinity of this Light lies in and around every individual, and it is our life's purpose to find and express that divinity which exists - not somewhere far away in some distant world, but right here, within each of us. Though the Light's message seemed to me to reflect the wisdom of the ages, it continues to elude so many. For me, it is up to each individual to find the way back to the inner light of our highest self, and to embrace rather than shun the darkness within us, for only by going through it can we find our way to the other side. **Note: **This essay has been lightly edited for clarity and ease of reading.

By now, these travelers tales have become familiar to us, and they have certainly helped to fashion a much more positive vision of the nature of death itself. Recently, however, NDE researchers have been more concerned with the question of what those of us who have never had such experiences can learn from those who have about how to live our daily lives.

This book is an attempt to distill the wisdom teachings of the near-death experience in such a way as to enable its readers to apply them to their own lives. Here, however, I will focus on just one particular feature of the NDE, that which is usually called the life review. The life review is that portion of an near-death experience when the individual has a panoramic review of his or her life wherein virtually everything that has ever happened to the individual is revealed, often in an atemporal holographic display of countless visual images. However, what most persons with only a superficial knowledge of this phenomenon fail to grasp is that in the life review, if this were happening to you, you would be more than a passive observer watching yourself in the movie of your life. Actually, you are back in it all over again, and you experience what happened to you as it were happening once more. In short, **you are living your life afresh - your memories have somehow transformed themselves into vivid recreations of the episodes of your life.** Now to begin to see what this kind of experience has to teach those of us who haven't had it, let's concentrate on just one single episode from a particular life review. It comes from the NDE of a man I know very well with the unlikely (but actual) name of the famous fictional character of the American author, Mark Twain - Tom Sawyer. As a youth Tom had an uncontrollable temper, and one day it really got him into trouble. He had been driving his hot-rod pickup truck through town when a pedestrian darted out and almost collided with it. Tom, rather than being relieved that no accident had occurred, found himself incensed that this man had almost damaged his beautiful truck of which he was inordinately proud. **Angry words were exchanged, soon followed by blows, and Tom eventually pummeled his victim into unconsciousness and left him lying in the middle of the street.** Shortly afterward, however, overtaken a bit by remorse after his surge of anger had subsided, he reported the incident to the police, but was let off with a warning. Years later during his NDE, Tom was forced to relive this scene. Like many others who have described their life reviews, he found himself doing so from a dual perspective. One part of himself seemed to be high up in a building", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt:1:018621c82f54", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13586, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "left him lying in the middle of the street.** Shortly afterward, however, overtaken a bit by remorse after his surge of anger had subsided, he reported the incident to the police, but was let off with a warning. Years later during his NDE, Tom was forced to relive this scene. Like many others who have described their life reviews, he found himself doing so from a dual perspective. One part of himself seemed to be high up in a building overlooking the street from which perch he simply witnessed, like an elevated spectator, the fight taking place below. But another part of him was actually involved in the fight again. However, **this time, in the life review, Tom found himself in the place of the other party. He experienced each distinct blow he had inflicted on this man - thirty-two in all - before collapsing unconscious on the pavement.** This role reversal in the life review in which one finds himself directly experiencing the effects of one's actions on another is hardly unique to Tom. In fact, as I was to discover doing the research for my book, it is found quite often in accounts of life reviews and seems to ram home their lessons for living with all the force of a psychic body blow to those who experience this surprising empathic turnabout. Just to get a sense of how powerful and all-encompassing these empathic life reviews tend to be, let me simply quote next a few of the many I culled for my book, using the words of the experiencers themselves. . . . *FLASH! Brilliant colors came radiating from within me, to be displayed in front of us [she was with a group of persons whose faces radiated unconditional love], like a theater floating in air. It was a three dimensional, panoramic view of my life, every aspect of my life. Everything I had ever said or done or even thought was right there for all of us to experience. I re-thought every thought. I re-experienced every feeling, as it happened, in an instant. * * I also felt how my actions, or even just my thoughts, had affected others. When I had passed judgment on someone else, I would experience myself doing that. Then I would change places in perspective and experience what that judgment had felt like for them to receive from me. Then I'd return to my own feelings, to be able to respond to the drama I'd just witnessed and experienced, to react, for example, with shame or remorse because of that episode. * *Multitudinous actions or thoughts, derived from my own meanness, unkindness, or anger, caused me to feel the consequent pains of the other people. I experienced this even if at the time I had hurt someone, I had chosen to ignore how that would affect them. **And I felt their", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt:2:7d563e1a16e2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13587, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "return to my own feelings, to be able to respond to the drama I'd just witnessed and experienced, to react, for example, with shame or remorse because of that episode. * *Multitudinous actions or thoughts, derived from my own meanness, unkindness, or anger, caused me to feel the consequent pains of the other people.

I yanked my little sister's Easter basket away from her, because there was a toy in it that I wanted. Yet in the review, I felt her feelings of disappointment and loss and rejection. What we do to other people when we act unlovingly! **Everything you have done is there in the review for you to evaluate. There was no covering up. I was the very people that I hurt, and I was the very people I helped to feel good**. . . It is a real challenge, every day of my life, to know that when I die I am going to have to witness every single action of mine again, only this time actually feeling the effects I've had on others. It sure makes me stop and think.* *. . .* *It proceeded to show me every single event of my 22 years of life in a kind of instant 3-D panoramic review. The brightness showed me every second of all those years, in exquisite detail, in what seemed only an instant of time. Watching and re-experiencing all those events of my life changed everything. It was an opportunity to see and feel all the love I had shared, and more importantly, all the pain I had caused. **I was able to simultaneously re-experience not only my own feelings and thoughts, but those of all the other people I had ever interacted with. Seeing myself through their eyes was a humbling experience.*** *. . .* ***Mine was not a review, but a reliving.** For me, it was a total reliving of every thought I had ever thought, every word I had ever spoken, and every deed I had ever done; plus, the effect of each thought, word and deed on everyone and anyone who had ever come within my environment or sphere of influence, whether I knew them or not.

When read slowly and meditatively, such quotes are quite a bit to take in at one sitting. In the groups I have presented them to, I have witnessed many persons becoming deeply pensive when contemplating these observations and, later when discussing them, some have even burst into tears. If you should feel this way simply upon reading them, imagine what it's like for the near-death experiencer! But it's not enough merely to note that these commentaries tend to provoke some deep reflections and strong emotions. To get more of the full impact of these observations and, more importantly, to begin to make them relevant to your own life, you can easily perform a little but very instructive exercise at home. Here it is. Please take a piece of blank paper or, if you keep a personal journal, pick it up now. Or if you prefer, go to your typewriter or computer screen. For the next ten or fifteen minutes (or longer, if you wish), begin with this sentence stem, and then continue to write: **When I reflect on these commentaries in relation to my own life, I . . .** I can assure you that performing this exercise, and even better, sharing it with others, can be a profoundly rewarding and even revelatory experience. It can help you to see how to bring such episodes to bear on your own life, as I will illustrate in a few moments. Of course, each person who reflects on these commentaries will come away with his or her own insights, but perhaps it might be useful here to try to bring out some of the chief implications that have often come up in my work with this material. Perhaps the most obvious - and important - insight that is voiced is that this exercise forces one to think about the meaning of the Golden Rule in an entirely new way. Most of us are accustomed to regard it mainly as a precept for moral action - \"do unto others as you would be done to.\" But in the light of these life review commentaries, the Golden Rule is much more than that - it is actually the way it works. In short, **if these accounts in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt:4:dfaa479fa88b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13589, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "insight that is voiced is that this exercise forces one to think about the meaning of the Golden Rule in an entirely new way. Most of us are accustomed to regard it mainly as a precept for moral action - \"do unto others as you would be done to.\" But in the light of these life review commentaries, the Golden Rule is much more than that - it is actually the way it works. In short, **if these accounts in fact reveal to us what we experience at the point of death, then what we have done unto others is experienced as done unto ourselves.** Familiar exhortations such as, \"love your brother as yourself,\" from this point of view are understood to mean that, in the life review, you yourself are the brother you have been urged to love. And this is no mere intellectual conviction or even a religious credo - it is an undeniable fact of your lived experience. This insight becomes self-evident to near-death experiencers who report a life review that causes them to look at this universal religious injunction with much deeper appreciation for just why it must be true. As one near-death experiencer told me: *No matter what I did to any person - no matter what that action might be, good or bad - that action would react not only upon me but also on others around me. I knew that every action was its own reaction. What we do for or against another, we do to ourselves. **I fully understood what Jesus meant when He said, \"As ye do it unto the least of these, you do it unto me.\"*** Another way of putting this would be to say that the life review demonstrates that, psychologically and spiritually, there is really only one person in the universe - and that person is, of course, yourself. Every act, every thought, every feeling, every emotion directed toward another - whether you know the person or not - will later be experienced by you. Everything you send out, returns - just as Tom Sawyer felt each of the thirty-two blows he had viciously rained down on his overmatched victim. Remember what one of the persons quoted above said to pithily encapsulate this lesson from the life review: \"I was the very people that I hurt, and I was the very people I helped to feel good.\" **Next time you are in the middle of a heated argument with someone, you might find yourself stopping in mid-sentence when you realize that your verbal assaults will one day inevitably be reflected back to you in the unsparing mirror of your life.** I don't know about you, but pondering these implications of the life review makes me think about justice in a new way.

It occurs to me, what could be a more perfect form of justice than this - everything you do becomes yours.** It is not that we are rewarded for our good deeds or punished by our cruel ones; it is simply that we receive back what we have given out, and exactly as we have done. ** Unselfish love given to your child is love you experience as bestowed on you. And likewise, a careless word that wounds somebody's feelings cuts into you. Measure for measure, perfectly, with no possibility of error. What Solon could devise anything fairer? These reflections in turn suggest a revisioning of one aspect of the near-death experience that seems to give many people trouble. Very often, following a lecture on NDEs, a question is raised to the effect of whether everybody will eventually find himself in the presence of the Light and receive the incomparable blessings that the Light seems to extend to anyone who comes within its embrace. Behind the question, there is usually the implication that some persons should be disqualified for this experience - rapists, for example, or others who have led morally reprehensible lives (or with some fundamentalists, persons who are \"unsaved\"). The answer I have heard several near-death experiencers give to this question is unqualified: Everyone, they say, will come into this light. **The Light is unconditional and plays no favorites.** This reply invariably stirs an agitated response in some members of the audience, and someone will then play the trump card. \"Even Hitler?,\" a voice will ask incredulously. I remember an answer that was given to this query by a near-death experiencer who, as a child, had suffered severe sexual and physical abuse from her father. When she found herself in the Light, she asked it telepathically, \"Does everyone come here?\" She was told, \"yes.\" Then, she herself asked the very question that represents the limit for most people: \"Even Hitler?\" \"Yes.\" And, then, pushing the Light even further, she found herself asking, \"Even my father?\" Again, \"yes.\" But when she told of her encounter with the Light, she also happened to mention the other side of the coin - the life review. Remember what we have already been told by the persons I have quoted: \"Multitudinous actions or thoughts, derived from my own meanness, unkindness, or anger, caused me to feel the consequent pains of other people. I experienced this even if at the time I had hurt someone, I had chosen to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt:6:112757eb3d97", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13591, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "my father?\" Again, \"yes.\" But when she told of her encounter with the Light, she also happened to mention the other side of the coin - the life review. Remember what we have already been told by the persons I have quoted: \"Multitudinous actions or thoughts, derived from my own meanness, unkindness, or anger, caused me to feel the consequent pains of other people. I experienced this even if at the time I had hurt someone, I had chosen to ignore how that would affect them. And I felt their pain for the full length of time they were affected by what I had done.\" Another person, echoing comments I have heard from other near-death experiencers, said that having to re-experience what she did to, thought, and felt about others, was hell itself for her. And a prisoner, not previously quoted, who actually had a long criminal career said, in a passage whose relevance to Hitler's atrocities cannot be overlooked, \"Apparently nothing was omitted in this nightmare of injuries, but the most terrifying thing about it was that every pang of suffering I had caused others was now felt by me as the scroll unwound itself.\" Again, seemingly perfect justice. From this perspective, can you imagine what Hitler's life review must have been like? One may even wonder whether it is over with yet! Such reflections, however much they serve our need to see justice done, especially to figures of world-historical moral depravity, are nevertheless very disquieting for most of us.** None of us, obviously, has lived a blameless life; we have all done things of which we are deeply ashamed** and now must live with the knowledge that the shadow of these deeds will haunt us like an unexorcised ghost. And then there are actions of whose consequences we may remain unaware, but whose effects, not always pleasant, we will be forced to experience for ourselves during the life review. Such thoughts - and maybe you had them when you were doing your writing - are likely to be disturbing, even deeply distressing, to many of us. Even to think about them now is a burden no one would wish to carry, and yet there seems to be no honest way to shake it off. **But there is a way to come to terms with this problem that threatens to weigh us down** with gloomy and fearful anticipations of almost Dickensian proportions. And it is one that may come as a surprise almost too good to be believed. For the incontestable fact is, **in these life reviews, justice is seemingly always tempered by a kind of mercy that allows most of us to re-experience our lives without teeth-gnashing anguish and remorse.** **There is never any condemnation - you are not judged.** **You are in the presence of a being who loves you unconditionally.** **You are treated with total compassion.**", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt:7:388a6e8c58cd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13592, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "almost Dickensian proportions.

A man who had quite a hard time looking at his life during his review commented: ***I feel strongly that the whole life review would have been emotionally destructive ... if it hadn't been for the fact that my friend [the being of light] and my friend's friends, while we watched the whole thing, were loving me. I could feel that love.** Every time I got a little upset, they turned it off for awhile and they just loved me. Their love was tangible. You could feel it on your body, you could feel it inside of you; their love went right through you. The therapy was their love. My life review just kept tearing me down. It was pitiful to watch, just pitiful ... it was nauseating. But through it all was their love.* Finally, just to show how knowledge of these experiences can actually affect one's conduct in everyday life, let me conclude by citing a letter that was sent to me by a friend named Judy. Though she had never experienced an NDE, Judy had thought about the lessons stemming from these life reviews. In her letter, she described this incident: *A friend, two recently acquired acquaintances and I met at a restaurant one evening. The four of us found ourselves sitting at a table in such a way that no general conversation inclusive of all of us could be held - and the decibel level in the crowded room also precluded that. A woman named Michelle was seated to the far left; my friend, Jim, was immediately to her right; I was positioned next to Jim; and another woman, Kathleen, was next to me on the far right-hand side of the table.* *Jim and I were eager to talk with Michelle because we were very interested in her work and knew we would not have a chance to see", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt:8:8445728e7584", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13593, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "held - and the decibel level in the crowded room also precluded that. A woman named Michelle was seated to the far left; my friend, Jim, was immediately to her right; I was positioned next to Jim; and another woman, Kathleen, was next to me on the far right-hand side of the table.* *Jim and I were eager to talk with Michelle because we were very interested in her work and knew we would not have a chance to see her again for a long time since she was soon to go to Europe for an extended period. However, a four-way conversation being impossible under the circumstances, I gradually gave up trying to chime in, especially since I had become aware that Kathleen seemed somewhat removed from the developing situation.* * It would have been difficult for Kathleen to participate, anyway, because Michelle, who is something of an \"entertainer\" and always \"on,\" quickly dominated the conversation. And it had already become apparent by now that Michelle and Kathleen had something of an antipathy toward each other. **Kathleen began to show signs of withdrawal, perhaps even resentment. It was becoming increasingly obvious to me that she didn't feel included. * Judy, already keenly aware of the implications of the life review from her knowledge of the NDE literature, suddenly had a thought flash through her mind that changed everything. *I was feeling a bit frustrated about not being able to talk more with Michelle and having instead to make conversation with someone who didn't seem to want to make any effort to engage and remained very distant. It is not easy for me to choose to be superficially social just out of obligation, so this was a difficult predicament for me. * ***Suddenly, the thought came, \"How would I like to see this scene in my life review?\" Immediately, I felt Kathleen's pain, and the degree of that pain sent shudders through my body. I didn't see my own life review per se, but rather I felt Kathleen's life inside of me, almost as if I were experiencing it myself, particularly the immense amount of rejection she had felt most of her life (which she later confirmed for me) and how distancing herself had become a protective device for her against further pain.*** After this insight had hit Judy like a thunderbolt, she says... *Feelings of empathy and compassion rose to the surface quite rapidly, accompanied by a genuine and strong sense of caring toward Kathleen. Without hesitation or hypocrisy, I turned - not just my head, but my entire body - toward her and gave her a very warm smile and began again to talk with her (although I knew that words wouldn't even be necessary). She responded as though she had just been given the most loving hug, and we soon became engrossed in a conversation of our own.*", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt:9:86044c2db05f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13594, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__near-death-experience-lessons", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "the surface quite rapidly, accompanied by a genuine and strong sense of caring toward Kathleen.

She responded as though she had just been given the most loving hug, and we soon became engrossed in a conversation of our own.* *As a result, not only was the evening a success after all, but there now developed between Kathleen and me a very tender and genuine mutual affection, which has since ripened into a friendship. And I have truly felt, ever since, an unchanged and unconditional empathy toward her, as if I had been allowed to peek for just a brief moment through all the deceiving veils into the heart of another, thus receiving the full force of complete understanding that comes from truly walking in someone else's shoes. \"To truly know someone is to love them,\" I remember reading somewhere, and I can tell you that was shown to me that evening, incontestably.* All this, it would seem, simply because Judy had consciously used her knowledge of the life review to behave as she would have wished to see herself in her own life review. This example makes plain the thesis of this article and of my book: **The lessons of the life review are available to everyone, whether one has had a near-death experience or not.** All that is necessary is not to forget what you have learned, and to act upon your knowledge. .................... **Note:** Now it is up to you to choose what you will do with this profound information.

The boy knew details about airplanes and about pilot James Huston Jr. that he couldn't have known. James' parents say he also had terrible nightmares about a plane crashing and a \"little man\" unable to get out. James, now 8, stills loves airplanes, but he is free of those haunting images of the pilot's death. Jim Tucker, a child psychiatrist and medical director of the Child and Family Psychiatric Clinic at the University of Virginia, is one of the few researchers to extensively study the phenomenon of children who seem to have memories of past lives. He says James' case is very much like others he has studied. **\"At the University of Virginia, we've studied over 2,500 cases of children who seem to talk about previous lives when they're little,\" Tucker said. \"They start at 2 or 3, and by the time they're 6 or 7 they forget all about it and go on to live the rest of their lives.\"** Tucker -- the author of [*Life Before Life: A Scientific Investigation of Children's Memories of Previous Lives*](http://www.amazon.com/Life-Before-Childrens-Memories-Previous/dp/031237674X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1290277409&sr=1-3) -- has seen cases", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__past-lives-articles-news.txt:0:1c53e5fa821a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13601, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__past-lives-articles-news.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__past-lives-articles-news", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "much like others he has studied. **\"At the University of Virginia, we've studied over 2,500 cases of children who seem to talk about previous lives when they're little,\" Tucker said. \"They start at 2 or 3, and by the time they're 6 or 7 they forget all about it and go on to live the rest of their lives.\"** Tucker -- the author of [*Life Before Life: A Scientific Investigation of Children's Memories of Previous Lives*](http://www.amazon.com/Life-Before-Childrens-Memories-Previous/dp/031237674X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1290277409&sr=1-3) -- has seen cases like James' where children make statements that can be verified and seem to match with a particular person. \"It means that this is a phenomenon that really needs to be explored,\" Tucker said. \"James is one of many, many kids who have said things like this.\" While about three-fourths of Americans say they believe in paranormal activity, 20 percent believe in reincarnation, according to a 2005 Gallup poll. **Note:** Watch an engaging [ABC News video clip](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/reincarnation_evidence_abc_boy_pilot_wwii) of this incredible story.

For a decade, Kenneth Ring, a psychology professor and researcher at the University of Connecticut, has looked into the question through the near-death experiences of others. Mr. Ring ... talked with hundreds of people between the ages of 18 and 84 who have come close to physical death. [His books] *[Life at Death](http://www.amazon.com/Life-at-Death-Kenneth-Ring/dp/0688012531/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1195750137&sr=1-1)* [and] *[Heading Toward Omega](http://www.amazon.com/Heading-Toward-Omega-Kenneth-Ring/dp/0688062687/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1195750664&sr=1-1)* both deal with near-death experiences and how they change people's lives. A near-death experience ... often happens to individuals who find themselves on the verge of imminent biological death. It involves ... a sense of the most profound peace and well-being that is possible to imagine. It's a sense of being separate from the physical body and sometimes being able to see it as though a spectator off to one side or from up above. These people have a sense of moving through a dark space or tunnel toward a radiantly beautiful white or golden light. They are absorbed in that light, having in some cases a panoramic life review in which virtually everything that they've ever done in their life they're able to see; perhaps meeting the spirits of deceased love ones or friends. And in some cases, they are asked to make a decision as to whether they would like to continue or go back to their body. The most powerful antidote to the fear of death is coming close to death ... and remembering one of these experiences.** After having a near-death experience, people believe the end of life isn't [the end]; they believe in some sort of life after death.

Bruce [and Andrea] Leininger say yes. They are authors of [*Soul Survivor: The Reincarnation of a World War II Fighter Pilot*](http://www.amazon.com/Soul-Survivor-Reincarnation-World-Fighter/dp/0446509345/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1290276199&sr=1-1). Their book describes how their son James had memories of a WWII pilot who was killed in battle more than 60 years ago. James is now 11 years old. Andrea, when did you first realize that ... James was having ideas or stories that he wanted to share about this? Andrea Leininger: [It] started about two weeks after James' second birthday. He had a -- a night terror, which he had never had before. And this first nightmare began a series of nightmares that started occurring every other night, every night. **And after several months of this, he was having a nightmare and ... I was able to finally determine what he was saying. And he was saying, \"airplane crash on fire, little man can't get out.\"** Probst: Bruce, even at three, he was -- James was drawing pictures of an airplane crashing. Bruce Leininger: By the time he started drawing those pictures, he'd been talking about this ... for several months. And he essentially gave us three items of information over about a three month period. One, **he gave us the name of the ship, which I verified through research on the Internet. \"Natoma Bay.\"** He gave us a name Natoma.

In the fall of 2008, however, after seven days in a coma during which the human part of my brain, the neocortex, was inactivated, I experienced something so profound that it gave me a scientific reason to believe in consciousness after death. I had somehow contracted a very rare bacterial meningitis that mostly attacks newborns. E. coli bacteria had penetrated my cerebrospinal fluid and were eating my brain. For seven days I lay in a deep coma, my body unresponsive, my higher-order brain functions totally offline. While the neurons of my cortex were stunned to complete inactivity by the bacteria that had attacked them, my brain-free consciousness journeyed to another, larger dimension of the universe: the same one described by countless subjects of near-death experiences and other mystical states. **What I saw and learned there has placed me quite literally in a new world: a world where we are much more than our brains and bodies, and where death is not the end of consciousness but rather a chapter in a vast, and incalculably positive, journey.** For most of my journey, someone else was with me. A woman. Without using any words, she spoke to me. The message went through me like a wind, and I instantly understood that it was true. I knew so in the same way that I knew that the world around us was real-was not some fantasy, passing and insubstantial. \"You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever.\" \"You have nothing to fear.\" \"There is nothing you can do wrong.\" **Note:** The author of this stirring account, Dr. Eben Alexander, was a neurosurgeon for 25 years.

Caroline Myss, a best-selling author and a speaker on spirituality and health, focuses on the first explanation. \"A near-death experience is a phenomenon in which a person's physical body ceases to have any signs of life, and the soul detaches from the body and begins what could be called the journey into the afterlife. ... A long tunnel of light begins to appear. ... **What's so phenomenal is that the descriptions [people] give, no matter what culture, no matter what background, match the ancient descriptions ... from various cultures. So if these experiences were in fact made up or hallucinatory, somebody did a very good job of getting that information out to multiple cultures at the same time.\"** Dr. Jeffrey Long runs the [Near Death Experience Research Foundation](http://www.nderf.org/). He defines the physical conditions of someone having a NDE as \"unconscious ... or actually clinically dead, with absent heartbeat and no spontaneous respiration. ... And yet when they shouldn't have any conscious remembering at this time, they do. ...

In addition to floating above their bodies, people often describe moving down a dark tunnel toward a bright light, feeling intense peace and joy, reviewing life events and seeing long-deceased relatives-only to be told that it's not time yet and land abruptly back in an ailing body. \"There are always skeptics, but there are millions of 'experiencers' who know what happened to them, and they don't care what anybody else says,\" says Diane Corcoran, president of the [International Association for Near-Death Studies](http://www.iands.org/), a nonprofit group in Durham, N.C.

He liked to draw pictures of his home too - a long single-storey, white house standing in a bay. But it sent shivers down his mum's spine - because Cameron said it was somewhere they had never been, 160 miles away from where they lived. And he said the mother he was talking about was his \"old mum.\" Convinced he had lived a previous life Cameron worried his former family would be missing him. [He] said they were on the Isle Of Barra. Mum Norma, 42, said: \"Ever since Cameron could speak he's come up with tales of a childhood on Barra. He spoke about his former parents, how his dad died, and his brothers and sisters. Eventually we just had to take him there to see what we could find. It was an astonishing experience. Cameron wouldn't stop begging me to take him to Barra. It was constant. **When we got to the island and DID land on a beach, just as Cameron had described, he turned to ... me and said, 'Now do you believe me?' He got off the plane, threw his arms in the air and yelled 'I'm back.'\"** The Macaulays booked into a hotel and began their search for clues to Cameron's past. Norma said: \"We contacted the Heritage Centre and asked if they'd heard of a Robertson family who lived in a white house overlooking a bay.\" Next the family received a call from their hotel to confirm that a family called Robertson once had a white house on the bay. Norma explains: \"We didn't tell Cameron anything. We just drove towards where we were told the house was and waited to see what would happen. He recognised it immediately and was overjoyed. But as we walked to the door all the colour drained from Cameron's face and he became very quiet.\" **Note:** If the above link fails, see [this webpage](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/stories/060908sun.boywholivedbefore.htm).

Many have blissful experiences of universal love. Most do not want to return to the living. When they do, they're often endowed with special powers: They can predict the future or intuit people's thoughts. These are the testimonies of people who have had near death experiences (NDEs) and returned from the other side to tell the tale. Journalist Judy Bachrach decided to listen to their stories. [National Geographic:] Your book, [*Glimpsing Heaven: The Stories and Science of Life After Death*](http://www.amazon.com/Glimpsing-Heaven-Stories-Science-After/dp/1426215142/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1410628062&sr=8-1&keywords=Glimpsing+Heaven%3A+The+Stories+and+Science+of+Life+After+Death), [describes] one scientist [who] suggests that NDEs may simply result from the brain shutting down, ... that, for instance, the brilliant light often perceived at the end of a tunnel is caused by loss of blood or hypoxia, lack of oxygen. How do you counter these arguments? [Bachrach:] **The problem with the lack of oxygen explanation is that when there is a lack of oxygen, our recollections are fuzzy and sometimes non-existent. The less oxygen you have, the less you remember. But the people who have died, and recall their death travels, describe things in a very clear, concise, and structured way.** Lack of oxygen would mean you barely remember anything. [NG:] You suggest there is a difference between brain function and consciousness. Can you talk about that idea? [Bachrach:] The brain is possibly ... not the only area of consciousness. Even when the brain is shut down, on certain occasions consciousness endures. One of the doctors I interviewed, a cardiologist in Holland, believes that consciousness may go on forever. So the postulate among some scientists is that the brain is not the only locus of thought. **Note:** Watch a profound [BBC documentary](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/inspiring/nde_day_i_died_bbc) on near-death experiences.

Moorjani can't put her finger on the exact minute that she says she left her body. She saw her husband standing next to her hospital bed. Moorjani could also hear conversations that took place between her husband and her doctors, far from her hospital room. She heard them, she said, discuss her pending death. \"Your wife's heart might be beating, but she's not really in there,\" a doctor told her husband -- a conversation, she said, he would later confirm to her after she asked. **Hovering between life and death, she said she was surrounded by people who loved her. Her [deceased] best friend, Soni, was there. So was her father, who had died years earlier from heart failure. There were others there, too. She knew they loved her and cared for her. It was a feeling unlike anything she says she had ever felt.** \"At first, I did not want to come back. Why would I want to come back into this sick body?\" she said.

Scientists at the University of Southampton have spent four years examining more than 2,000 people who suffered cardiac arrests at 15 hospitals in the UK, US and Austria. And they found that **nearly 40 per cent of people who survived described some kind of 'awareness' during the time when they were clinically dead before their hearts were restarted. One man even recalled leaving his body entirely and watching his resuscitation from the corner of the room.** Despite being unconscious and 'dead' for three minutes, the 57-year-old social worker from Southampton, recounted the actions of the nursing staff in detail and described the sound of the machines. \"We know the brain can't function when the heart has stopped beating,\" said Dr Sam Parnia, a former research fellow at Southampton University ... who led the study. \"But in this case, conscious awareness appears to have continued for up to three minutes into the period when the heart wasn't beating, even though the brain typically shuts down within 20-30 seconds after the heart has stopped.

She looked down into what she later described as a bottomless pit. Then she went over. The front end of her boat got pinned in the rocks, submerging her in the water. Pinned in the boat and out of air, Neal started to give up. \"I really gave it all over to God, and I really said, 'Your will be done,'\" she said. [She] was sucked out of the bottom of the boat by the current -- with her legs bending back over her knees. \"I could feel the bones breaking. I could feel the ligaments and the tissue tearing. I felt my spirit peeling away from my body, sort of like peeling two pieces of tape,\" Neal recounted. As one of her friends grabbed her wrist to try to pull her out of the water, Neal realized she was outside her body watching the rescue effort. \"I could see them pull my body to the shore. I could see them start CPR,\" she said. \"I had no pulse, and I wasn't breathing. One fellow was yelling at me to come back. ...My body was purple and bloated.

Laureys heads the Coma Science Group at the university hospital in the city of Liege. NDEs feel \"even more real than real,\" Laureys said. Laureys and his team studied the near-death memories of people who survived -- in particular those of coma patients -- with the help of a psychological examination. The Memory Characteristics Questionnaire tests for sensory and emotional details of recollections and how people relive them in space and time. In other words, it gauges how present, intense and real a memory is. They compared NDEs with other memories of intense real-life events like marriages and births, but also with memories of dreams and thoughts. Memories of important real-life events are more intense than those of dreams or thoughts, Laureys said. \"If you use this questionnaire ... if the memory is real, it's richer, and if the memory is recent, it's richer,\" he said. **\"To our surprise, NDEs were much richer than any imagined event or any real event of these coma survivors,\" Laureys reported. The memories of these experiences beat all other memories, hands down, for their vivid sense of reality. \"The difference was so vast,\" he said with a sense of astonishment. Even if the patient had the experience a long time ago, its memory was as rich \"as though it was yesterday,\"** Laureys said. \"Sometimes, it is hard for them (the patients) to find words to explain it.\" **Note:** For lots more on NDEs, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/nde/near-death-experiences-ndes).

And among the top, from men in particular, is 'I wish I hadn't worked so hard'. Bronnie Ware is an Australian nurse who spent several years working in palliative care, caring for patients in the last 12 weeks of their lives. She recorded their dying epiphanies in a blog called Inspiration and Chai, which gathered so much attention that she put her observations into a book called [*The Top Five Regrets of the Dying*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Top-Five-Regrets-Dying/dp/140194065X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1335151384&sr=1-1). Ware writes of the phenomenal clarity of vision that people gain at the end of their lives, and how we might learn from their wisdom. \"When questioned about any regrets they had or anything they would do differently,\" she says, \"common themes surfaced again and again.\" **Here are the top five regrets of the dying, as witnessed by Ware: 1. I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me. 2. I wish I hadn't worked so hard**. \"All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.\" **3.

He was, after all, a neurosurgeon with sophisticated medical training. But then in 2008 Dr. Alexander contracted bacterial meningitis. The deadly infection soaked his brain and sent him into a deep coma. **During that week, as life slipped away, he now says, he was living intensely in his mind. He was ... guided by \"a beautiful girl with high cheekbones and deep blue eyes\" on the wings of a butterfly to an \"immense void\" that is both \"pitch black\" and \"brimming with light\" coming from an \"orb\" that interprets for an all-loving God.** Dr. Alexander, 58, was so changed by the experience that he felt compelled to write a book, [*Proof of Heaven*](http://www.amazon.com/Proof-Heaven-Neurosurgeons-Journey-Afterlife/dp/1451695195/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1366560150&sr=1-1&keywords=Proof+of+Heaven), that recounts his experience. He knew full well that he was gambling his professional reputation by writing it, but his hope is that his expertise will be enough to persuade skeptics, particularly medical skeptics, as he used to be, to open their minds to an afterworld.

He told us so many people he interviewed for the story had an out-of-body experience, similar to his own when his group was hit by an IED 5 years ago while covering the war in Iraq. He told us when he woke up 36 days later he remembered seeing his body floating below him. Woodruff says others he spoke with describe experiences like his, but the thing he found interesting was, all of them say they weren't scared. \"**Everyone said it was comfort. There was a lack of fear, and certainly no pain. All of them share that**, no matter who they are that's gone through this and it's very, very interesting.\" Woodruff also spoke with several doctors and scientists, who don't necessarily reject these out-of-body experiences, but they're just looking for answers. ABC15 wanted to know, how the people he interviewed felt about coming back to this world. Woodruff says, **\"Almost everybody said not only that they thought about staying, but generally wanted to stay. I, in some ways, was fine with staying.\"** **Special Note:** If the above link fails, see [this webpage](https://web.archive.org/web/20111123002731/http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/science_tech/ABC-tonight%3A-What-it%27s-like-to-experience-a-brush-with-death). **What Happens When We Die?** **2008-09-18, *Time* magazine** [https://web.archive.org/web/20090413010822/https://time.com/time/health...](https://web.archive.org/web/20090413010822/https://time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1842627,00.html) A fellow at New York City's Weill Cornell Medical Center, Dr. Sam Parnia is one of the world's leading experts on the scientific study of death.

Last week Parnia and his colleagues at the Human Consciousness Project announced their first major undertaking: a 3-year exploration of the biology behind \"out-of-body\" experiences. The study, known as AWARE (AWAreness during REsuscitation), involves the collaboration of 25 major medical centers through Europe, Canada and the U.S. and will examine some 1,500 survivors of cardiac arrest. TIME spoke with Parnia about the project's origins, its skeptics and the difference between the mind and the brain. *What sort of methods will this project use to try and verify people's claims of \"near-death\" experience?* When your heart stops beating, there is no blood getting to your brain. And so what happens is that within about 10 sec., brain activity ceases - as you would imagine. Yet paradoxically, 10% or 20% of people who are then brought back to life from that period, which may be a few minutes or over an hour, will report having consciousness. So the key thing here is, Are these real, or is it some sort of illusion? In my book [*What Happens When We Die?*](http://www.amazon.com/What-Happens-When-Die-Groundbreaking/dp/1401907113/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222298820&sr=1-1) ... I wanted people to get both angles - not just the patients' side but also the doctors' side - and see how it feels for the doctors to have a patient come back and tell them what was going on. **There was a cardiologist that I spoke with who said he hasn't told anyone else about it because he has no explanation for how this patient could have been able to describe in detail what he had said and done. He was so freaked out by it that he just decided not to think about it anymore**. **Note:** How interesting that when something amazing happened that this cardiologist could not explain, he chose not to think about it rather than consider that there might be some deeper explanation.

A 10-minute BBC video of this remarkable case is [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNbdUEqDB-k). * In 1991, Atlanta-based singer and songwriter Pam Reynolds felt extremely dizzy, lost her ability to speak, and had difficulty moving her body. A CAT scan showed that she had a giant artery aneurysm-a grossly swollen blood vessel in the wall of her basilar artery, close to the brain stem. If it burst, which could happen at any moment, it would kill her. But the standard surgery to drain and repair it might kill her too. With no other options, Pam turned to a last, desperate measure offered by neurosurgeon Robert Spetzler at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. **Dr. Spetzler was a specialist and pioneer in hypothermic cardiac arrest-a daring surgical procedure nicknamed \"Operation Standstill.\" Spetzler would bring Pam's body down to a temperature so low that she was essentially dead. Her brain would not function, but it would be able to survive longer without oxygen at this temperature. ** The low temperature would also soften the swollen blood vessels, allowing them to be operated on with less risk of bursting. When the procedure was complete, the surgical team would bring her back to a normal temperature before irreversible damage set in. **Essentially, Pam agreed to die in order to save her life-and in the process had what is perhaps the most famous case of independent corroboration of out of body experience (OBE) perceptions on record. **This case is especially important because cardiologist Michael Sabom was able to obtain verification from medical personnel regarding crucial details of the surgical intervention that Pam reported. Here's what happened. Pam was brought into the operating room at 7:15 a.m., she was given general anesthesia, and she quickly lost conscious awareness.

Here's what happened. Pam was brought into the operating room at 7:15 a.m., she was given general anesthesia, and she quickly lost conscious awareness. At this point, Spetzler and his team of more than 20 physicians, nurses, and technicians went to work. They lubricated Pam's eyes to prevent drying, and taped them shut. They attached EEG electrodes to monitor the electrical activity of her cerebral cortex. They inserted small, molded speakers into her ears and secured them with gauze and tape. The speakers would emit repeated 100-decibel clicks-approximately the noise produced by a speeding express train-eliminating outside sounds and measuring the activity of her brainstem. At 8:40 a.m., the tray of surgical instruments was uncovered, and Robert Spetzler began cutting through Pam's skull with a special surgical saw that produced a noise similar to a dental drill. **At this moment, Pam later said, she felt herself \"pop\" out of her body and hover above it, watching as doctors worked on her body.** Although she no longer had use of her eyes and ears, she described her observations in terms of her senses and perceptions. \"I thought the way they had my head shaved was very peculiar,\" she said. \"I expected them to take all of the hair, but they did not.\" She also described the Midas Rex bone saw (\"The saw thing that I hated the sound of looked like an electric toothbrush and it had a dent in it ... \") and the dental-drill sound it made with considerable accuracy. Meanwhile, Spetzler was removing the outermost membrane of Pamela's brain, cutting it open with scissors. At about the same time, a female cardiac surgeon was attempting to locate the femoral artery in Pam's right groin. **Remarkably, Pam later claimed to remember a female voice saying, \"We have a problem. Her arteries are too small.\" And then a male voice: \"Try the other side.\" Medical records confirm this conversation yet Pam could not have heard them.** The cardiac surgeon was right-Pam's blood vessels were indeed too small to accept the abundant blood flow requested by the cardiopulmonary bypass machine, so at 10:50 a.m., a tube was inserted into Pam's left femoral artery and connected to the cardiopulmonary bypass machine. The warm blood circulated from the artery into the cylinders of the bypass machine, where it was cooled down before being returned to her body. Her body temperature began to fall, and at 11:05 a.m. Pam's heart stopped. Her EEG brain waves flattened into total silence. A few minutes later, her brain stem became totally unresponsive, and her", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__she-had-to-die-to-live.txt:1:448dddd30134", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13619, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__she-had-to-die-to-live.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__she-had-to-die-to-live", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "bypass machine, so at 10:50 a.m., a tube was inserted into Pam's left femoral artery and connected to the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

Her body temperature began to fall, and at 11:05 a.m. Pam's heart stopped. Her EEG brain waves flattened into total silence. A few minutes later, her brain stem became totally unresponsive, and her body temperature fell to a sepulchral 60 degrees Fahrenheit. **At 11:25 a.m., the team tilted up the head of the operating table, turned off the bypass machine, and drained the blood from her body. Pamela Reynolds was clinically dead.** **At this point, Pam's out-of-body adventure transformed into a near-death experience (NDE): She recalls floating out of the operating room and traveling down a tunnel with a light. She saw deceased relatives and friends, including her long-dead grandmother, waiting at the end of this tunnel. She entered the presence of a brilliant, wonderfully warm and loving light, and sensed that her soul was part of God and that everything in existence was created from the light (the breathing of God).** But this extraordinary experience ended abruptly, as Reynolds's deceased uncle led her back to her body-a feeling she described as \"plunging into a pool of ice.\" Meanwhile, in the operating room, the surgery had come to an end. When all the blood had drained from Pam's brain, the aneurysm simply collapsed and Spetzler clipped it off. Soon, the bypass machine was turned on and warm blood was pumped back into her body. As her body temperature started to increase, her brainstem began to respond to the clicking speakers in her ears and the EEG recorded electrical activity in the cortex. **The bypass machine was turned off at 12:32 p.m. Pam's life had been restored, and she was taken to the recovery room in stable condition at 2:10 p.m.** Tales of otherworldly experiences have been part of human cultures seemingly forever, but **NDEs as such first came to broad public attention in 1975 by way of American psychiatrist and philosopher Raymond Moody's popular book *Life After Life.* **He presented more than 100 case studies of people who experienced vivid mental experiences close to death or during \"clinical death\" and were subsequently revived to tell the tale. Their experiences were remarkably similar, and Moody coined the term NDE to refer to this phenomenon. The book was popular and controversial, and scientific investigation of NDEs began soon after its publication with the founding, in 1978, of the International Association for Near Death Studies (IANDS)-the first organization in the world devoted to the scientific study of NDEs and their relationship to mind and consciousness.

NDEs are the vivid, realistic, and often deeply life-changing experiences of men, women, and children who have been physiologically or psychologically close to death. They can be evoked by cardiac arrest and coma caused by brain damage, intoxication, or asphyxia. They can also happen following such events as electrocution, complications from surgery, or severe blood loss during or after a delivery. They can even occur as the result of accidents or illnesses in which individuals genuinely fear they might die. **Surveys conducted in the United States and Germany suggest that approximately 4.2 percent of the population has reported an NDE. It has also been estimated that more than 25 million individuals worldwide have had an NDE in the past 50 years.** **People from all walks of life and belief systems have this experience. Studies indicate that the experience of an NDE is not influenced by gender, race, socioeconomic status, or level of education. Although NDEs are sometimes presented as religious experiences, this seems to be a matter of individual perception. Furthermore, researchers have found no relationship between religion and the experience of an NDE. That is, it did not matter whether the people recruited in those studies were Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist, atheist, or agnostic.** Although the details differ, NDEs are characterized by a number of core features. Perhaps the most vivid is the OBE: the sense of having left one's body and of watching events going on around one's body or, occasionally, at some distant physical location. During OBEs, near-death experiencers (NDErs) are often astonished to discover that they have retained consciousness, perception, lucid thinking, memory, emotions, and their sense of personal identity. If anything, these processes are heightened: Thinking is vivid; hearing is sharp; and vision can extend to 360 degrees. NDErs claim that without physical bodies, they are able to penetrate through walls and doors and project themselves wherever they want. They frequently report the ability to read people's thoughts. The effects of NDEs on the experience are intense, overwhelming, and real. **A number of studies conducted in United States, Western European countries, and Australia have shown that most NDErs are profoundly and positively transformed by the experience. **One woman says, \"I was completely altered after the accident. I was another person, according to those who lived near me. I was happy, laughing, appreciated little things, joked, smiled a lot, became friends with everyone ... so completely different than I was before!\" However different their personalities before the NDE, experiencers tend to share a similar psychological", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__she-had-to-die-to-live.txt:3:063070f7280f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13621, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__she-had-to-die-to-live.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__she-had-to-die-to-live", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "conducted in United States, Western European countries, and Australia have shown that most NDErs are profoundly and positively transformed by the experience. **One woman says, \"I was completely altered after the accident.

Indeed, their beliefs, values, behaviors, and worldviews seem quite comparable afterward. Importantly, these psychological and behavioral changes are not the kind of changes one would expect if this experience were a hallucination. And, as noted NDE researcher Pim van Lommel and his colleagues have demonstrated, these changes become more apparent with the passage of time. Some skeptics legitimately argue that the main problem with reports of OBE perceptions is that they often rest uniquely on the NDEr's testimony-there is no independent corroboration. From a scientific perspective, such self-reports remain inconclusive. But during the last few decades, some self-reports of NDErs have been independently corroborated by witnesses, such as that of Pam Reynolds. One of the best known of these *corroborated veridical NDE perceptions*-perceptions that can be proven to coincide with reality-is the experience of a woman named Maria, whose case was first documented by her critical care social worker, Kimberly Clark. Maria was a migrant worker who had a severe heart attack while visiting friends in Seattle. She was rushed to Harborview Hospital and placed in the coronary care unit. A few days later, she had a cardiac arrest but was rapidly resuscitated. The following day, Clark visited her. Maria told Clark that during her cardiac arrest she was able to look down from the ceiling and watch the medical team at work on her body. **** At one point in this experience, said Maria, she found herself outside the hospital and spotted a tennis shoe on the ledge of the north side of the third floor of the building. She was able to provide several details regarding its appearance, including the observations that one of its laces was stuck underneath the heel and that the little toe area was worn. Maria wanted to know for sure whether she had \"really\" seen that shoe, and she begged Clark to try to locate it. **Quite skeptical, Clark went to the location described by Maria-and found the tennis shoe. From the window of her hospital room, the details that Maria had recounted could not be discerned. But upon retrieval of the shoe, Clark confirmed Maria's observations.** \"The only way she could have had such a perspective,\" said Clark, \"was if she had been floating right outside and at very close range to the tennis shoe. I retrieved the shoe and brought it back to Maria; it was very", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nde__she-had-to-die-to-live.txt:4:17b03285d82d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13622, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nde__she-had-to-die-to-live.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nde__she-had-to-die-to-live", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "went to the location described by Maria-and found the tennis shoe.

I retrieved the shoe and brought it back to Maria; it was very concrete evidence for me.\" This case is particularly impressive given that during cardiac arrest, the flow of blood to the brain is interrupted. When this happens, the brain's electrical activity (as measured with EEG) disappears after 10 to 20 seconds. In this state, a patient is deeply comatose. Because the brain structures mediating higher mental functions are severely impaired, such patients are expected to have no clear and lucid mental experiences that will be remembered. Nonetheless, studies conducted in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States have revealed that **approximately 15 percent of cardiac arrest survivors do report some recollection from the time when they were clinically dead. **These studies indicate that consciousness, perceptions, thoughts, and feelings can be experienced during a period when the brain shows no measurable activity. NDEs experienced by people who do not have sight in everyday life are quite intriguing. In 1994, researchers Kenneth Ring and Sharon Cooper decided to undertake a search for cases of NDE-based perception in the blind. They reasoned that such cases would represent the ultimate demonstration of veridical perceptions during NDEs. ** If a blind person was able to report on verifiable events that took place when they were clinically dead, that would mean something real was occurring. They interviewed 31 individuals, of whom 14 were blind from birth. Twenty-one of the participants had had an NDE; the others had had OBEs only. Strikingly, the experiences they reported conform to the classic NDE pattern**, whether they were born blind or had lost their sight in later life. The results of the study were published in 1997. Based on all the cases they investigated, Ring and Cooper concluded that what happens during an NDE affords another perspective to perceive reality that does not depend on the senses of the physical body. They proposed to call this other mode of perception *mindsight*. The scientific NDE studies performed over the past decades indicate that heightened mental functions can be experienced independently of the body at a time when brain activity is greatly impaired or seemingly absent (such as during cardiac arrest). Some of these studies demonstrate that blind people can have veridical perceptions during OBEs associated with an NDE. Other investigations show that NDEs often result in deep psychological and spiritual changes. These findings strongly challenge the mainstream neuroscientific view that mind and consciousness result solely from brain activity.

My condition was non-operable. I chose not to have chemotherapy. I was given six to eight months to live. Before this time, I had become increasingly despondent over the nuclear crisis, the ecology crisis, and so forth. **I came to believe that nature had made a mistake - that we were probably a cancerous organism on the planet. And that is what eventually killed me. ** Before my near-death experience, I tried all sorts of alternative healing methods. None helped. So I determined that this was between me and God. I had never really considered God. Neither was I into any kind of spirituality. But my approaching death sent me on a quest for more information about spirituality and alternative healing. I read various religions and philosophies. They gave hope that there was something on the other side. I had no medical insurance, so my life savings went overnight on tests. Unwilling to drag my family into this, I determined to handle this myself. I ended up in hospice care and was blessed with an angel for my hospice caretaker, whom I will call \"Anne.\" She stayed with me through all that was to follow. **Into the Light ** I woke up about 4:30 am and I knew that this was it. I was going to die. I called a few friends and said good-bye. I woke up Anne and made her promise that my dead body would remain undisturbed for six hours, since I had read that all kinds of interesting things happen when you die. I went back to sleep. The next thing I remember, I was fully aware and standing up. Yet my body was lying in the bed. I seemed to be surrounded by darkness, yet I could see every room in the house, and the roof, and even under the house. A Light shone. I turned toward it, and was aware of its similarity to what others have described in near-death experiences.

It was magnificent and tangible, alluring.** I wanted to go towards that Light like I might want to go into my ideal mother's or father's arms. As I moved towards the Light, I knew that if I went into the Light, I would be dead. So I said/felt, \"Please wait. I would like to talk to you before I go.\"** The entire experience halted. I discovered that I was in control of the experience. My request was honored. I had conversations with the Light. That's the best way I can describe it. The Light changed into different figures, like Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, archetypal images and signs. I asked in a kind of telepathy, \"What is going on here?\" The information transmitted was that our beliefs shape the kind of feedback we receive. If you are a Buddhist or Catholic or Fundamentalist, you get a feedback loop of your own images. I became aware of a Higher Self matrix, a conduit to the Source. We all have a Higher Self, or an oversoul part of our being, a conduit. All Higher Selves are connected as one being. All humans are connected as one being. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. It was like all the love you've ever wanted, and it was the kind of love that cures, heals, regenerates. I was ready to go at that time. I said \"I am ready, take me.\" Then the Light turned into the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen: a mandala of human souls on this planet. I saw that we are the most beautiful creations - elegant, exotic ... everything. I just cannot say enough about how it changed my opinion of human beings in an instant. I said/thought/felt, \"Oh, God, I didn't realize.\" **I was astonished to find that there was no evil in any soul. People may do terrible things out of ignorance and lack, but no soul is evil. \"What all people seek - what sustains them - is love,\" the Light told me. \"What distorts people is a lack of love.\" ** The revelations went on and on. I asked, \"Does this mean that Humankind will be saved?\" Like a trumpet blast with a shower of spiraling lights, the Light \"spoke,\" saying, \"You save, redeem and heal yourself. You always have and always will. You were created with the power to do so from before the beginning of the world.\" In that instant I realized that we have", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:neardeathexperience.txt:1:01e0a8085cfa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13626, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "neardeathexperience.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "neardeathexperience", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "love,\" the Light told me. \"What distorts people is a lack of love.\" ** The revelations went on and on.

You always have and always will. You were created with the power to do so from before the beginning of the world.\" In that instant I realized that we have already been saved. I thanked the Light of God with all my heart. The best thing I could come up with was: \"Oh dear God, dear Universe, dear Great Self, I love my Life.\" The Light seemed to breathe me in even more deeply, absorbing me. I entered into another realm more profound than the last, and was aware of an enormous stream of Light, vast and full, deep. I asked what it was. The Light answered, \"This is the River of Life. Drink of this manna water to your heart's content.\" I drank deeply, in ecstasy. **The Void of Nothingness ** Suddenly I seemed to be rocketing away from the planet on this stream of Life. I saw the earth fly away. The solar system whizzed by and disappeared. I flew through the center of the galaxy, absorbing more knowledge as I went. I learned that this galaxy - and the entire Universe - is bursting with many different varieties of life. I saw many worlds. [We are not alone](https://www.WantToKnow.info/ufocover-up) in this Universe. It seemed as if all the creations in the Universe soared past me and vanished in a speck of Light. Then a second Light appeared. As I passed into the second Light, I could perceive forever, beyond Infinity. I was in the Void, pre-Creation, the beginning of time, the first Word or vibration. I rested in the Eye of Creation and it seemed that I touched the Face of God. It was not a religious feeling. I was simply at One with Absolute Life and Consciousness. I rode the stream directly into the center of the Light. I felt embraced by the Light as it took me in with its breath again. And the truth was obvious that there is no death; that nothing is born and nothing dies; that we are immortal beings, part of a natural living system that recycles itself endlessly. **It would take me years to assimilate the Void experience. It was less than nothing, yet greater than anything. Creation is God exploring God's Self through every way imaginable. Through every piece of hair on your head, through every leaf on every tree, through every atom. God is exploring God's Self. I saw everything as the Self of all. God is here.

It was only natural, from what I had seen. As I began my return to the life cycle, it never crossed my mind, nor was I told, that I would return to the same body. It did not matter. I had complete trust in the Light and the Life process. As the stream merged with the great Light, I asked never to forget the revelations and the feelings of what I had learned on the other side. I thought of myself as a human again and I was happy to be that. From what I have seen, I would be happy to be an atom in this universe. An atom. So to be the human part of God ... this is the most fantastic blessing. It is a blessing beyond our wildest imagination of what a blessing can be.

But I reincarnated back into this body. I was so surprised when I opened my eyes, to be back in this body, back in my room with someone looking over me, crying her eyes out. It was Anne, my hospice caretaker. She had found me dead thirty minutes before. We do not know how long I was dead, only that she found me thirty minutes before. She had honored my wish to have my newly-dead body left alone. She can verify that I really was dead. It was not a near-death experience. I believe I probably experienced death itself for at least an hour and a half. When I later awakened and saw the light outside, confused, I tried to get up to go to it, but I fell out of the bed. She heard a loud \"clunk\", ran in, and found me on the floor. When I recovered, I was surprised and awed about what had happened. I had no memory at first of the experience.

Within three days, I was feeling normal again, clearer, yet different than ever before. My memories of the journey came back later. But **from my return I could find nothing wrong with any human being I had ever seen. Previous to my death I was judgmental, believing that people were really screwed up. ** About three months later a friend said I should get tested for the cancer. So I got the scans and so forth. I felt healthy. I still remember the doctor at the clinic looking at the \"before\" and \"after\" scans. He said, \"I can find no sign of cancer now.\" \"A miracle?\" I asked. \"No,\" he answered. \"These things happen ... spontaneous remission.\" He seemed unimpressed. But I was impressed. I knew it was a miracle. **Lessons Learned ** **I asked God: \"What is the best religion on the planet? Which one is right?\" God said with great love: \"It doesn't matter.\"** What an incredible grace. It does not matter what religion we are. Religions come and they go. They change. Buddhism has not been here forever, Catholicism has not been here forever, and they are all about to become more enlightened. More light is coming into all systems now. Many will resist and fight about it, one religion against the next, believing that only they are right. When God said, \"It doesn't matter,\" I understood that it is for us to care about, because we are the caring beings. The Source does not care if you are Protestant, Buddhist, or Jew. Each is a reflection, a facet of the whole. I wish that all religions would realize it and let each other be. It is not the end of separate religions, but live and let live. Each has a different view, and it all adds up to the big picture. **I went over to the other side with a lot of fears about toxic waste, nuclear missiles, the population explosion, the rain forest. I came back loving every single problem. I love nuclear waste. I love the mushroom cloud; this is the holiest mandala that we have manifested to date, as an archetype. More than any religion or philosophy on Earth, that terrible, wonderful cloud brought us together all of a sudden, to a new level of consciousness. ** Knowing that maybe we can blow up the planet fifty times, or 500 times,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:neardeathexperience.txt:4:86202c991c03", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13629, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "neardeathexperience.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "neardeathexperience", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "toxic waste, nuclear missiles, the population explosion, the rain forest.

For a period, they had to keep setting off more bombs to get it into us. Then we started saying, \"we do not need this any more.\" Now we are actually in a safer world than we have ever been in, and it is going to get even safer. So I came back loving toxic waste, because it brought us together. These things are so big. Clearing of the rain forest will slow down, and in fifty years there will be more trees on the planet than in a long time. If you are into ecology, go for it; you are that part of the system that is becoming aware. Go for it with all your might, but do not be depressed or disheartened. Earth is in the process of domesticating itself, and we are cells on that Body. Population increase is getting very close to the optimal range of energy to cause a shift in consciousness. That shift in consciousness will change politics, money, energy, and more. The Great Mystery of life has little to do with intelligence. The Universe is not an intellectual process. The intellect is helpful; but our hearts are the wiser part of ourselves. Since my return I have experienced the Light spontaneously. I have learned how to get to that space almost any time in my meditation. You can also do this. You don't have to die first. You are wired for it already. The body is the most magnificent Light being there is. The body is a universe of incredible Light. We don't need to commune with God; God is already communing with us in every moment! **Note:** The above text is a concise, slightly edited summary.

Is it a hoax or a scam? I first learned about NESARA in 2002. **I have investigated this fairly carefully and have serious doubts about the NESARA claims.** Originally, there were two conflicting websites focused on NESARA. The \"Dove of Oneness\" version was promulgated at www.nesara.us. This [well researched report](https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/special-reports/article25855081.html) from the *Tacoma News Tribune* reveals Dove as Shaini Goodwin, a master of deception. I highly recommend this article as it beautifully shows how some people are ensnared in this and so many other scams. The website was discontinued in 2010 after [Goodwin's death](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/shaini-goodwin-obituary?pid=178697247). [This link](http://web.archive.org/web/20040723012125/http://www.nesara.us/pages/home.html) takes you to an archived copy of her website on archive.org. The second version, run by a Ph.D. systems engineer named Harvey Barnard, was promoted on nesara.org, which claimed to be the official NESARA website. Barnard clearly [denounced Dove](https://web.archive.org/web/20040405135634/https://www.nesara.org/articles/rabbits-rumors_wtc.htm). By using [archive.org](http://www.archive.org/) you can see that nesara.org came onto the scene first in [June of 2001](https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.nesara.org). The Dove of Oneness NESARA website [started in November of 2002](https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.nesara.us). Though [Barnard died in 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112002842/https://obits.theadvocate.com/obituaries/theadvocate/obituary.aspx?pid=3576472), the nesara.org website continued to be maintained until it was taken down in early 2015. [This link](https://web.archive.org/web/20110831154706/http://nesara.org/main/index.htm) takes you to an archived copy of Barnard's website. **Numerous iterations of NESARA propaganda have popped up on the Internet since these first two. I find it hard to believe any of them,** though there is certainly some convincing information presented for those who don't explore deeper into the matter. The NESARA bill, available on [this webpage](https://www.WantToKnow.info/nesara.pdf), was written by Barnard as an \"academic exercise.\" Though very well thought out and written, it never went anywhere, as [he himself fully admitted](https://web.archive.org/web/20050205164433/http://nesara.org/main/status_of_the_bill.htm). Dove's claims that it was secretly passed by Congress in 2000 were a fabrication, as made clear in [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20050205164433/http://nesara.org/main/status_of_the_bill.htm). Anyone who is encouraging you to spend money and go into debt because it won't matter anymore in the future is, in my opinion, highly suspect, especially if they are asking for your money. Read the email exchange I had on this below and the following two articles. Both articles are quite intriguing. Don't believe everything written here, but consider that at least some of it may be true. I invite you to be careful if you do choose to be involved in this matter.** I especially don't advise going further into debt with the hope that it will all be forgiven.** The NESARA bill written by Barnard had some thought-provoking ideas in it, yet I'm certain it never was accepted in Congress, and it has been used by Dove and others to promote a big, sophisticated hoax.

Mr. Burks, I ran across a quote of yours on [Jean Hudon's email list](http://www.earthrainbownetwork.com/). You mentioned NESARA. I have been following the NESARA'S Dove of Oneness reports for about a month now and it gave me so much hope. I did tell myself that I needed to be aware of the saying \"If it sounds too good to be true, it probally is!\" I have just been waiting to see if Jean would be talking about NESARA on his site and here you are today. Would you please be so kind as to write to me and tell me what you know about NESARA? I'm not saying the information is not true, but there are huge amounts of money and time being spent to concoct stories which gullible, well intentioned New Age people like ourselves will often swallow all too easily. NESARA is a wonderful example of that if you have heard of it. Yes, we need to spread the news for those who are ready to hear, but let's make sure that news is credible. Thank you so much for your time. Elizabeth April 29, 2003 Hi Elizabeth Having been [involved in high level politics](https://www.wanttoknow.info/g/fredburks/down_the_rabbit_hole) as an interpreter, I was both very impressed and very suspicious of NESARA when I first heard about it almost a year ago. It was just too big to be kept a secret, even though it was done incredibly professionally. I am fairly certain that it is secret government disinformation to throw good-hearted people off the track, and to drive people further into debt, thinking they won't have to pay for it. One of our team has talked with Dove and was disturbed with her responses as well. She recommends the articles below. Thanks for checking in and have a wonderful, blessed day!

Ekker of Tehachapi, California and Las Vegas, Nevada, have created fraudulent financial instruments based on the mammoth Peruvian Commodity Contract known as the Bonus 3392-181. V.K. Durham, also known as Granny Herrman or the widow of Colonel Russell Herrman of the OSS and CIA, is that CEO and is the lawful signatory to the Bonus Contract. In the series of articles entitled the [Texas Two Step & The Billionaire Boys' Club](https://web.archive.org/web/20041111062325/https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi?read=26591), she detailed the ways in which a select group of corporate leaders and politicians tried to create an \"insiders' only\" club for doing business in the whole of the western world. She has given precise details of the murder of her husband, Colonel Herrman. **She has revealed that the two Ekkers, who were long-time scam artists operating under various corporation or partnership names, created an entire mythology of a \"Spaceship Commander\" from the Pleiades -- named Hatonn -- who communicated by a special radio frequency that only Doris Ekkers could receive.** She has discussed how the creation of the Global Alliance Investment Association and other groups which may use a similar acronym -- GAIA -- are the \"financial muscle\" behind this cult mythology. She has related to RMN readers how this self-styled channel for the \"Hatonn\" has also reserved the alias of Germain, as in St. Germain, the Ascended Master who was also a man of noble birth who lived in France prior to their Revolution. V.K. Durham has provided extensive documentation and made the links to show that the Ekkers' scams have netted them something in excess of $17 million in gold and that they left behind some $5 million in gold coins, when they skedaddled out of the United States in late 1997. She and others have provided information linking the Ekkers to scams run on elderly U.S. Citizens, like Betty Tuten of Nevada, who lost $402,000 to one of their \"investment\" plans. **An article published in the Sunday Telegraph of London in 2001 revealed that the Ekkers took a fortune in gold coins from a retired mathematician in Austin,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nesara.txt:2:8eed82bccc5a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13634, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nesara.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nesara", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "gold and that they left behind some $5 million in gold coins, when they skedaddled out of the United States in late 1997. She and others have provided information linking the Ekkers to scams run on elderly U.S. Citizens, like Betty Tuten of Nevada, who lost $402,000 to one of their \"investment\" plans. **An article published in the Sunday Telegraph of London in 2001 revealed that the Ekkers took a fortune in gold coins from a retired mathematician in Austin, Texas, one Dave Overton, by selling him on the reality of their spaceship commander -- Hatonn.** He was a mathematical genius and a notable eccentric, and a Nevada court determined in 1994 that Mr. Overton had been swindled by the Ekkers and George Green, their one-time business agent. After he died, his estate was probated and some of the money they took from him was returned to it. Through it all, these two Ekkers have conducted their business -- which is nothing more than scamming, selling mythologies and dreams of interstellar glory, and falsified gold bonds and instruments -- with the help of a bewildering variety of corporations and partnerships. The Ekkers even founded a church and then used that Church to sue themselves! Why? It was done in order to get publicity, to create a 'victim status,' and to keep the readers of their publications \"involved\", that is to say -- using \"Ritual.\" Throughout it all, they have somehow won and held the allegiance of a variety of people with many talents. **The latest and deadliest scam, based on yet another improbable mythology, is the \"secret law\" called NESARA or the National Stabilization And Reformation Act, which has been ceaselessly propagated by one who calls herself \"the Dove of Oneness\".** The mythologies of NESARA all revolve around the legitimate losses and the truly tragic swindles of the Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s. Hundreds of thousands of farm and ranching families and rural businesses were drawn into the whirlpool of bankruptcy and foreclosures, and from that long-running tragedy was generated a movement which has been called The Farm Claims. The Dove of Oneness, who claims to receive messages from the Ascended Master St. Germain, has taken many opportunities to link the origin of NESARA as a secret law reforming the whole of the United States' tax code, abolishing the income tax, to then moving the country into a gold standard. Whether this individual knows it or not, the so-called Master is none other than Doris J. Ekker, who has registered the alias of St. Germain. NESARA is not just a mythology. It is not just a scam designed to build an e-mail list for later use by other confidence men, fraud experts and flim-flam artists! **It is an incredibly dangerous and insidious trap, a psychological warfare tactic, designed to ensnare thousands of good and patriotic Americans, and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nesara.txt:3:a84cdc705a46", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13635, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nesara.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nesara", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "a gold standard.

Ekker has been a Navy intelligence asset for almost 30 years.\" But isn't Naval Intelligence the soul of Faction Two? Talk about turning on the lights! The plan is to destroy the Children of Light, before they ever see one dollar of prosperity from any program or any fund of any kind! Talk about selling out the Children of Light, for the benefit of the Dark Agenda, as Dove calls it! The question immediately redounds -- how can a man who is a Naval Intelligence asset operate in the clear, as a scam artist, working both traditional forms of confidence and creating an entire \"spaceship mythology\" with a virulently anti-Israel and anti-Federal Reserve System bias, continue to enjoy his success while in exile? Who is protecting him? Is it Faction 1, the New World Order and the Satanists? Is it Faction 2, the principled opposition to the New World Order and the advocates of a return to lawful money, the gold standard and the Constitution? Why does E.J. Ekker seem to have complete and absolute immunity, even as he and Doris J. Ekker float their false instruments to leverage gold and funnel monies to the Al Qaeda network of terrorist groups? Which side are they on? The answer is shocking and shockingly obvious: **The Ekkers are on both sides. They are Triple Agents, the most skilled and skilful operatives ever known, and they have very nearly succeeded in selling their entire NESARA ~ Farm Claims ~ Prosperity Programs mythology to a monster-sized audience.** But why? Why pull a Triple Cross on the people of the United States and Canada, and all the others who have put money into prosperity programs like the Bergavine, the SBC, the Treasurygate and the mighty Omega? What is the purpose? TRIPLE CROSS, TRIPLE THREAT, TRIPLE PLAY The impeccable source also informs Rumor Mill News that E.J.

The first purpose of Faction 2 has been, we are told, to bankrupt and destroy the Federal Reserve System, which is the private banking cartel and the oppressor holding sway over these United States (and Canada, too). What E.J. Ekker was conniving to do, was to bring in those gold-backed bonds and gold certificates and to bring the cash that the phony Deeds of Assignment were used to create, to whack the Fed Res Sys into pieces. No doubt some of what Ekker has assembled in the portfolio of GAIA is legitimate. But most of it is a forgery. 2. The Faction opposing the New World Order has been linked to Naval Intelligence, and to men who are loyal to the Constitution and the organic United States: now it is clear that the Ekkers were tripling-up -- working their bona fides as F-1 agents and representing themselves to Faction 2 as having 'defected in place'. V.K. Durham confirms that Doris Ekker has often represented herself as \"working for a higher authority\" than the President! In reality, the Ekkers have been working for F-1, the Satanic New World Order at a much higher level! 3. The drive for nine months or more, with the Dove, et al., has been to build her email list. Clearly, the goal of F-1 was to allow F-2 to use those false Deeds of Assignment, along with many legitimate instruments and other gold assets, to bring those Trillions said to be in the prosperity programs back into play. To do what is right and proper in making \"whole\" the great tragedy of the farm and ranch foreclosures and the ruined lives that spawned the Farm Claims. 4. Now, to bring these assets into the country as financial instruments convertible into monies, would be a good thing if they were not based on the fraudulent Deeds of Assignment written by the Ekkers and using -- among other things -- their false front Cosmos Seafood Energy groups. But the money is coming in from abroad, that does make it subject to federal oversight, and so what happens next? THE EKKERS ARE SACRIFICED The Ekkers will be revealed in the mass (controlled) media as being the Sugar Daddy and the Sugar Momma of the Al Qaeda!

Then, just when the Trillions of dollars which the Ekkers have ginned up by selling falsified gold instruments, actually move into position and the program recipients are given access. Then -- the Children of Light would be tarred with the brush of having taken money directly from the Al Qaeda Headquarters in Manila, and by way of Islamic banking operations which are holding debentures! The Federal Reserve System would be tasked to seek out and seize or freeze all of these funds (thus, sacrificing the Ekkers), and federal law enforcement and Anti-Terrorist units would then proceed to use the Dove list! They would then seek out and arrest the most prominent supporters of these legitimate Farm Claims, thus destroying the nucleus of a true political opposition by decapitating and ruining its most ardent advocates. The gravity of the situation cannot be underestimated! Whereas it is not practical to arrest 300,000+ people around the world in one or two day's time, it is not actually necessary to do that at all! The purpose is to take down the Farm Claims activists, not to take the properties they have already lost, but to turn them into confessed criminals or indicted co-conspirators! The people on the Dove list would be arrested for \"financial terrorism\" as soon as they got their monies in their accounts, and sought to access. Meanwhile the Children of Light would either be sullied and made pariahs, or set up for indictments, too. The monies -- all of the Trillions -- would then be seized or frozen or sequestered, and the Fed Res Sys would be made liquid again by keeping all those assets in place in their member banks. We know from experience that it takes years to get seized assets back, the legal costs are immense, and what assets are the Farm Claimants going to have to use? None. V.K. Durham estimates that the liabilities for bad paper and bad derivatives investments, accruing to the Federal Reserve System are at or in excess of $31 Trillion dollars. Then, consider that the total said to be moving into the Omega, Bergavine, Farm Claims and other related programs is in excess of $37 Trillion dollars USDA.

It is a Triple Play, in the parlance of baseball, and every runner is put out, and all the bases are cleared. The impeccable source reporting to Rumor Mill News said this about E.J. Ekker, as a spy, a confidence man, a planner -- \"... his skills alone are some of the best around and he has always surrounded himself with the best in all fields\", and that includes the use of the Internet and computers and tracking. **The Ekkers are operating the Dove as an asset, even if she doesn't know it:** she and her crew are a GAIA cell. So, too, is Patrick Bellringer. So? So, it does matter, in life and death terms, it does matter! The Dove's legion of followers would suddenly be faced with doing hard time, once they did get their monies; and their defense would be the illusory NESARA law, which nobody has ever seen in print. Furthermore, the Children of Light would be both disenfranchised and \"targetted\" as supporters or co-operators with the Al Qaeda, and the now-bankrupt Fed Res Sys would be given new life -- albeit a new life based on the fraudulent Deeds of Assignment, debentures and other instruments faked up and phonied up by the Ekkers and their crew -- but a life that they could easily continue to live and enjoy! Triple Threat. Triple Cross. Triple Play. If you are on the Dove's list -- YOU ARE IT, and YOU ARE OUT. **Rumors-The \"Real\" NESARA** Dr. Harvey Barnard started his search for a root cause and the solutions to America's social problems in the late 1960s when a professor at Louisiana State University casually remarked during a lecture that social and economic problems could be analyzed and solved with the same tools and techniques used to solve industrial problems. That single comment launched a lifetime pursuit of intellectual curiosity that later became a crusade, driven by nothing more than the challenge of doing the seemingly impossible. After many years of personal study, Dr. Barnard developed [a new theory of money](https://web.archive.org/web/20040204175112/https://www.nesara.org/articles/index.htm#money). His NESARA legislative proposal began as a formal idea in the late 1980s. The current NESARA proposal saw first light in the early 1990s as a proposal for monetary policy reform. Later Dr. Barnard added his proposals for fiscal policy reform. In 1996 Dr. Barnard self-published his first version of [Draining the Swamp](https://web.archive.org/web/20050404071004/http://nesara.org/book/index.htm), which contained the first public copy of his full NESARA proposal.

He circulated copies to members of Congress and other influential political actors. After numerous personal attempts to introduce NESARA to Congress, including attempts to encourage presidential candidates to use NESARA as part of a political reform platform, Dr. Barnard decided that the best hope for meaningful reform was through a grass roots effort.' In 1999, with the world wide web beginning to impact modern social structures, he decided to place his NESARA proposal into the public domain and went live with his web site in the summer of 2000. He founded the NESARA Institute in 2001. Shortly after introducing NESARA to the world wide web, certain people latched onto the NESARA idea and began promoting a different version of this story. Supporters of the altered version of the NESARA story believe that NESARA was enacted into law secretly during the Clinton administration, that there are \"White Knights\" working tirelessly behind the political scenes to inform the world of this secret legislation, and that the altered version of NESARA promises numerous debt forgiveness elements. Originally, the altered story did not dispute the original NESARA acronym used by Dr. Barnard, but as the rumors increased, supporters then also altered the NESARA acronym. Although little more than a curiosity for a few years, the altered version of the NESARA story took on a life of its own and now grows throughout the world wide web much like a cancer. So influential is this alternate effort that many people have protested outside the World Court, and some people have paid thousands of dollars to advertise their version of NESARA on the side panels of advertising trucks in Washington, D.C. Sadly, this disinformation campaign has reduced the credibility of Dr. Barnard's efforts and today the word \"NESARA\" is an ill-received word at Congress. To this day Dr. Barnard's NESARA proposal has yet to be [introduced into Congress](https://web.archive.org/web/20050205164433/http://nesara.org/main/status_of_the_bill.htm). The staff at the NESARA Institute understands part of the emotional and psychological reasons why people support the alternate version of NESARA. Dr. Barnard intended to provide meaningful social reform through his NESARA proposal. He believed that no meaningful social reform was possible without meaningful monetary system reform. Dr. Barnard believed that although individual units of money were privately owned, the monetary exchange system itself was owned by everybody and that the system must be [fair and equitable](https://web.archive.org/web/20050210211203/http://nesara.org/wiifm/fair_or_equitable.htm) to all people at all times and not just benefit a few politically privileged", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nesara.txt:8:e9f875c2814b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13640, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nesara.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nesara", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "psychological reasons why people support the alternate version of NESARA. Dr. Barnard intended to provide meaningful social reform through his NESARA proposal. He believed that no meaningful social reform was possible without meaningful monetary system reform.

Part of that monetary reform required modifying the fundamental equations that drive the current economic system, primarily through the socially disruptive concept known as compound interest. By restructuring those equations Dr. Barnard believed that [meaningful monetary reform](https://web.archive.org/web/20050211092629/http://nesara.org/articles/practical_virtual_wealth1.htm) was possible. [Restructuring those equations](https://web.archive.org/web/20050214171644/http://nesara.org/articles/new_equations.htm) necessarily implied a shift in the character of debt. Debt would not disappear, but most people would find themselves in debt for shorter periods. This effort would return resources to people so that they once again tasted and experienced meaningful social liberty. Unfortunately, many supporters of the alternate NESARA story interpreted this change in the character of debt as a debt reduction or debt forgiveness plan. Perhaps more sadly is that several investment schemes and prosperity programs circulate around this alternate NESARA story and because so many people desire meaningful monetary reform, find themselves succumbing to the Siren's lure and provide these schemers money. Money that is never again seen nor is any return on investment ever realized. Of course, the alternate NESARA story rests upon a conspiracy theory in that NESARA allegedly was passed secretly. Thus, researchers can ask for a copy of this alleged act, but will be told that no copy exists because of the secret passage. Diligent researchers are reminded of the impossibility of honestly investigating this alternate version of NESARA and that such difficulties should provide clues about authenticity. Additionally, the process of enacting a legislative proposal and bill into law is easily understood by surfing the web. Researchers will learn that no proposed legislation or bill is ever enacted secretly. Of course, the copy of NESARA proposed by Dr. Barnard is available here at this [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20050308215430/http://nesara.org/bill/index.htm), as well as in [Draining the Swamp](https://web.archive.org/web/20050404071004/http://nesara.org/book/index.htm). There also are claims from supporters of the alternate NESARA that Dr. Barnard and NESARA Institute staff members all work for President Bush or other nefarious \"New World Order\" organizations. They also claim that NESARA as presented here at this web site is merely a ploy to detract people from knowing the so-called \"true\" NESARA. Before investing funds with anybody, one should diligently research the investment plan. That research includes reading literature, conversing with people, and then seriously evaluating the information based upon facts and not pure emotion. The staff at the NESARA Institute empathizes with those who have lost hard earned funds to these schemers and scam promoters, but a life of social liberty begins first and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nesara.txt:9:727825d3fe51", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13641, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nesara.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nesara", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "at this web site is merely a ploy to detract people from knowing the so-called \"true\" NESARA.

The staff at the NESARA Institute empathizes with those who have lost hard earned funds to these schemers and scam promoters, but a life of social liberty begins first and foremost with self-responsibility. Perhaps one day the alternate NESARA story will fizzle and disappear, but as long as people act and respond through emotion rather than intelligence then these scam artists will continue to succeed. Some people believe that there is no such thing as bad publicity, but many serious NESARA advocates now realize that there also is a point of no return with some kinds of publicity. Credibility becomes a factor because of the effort to circulate the alternate NESARA story. Serious advocates of Dr. Barnard's NESARA idea would like to see NESARA introduced into Congress. Serious advocates realize that doing so is an uphill battle simply through the fundamental political process, but that the alternate NESARA story makes that hill steeper and more difficult to climb. True monetary and fiscal policy reform still await. Social conflict continues because of the flawed equations that drive the system. Please exercise some common sense before deciding to support the alternate NESARA story. For further information: [What is a Rabbit?

Within 20 years, there would be automobiles, airplanes, movies, recorded music, telephones, radio, and practical cameras. For the first time in history, common people were encouraged to envision a utopian future filled with abundant modern transportation and communication, as well as jobs, housing and food for everyone.

None of these technologies have made it to the open consumer market, however. Why this is true will be discussed shortly. First, here is a short list of new energy technologies. The common feature connecting all of these discoveries is that they use a small amount of one form of energy to control or release a large amount of a different kind of energy.

[[More](https://www.WantToKnow.info/freeenergy#6)] There are dozens of other systems. Many are viable and well tested. But this short list is sufficient to make the point: new energy technology is here. It offers the world pollution-free energy abundance for everyone, everywhere. It is now possible to stop the production of \"greenhouse gases\" and shut down the nuclear power plants. Transportation and production costs for just about everything can drop dramatically. Yet all these wonderful benefits that can make life on this planet so much easier and better for everyone have been postponed for decades. Why? Whose purposes are served by this postponement? **Four Invisible Forces. There are four forces that have worked together to create this situation. The wealthiest families and their central banking institutions are the [first force](https://www.WantToKnow.info/051115secretsocietiesbilderberg)**. Their motivations are greed and the need to control almost everything except themselves. Their plan is to eventually control all of the resources of the world, and thereby control everyone's life through the availability of all goods and services. An independent source of wealth (new energy device) in the hands of every person in the world ruins their plans for world domination. They don't want any competition. The weapons they have used to enforce this include intimidation, \"expert\" debunkers, buying and shelving of technology, and murder of inventors. They have also promoted the scientific theory that states free energy is impossible (laws of thermodynamics). **The second force is national governments**. The problem here is related to the maintenance of national security. There is a constant jockeying for position and influence in world affairs, and the strongest party wins. In economics, it's the golden rule: \"The one with the gold makes the rules.\" Unlimited energy on this planet will lead to an inevitable reshuffling of the balance of power. Everybody will want it, and at the same time, want to prevent everyone else from getting it. So, national governments' motivations are self-preservation. Their weapons include preventing the issuance of patents based on national security grounds, harassment of inventors with criminal charges, tax audits, threats, phone taps, arson, theft, and a host of other intimidations which make the business of building and marketing a new energy machine practically impossible. **The third force consists of deluded inventors and con men**. On the periphery of the extraordinary scientific breakthroughs that constitute real new energy technologies, lies a shadow world of unexplained anomalies, marginal inventions and unscrupulous promoters. The first two forces have constantly used the media to promote the worst examples of this group, to distract the public's attention, and to discredit real breakthroughs by associating", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:newenergysources.txt:1:09d8e6046243", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13648, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "newenergysources.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "newenergysources", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "intimidations which make the business of building and marketing a new energy machine practically impossible. **The third force consists of deluded inventors and con men**.

The first two forces have constantly used the media to promote the worst examples of this group, to distract the public's attention, and to discredit real breakthroughs by associating them with the frauds. So, the third force is delusion and dishonesty. The motivations are self-aggrandizement, greed, want of power over others, and a false sense of self-importance. The weapons used are lying, cheating, self-delusion and arrogance combined with bad science. **The fourth force operating to postpone the public availability of new energy technology is all of the rest of us.** It may be easy to see how narrow and selfish the motivations of the other forces are, but actually, these motivations are still very much alive in each of us as well. Like the wealthiest families, don't we each secretly harbor illusions of false superiority and want to control others instead of ourselves? Also, wouldn't you sell out if the price were high enough? Or like the governments, don't we each want to ensure our own survival? Or like the deluded inventor, don't we trade a comfortable illusion once in a while for an uncomfortable fact? Or don't we still fear the unknown, even if it promises a great reward? All four forces are just different aspects of the same process. There is really only one force preventing the availability of new energy technology, and that is unspiritually motivated behavior. New energy technology is an outward manifestation of divine abundance. It is the engine of the economy of an enlightened society, where people voluntarily behave in a respectful and civil manner toward each other. Unspiritualized humans cannot be trusted with new energy. They will only do what they have always done, which is to take merciless advantage of each other, or kill each other and themselves in the process. **The Opportunity.** What is new is that you and I can communicate with each other now better than at anytime in the past. The Internet offers us, the fourth force, an opportunity to overcome the combined efforts of the other forces preventing new energy technology from spreading. What is starting to happen is that inventors are [publishing their work](https://web.archive.org/web/20150312123641/http://www.peswiki.com/index.php/Congress:Top_100_Technologies_--_RD), instead of patenting it and keeping it secret.

If we stand up and refuse to remain ignorant and action-less, we can change the course of history. Only mass action can create the world we want. The other three forces will not help us put a fuelless power plant in our homes. New energy technology will change everything about the way we live, work and relate to each other. It obsoletes greed and fear for survival. But like all exercises of spiritual faith, **we must first manifest generosity and trust in our own lives**. New energy technology is here. It has been here for decades. Communications technology and the Internet have torn the veil of secrecy off of this remarkable fact. People all over the world are starting to build new energy devices. The bankers and governments don't want this to happen, but can't stop it. Tremendous economic instabilities and wars will be used to distract people's attention from the new energy movement. There will be essentially no major media coverage of this aspect of what is going on. Western society is in many ways spiraling toward self-destruction due to the accumulated effects of greed and corruption. New energy technologies cannot stop this trend. If, however, you have a new energy device, you may be better positioned to support the transition that is underway. The question is, who will ultimately control the emerging world government, the first force, or the fourth force? **Those who choose the fourth force may live to see the dawn of the world of new energy.

The movie, which won the coveted Palme D'Or, is a blistering critique of the Bush administration's motives for the \"war on terror,\" and even goes so far as to suggest that the Twin Tower atrocities provided a convenient mandate for America to invade Iraq. Reaction to the film is one more sign of the growing cynicism over the President's handling of the catastrophic events of 9/11. Yet the questions that Moore's movie pose scratch only the surface. Now, an explosive book on the happenings of 9/11, which raises even more controversial issues, is about to be published. It will be damned in some quarters as nothing other than the irresponsible ramblings of conspiracy theorists or the wild rantings of anti-war activists. Much of what it says has been criticised, and flatly denied, by the White House and America's intelligence services. Yet its findings have garnered an enthusiastic response from sections of America's intelligentsia and a former British Cabinet Minister, the MP Michael Meacher, wrote the foreword of the book. In it he says: \"Never in modern history has an event of such cataclysmic significance been shrouded in such mystery. So many of the key facts remain unexplained on any plausible basis, and so many of the key actors have put forward contradictory accounts only to be forced to retract or cover up later.\" Whether he is right or not, the book is tellingly called The New", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:newpearlharbor.txt:0:0508375f5d16", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13651, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "newpearlharbor.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "newpearlharbor", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "British Cabinet Minister, the MP Michael Meacher, wrote the foreword of the book.

The book makes some deeply unpalatable - and frankly incredible - assertions, even querying if the Al Qaeda attacks would have happened without the complicity of America's most powerful politicians and policy-makers. Written by the academic author and American theologian, Professor David Ray Griffin of Claremont School of Theology, California, it challenges almost every official account of the day and among the disturbing questions it asks are . . . Why were no military fighters scrambled from the nearest air force bases after the terrorists first struck? How could a rookie pilot - one of the terrorists - fly a 757 aircraft so precisely into the American defence headquarters, the Pentagon? Was it really an aircraft that pierced this well-protected building or a military plane or missile? And who made ten million dollars out of betting before 9/11 that shares in the two airlines of the hijacked planes were about to plummet? To start to unravel this extraordinary story one must go back to September 11, 2001 as President George Bush flew into Florida, on Air Force One for what was intended as the perfect photo opportunity. It was just after 9am and the world's most powerful man was sitting among seven-year-olds at a school in Sarasota listening as they laboriously lisped from a favourite American school book, My Pet Goat. The President was in good humour, even cracking a corny joke and evoking laughter among the watching teachers, TV crews and his secret service men. Yet a terrorist maelstrom had already been unleashed. A little over one hour earlier and 1,200 miles away on the Eastern seaboard, American Airlines Flight 11 had left Boston at 7.59. Fifteen minutes later its radio suddenly snapped off air. The first indication that it might have been hijacked. The time was precisely 8:14am. Flight 11 should have been immediately intercepted by fighter pilots sent up from nearby McGuire Air Force Base, in New Jersey, who could have made the journey to the World Trade Centre in three minutes. Interception is a standard - and mandatory - emergency procedure in the U.S. in suspected hijacks and one that had been used routinely in 67 air scares over America in the nine months preceding 9/11. But,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:newpearlharbor.txt:1:82bd257ee596", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13652, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "newpearlharbor.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "newpearlharbor", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "might have been hijacked.

Interception is a standard - and mandatory - emergency procedure in the U.S. in suspected hijacks and one that had been used routinely in 67 air scares over America in the nine months preceding 9/11. But, disturbingly, fighter jets were instead ordered out of an air base 180 miles away in Cape Cod. And they flew so slowly that they did not even arrive in time to stop the second hijack attack on the south tower of the Trade Centre. According to Griffin, \"There are standard procedures for situations such as this . . . and if they had been followed American Airline Flight 11 would have been intercepted by fighter jets within ten minutes of any sign that it had been hijacked. Had the plane then failed to obey the standard signal to follow the fighter jets to an airport it would have been shot down.\" The two Cape Cod F-15 fighters, one piloted by a Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy, set off at 8.52 when there were still 11 minutes to go before the second plane hit the World Trade Centre at 9:03am. Lt-Col Duffy has since said that he was \"on full blower all the way\" - a top speed of more than 1850mph, which meant he could travel at 32 miles every minute. \"Allowing the standard 2.5 minutes for them to get airborne and up to speed, the fighters should have reached Manhattan in about eight minutes, having a full three minutes left to shoot down the errant airline\", writes Professor Griffin. And yet as United Airlines Flight 175, the second Boeing, crashed into the South Tower, the F-15s were still 70 miles away. It took the fighter pilots not eight minutes to reach downtown New York but 19 minutes. It seems that instead of flying at \"full blower\" they were travelling at a comparatively leisurely 700mph. If this seems extraordinary, Professor Griffin raises some other tantalising questions about events that day. He records that the Pentagon was hit by the hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 at 9.38am, The aircraft, with 58 passengers on board, had left Dulles Airport, in Washington DC at 8.20am and suddenly disappeared from radio contact at 8.46am. Astonishingly, no fighter jets from Andrews Air Force Base, just ten miles from Washington D.C., were ever scrambled to intercept it. Instead fighters were ordered from 130 miles away at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. They finally arrived after the Pentagon crash had already happened. Thought to be flying towards Ohio, Flight 77 disappeared from radar screens for half an hour. But the plane astonishingly reappeared in airspace over Washington D.C.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:newpearlharbor.txt:2:c34bd5a0d16b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13653, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "newpearlharbor.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "newpearlharbor", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "8.20am and suddenly disappeared from radio contact at 8.46am.

Thought to be flying towards Ohio, Flight 77 disappeared from radar screens for half an hour. But the plane astonishingly reappeared in airspace over Washington D.C. at 9:24am. It was then that the pilot executed a complex manoeuvre, turning almost a complete circle and dropping the last 7,000 feet in two and a half minutes to hit a wing of the Pentagon with perfect precision. It was the sort of flying that you would expect only from a seasoned airman. Yet at the cockpit controls was a rookie, a terrorist named Hani Hanjour, who had been such a bad trainee pilot that managers at his flying school had reported him to aviation authorities five times. \"A pilot they want us to believe was trained at a puddle jumper school for Piper Cubs and Cessnas brings the plane in so low and flat that it clips the electrical wires across the street from the Pentagon and flies it with pinpoint accuracy into the side of this building at 460 miles per hour,\" says Griffin. It is a puzzle that may never be solved because, in another odd coincidence, no pictures exist of the moment the aircraft penetrated the building. Jose Velasquez, an employee at the petrol station opposite the Pentagon, has stated that security cameras there would have recorded the moment of impact. \"But I've never seen what the pictures looked like. The FBI were here within minutes and took the film away,\" he told reporters. But even more bizarre is the damning physical evidence which appears to show the Pentagon could never have been struck by a Boeing 757, with a wing span of 125ft. According to the White House, the Boeing penetrated the Pentagon with such ferocity that it went completely inside, disappearing from view before burning to almost nothing. Crucial photos taken just after the fire fighters arrived show a hole in the building's facade of between 15ft and 18ft in diameter. It clearly reveals there was no damage above the hole or on either side of it. So how did the giant Boeing aircraft fit into that hole? The official account claims that the wings folded back, or snapped, during the initial impact with the reinforced structure of the Pentagon. They were pushed inward towards the fuselage and then carried along with the plane into the building. But, insists Professor Griffin, this would be next to impossible. \"For when the plane's forward motion was suddenly reduced as the nose hit the Pentagon, the wings could not have folded back - unless the laws", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:newpearlharbor.txt:3:918b8826db75", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13654, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "newpearlharbor.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "newpearlharbor", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "aircraft fit into that hole?

But, insists Professor Griffin, this would be next to impossible. \"For when the plane's forward motion was suddenly reduced as the nose hit the Pentagon, the wings could not have folded back - unless the laws of kinetic energy were momentarily suspended.\" Instead the wings would have been propelled forward at great speed, damaging the building on either side of the main area of the point of contact of the plane. Even more bewildering is what happened to the Boeing's 40ft-high tail. \"Did it obligingly duck before entering the building?\" asks Griffin. \"Whatever did hit the Pentagon it did not cause nearly enough destruction for the official story to be true. A Boeing 757, besides being so tall and having such a wide wingspan, weighs over 100 tons. Travelling at a speed of 250 to 440 miles per hour, it would have caused tremendous devastation, far more than was evident at the crash site.\" But there is another intriguing element to this particular poser. If the official story is correct, if the hijacked aircraft did go right inside the Pentagon, where are the remains now? We know that fingerprints were taken from some of the dead passengers proving that some human remains at least had survived the resulting fire. Yet the fuselage, the tail, the wings and the engines of the enormous Boeing - made of heat-resistant aluminium and tempered steel - were all, according to the official version of events, destroyed. So, if the plane didn't hit the Pentagon, what did? In what is the wildest of all the theories of The New Pearl Harbour, the suggestion is that the Pentagon wasn't hit by a plane at all but by a military missile or military aircraft. Certainly, several onlookers claim that it was a missile that so precisely pierced the Pentagon that day. One of them asserts it was making a shrill noise \"like a fighter plane.\" But sent by whom? And if indeed it was a missile, what on earth happened to Flight 77, last thought to be heading for Ohio? No one knows. There are only unanswered questions, such as that posed by Kristen Breitweiser, whose husband died in the World Trade Centre. She apparently told a television show: \"I don't understand how a plane could hit our defence department (The Pentagon) an hour after the first plane hit the Twin Towers. I don't understand how that is possible. I'm a reasonable person. But when you look at the fact that we spend a half trillion dollars on national defence . . . I think there were procedures and protocols that were not", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:newpearlharbor.txt:4:73cfe3ac76f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13655, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "newpearlharbor.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "newpearlharbor", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "Kristen Breitweiser, whose husband died in the World Trade Centre.

I don't understand how that is possible. I'm a reasonable person. But when you look at the fact that we spend a half trillion dollars on national defence . . . I think there were procedures and protocols that were not followed on September 11.\" One fact is certain about 9/11 and that concerns the stock market dealings before the tragedy. An extremely high volume of \"put options\" - a bet on the price of shares falling - were purchased for the stock of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the international financiers which occupied 22 storeys of the World Trade Centre. Even more telling were the volume of \"put options\" on American and United Airlines, which owned the four aircraft hijacked by the terrorists. On these two airlines, and only these two, the level of share trade went up by 1,200 per cent in the three days prior to the catastrophe. As the shares dropped in response to the terrorism, the value of these options multiplied a hundred fold. Someone - and it may have been Bin Laden himself - had made ten million dollars in profit. So why weren't these dealings spotted? \"Any American intelligence officer looking at the stock market put option purchases in the early September of 2001 would easily have concluded that in the near future American and United aircraft were going to be involved in some disaster. And that the target was quite likely to be the World Trade Centre where Morgan Stanley Dean Witter had their offices,\" speculates Professor Griffin. And then we must turn to the behaviour of George Bush junior himself. America's CNN network broke into its programming at 8:48 to report the first collision and Flight 11's demise. But the President, says the White House, was told of the horror at 9am when he arrived at the Sarasota school. By then, 12 minutes after the television announcement, millions of Americans knew of the crash and much of the world, too. Strangely, according to this official account, the President appeared to be one of the last to hear this shocking news. He reportedly told the principal of the school, \"A commercial plane has hit the World Trade Centre and we're going ahead to do the reading thing anyway.\" Then the Commander-in-Chief of the American military settled down to hear pupils recite My Pet Goat, only interrupted a few minutes later by a whispered message in his ear from an aide that a second aircraft had hit the World Trade Centre. \"He never asked if there had been any additional threats, where the attacks were coming from, how to best protest the country from further", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:newpearlharbor.txt:5:79c75fcded90", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13656, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "newpearlharbor.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "newpearlharbor", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "the World Trade Centre and we're going ahead to do the reading thing anyway.\" Then the Commander-in-Chief of the American military settled down to hear pupils recite My Pet Goat, only interrupted a few minutes later by a whispered message in his ear from an aide that a second aircraft had hit the World Trade Centre. \"He never asked if there had been any additional threats, where the attacks were coming from, how to best protest the country from further attacks. In the middle of a modern day Pearl Harbor he simply turned back to the matter in hand, the day's photo opportunity,\" claims Griffin. So why was the President not informed that something was possibly dreadfully amiss by his secret service personnel riding in his car and among his motorcade before he got to the school? Why, when learning of the second crash into the South Twin Tower - which transformed the events into a terror attack rather than a terrible accident - did he not leave the school immediately? He was on a pre-scheduled and well-publicised photocall. The school and the President, it might be assumed, were now Al Qaeda's targets, too. Instead Bush and his people dawdled at the school before leaving in their scheduled motorcade on their scheduled route to the airport. It was during that journey that they reportedly were informed that the Pentagon had been struck. Yet, mysteriously, still no military escort was ordered for the President. Air Force One took off without fighter jets to protect it. \"The implied question is, of course, a disturbing one,\" says Griffin. \"Did the President, and at least the head of his secret service, know that he was not a terrorist target?\" That is, of course, a theory that will rightly come in for the most heated criticism when the book is published here next month. But there is one more twist to the strange tale. It rests on a statement made by Bush himself about what he knew on the day of 9/11. He says that he was sitting outside the Sarasota classroom waiting for the start of the Pet Goat reading when he saw the first plane crash into the Twin Towers on a television monitor. \"I saw the airplane hit the tower - the TV was obviously on and I used to fly myself,\" he was to explain later. The President recalls that he turned to his security men, joking: \"There's one terrible pilot.\" He repeated the story more than once in the months after 9/11. Yet the footage of the first plane crashing into the Twin Tower did not emerge for another 13 hours (what millions of us saw was live footage of the second plane). Shots of the first plane, taken accidentally by a French documentary maker filming in Manhattan, were only released publicly for television the following day. So, according to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:newpearlharbor.txt:6:481234b1e704", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13657, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "newpearlharbor.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "newpearlharbor", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "turned to his security men, joking: \"There's one terrible pilot.\" He repeated the story more than once in the months after 9/11.

Shots of the first plane, taken accidentally by a French documentary maker filming in Manhattan, were only released publicly for television the following day. So, according to Professor Griffin, President Bush simply could not have seen that Flight 11 crash picture on television. Nor could he have seen the second plane crash, as he was in the classroom when it happened. But did something else happen? Did the President, sitting in the secure communications room set up by secret services at the school, view secret images of the crash; images transmitted by American intelligence onto the monitor in that room as the attack actually occurred? It is an explosive theory, one that understandably will be dismissed as risible nonsense. For alarmingly, if U.S. intelligence did film the last moments of Flight 11 live, as it actually happened, it can only mean one thing: that the Bush administration had prior knowledge of the Al Qaeda terror assaults. This, of all the theories propounded by Professor Griffin in The New Pearl Harbor, is the one that will be condemned most aggressively by those who wield power in America today. Yet we should not forget the words President Bush penned in his diary on the night of 9/11.

It may have been a sophisticated disinformation campaign in order to distract attention from the Abu Ghraib torture scandals which had hit the news not long before. Unfortunately, though their arguments were quite convincing, none of these researchers were quoting what I consider to be reliable sources. Then just recently Dyson Devine, a researcher from [www.gaiaguys.net](http://www.gaiaguys.net) in Australia, sent me the below article from the *Sydney Morning Herald*, Australia's most respected newspaper. It is quite refreshing to see this critical information on Nick Berg being reported in the mainstream media. Things are not always what they seem.

Richard Neville explores the explanations. Iraq in flames, Washington an object of disgust. What to do? At this pivotal moment, CNN and Fox News are tipped off to a clip of an American citizen being beheaded. The victim is a 26-year-old idealist from Pennsylvania, Nick Berg. Despite the perpetrators being masked, the vile deed is deemed the work of al-Qaeda. The clip was first \"discovered\" on an Islamic website in Malaysia. Its Arabic title reads \"Abu Musab al-Zarqawi shown slaughtering an American\". al-Zarqawi is a 38-year-old Jordanian militant who fled to Iraq in 2001 after reportedly losing a leg in a US missile strike. al-Zarqawi's face is widely known and he credits himself with the deed, so why a mask? The timing of the video was brilliant for the West. Media pundits judged the crime a deeper evil than the systemic torture of innocent Iraqis. But some people sensed a rat. But if it was not al-Qaeda, who? Surely not Uncle Sam. That's too dark, even for the CIA. While this video shows a human body having its head chopped off, it does not necessarily portray an act of murder. Berg's headless body was found dumped on a Baghdad roadside on Saturday, May 8. Three days later, the \"live beheading\" clip was uploaded from London to the Malaysian website [http://www.al-ansar.biz](http://www.al-ansar.biz/) The statement in the video is signed with al-Zarqawi's name, dated May 11. After Fox News and CNN had downloaded the video, it disappeared from the site. As no autopsy is available, little is known about the state of the body. No time of death, no forensic analysis. On April 6, a month before the discovery of the corpse, Berg had been released from custody. But whose custody?

On April 6, a month before the discovery of the corpse, Berg had been released from custody. But whose custody? Dan Senor, adviser to the US Presidential Envoy in Iraq, has said Berg was never held by the Americans. Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, the Coalition's deputy head of operations, claimed he was in the custody of Iraqi police from March 24 to April 6. However, the Iraqi police chief, Major-General Mohammed Khair al-Barhawi, told Associated Press \"the Iraqi police never arrested the slain American\". Berg's family are certain his jailers were the US military. His father, Michael, had been told so by the FBI. He has produced an email from a US consular official in Baghdad, Beth Payne, confirming that his son was in the hands of the US. (Later, another official said this was an error.) On April 5 in the Philadelphia office of the US Supreme Court, the Berg family had launched an action against the US military for false imprisonment. The following day, Berg was released. The issue of custody is significant; in his final moments on screen Berg is wearing an orange jumpsuit of the kind familiar from Guantanamo Bay. The official reasons for Berg's arrest were \"lack of documentation\" and \"suspicious activities\". He carried sensitive electronic equipment for which he lacked documents. In custody, he was visited three times by the FBI. Such interviews are bound to have been recorded but no transcripts have been produced. After his release, Berg travelled to Baghdad and the $30-a-night Al-Fanar Hotel. A fellow hotel guest told *Newsday* that Berg recounted how Iraqi police had quickly handed him to US authorities in Mosul and that he had been held the entire time in a jail where his guards were US soldiers. Berg was in Baghdad to win contracts for his family firm, Prometheus Methods Tower Service, a provider of communications facilities. He often \"worked at night on a tower in the neighbourhood of Abu Ghraib\", according to *The New York Times*. The family last heard from him on April 9, when he said he was planning to leave Iraq via Kuwait as soon as it was safe. Berg was last seen walking with his bags the following day, apparently hoping to find his way through the turmoil engulfing the city and make it to the border. On March 7, 2004, two weeks before his arrest in Mosul, an \"enemies list\" had been posted on a conservative website, [FreeRepublic.com](http://www.freerepublic.com/) The list was compiled from signatories to an anti-war petition, and its implied purpose was to encourage readers to harass those", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nickberg.txt:1:84a7069703b2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13660, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nickberg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nickberg", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "via Kuwait as soon as it was safe.

Berg's father was on that list, as was the family firm, Prometheus. This information may well have triggered the arrest of Berg in Iraq. Berg's politics are not clear. His father, Michael, has described his son as a \"staunch supporter\" of US President George Bush. Friends said Nick believed he could help rebuild Iraq \"one radio tower at a time\". According to *The New York Times*, he was attracted to the Hebrew concept of *tikkun olam* - healing the world through social action. The first few seconds of the video shows Berg sitting on a white plastic chair in an orange jumpsuit. He speaks directly to the camera in a relaxed way: \"My name is Nick Berg ... I have a brother and sister, David and Sara. I live in Philadelphia.\" His white chair is identical to those in the photographs of the Abu Ghraib prison tortures, but such chairs are probably common in Iraq. It is highly likely that this segment is edited from the interrogation of Berg during his 13 days of custody. In the next scene, Berg is sitting on the floor with five masked figures standing behind him. We do not see the figures enter. Berg looks lifeless, though his body appears to make slight movements. A man reads a lengthy Arabic statement in a passionless monotone. He is identified as \"Abu Musab al-Zarqawi\", a Jordanian associate of Osama bin Laden who is tied to dozens of terrorist acts. Yet a leaflet recently circulated in Falluja, by no means a reliable source, claims that al-Zarqawi was killed in the Sulaimaniya mountains of northern Iraq during a US bombing. A US military report last month has claimed al-Zarqawi was killed in the bombing of Falluja. Also, the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, has said that al-Zarqawi was fitted with a prosthetic leg in a Baghdad hospital, yet the tape shows no evidence of a limp. CNN staff familiar with al-Zarqawi's voice have been quoted as saying the voice does not sound like his. Among the many curiosities raised on the web about the fanatical five are: They are well-fed, fidgety, and reveal glimpses of white skin. Their Arabic is heavily accented (Russian, Jordanian, Egyptian). An aside in Russian had been translated as \"do it quickly\". One character wears wears bulky white tennis shoes.

The men's scarves are worn and tied by people who \"haven't a clue\", says conspiracy theorist Hector Carreon, like actors in Hollywood movies. There is even a voice at the end that seems to ask in English, \"How will it be done?\" [http://www.aztlan.net/nick_berg_how_done.htm](http://www.aztlan.net/nick_berg_how_done.htm) None of this proves a grand conspiracy, but it does raise questions. In the final segment of the tape, Berg is thrown to the ground, but doesn't move. During the decapitation, starting at the front of the throat, there is little sign of blood. The scream is wildly out of sync, sounds female, and is obviously dubbed. Dr John Simpson, executive director for surgical affairs at the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, told Ritt Goldstein of the *Asia Times*, \"I would have thought that all the people in the vicinity would have been covered in blood, in a matter of seconds ... if it [the video] was genuine\". Simpson agrees with other experts who find it highly probable that Berg had died before his decapitation. But there is still the problem of Berg's slight body movements while sitting on the floor, before the beheading. According to a blogger (internet diarist), Nick Possum, \"this footage was subsequently modified frame by frame to make Berg's body move very occasionally\". Apparently, this can be achieved with \"commonly available software\". [http://www.brushtail.com.au/nick_berg_hypothesis.html](http://www.brushtail.com.au/nick_berg_hypothesis.html) Possum believes \"the available evidence surrounding the case suggests that it was a 'black operation' by US psychological warfare specialists ... to provide the media with a moral relativity argument to counter the adverse publicity over torture at Abu Ghraib\". The use of FBI footage in the opening sequence, if confirmed, suggests the involvement of high-level US Government operatives. I do not know who killed Nick Berg, or how he died. But there's something fishy about this video. In the end, the question is: who killed Nick Berg, and why? **For another interesting article on Berg's strange connections in the *New York Daily News: *****[http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/193331p-166984c.html](http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/193331p-166984c.html)** **And an article on CNN: ****[http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Northeast/05/13/berg.encounter/](http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Northeast/05/13/berg.encounter/)** **See our archive of revealing news articles at ****[**https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles**](https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles)**** ** Your tax-deductible donations, however large or small, help greatly to support this important work.

Michael Berg said the FBI investigated the matter more than a year ago. He stressed that his son was in no way connected to the terrorists who captured and killed him. Government sources told CNN that the encounter involved an acquaintance of Zacarias Moussaoui -- the only person publicly charged in the United States in connection with the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. According to Berg, his son was taking a course a few years ago at a remote campus of the University of Oklahoma near an airport. He described how on one particular day, his son met \"some terrorist people -- who no one knew were terrorists at the time.\" At one point during the bus ride, Berg said, the man sitting next to his son asked if he could use Nick's laptop computer. \"It turned out this guy was a terrorist and that he, you know, used my son's e-mail, amongst many other people's e-mail who he did the same thing to,\" Berg said. Government sources said Berg gave the man his password, which was later used by Moussaoui, the sources said. The sources said the man who used Berg's e-mail knew Moussaoui, now awaiting trial on federal charges that could bring a death sentence. But the sources would not disclose details of how the men were connected. Moussaoui, 36, was arrested in August 2001 after he aroused suspicion at a Minnesota flight school when he arrived for 747 simulator training without holding a pilot's license. A French national of Moroccan descent, Moussaoui has admitted in open court that he belonged to al Qaeda, the radical Islamic group behind the September 11 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. But Moussaoui has fiercely denied being involved in the September 11 plot, and the prosecutors' theory of his role has shifted from being a possible 20th hijacker that day to possibly piloting a fifth hijacked jetliner targeting the White House.

Please note that there allegedly were 19 hijackers who carried out the 9/11 attacks. This would have required a large system of support, yet only two people in the whole world have ever been charged with complicity. Does that make sense? Are our intelligence services that weak that they can't find and charge more people involved? One of those charged is a man in Germany who the German courts have recently released as US intelligence services were unwilling to surrender incriminating documents they claimed to have for the trial.

In an article which appeared recently in \"The Electrical World,\" Mr. Tesla explains the theories on which the world telegraphy system is founded and what he expects to accomplish by it. His plans involve the establishment of stations for the transmission of messages and power, \"preferably near important centers of civilization.\" Oddly enough, what Mr. Tesla proudly designates as the first of his commercial \"world telegraphy\" stations has been established at Wardenclyffe, L.I., which is not in any sense an important \"centre of civilization,\" but a place described by train hands of the Long Island Railroad as a way station where \"a passenger alights occasionally.\" The transmitting station is an octagonal tower, pyramidal in shape, and some 187 feet in height. It consists of huge wooden stilts, heavily braced, and reinforced, and surmounted by a cupola of interlaced steel wires, bent so as to form an arc. In the cupola there is a wooden platform occupying its entire width. Mr. Tesla began work on his transmitting station about eighteen months ago. When he first came there, and it was understood that J. Pierpont Morgan had become interested in his odd enterprise and furnished him with financial assistance, a thrill of vague expectancy ran through the little settlement, The Wardenclyffe Land Company, which owns practically all the available ground in the vicinity, gave the inventor a free grant of some 175 acres of fine land, and then settled down to wait for the day when Wardenclyffe would become the centre of the universe. Some of the farmers who come to Wardenclyffe to send their products to this city look at Mr. Tesla's tower, which is situated directly opposite the railroad station, and shake their heads sadly. They are inclined to take a skeptical view regarding the feasibility of the wireless \"world telegraphy\" idea, but yet Tesla's transmitting tower as it stands in lonely grandeur and boldly silhouetted against the sky on a wide clearing on the concession is a source or great satisfaction and of some mystification to them all. \"It is a mighty fine tower,\" said one food farmer to a visitor last week. \"The breeze up there is something grand on a Summer evening, and you can see the Sound and all the steamers that go by. We are tired, though, trying to figure out why he put it here", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:nikolateslamagnifyingtransmitter.txt:0:c923d5ba8da1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13666, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "nikolateslamagnifyingtransmitter.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "nikolateslamagnifyingtransmitter", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "lonely grandeur and boldly silhouetted against the sky on a wide clearing on the concession is a source or great satisfaction and of some mystification to them all. \"It is a mighty fine tower,\" said one food farmer to a visitor last week. \"The breeze up there is something grand on a Summer evening, and you can see the Sound and all the steamers that go by. We are tired, though, trying to figure out why he put it here instead of at Coney Island. \" While the tower itself is very \"stagy\" and picturesque, it is the wonders that are supposed to be hidden in the earth underneath it that excite the curiosity of the population in the little settlement. In the centre of the wide concrete platform which serves as a base for the structure there is a wooden affair very much like the companionway on an ocean steamer. The tower and the enclosure in which it has been built are being carefully guarded these days, and no one except Mr. Tesla's own men are allowed to approach it. Only they have been allowed as much as the briefest peep down the companionway. Mr. Scherff, the private secretary of the inventor, told an inquirer that the companionway led to a small drainage passage built for the purpose of keeping the ground about the tower dry. But such of the villagers as saw the tower constructed tell a different story. They declare that it leads to a well-like excavation as deep as the tower is high with walls of mason work and a circular stairway leading to the bottom. From there, they say, tunnels have been built in all directions, until the entire ground below the little plain on which the tower is raised has been honeycombed with subterranean passages. They tell with awe how Mr. Tesla, on his weekly visits to Wardenclyffe, spends as much time in the underground passages as he does on the tower or in the handsome laboratory and workshop erected beside it, and where the power plant for the world telegraph has been installed. No instruments have been installed as yet in the transmitter, nor has Mr. Tesla given any description of what they will be like.

As politicians at the Republican National Convention use microphones to make themselves heard from the podium, other sounds in and around the event will be emitted in cutting-edge audio technology. **Outside the convention hall, New York City police plan to control protesters using a device that directs sound for up to 1,500 feet in a spotlight-like beam. Meanwhile, a display of former Republican presidents inside the hall will feature campaign speeches that are funneled to listeners through highly focused audio beams. ** \"These are totally different from the way an ordinary speaker emits sound,\" said Elwood (Woody) Norris, founder and head of American Technology Corp. of San Diego. \"It's like it's inside your head.\" Norris, an intrepid entrepreneur who has no college degree but more than 43 patents to his name, invented both the crowd control tool, called the Long Range Acoustical Device (LRAD), and the display audio technology, called HyperSonic Sound (HSS). **Both technologies feature unprecedented manipulation of sound, but for very different purposes. And while both technologies have unique, \"gee-whiz\" factors, some remain uneasy with the idea of using sound to control crowds. ** \"It produces sound in a way that for most people will be a novel experience, so I think it has potential to create confusion and panic,\" said Richard Glen Boire, founder of the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics in Davis, Calif. \"It can't be identified, it's an invisible force.\" **Sound as a Weapon** In fact, LRAD, which is 33 inches in diameter and looks like a giant spotlight, has been used by the U.S. military in Iraq and at sea as a non-lethal force. In these settings, operators can use the device not only to convey orders, but also as a weapon. **When in weapon mode, LRAD blasts a tightly controlled stream of caustic sound that can be turned up to high enough levels to trigger nausea or possibly fainting.** The operators themselves remain unaffected since the noise is contained in its focused beam. \"We've devised a system with a", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:noisegun.txt:0:0ccf7e6f716a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13669, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "noisegun.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "noisegun", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "used by the U.S. military in Iraq and at sea as a non-lethal force.

The concept is to offer an intermediate tool to warn and ward off attacking combatants before resorting to force. \"Regular bullets don't have volume control on them,\" said Norris. \"With this, you just cause a person's ears to ring.\" The NYPD, however, has said they won't be using the $35,000 tool to make people's ears ring, but only as a communication device. \"We're only going to use them for safety announcements and directions,\" said Paul Browne, a police spokesman. **In tests, police have shown how they can convey orders in a normal voice to someone as far as four blocks away. The sound beam is even equipped with a viewfinder so the operator can precisely target the audio by finding a person in cross hairs. Rather than using pure volume to throw sound far, the LRAD reaches distant ears by focusing the audio beam. ** This is the second time the device has been used by police - Miami police also used it during the free-trade conference in that city last year. Despite the NYPD's assurances that they won't use the tool to hurt protesters, Bill Dobbs of United for Peace and Justice, which has planned protests around the convention, has told reporters that the sound system presents \"a potential Big Brother nightmare.\" **Quiet Noise** Inside the convention center, people will have the chance to experience - at will - another of Norris's inventions. A *TIME *magazine display at the convention will feature speeches of past Republican presidents in tightly controlled beams of HyperSonic Sound (HSS). Viewers can literally step in and out of the display's different listening zones. A similar high-tech display of former Democratic presidents was featured at the Democratic National Convention in Boston in July. HSS works by mixing regular, audible sound with two beams of super high frequency, inaudible sound waves. \"Just the way artists mix their paint,\" says Norris. The resulting ultrasonic sound wave can then be directed out in a tightly controlled beam. **Wherever the beam makes contact with air, the air", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:noisegun.txt:1:4d1326d19cf9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13670, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "noisegun.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "noisegun", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "literally step in and out of the display's different listening zones.

The resulting ultrasonic sound wave can then be directed out in a tightly controlled beam. **Wherever the beam makes contact with air, the air molecules interact in a way that isolates the original audible sound. So if you're standing in front of the ultrasonic sound wave, you can hear the sound. If you're a few inches away, you hear nothing. ** This cuts down on ambient noise and gives listeners the somewhat eerie effect that the noise is inside their heads. \"We like to say we create silence instead of noise,\" said Norris. \"You don't need to fill the space with a whole cacophony of noise.\" The GOP convention display should perk up the ears of some curious attendees, but Norris is most excited about the device's marketing potential. **Already, some Coca-Cola machines in Japan are equipped with the technology so passers-by hear the enticing sound of soda being poured into a glass of ice.** And dozens of Safeway supermarkets in California, Colorado and Virginia are testing the technology on patrons waiting in line to pay. Norris' company has also sent out HSS for testing at Wal-Mart and McDonald's. The narrow beams of sound advertise sale items at the store or restaurant and feature promotional material. **Glen Boire argues the concept is annoying and invasive, but Norris counters, \"If you don't want to hear it, you can move your head a half foot away and it will go away.\" ** Needless to say, it won't be as simple for convention-goers and protesters - who may wish to tune each other out next week. **What you can do:** Explore our comprehensive Mind Control Information Center at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrolinformation).

Amazing information is coming out! You have a great day! With love and best wishes, Fred **NORAD had drills of jets as weapons** By Steven Komarow and Tom Squitieri, USA TODAY WASHINGTON - In the two years before the Sept. 11 attacks, the North American Aerospace Defense Command conducted exercises simulating what the White House says was unimaginable at the time: hijacked airliners used as weapons to crash into targets and cause mass casualties. One of the imagined targets was the World Trade Center. In another exercise, jets performed a mock shootdown over the Atlantic Ocean of a jet supposedly laden with chemical poisons headed toward a target in the United States. In a third scenario, the target was the Pentagon - but that drill was not run after Defense officials said it was unrealistic, NORAD and Defense officials say. NORAD, in a written statement, confirmed that such hijacking exercises occurred. It said the scenarios outlined were regional drills, not regularly scheduled continent-wide exercises. \"Numerous types of civilian and military aircraft were used as mock hijacked aircraft,\" the statement said. \"These exercises tested track detection and identification; scramble and interception; hijack procedures; internal and external agency coordination and operational security and communications security procedures.\" A White House spokesman said Sunday that the Bush administration was not aware of the NORAD exercises. But the exercises using real aircraft show that at least one part of the government thought the possibility of such attacks, though unlikely, merited scrutiny. On April 8, the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks heard testimony from national security adviser Condoleezza Rice that the White House didn't anticipate hijacked planes being used as weapons. On April 12, a watchdog group, the Project on Government Oversight, released a copy of an e-mail written by a former NORAD official referring to the proposed exercise targeting the Pentagon. The e-mail said the simulation was not held because the Pentagon considered it \"too unrealistic.\" President Bush said at a news conference Tuesday, \"Nobody in our government, at least, and I don't think the prior government, could envision flying airplanes into buildings on such a massive scale.\" The exercises differed", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:norad911drills.txt:0:7f6a06e2bc78", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13673, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "norad911drills.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "norad911drills", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "April 12, a watchdog group, the Project on Government Oversight, released a copy of an e-mail written by a former NORAD official referring to the proposed exercise targeting the Pentagon.

Until Sept. 11, NORAD was expected to defend the United States and Canada from aircraft based elsewhere. After the attacks, that responsibility broadened to include flights that originated in the two countries. But there were exceptions in the early drills, including one operation, planned in July 2001 and conducted later, that involved planes from airports in Utah and Washington state that were \"hijacked.\" Those planes were escorted by U.S. and Canadian aircraft to airfields in British Columbia and Alaska. NORAD officials have acknowledged that \"scriptwriters\" for the drills included the idea of hijacked aircraft being used as weapons. \"Threats of killing hostages or crashing were left to the scriptwriters to invoke creativity and broaden the required response,\" Maj. Gen. Craig McKinley, a NORAD official, told the 9/11 commission. No exercise matched the specific events of Sept. 11, NORAD said. \"We have planned and executed numerous scenarios over the years to include aircraft originating from foreign airports penetrating our sovereign airspace,\" Gen. Ralph Eberhart, NORAD commander, told USA TODAY. \"Regrettably, the tragic events of 9/11 were never anticipated or exercised.\" Explore these empowering websites coordinated by the nonprofit [PEERS network](https://www.peerservice.org): [www.momentoflove.org](https://www.momentoflove.org) - Every person in the world has a heart [www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) - Revealing major cover-ups & working together for a better world [www.inspiringcommunity.org](https://www.inspiringcommunity.org) - Building a Global Community for All [www.weboflove.org](https://www.weboflove.org) - Strengthening the Web of Love that interconnects us all Educational websites promoting transformation through education and inspiration To subscribe to or unsubscribe from the WantToKnow.info list (one email every few days): [https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe](https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe)", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:norad911drills.txt:1:18d7ae6a6586", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13674, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "northwoods.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "northwoods", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Operation Northwoods: Top US Generals Approved Terror on US Soil **Operation Northwoods in ABC News Report Top US Generals Approved Terror Acts in US** The revealing ABC news article at the link below begins, \"In the early 1960s, **America's top military leaders reportedly drafted plans to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in U.S. cities** to create public support for a war against Cuba.\" The article goes on to say that the plans, code-named Operation Northwoods, were approved in writing by the top US military chiefs.

If you don't have time to read the original documents, take a look at the key excerpts below. We invite you to then ask yourself, is it beyond comprehension that this same kind of thinking and planning could have led to 9/11? Remember that **these documents were approved in writing by the Joint Chiefs of Staff - the top generals of each branch of the US armed forces** - and submitted to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in 1962. Thankfully, the Kennedy administration rejected this devious proposal. The plans were classified top secret so that the American public would not know how it was being manipulated. They came to light only because of a Freedom of Information Act request in the late 1990s. **Excerpts from Operation Northwoods Documents** **Page 1 of 15-page GWU file on Operation Northwoods** (Memorandum) 13 March 1962 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Subject: Justification for US Military Intervention in Cuba The Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered the attached Memorandum for the Chief of Operations, Cuba Project, which responds to a request of that office for brief but precise description of pretexts which could provide justification for US military intervention in Cuba.

It is assumed that a single agency will be given the primary responsibility for developing military and para-military aspects of the basic plan. It is recommended that this responsibility for both overt and covert military operations be assigned the Joint Chiefs of Staff. **Page 5 of 15-page GWU file on Operation Northwoods** (page 2 of Pentagon report) The suggested courses of action ... are based on the premise that US military intervention will result from a period of heightened US-Cuban tensions which place the United States in the position of suffering justifiable grievances. World opinion, and the United Nations forum should be favorably affected by developing the international image of the Cuban government as rash and irresponsible, and as an alarming and unpredictable threat to the peace of the Western Hemisphere. **Page 8 of 15-page GWU file on Operation Northwoods** (page 5 of Pentagon report) This plan ... should be developed to focus all efforts on a specific ultimate objective which would provide adequate justification for US military intervention. Such a plan would enable a logical build-up of incidents to be combined with other seemingly unrelated events to camouflage the ultimate objective. **Pages 10-11 of 15-page GWU file on Northwoods** (page 7-8 of Joint Chiefs report) A series of well coordinated incidents will be planned to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces. A. Incidents to establish a credible attack: (1) Start rumors (many). Use clandestine radio. (2) Land friendly Cubans in uniform \"over-the-fence\" to stage attack on base. (3) Capture Cuban (friendly) saboteurs inside the base. (4) Start riots near the base main gate (friendly Cubans). (5) Blow up ammunition inside the base: start fires. (6) Burn aircraft on air base (sabotage). (7) Lob mortar shells from outside of base into base. (8) Capture assault teams approaching from the sea or vicinity of Guantanamo City. (9) Capture militia group which storms base. (10) Sabotage ship in harbor; large fires - naphthalene. (11) Sink ship near harbor entrance. Conduct funerals for mock-victims. A \"Remember the Maine\" incident could be arranged: We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba. Casualty lists in US newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation. We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington. **Page 12** **of 15-page GWU file on Operation Northwoods** (page 9 of Pentagon report) Use of MIG type aircraft by US pilots could provide additional provocation.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:northwoods.txt:1:3f48d2090d1f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13676, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "northwoods.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "northwoods", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "A \"Remember the Maine\" incident could be arranged: We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba.

Harassment of civil air, attacks on surface shipping and destruction of US military drone aircraft by MIG type planes would be useful as complementary actions. Reasonable copies of the MIG could be produced from US resources in about three months. **Page 13 of 15-page GWU file on Operation Northwoods** (page 10 of Pentagon report) Hijacking attempts against civil air and surface craft should appear to continue as harassing measures condoned by the government of Cuba. It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner enroute from the United States. The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan to cross Cuba. The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday. An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At the designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual aircraft would be converted to a drone. The drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will be transmitting on the international distress frequency a \"MAY DAY\" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal. **What We Can Do** **Remember that many government and military leaders think of this like a chess game.

The U.S. media widely reported that the Iranian president accused the U.S. government of killing U.S. citizens in an attack on the World Trade Center in New York on the fateful day of Sept. 11. \"But the world leader's question and message were much more nuanced and important than that-his core assertion was that a horrible attack that killed some 3,000 people and the U.S. response changed the world. The truth is the truth regardless of the messenger; and the truth of the matter is that what really happened on September 11, 2001 is an issue that people cannot run away from,\" said Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general and co-founder of the International Action Center. \"I don't think you can reject the issue because of the messenger,\" Mr. Clark added. \"History does require that the facts have a proper review.\" ** Wikipedia Bio:** [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_Clark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_Clark) **Department of Justice Bio:** [http://www.justice.gov/ag/aghistpage.php?id=65>](http://www.justice.gov/ag/aghistpage.php?id=65) <!

The magnitude of its impact on America and the world cannot be overstated. The terrible acts of 9/11 and the events leading up to them deserve a thorough and unimpeachable investigation to learn the facts. And if some rogue elements within the U.S. government were complicit in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11, as several of these individuals allege, it is critical that these elements be exposed and removed from power. **Note of acknowledgement:** Most of this excellent data was compiled by Alan Miller. For the latest version of this chart on his website: [http://www.patriotsquestion911.com](http://www.patriotsquestion911.com). Please note that most of the individuals listed above are not affiliated with this website. **A PERSONAL NOTE ABOUT THIS WEBPAGE FROM ALAN MILLER ** I believed the official explanation of 9/11 for four and one-half years. I remember, during that time, becoming angry at news stories about people who challenged that explanation. However, in the Spring of 2006, I saw the documentary, *[Loose Change](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060407bestdocumentary9-11)*, on the Internet. Although not entirely objective, it raised many serious and disturbing questions about the events of 9/11 that I had previously simply accepted without much critical thought. And so I began a several month period of researching the events of 9/11. I found a great deal of material challenging the 9/11 Commission Report on web sites like [911truth.org](http://www.911truth.org), [physics911.net](http://www.physics911.net), [Scholars for 9/11 Truth](http://www.st911.org) and many others. I attended a lecture by [Prof. David Ray Griffin](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050504davidraygriffin). I learned much about what has become known as the 9/11 Truth Movement.

I attended a lecture by [Prof. David Ray Griffin](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050504davidraygriffin). I learned much about what has become known as the 9/11 Truth Movement. Much of the information and limited media coverage of the 9/11 Truth Movement focuses on college professors like [David Ray Griffin](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050504davidraygriffin), [Steven Jones](http://st911.org/), [James Fetzer](http://www.d.umn.edu/~jfetzer/), [Kee Dewdney](http://physics911.net/missingwings.htm), and others. In August of 2006, I began searching for statements about 9/11 by members of the intelligence services, military and government. Because of their experience in these areas, I felt their opinions about 9/11 would be an additional valuable source of information. I was surprised by the amount of criticism of 9/11 from this group that I found scattered around the Internet. I had learned of virtually none of this criticism through newspapers, television, or radio news sources. I don't know what really happened on 9/11. I greatly value these individuals' statements because most have spent large portions of their careers studying espionage, terrorism, and military operations throughout the world and personally planned and carried out United States' military and intelligence activities. They're experienced professionals, whom I trust. My objective, at this point, is to have our government launch a new, extremely thorough and impartial re-examination of the terrible acts of 9/11 and the events leading up to them.

He explained that this material had come from the 1947 crash of an extraterrestrial craft....I got an opportunity to travel with President Eisenhower.

Approved in writing by the Pentagon Joint Chiefs, Operation Northwoods even proposed blowing up a US ship and hijacking planes as a false pretext for war.** A summary of key quotes from the Operation Northwoods documents is given below these instructions. To access the Operation Northwoods documents in the U.S. National Archives, first go to the webpage of the National Archives Catalog at: [http://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/](http://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/) Then, in the search box of the page that appears, type \"Northwoods\" and click on the \"Search\" button to the right of the box.

You will then see the first of 181 pages available, though the first page does not mention Operation Northwoods. The most revealing 15 pages of Operations Northwoods documents begin on page 129 and continue to 143. Thanks for caring enough to investigate Operation Northwoods. These documents demonstrate clearly that some top leaders in the U.S. military have no moral or ethical difficulty in developing plans which not only sacrifice the lives of innocent American citizens, but clearly trick and manipulate the American people in order to forward the war agenda.

It is assumed that a single agency will be given the primary responsibility for developing military and para-military aspects of the basic plan. It is recommended that this responsibility for both overt and covert military operations be assigned the Joint Chiefs of Staff. **Page 133 of file** (page 2 of actual Joint Chiefs report) The suggested courses of action ... are based on the premise that US military intervention will result from a period of heightened US-Cuban tensions which place the United States in the position of suffering justifiable grievances. World opinion, and the United Nations forum should be favorably affected by developing the international image of the Cuban government as rash and irresponsible, and as an alarming and unpredictable threat to the peace of the Western Hemisphere. **Page 136 of file** (page 5 of actual Joint Chiefs report) This plan ... should be developed to focus all efforts on a specific ultimate objective which would provide adequate justification for US military intervention. Such a plan would enable a logical build-up of incidents to be combined with other seemingly unrelated events to camouflage the ultimate objective. **Page 138-139 of file** (page 7-8 of actual Joint Chiefs report) A series of well coordinated incidents will be planned to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces. A. Incidents to establish a credible attack: (1) Start rumors (many). Use clandestine radio. (2) Land friendly Cubans in uniform \"over-the-fence\" to stage attack on base. (3) Capture Cuban (friendly) saboteurs inside the base. (4) Start riots near the base main gate (friendly Cubans). (5) Blow up ammunition inside the base: start fires. (6) Burn aircraft on air base (sabotage). (7) Lob mortar shells from outside of base into base. (8) Capture assault teams approaching from the sea or vicinity of Guantanamo City. (9) Capture militia group which storms base. (10) Sabotage ship in harbor; large fires - naphthalene. (11) Sink ship near harbor entrance. Conduct funerals for mock-victims. **A \"Remember the Maine\" incident could be arranged: ****We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba. Casualty lists in US newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation.** **We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington.** **Page 140** **of file** (page 9 of actual Joint Chiefs report) Use of MIG type aircraft by US pilots could provide", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:operationnorthwoods.txt:1:ae33ac6d3f88", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13704, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "operationnorthwoods.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "operationnorthwoods", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "entrance.

Harassment of civil air, attacks on surface shipping and destruction of US military drone aircraft by MIG type planes would be useful as complementary actions. Reasonable copies of the MIG could be produced from US resources in about three months. **Page 141 of file** (page 10 of actual Joint Chiefs report) Hijacking attempts against civil air and surface craft should appear to continue as harassing measures condoned by the government of Cuba. It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner enroute from the United States. The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan to cross Cuba. The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday. An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At the designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual aircraft would be converted to a drone. The drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will be transmitting on the international distress frequency a \"MAY DAY\" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal. **Note from WantToKnow.info:** As you explore some of the other strange facts you find on our website, we invite you to remember how the top US military leaders planned to manipulate public opinion to support their objectives in Operation Northwoods.

We have no doubt that everyone of us can make a difference in what is happening in our world. There are clear reasons why all of this can be overwhelming. Most of us over the years have developed fairly well-established ideas of how democracy, government, and businesses function in our nation and world. Our educational system and the media generally reinforce beliefs we developed from an early age in the way the world works. **It is not easy to open to evidence which seriously challenges these beliefs, even if the information is verifiable and from reliable sources.** When presented with information which questions our basic understanding of the world, it's natural to feel uneasy and overwhelmed. Yet we encourage you not to despair. Though it can be overwhelming at times, choosing knowledge and understanding in the long run allows us to work together to [build a brighter future](https://www.WantToKnow.info/brighterfuture). It's only natural that some become upset, angry, or fearful to discover how much they have been deceived. Many who developed material on [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) went through a period of shock and anger upon first learning about the major cover-ups before they eventually shifted to work for change in a positive way. Some individuals may need to go through a period of anger at being deceived. Though it may be important at times to give our anger a voice, in the long run, anger will not change our world for the better, and excessive anger will likely only lead to more of the same. The underlying intention of providing all of these materials is to open you to the possibility that there is much more than you might have imagined going on behind the scenes in the world - both destructive and constructive. *If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them.

Monday, Ph.D., LPC and Denny Hilgers** (Note from the authors: The purpose of this article is to assist interested parties in recognizing and identifying the complex nature of mind control programming. While therapeutic techniques are mentioned, it is assumed that only experienced therapists under expert supervision will use these techniques, and only in the context of ongoing psychotherapy.) Many Sadistic Ritual Abuse Survivors who have been diagnosed as having Multiple Personality Disorder (SRA/MPD), have been programmed in systematic, complex ways. By programming, we mean that the human, in a dissociated or altered mind state, has been systematically and deliberately taught lessons, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and responses to specific cues (\"triggers\") so as to respond on command in ways that benefit the person/groups responsible for the programming. There has been much controversy about whether the human mind functions as a computer; many clinicians believe that it is impossible to \"program\" the human brain. However, we have learned from survivors, including those whose job within a cult/organized group, was to \"program\" others, that indeed, it is possible to instill very complex information in the unconscious mind, and to use this information to ensure control of the human by controlling the mind. Survivors have told us that a group of programmers may travel from location to location, teaching members of various \"cults\" or other organized groups how to program their victims so as to ensure optimal mind control. By programming an SRA/MPD's system, the programmer can maintain constant contact with the survivor. This contact permits knowledge of a victim's location at any time and also allows manipulation of the victim to perform acts he/she would ordinarily be unwilling to do. Programmed mind control reinforces the lesson survivors tell us that all cult victims are taught, namely, that he/she cannot escape from the cult or perpetrating group. The programming is done in very complex ways so as to maximize the use of amnestic barriers between personalities, thereby preventing any one personality from having all of the information about how they are being controlled. Knowledge is power; by compartmentalizing knowledge throughout the system (i.e., the mind), the programmer or programming group has power over the victim. Basic therapeutic goals are: reducing amnestic barriers between personalities so that they can cooperate and share knowledge; finding the original memory of how the personality was created and thus uncovering the programming information (including how programming was done as well as perpetrator identity and triggers); and using imagery, cognitive restructuring, and other empowering therapeutic interventions to help the patient get back control over their own mind. However, the sophisticated programming that we are seeing in some survivors makes our task very difficult. Programming occurs after the creation of a new personality via the usual techniques of trauma and torture. While there is some evidence", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:pammonday.txt:0:7c4006f852fc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13710, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "pammonday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "pammonday", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "personality was created and thus uncovering the programming information (including how programming was done as well as perpetrator identity and triggers); and using imagery, cognitive restructuring, and other empowering therapeutic interventions to help the patient get back control over their own mind. However, the sophisticated programming that we are seeing in some survivors makes our task very difficult. Programming occurs after the creation of a new personality via the usual techniques of trauma and torture. While there is some evidence that with sophisticated computer equipment that creates altered states of consciousness via audio waves or manipulation of the visual field, a trauma base for programming is no longer necessary, the vast majority of our patients will have personalities created through torture. Survivors report that one form of programming involves the use of a physical image, for example, a picture or portion of a video. In an hypnotic state, the personality readily accepts this image as reality in his/her life. It is speculated that the \"internal landscapes\" that patients see inside have been created in part through the use of these visual images that have been internalized as reality. This may explain why survivors have similar \"landmarks\" within their internal landscapes such as a castle, carousel, Kabul, umbrella, puppet, cave, etc., that, when drawn and compared with the drawings from other survivors, look very much alike in design and detail. Many survivors report that they have internal computers that control information within their systems (this has especially been reported from survivors who report \"military\" mind control programming). The internalized computer usually lies deeply hidden within the unconscious but over time, its presence may be revealed to the victim. As communication between personalities and between levels proceeds, someone inside may know about the Internal Programmer, or Information System Specialist, the Controller, or simply the one who's job it is to program the system. Within the internal computer, grids and \"clone\" grids (or duplicators) house the different programs. Visualize a piece of graph paper (grids) with the space within each square having several programs within it. \"Clones\" are back-ups, so that if an entire grid, or even one program, is neutralized (deprogrammed), a replacement is spontaneously generated. Thus, it is vital that the duplicators be dealt with as programs are erased or decoded. Within a complete system, there are usually many levels and combinations of programs. The victim most likely will have no knowledge of their internal programmer because as programming commences, erasure codes, block codes, stop codes, and \"brain switch\" commands (having to do with right/left hemisphere functioning) have been put in to prohibit disclosure of deeply buried information about the internal computer. On each level, there most likely will be a computer and a back-up computer. As communication between personalities and levels increases, it is possible to obtain the different codes from controllers inside the system on each level so that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:pammonday.txt:1:cd9773304782", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13711, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "pammonday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "pammonday", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "knowledge of their internal programmer because as programming commences, erasure codes, block codes, stop codes, and \"brain switch\" commands (having to do with right/left hemisphere functioning) have been put in to prohibit disclosure of deeply buried information about the internal computer. On each level, there most likely will be a computer and a back-up computer. As communication between personalities and levels increases, it is possible to obtain the different codes from controllers inside the system on each level so that \"deprogramming\" using codes (such as number, alphabet or rhyme codes) can occur. This can be very dangerous, however, because there are booby traps and safeguards within the system that are programmed in to prevent any outside source from getting into the system. It helps to think of the programming as a very sophisticated Nintendo game, where there are many levels, secrets, and hazards. It is vital to proceed with caution, and with the full cooperation of the client, as only they can know where the dangers lie. Understand that as you get close to secret or hidden information that will help you move deeper into the system, the danger of internal or external harm to the client increases. Suicide programming will often be set off, and should be expected. Survivors report that programmers place \"Gatekeepers\" and \"Blockers\" in the system to protect hidden information, often by keeping you from reaching the inside people who can help decode the system. These must be found and removed in order to proceed with therapy. They may be identified by direct questioning, or they may appear as \"guards\" in the internal landscape, standing by a door or wall, or literally in front of a gate or other physical barrier. Some of these gatekeepers and blockers may be personalities or they may be perceived as \"spirits\". This is especially true with individuals who may have been abused by groups purporting to worship Satan. (For a Biblical understanding of the role of gatekeepers who block the \"doorway\", See John 10). The use of imagery to bind or enclose the gatekeepers is often useful. If the gatekeepers see themselves as spirits, they can be particularly difficult. They may present as individuals who are just \"passing through\" the body, and are not afraid of harm to the body because they will just\" go to the next body.\" Sometimes they present as very aggressive; at times these aggressive ones may be personalities who are projecting themselves as spirits because of their deep guilt; identifying with the \"evil\" spirit is a way of gaining mastery and control, and should be dealt with in typical therapeutic fashion. If your therapy includes knowledge of and use of spiritual information and imagery, this would be a good place to use it.

If your therapy includes knowledge of and use of spiritual information and imagery, this would be a good place to use it. Some of the booby traps you may run across include personalities whose job it is to direct you off course and provide false information. Others may ask you questions or try to get you to ask them questions (making you think you're getting somewhere) only to find that what they are doing is setting a suicide or self-mutilation program in motion. An example is a client who, when she heard the phrase, \"Why did the chicken cross the street?\" would self-destruct. Another asked the therapist, \"How old are you?\" (response) \"When's your birthday?\", etc., and the answers were triggers for the internal self-destruct program. The personality asking the questions had no knowledge of why she was asking them, only that she \"had to\". Many MPD patients report having a \"stairwell system\" internally. The stairwells are what connect the different levels. Sometimes the internal people will locate a stairwell that is sealed up, and a gatekeeper is there. Deal with the gatekeeper, break the seal, and proceed down to the next level. As you proceed through the levels, you may find that at the first couple of levels, you will get much flooding and spinning. The programs you may be dealing with are the \"Tornado\" or \"Whirlwind\" programs. The tornadoes function to create confusion and disorganization and a sense of being lost, being out of control. Tornadoes float around the different systems. Visual imagery of walls around the tornadoes to enclose them has often been useful. The \"whirlwind\" spins inward, \"sucking one in\" instead of outward; the result is to create a sensation of shutting down, shutting up, and feeling as if the person is going to die. The various systems that have been reported and worked by these authors include differing levels of complexity. Systems include: Spider Web, Carousel, Pool of Death, Communication, Kabbala, Puppet, Pentagram, Tornado, Castle, Galaxy, Flower, Scrabble, and Umbrella systems. Associated with \"military\" mind control programming are: Double Helix, Solometric, Cave and Well, and the Mensa systems. Space limitations prevent discussion of each of these systems, but illustrations of the difficulties in working with some of these systems follow. The Pentagram (or star) system is often connected to the Tornado system. Rituals are tied to this system. There are many cult-created alters within this system. You may see personalities who are re-enacting rituals (such as attempting to kill the host's cat, etc.) Traumatic memories reveal Satanic ritual abuse themes. The Castle system involves internal imagery of a castle containing a drawbridge, moat, turrets, gargoyles, dungeon, secret passageways, torture", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:pammonday.txt:3:d3db8114e37e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13713, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "pammonday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "pammonday", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "of the difficulties in working with some of these systems follow.

The Castle system involves internal imagery of a castle containing a drawbridge, moat, turrets, gargoyles, dungeon, secret passageways, torture chamber, and lots of rooms. Child alters are often hidden in the dungeon. Lots of programs can be contained within the castle, and many booby traps can be present that must be overcome. The Spider Web system is very complex. Communication between personalities proceeds through the strands. In order to break the negative communication, the strands must be broken, but understand that the internal self-helpers often also must communicate through the strands. You will often find a black widow spider (symbolic of the \"black widows\" used by Satanists to recruit new members, especially in churches and in clubs where youth congregates) with victims getting \"stuck\" in the web. Viper is a spirit associated with this system (see Isaiah 59:5 for the Biblical basis of this system). Gatekeepers are present; you may also find eggs, personalities named \"Viper\" or \"Devourer\" or those who binge and purge. In order to break this program, it is important to break the connectors (the silk strands) that connect the webs and hold them in place; remember to destroy the clone strands so new webs can't be spun. In this program, the clones immediately spin new webs that are double connected and more difficult to remove. If the \"viper\" is present, the tail and fangs can be removed (they contain poison) and the poison in the eggs can be removed (trapped personalities as well as \"demons\" are often found in the eggs). The Flower system involves criss-cross programming, i.e., three or four people may have been programmed together so that one person only has a piece of the programming. In order to get to that piece, you must have access to the other piece which resides in another person. Internally, the flower system may show up as flowers with lots of colors, with the bud representing one person, the stem and flower representing other people. This system is often connected to other systems such as Pi, Umbrella, Triangle and Star. The Mensa system (reportedly involving military and Illuminati programming) involves lots of numbers and sequences along with bar codes and union force codes. Union force would have to do with a set of numbers that would equal another set to come up with yet another set: e.g., a+b=c, b+c=a, c+b=a. A person could be programmed to respond to this very complex code. These codes are extremely difficult to discover in order to neutralize responses to the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:pammonday.txt:4:509ddb37c016", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13714, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "pammonday.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "pammonday", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "Umbrella, Triangle and Star.

A person could be programmed to respond to this very complex code. These codes are extremely difficult to discover in order to neutralize responses to the codes. The Mensa system will often have the Double Helix system within it. This system is connected with DNA; the patient has usually had lots of blood transfusions. Programming reportedly has been done through medical abuse by hospitals and doctors. Hospitalization is generally required to work with this system, as it is so complex and so may suicide programs are involved. The Carousel is usually found in the center of the Double Helix. Within the carousel there are mirrors and a shadow system. There is a key in the center of the carousel. The carousel spins and moves up and down repeatedly. The function of this program is to add confusion and avoidance. The mirrors and shadows are within the carousel which help prevent further deprogramming. Often the use of special light to light up the right path through the mirrors and shadows in order to reach the key has been helpful. Spiritual Interventions can be helpful here, as three \"floating spirits\" (False Prophet, Hoofed One, and Dragon) are frequently found in this program. The Scrabble system contains letters, numbers, and mathematical exponents. This is a very detailed system, with no room for error. A sequence of numbers or letters might set off this programming. For example, if the therapist writes a series of numbers such as \"31133113\", \"13113311\", or \"11331313\", and the patient responds to one or all of these series of numbers, you may have the Scrabble system. There is a lot of torture and trauma associated with this program because it is so sophisticated and difficult to learn. As programming proceeds, any mistakes made by the survivor will be severely punished. **Final Note:** For an excellent, detailed book on deprogramming survivors of SRA/MPD available free online, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secret_societies/svali_book_svali_speaks).

Mind controlled super spies have played a major role in the development of political and historical events for many decades. These spies are normal people who have no conscious knowledge that they are being used as spies. If you want to understand more about how this is possible, read our 10-page summary at [www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol10pg](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol10pg).

I highly recommend one or both of these before reading the link to a deep insider's information below. I have been in contact with numerous survivors and several experts on the secret CIA programs which developed mind control back in the 1950s. One of the experts is a man named Charles Viar. Mr. Viar is the Chairman of the Center for Intelligence Studies - [http://www.centerforintelligencestudies.com](http://www.centerforintelligencestudies.com/) He worked for 25 years in deep intelligence (counterintelligence to be specific), and has worked closely with top officials in both the military and CIA. His story is quite fascinating. You can find some of it on the Center for Intelligence Studies website by [clicking here](http://www.centerforintelligencestudies.com/cfisspecialsection.html). Through various sources, I have independent verification of much of the powerful information he has sent me. You can find an excellent, eight-page summary titled \"Pandora's Box\" written by Mr. Viar at [https://www.WantToKnow.info/pandorasboxcv](https://www.WantToKnow.info/pandorasboxcv) This fact-filled essay provides fascinating background information on the subject of mind control. I think you will find it most interesting and revealing. Please note, however, that though we recommend this article to our readers, we feel obliged to offer a cautionary note with regard to Section IV, paragraph two of this essay, in which the author states that \"there is no evidence that either the CIA or the US military operationalized ARTICHOKE.\" While this is true in a narrow sense - there is, in fact, no conclusive documentary evidence proving that either the CIA or the US military has employed ARTICHOKE in field operations - volumes of anecdotal evidence suggest that US government agencies have used this technique in various types of operations for several decades; and we suggest that our readers bear this in mind while reading this otherwise excellent article. For those who want more, I have additional information from Mr. Viar and others, which is not posted on the website. Please help to spread the word.

Viar** i On 23 October 1983, a truck packed with explosives crashed through the perimeter of the U.S. Marine expeditionary force at the Beirut International Airport. Moments later it slammed into a temporary barracks and exploded, killing 241 Marines serving with an international peacekeeping force that had been dispatched to Lebanon at the request of the Lebanese government. Within a matter of minutes a second truck penetrated the lines of the French contingent located nearby and detonated, killing 58 French paratroops. As a result of the carnage, the Reagan Administration made the politically costly decision to withdraw from that country; and the governments of Great Britain, France and Italy followed suit. Lebanon dissolved into chaos, and a bitter civil war ensued pitting the traditional Christian elite backed by Israel against an emergent Muslim majority supported by Syria, Iran, Iraq and Libya. At the time, US policymakers dismissed the suicide bombings as a tactical gambit conceived and executed by local fanatics. But with the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear that they marked the beginning of a general offensive against the West. For in the 19 years that have since elapsed, more than 200 suicide attacks have been conducted against Israel, Russia, Chechnya, India, Sri Lanka and the United States - and these have reshaped the face of modern war. Despite the spectacular aerial assaults that destroyed the World Trade Center and badly damaged the Pentagon on 11 September, Western analysts remain loath to recognize this basic fact. According to the still prevalent conventional wisdom, suicide attacks are born of desperation and despair - in this case, from the pervasive social and economic malaise that afflicts the Muslim world. Like the Japanese Kamikazes of an earlier era, Western analysts have dismissed them as little more than a deadly nuisance. This is unfortunate, for had they reached deeper into history they might have realized that the suicide attacks are strategic rather than tactical in nature; and that their objective is not to wreak local havoc, but rather to overturn the global balance of power. Moreover, they might also have found that this strategy is based upon the modern rediscovery of an ancient art - specifically, the conquest and weaponization of the human psyche. Although tyrants have sought to enslave the human mind from times immemorial, the first known success was an Eleventh Century figure by the name of Hasan bin Sabah.

Although tyrants have sought to enslave the human mind from times immemorial, the first known success was an Eleventh Century figure by the name of Hasan bin Sabah. Said to have been of noble birth, Hasan was forced to flee his native Persia after having become embroiled in a financial scandal at the Imperial Court. After finding sanctuary in Egypt, he is reported to have studied the teachings and organizational structure of an underground cult known as the *Dar ul Kikmat. *During this same time frame, he is also said to have mastered the Dark Arts. Whatever the actual truth, Hasan had returned to Persia by 1094; and with the aid of indigenous allies he seized control of the mountain fortress of Alamut. There he founded a sect that achieved infamy as the *Assassini*. Formally known as the *Shiah Ismai, *this sect claimed to hold in its possession secret and sacred truths; but in fact, it was a terrorist organization that sought to impose its will upon the Islamic World by systematically assassinating political figures that opposed its ends. Until finally crushed by Mongol invaders in 1250, the *Assassini *shook the political structures of the Middle East to their very foundations. According to legend, Hasan created a virtual paradise in a valley beneath his mountain citadel to recruit and train initiates. Hasan is said to have dispatched his followers to the public houses of the area, where they would drug and kidnap young men, and transport them to the valley. There they would awaken from their stupor to find themselves in luxurious surroundings, tended to by scores of beautiful young women. Having been informed by the maidens that they had been transported to Paradise by angels, the hapless victims would spend their days gorging upon wine, sex and mind-altering drugs. Then they would mysteriously re-awaken in their former surroundings, alone and bereft. Months might pass without incident as they resumed their ordinary and miserable lives; but then suddenly and mysteriously, they would reawaken in what they credulously believed to be the Muslim Heaven. After three or four such experiences, most became willing slaves to Hasan and his murderous schemes. Persuaded that Hasan was Allah made manifest upon the Earth, they killed their assigned targets without pity or remorse; and then went willingly to their deaths, certain of their place in Paradise. Although this story of Hasan's recruitment and training techniques is fantastic, it is well supported by historical evidence.1 Moreover, it closely resembles the ARTICHOKE technique that was developed and successively refined by the Soviet, Nazi, and Western intelligence services between 1920 and 1973.

Like the mythical Phoenix it has arisen from the ashes; and it now threatens to shake the world once more. II Although the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany - and, apparently, Great Britain - mounted large-scale research programs designed to develop techniques for psychological control at an early date, the United States did not actively pursue the subject until the Second World War. Then the Office of Strategic Services - forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency - enlisted behavioral scientists for specialized problem solving. Foremost among these was the development of technical solutions to the urgent problems of agent recruitment, handling and assessment. Although the OSS had at its disposal a wealth of human talent and essentially unlimited funds, the hurriedly constructed organization lacked experienced case officers to recruit and run field agents behind enemy lines. Acutely aware that their lack of practiced personnel rendered them vulnerable to deceptions, senior OSS officers turned to the behavioralists for a scientific solution. Their top priority was the development of a \"truth serum,\" which they hoped would make possible fast and accurate assessments of agent reliability. Despite frantic efforts, the OSS failed to find an effective interrogative drug. Yet the lure was so enormous that even after the war the newly created CIA continued the effort undeterred. But it was not until the 1949 trial of Cardinal Josef Mindszentry by the Soviet-installed Hungarian communist regime that the CIA realized that drugs held other promises as well. In the course of Mindszentry's trial, his deportment, demeanor and speech led CIA analysts to the conclusion that he had been successfully subjected to an extraordinary form of psychological manipulation. Although the technique was unknown to CIA psychologists, it was clearly of such efficacy and power as to cause him to confess to crimes he did not commit and could not have committed;2 and they were quite certain that drugs were somehow involved. The Soviets had clearly mastered a new form of totalitarian control; and discovering its secrets became an urgent intelligence priority. On April 20, 1950, CIA Director Roscoe Hillenkoetter approved the United States' government's first research and development program expressly designed to develop techniques for the control of the human mind. It was known through successive incarnations as Project BLUEBIRD, ARTICHOKE, MKULTRA and MKSEARCH; and eventually came to encompass 149 distinct behavioral science research programs and 33 related non-behavioral projects over the course of twenty-three years. The open-ended", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:pandorasboxcv.txt:2:95bfad773b4b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13721, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "pandorasboxcv.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "pandorasboxcv", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "form of totalitarian control; and discovering its secrets became an urgent intelligence priority.

The open-ended research program that Hillenkoetter approved was given sudden impetus by two dramatic developments. The first was the outbreak of war in Korea sixty-six days later; the second was the public breakdown of the U. S. ambassador to the Soviet Union some two years thereafter. During the Korean conflict American forces often performed poorly in the field against enemy armies that had no prior experience in mechanized warfare; and in one particularly shameful incident, an entire U.S. Army division fled the field. Moreover, the conduct of American servicemen in captivity was shocking. Fifteen per cent of American prisoners of war held by the Chinese Communists actively collaborated with their captors, and a full seventy per cent signed fraudulent confessions to war crimes or written denunciations of the United States government. More alarming still, large numbers of those that signed confessions or denunciations refused to recant after their repatriation.3 Many were suspected of having returned to the United States as willing spies for the enemy; and some were later proven to be.4 Of similar concern was the bizarre behavior of Ambassador George F. Kennan at Templehof airport while *en route* to London from Moscow. There Kennan exploded in anger at a nave question posed by an inexperienced reporter; and as a result of his ill-advised response was declared *persona non grata* by the Soviet regime. Such were the times that many senior American officials were convinced that this incident provided strong evidence that Kennan had fallen victim to Soviet mind control.5 The general outline of the CIA's behavioral science research program - commonly, but incorrectly referred to as MKULTRA - was inadvertently revealed by the Rockefeller Commission in 1975. Established by President Ford to investigate allegations of CIA illegality, the Commission's *Final Report* contained a one-line reference to a federal employee who had killed himself after having been unwittingly drugged by a CIA officer as part of an MKULTRA experiment. This sparked a press furor that eventually resulted in more extensive congressional investigations chaired by Sen. Edward F. Kennedy. Not surprisingly, both the press and the Sen. Kennedy focused their investigations upon the more lurid aspects of MKULTRA, which included the kidnapping, drugging and torturing of American citizens on American soil for research purposes and the effort to develop \"programmed assassins.\" Overlooked in the process were the CIA's efforts to determine the effects of electromagnetism upon the psyche, electromechanical stimulation of the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:pandorasboxcv.txt:3:4c1581befb8b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13722, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "pandorasboxcv.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "pandorasboxcv", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "a press furor that eventually resulted in more extensive congressional investigations chaired by Sen.

This was unfortunate, for their researchers made gains in most of these areas and scored dramatic breakthroughs in others. 6 According to declassified financial records and the testimony of retired CIA officers, the CIA had by 1961 developed implant devices for dogs, making it possible for their handlers to guide them through various courses by remote.7 During this same time frame they also developed techniques for disrupting bodily functions with radio waves. By the mid-1960's they had successfully developed and field-tested nonaural voice communications with both radio and micro waves; and by 1977 they had developed and field-tested a rudimentary form of electromechanical \"mind reading.\"8 But despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, they have steadfastly maintained that they failed entirely in their quest to control the human mind. III There are perhaps three reasons for the CIA's implausible denials. The first is legal responsibility. For as the Kennedy hearings established, CIA officers wildly exceeded their authority in the course of MKULTRA. Innocent citizens were kidnapped off the streets and drugged, hypnotized and subjected to physical torture. These actions were and remain felonious; and had the criminal justice system taken its proper course, scores of CIA officers would have faced capital charges. The second reason is the explosive nature of the data they developed in the course of their experiments. For contrary to common belief, the human psyche lacks systemic integrity. Rather than the tightly integrated system that has been historically assumed, it is in fact a loosely related collage of drives, inhibitions, orientations, functions, desires and beliefs - all of which are subject to external manipulation. The third and final reason is the extraordinary ease of reengineering the human mind. With the ARTICHOKE technique, a psyche may be broken apart, restructured and reassembled almost to specification in approximately four hours - all without the victim's consent, or even his conscious awareness. Despite almost two and a half centuries of scientific study, hypnosis remains poorly understood; and at present, all that is known with certainty is that hypnotic states are natural phenomenon that occur under certain - and often quite ordinary - circumstances. These states may be induced by external stimuli - and especially, by a skilled practitioner of hypnosis - and are related more or less closely to another psychological", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:pandorasboxcv.txt:4:2d3b834f545e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13723, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "pandorasboxcv.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "pandorasboxcv", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "- all without the victim's consent, or even his conscious awareness. Despite almost two and a half centuries of scientific study, hypnosis remains poorly understood; and at present, all that is known with certainty is that hypnotic states are natural phenomenon that occur under certain - and often quite ordinary - circumstances. These states may be induced by external stimuli - and especially, by a skilled practitioner of hypnosis - and are related more or less closely to another psychological phenomenon known as disassociation. Hypnotic states extend across a broad spectrum, ranging from a light hypnotic trance in which the subject is alert and fully aware, to a very deep trance in which the subject looses both conscious awareness and volition. At this level, the will of the subject may be entirely suborned, through a process of *faux *identification, by that of a hypnotist. Because hypnotic states are inherent potentialities of the human mind, everyone is subject to hypnosis. But under most circumstances, only about 20 percent of the population is capable of achieving the deepest hypnotic state required by ARTICHOKE. To escape this difficulty, practitioners first anesthetize their subject/victims with sodium pentothal and then stimulate them with Benzedrine. This produces an indeterminate physical state somewhere between sleep and waking consciousness, making it possible to place the victim/subject in a deep trance. Once the desired level of hypnosis is achieved, the subject/victim's psyche is systematically disassembled by isolating and identifying his or her drives, inhibitions, orientations, functions, desires and beliefs. In this process, particular attention is given to the so-called ego-defenses. Ego-defenses protect the individual from unwanted or threatening intrusions into conscious awareness; and for that reason are essential to ordinary functioning. Operating heavy equipment for example is an exceedingly hazardous endeavor; and safety requires the operator to concentrate carefully. To do so, he must repress his most basic instinct to flee from the danger. In the process, he must also avoid making untoward associations through a process known as inhibition. Ego-defenses are a matter of common experience, and one need merely reflect upon ones own behavior in various circumstances to observe their operation. Nonetheless, the number and nomenclature remains a matter of debate among psychologists and psychiatrists. But for operational purposes, the CIA embraced the classical catalogue presented by Anna Freud. According to Dr. Freud, there are nine innate ego-defenses and one potentiality: regression, repression, reaction formation, isolation, undoing, projection, introjection, turning-against-the-self and reversal. The last - which differs from the others in the sense that it actively promotes mental health, rather than psychological stability - is sublimation, or the displacement of instinctual drives.9 Ego defenses normally operate automatically, far below the level of conscious awareness. But in a state of deep hypnosis they may be isolated and brought to a state of awareness through a process of *regression*.

But in a state of deep hypnosis they may be isolated and brought to a state of awareness through a process of *regression*. They hypnotist, for example, might summon forth *projection* by asking the subject/victim to go back in time to his early childhood and recall an incident in which he was so angry with his mother that he screamed at her, and accused her of wanting to deliberately harm him. Once the subject complied, the hypnotists would evoke the particular emotions of that moment by expressing his sympathy and providing his assurances that the sentiments were right and proper. He would then inform the subject/victim that this was especially true as his mother had deceived him all his life. Rather than John Doe, as his mother had falsely informed him, his real name was \"Frank\" or whatever name came to the hypnotist's mind. Most often, the hypnotist would then inform the subject/victim that he was in fact of noble birth or lineage, and that someone - perhaps the Communists, or the Jews, the Freemasons or perhaps the *villain de jour* - had wickedly denied him this birthright. Identifying himself to the subject/victim as a secret friend who's identity must never be revealed to anyone, the hypnotist would suggest that the subject/victim be reminded of his terrible mistreatment - and exalted status - whenever he might throw something in the trash or launch a paper airplane in flight. The hypnotist would then would ask the subject victim to recall another incident from his youth in which, for example, he created something - perhaps a sand castle at the beach - and then obliterated it, wiping all traces away. By this means the hypnotist would summon forth the ego defense *undoing. * The hypnotist would then gently explain how he was different from \"Frank\" - and incidentally, much superior - and give him a new name, accompanied by a similar story of exalted birth and stolen birthright. The hypnotist might then introduce the ego-defense *undoing *- now grandly named \"Robert\", for example - to *projection* - that is, to \"Frank \" - and then tell them a story as to how they are related and why they should work together in what circumstances. The process would then be repeated with each ego-defense in turn, until all had been identified, named, ennobled by a fantastic story, provided with suitable reinforcers and, perhaps, given instructions for a subsequent rendezvous for \"refreshment.\" By this means a new psychic structure is constructed - creating, in effect, highly specialized multiple personalities within a single psychic system without the subject/victim's", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:pandorasboxcv.txt:6:9f376b504522", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13725, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "pandorasboxcv.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "pandorasboxcv", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "tell them a story as to how they are related and why they should work together in what circumstances.

Once this is done, the next challenge is to reshape his relationship to external reality. The human mind has four basic orientations: thinking, feeling, sensing and intuition. In simple terms, this means that the mind relates to external phenomenon by way of reasoned thought, emotions, physical sensations or intuitive knowledge. Thinking and feeling are considered to be superior functions, as they involve making judgments; while physical sensations and intuition are regarded as inferior functions. In any given circumstance, at least three of the four are engaged by external stimuli; and in a well-functioning psyche, they tend to be more or less congruent. In eating a chocolate bar, for example, a normal and healthy individual might think it good for satisfying a consciously recognized need for energy, feel it to be good it for providing a physical lift, and sense it to be good for the release of endorphins it caused within the brain. In contrast, a reasonably informed adult smoking a cigarette would know it to be bad, feel it to be good for relieving his nicotine cravings, but still sense it to be bad for wreaking havoc within his body. Realigning the subject/victim's orientation toward the external world is essential to ARTICHOKE, for success is measured in part by separating the subject/victim from reality. This is unfortunately easily done, by attaching a powerful and pleasurable physical memory to an otherwise unappealing situation. To do so, the hypnotist might for example ask the subject/victim to recall his fondest memory of physical pleasure; and then associate it with words and images to the unappealing situation referenced above. In this way the subject/victim's physical memories of intimacy with his first love might be associated with a particularly dangerous activity, thereby creating an artificial attraction to that activity. A soldier sent into battle, for example, might correctly think it dangerous but feel it wonderfully euphoric; and even though he sensed that something was terribly wrong with this feeling, he would not be able to escape it. In a very literal sense, he would be drawn towards danger. The next difficulties for the hypnotist to overcome are the subject/victim's inhibitions - which are, for operational purposes, the subject/victim's most basic beliefs. The subject/victim might for example believe himself incapable of performing certain particularly challenging physical or mental tasks; but this belief is ultimately based upon his self image - and this is quite", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:pandorasboxcv.txt:7:07eeea3654ae", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13726, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "pandorasboxcv.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "pandorasboxcv", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "was terribly wrong with this feeling, he would not be able to escape it.

The next difficulties for the hypnotist to overcome are the subject/victim's inhibitions - which are, for operational purposes, the subject/victim's most basic beliefs. The subject/victim might for example believe himself incapable of performing certain particularly challenging physical or mental tasks; but this belief is ultimately based upon his self image - and this is quite literally a picture of himself that he has formed within his own mind. To change that belief, it is necessary only to change that picture, substituting for example a perhaps realistic image of himself for an image of a far superior man capable of overcoming any obstacle. To do this, the hypnotist need only play to the subject/victim's vanity, pride and desire. For in almost all cases, these temptations are sufficient to persuade him to willfully suspend his own disbelief. Some inhibitions are more difficult to overcome than others, especially those that involve basic moral issues; and this is particularly true in terms of the prohibition against the taking of human life. During World War Two for example, American soldiers rarely displayed overt acts of cowardice and in fact routinely demonstrated a high level of courage under fire. Nonetheless, the overwhelming majority of American soldiers would not shoot to kill. Studies undertaken after the war demonstrated this fact conclusively; for it was found that a mere 25 per cent of the Army's frontline troops were responsible for almost 100% of the casualties inflicted upon the enemy. 10 To avoid this difficulty, the hypnotist uses a variety of techniques upon the subject/victims. One of these is the alteration of self-image described above; but a more powerful technique is known as \"permissioning.\" To do so, the hypnotist questions the subject/victim intensively as to why he believes that killing is wrong, and tries to find exceptions. Extensive research demonstrated that in most cases the inhibition against killing is traceable to the influence of the subject/victim's mother during his most formative stage; and to overcome this the hypnotist might present killing in certain circumstances as exceptions that the subject/victim's mother would approve of; or perhaps even impersonate the subject/victim's mother, to falsely assure him that the taking of life under specified circumstances would be permissible after all. Once this inhibition has been overcome, excepted, or rationalized through hypnotic deceit, all that remains to be done is to install additional \"reinforcers\" in the subject/victim's mind, assign to him his particular task and, if necessary, schedule a follow-up \"appointment.\" Thus the subject/victim may be instructed that each time he saw a telephone pole he was to reaccept and reaffirm as right, proper and true all that occurred while in the hypnotic state; and to re-accept and re-affirm his mission. IV As declassified CIA documents make clear,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:pandorasboxcv.txt:8:83e06e5c5bbc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13727, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "pandorasboxcv.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "pandorasboxcv", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "or rationalized through hypnotic deceit, all that remains to be done is to install additional \"reinforcers\" in the subject/victim's mind, assign to him his particular task and, if necessary, schedule a follow-up \"appointment.\" Thus the subject/victim may be instructed that each time he saw a telephone pole he was to reaccept and reaffirm as right, proper and true all that occurred while in the hypnotic state; and to re-accept and re-affirm his mission. IV As declassified CIA documents make clear, a principal objective of MKULTRA was to develop techniques that would allow the Agency to exert control over an individual to such an extent that he would do their bidding \"against his will and even against such fundamental laws of nature such as self-preservation.\" Technically, they failed; but only because a parallel project run by the Department of Defense achieved success first. The CIA research and development program was reportedly shut down in 1973, and the ARTICHOKE techniques perfected by the military were adopted wholesale. There is no evidence that either the CIA or the US military operationalized ARTICHOKE, but other intelligence services were less circumspect. There is clear evidence that the Soviet and Soviet Bloc intelligence services made ample use of it. The Soviets were decades ahead of the West in the race to weaponize the human psyche, and they exploited their advantage to its maximum potential. Throughout the 1950's and 1960's the West received a steady stream of false defectors, dispatched abroad by the KGB to disinform the Western intelligence services. To ensure that they delivered their false messages and no more, most were subjected to ARTICHOKE. The KGB later shared its expertise with their North Vietnamese allies; and by 1966, suicide bombings in Saigon, Da Nang and Hue began to exact a heavy toll upon American rear-echelon troops. These bombings did not significantly contribute to the North Vietnamese victory, but they did exact a measurable toll upon the morale of US forces. Exactly when the Soviets shared ARTICHOKE with their Arab allies is unknown, but they had clearly acquired the capability by the latter part of the 1970's. Their intelligence services are said to have passed it to various terrorist groups under their control by the late 1980's; and this knowledge is now widely believed to have diffused throughout the terrorist underground. Although this supposition remains unproven, it meshes neatly with the historical record.

Before the vehicle could come to a complete stop, it exploded with enormous force, killing the driver and eight Israelis and wounding 50 more. Although few Western analysts have made the connection, the Afula attack was a turning point in the Middle East conflict. For it was the first time that Islamic terrorists - manifestly independent of any state or intelligence service - employed ARTICHOKE to mount suicide attacks. Since then, they have conducted more than 80 additional suicide attacks against Israel, and three against the United States. The results have been devastating. In Israel, suicide bombers have killed more than 1000 Israelis and wounded almost five times as many. Moreover, they have inflicted enormous damage upon the Israeli economy. During the last 18 months, economic growth has ground to as standstill; and in partial result, Israel is now suffering a net population loss from emigration, as young Israelis leave for Europe and America in search of employment and, perhaps, security. The effects of suicide bombings upon the Israeli political system have been equally severe, and may eventually prove fatal. Israel is now locked into an apparently interminable struggle with the Islamic terrorists at an exceedingly unfavorable exchange rate. For each Israeli killed by suicide bombers, Israeli retaliatory actions have killed three Palestinians. This is a price Palestinians can pay indefinitely, while Israel cannot. Adjusting for population disparities, the number of Israelis killed by Islamic terrorists in the past 18 months is equivalent to 20,000 Americans. Despite this enormous bloodletting, the Israeli security service has yet to find a way to defend their civilian populace. If it cannot do so, the government itself is liable to eventual collapse. The 11 September attacks against New York and Washington in the United States are comparable. There Islamic terrorists traded the lives of 19 operatives for an estimated 3000 Americans; and at an estimated cost of $200,000 they inflicted approximately $100,000,000,000 damage upon the US economy. In terms of human life, this translates into an exchange ratio 1 to 157; and in terms of monetary costs, a ratio of $1 to $500,000,000. Such an exchange ratio cannot be long sustained, even by a country as rich, powerful and heavily populated as the United States. For that reason, developing an effective counter to ARTICHOKE-assisted suicide attacks must be an urgent national priority.

VI As of this writing, there has been no public discussion of ARTICHOKE-assisted suicide bombings. Indeed, all official discussions of suicide attacks have carefully omitted any reference to ARTICHOKE as an element of the suicide attack strategy. They have instead focused upon the supposed religious fanaticism of the bombers. Religious fanaticism is undoubtedly a significant factor in the recruitment of volunteers for so-called martyrdom operations, and it is certainly a strong contributing factor to their success. But in and of itself, religious fanaticism fails to explain the remarkably low failure rate of suicide bombings. To date, not a single recruit is known to have defected to either Israel or the United States; and only one is known to have refused to carry out his assigned mission. On the basis of current public source reports, the failure rate of suicide bombers appears to be about 1 in 80; and such an extraordinary figure is only attributable to scientific technique. Thus far the only countermeasure known to have been employed by Israeli and American - and, presumably - European security services is Remote Influence Technology, or RIT. An offshoot of MKULTRA distantly related to ARTICHOKE, RIT employs radio and microwave frequencies to broadcast subliminal messages to general or specific targets. Although RIT appeared promising in field tests and is said to have performed well during the 1989 invasion of Panama, it appears to have fallen short in this particular application. Israel is said to have initiated intensive RIT broadcasts in September of 2000, with no apparent success. Similarly, the National Security Agency's much vaunted effort to use RIT against Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan has been judged an unqualified failure, and apparently abandoned. On the basis of the available evidence, then, it would appear that technological solutions to the problem of ARTICHOKE-assisted suicide bombings are unlikely in the near or medium range future. The only plausible alternative is classical counterintelligence - that is, intelligence operations that are designed to counter, i.e., *negate,* the effectiveness of targeted intelligence services by infiltrating, penetrating and suborning their ranks. Because counterintelligence has historically focused upon opposing intelligence services rather than terrorist organizations, classical CI may be imperfectly suited for this task. Nonetheless, no other alternative readily suggests itself. Unfortunately, the United States is singularly ill equipped to undertake this effort, for the national counterintelligence capability was systematically destroyed during the anti-intelligence hysteria of the 1970's; and the feeble attempt to re-establish it by the Reagan Administration arguably died with James Angleton in May of 1987.

A scholar of international renown, Angleton was widely regarded as the premier theorist of counterintelligence during the Twentieth Century; and during his long tenure as chief of CIA counterintelligence, he is credited with creating America's first and only national counterintelligence capability. Unfortunately, Angleton's refusal to accept Henry Kissinger's policy of *détente *with the Soviet Union precipitated his dismissal in December of 1973; and within a matter of years, the CIA's counterintelligence staff was disbanded altogether. Creating a new counterintelligence capability configured for both classical counterintelligence and counter terrorist operations is a daunting task; and even if the political will for this undertaking is suddenly found, it will take at least a decade to achieve full functionality. Nonetheless, the need is compelling, and the prospects are bright. For *Al Qaeda* and other Islamic terrorist organizations not only accept Western volunteers; they seem to revel in the practice. The fact that at least two Americans, two Britons, and an Australian have been found among captured *Al Qaeda* fighters demonstrated the permeability of this organization, and augers well for success. Even in the absence of a national counterintelligence capability - with the training and support functions that this implies - it should be a comparatively simple task to place American or Allied agents in the ranks of the Islamic terrorist organizations; and once emplaced, to begin the long task of reducing them from within. Given the ghastly potential of suicide bombers, their first and foremost objective should be obtaining the names and locations of the terrorist's ARTICHOKE operators, and their subject/victims. VII For more than a century and a half, Hasan bin Sabah and his followers terrorized the Muslim world by systematically murdering anyone who stood in their way. In this, their principal weapon was the programmed assassin, psychologically weaponized with a technique strikingly similar to ARTICHOKE. In terms of strategy, tactics and technique, the *Assassini* were the historical predecessors of today's suicide bombers; and for that reason they are instructive. The Medieval Islamic elite failed to devise an effective strategy against suicide assassins, and for that they paid a fearsome price. It was not until the Mongol Conquest that the *Assassini* were finally suppressed, and then only by sheer brutality. Lacking modern sensibilities, the Mongols laid waste their strongholds and surrounding areas; and all known, suspected, and potential supporters of the A*ssassini* were summarily put to the sword. The number of people killed by the Mongol's in their campaign against the *Assassini* has been lost to history, but it", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:pandorasboxcv.txt:12:3c81c8050409", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13731, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "pandorasboxcv.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "pandorasboxcv", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "strategy against suicide assassins, and for that they paid a fearsome price.

The number of people killed by the Mongol's in their campaign against the *Assassini* has been lost to history, but it was surely in the hundreds of thousands and it may have numbered in the millions. Contemporary suicide bombers pose an almost identical challenge to the political structures of the contemporary world. ARTICHOKE-assisted terrorism is capable of successfully attacking almost any target at a highly favorable exchange ratio; and for that reason, it has revolutionized modern warfare. The political and economic structures of the Western states are now at grave risk; and the danger grows daily with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Barring an improbable technological breakthrough, the only plausible option for the United States is a strategy of suppression based upon the classical counterintelligence techniques of infiltration, penetration and subornation. Although such a strategy would be difficult for the United States to undertake at the present time, it offers every promise of long-term success. All that is required is political will, ingenuity, and patience - and a commitment to national survival. ___________________________________________ *Copyright 2002 by Charles S. Viar* notes 1.

With very best wishes, Fred Burks ** ** ** ** **A Palestinian and a Jew Find Peace Together ****Marion Pargamin, Jerusalem, ******[marion_p84@hotmail.com](mailto:marion_p84@hotmail.com)**** I would like to tell you about a quite extraordinary event that happened to me during a peace walk organized by a meditation group in Israel. The eight-day walk took place on the first week of April. It was intended to give an opportunity for Palestinians and Israelis to walk together, to develop dialogue and self-introspection, inspired by the ancient traditions that guided people like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. During these eight days, participants walked together from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, passing by Jewish and Arab towns and settlements in silence and awareness, declaring a commitment to deep listening and nonviolence. Monday, the 8th of April, the last day of the Walk, is the eve of the Holocaust day, a day of deep emotion for the Jewish community. The walk goes through Jerusalem to the foot of the old city walls. I had planned to join the group in the morning, but after a sleepless night I decide to join later. In the early afternoon, I walk up to the walls of the old city to join the walkers. When I get to Jaffa gate, I find myself in front of a very agitated elderly Arab man exchanging insults with an elderly religious Jew who is standing at a bus station a few meters down. They are extremely angry. Some policemen from a Border Police patrol are trying to calm them down, so that it won't turn into a fight. I stand beside the Arab. I speak to him calmly and ask him to sit down without reacting to the other's provocation. I am quite impressed by the restraint shown by the policemen. They don't defend one side or the other and respect both sides. The bus arrives, the Jewish man boards the bus and the situation seems to have settled down. Then, a Jewish woman who was there in the queue from the beginning of the argument takes it upon herself to start insulting the Arab, who reacts immediately. The police have gone and I am left alone to try to calm the situation. I give my attention to the Arab, who would have stayed quiet if he was not continually provoked by the woman. I try from a distance to reason with her without success. She stops a passing police car and says something to the policeman.

I am so happy that all the policemen in this situation act so calmly and help to restore peace. Then, a Palestinian woman on her way to Jaffa gate bursts onto the scene. She jumps to the conclusion that the old Arab is under attack and rushes in a frenzy to rescue him. She yells insults at the Jewish woman, and the situation heats up again. All my attention is now focused on her. She is like a bomb ready to explode. I try to explain to her what is going on, but she is furious with me, screaming out her hatred, her despair and her pain. This whole situation is greater than the two of us and takes on proportions beyond our present meeting. This is Palestine accusing Israel. At this moment I represent Israel for her. She shouts out her sorrow about what is going on now in the territories, the military incursions into Palestinian towns. She has family and friends in Jenin and says that our soldiers are war criminals. She is convinced that we want to kill them all. Why do we hate them so much? They are not responsible for the Holocaust, why should they be paying the price? Pointing at the Jewish woman, she assures me that in the Arab country from where this Sephardi woman comes, she was treated with honor, as a human being and yet look at how she behaves with Palestinians now! It goes on and on. She shouts and spews her hatred for Israel at me. I don't try to argue with her at all. I don't show any reaction to all these accusations. I feel a huge compassion and an intense need just to listen to her. My patience is nourished by understanding that behind this overwhelming hatred is a deep suffering and pain aggravated by the present situation of war. It must express itself in some way so that healing can take place. I don't let myself get tempted or trapped into guilt or anger. I am sorry for the tragedy on both sides. I let her express herself for a long time without interrupting her.

As she continues to shout at me, I tell her that she has no need to speak so loudly, because I am listening to her with all my attention. At the same time I find myself caressing her arm. She lets me do it and progressively lowers her voice, while continuing to let her despair overflow. She says to me, \"Do you understand why some of us come and commit suicide among you? You kill us anyway, so why not kill you at the same time?\" She even mentions the possibility of coming and blowing herself up out of despair. I tell her softly that I don't want her to die. Nobody should come to this decision. We all suffer on both sides. She goes on and on claiming that the Zionists only want to get rid of the Palestinians. I tell her, \"You see I am a Zionist, and I don't want to get rid of you. I wish we could live together as good neighbors.\" She listens to me! She tells me about the demonstration that took place the week before near Ramallah. Then she asks me to donate some money to buy phone cards for Palestinians who need them. I give her some money. At this stage the conversation is quite normal between us. She doesn't shout any more, she is even able to listen to me. She is almost calm when I notice the people of the Walk approaching us slowly, at the top of the street. They are in a line, a hundred of them, one after the other walking in silence, slowly, quietly, aware of each step, creating an atmosphere of peace and safety around them. They are very present. They radiate calm and warmth. I point them out to her and explain that this is the reason I came here, to join a walk of peace in which Palestinians and Israelis walk together. I tell her about the Walk, its message of coexistence and peace; peace at every step, here and now. I suggest that she come into the line with me. She hesitates and rejects my offer. At this moment they reach us. Several people I know shake my hand warmly as they go by. A young woman approaches her and gives her a kiss. It appears that they know each other.

Before I go I tell her, \"I am sure that someday we will succeed in building peace between us.\" She smiles and replies, \"Me too.\" Then to my total surprise, she comes close to me and kisses me on my cheeks! She walks alongside the line for a while. She tells me that she likes this Walk, that it makes her feel good. She says it gives her relief and that her mood is much better now. I am very, very moved. I feel overwhelmed by this encounter, especially by its unexpected ending. Peace was there around the corner! I did not miss it!! I never understood so fully as in this moment, the deep meaning of the words pronounced by Thich Nhat Hanh in Shanghai on the 19th of October, after the September 11th tragedy: \"Terror is in the human heart. We must remove it from the heart. The root of terrorism is misunderstanding, hatred and violence. This root cannot be located by the military. Bombs and missiles cannot reach it, let alone destroy it. Only through the practice of finding calm and looking deeply within can our insight reveal and identify this root. Only with the practice of deep listening and compassion can terror be transformed and removed. Darkness cannot be dissipated with more darkness. Only light can dissipate darkness. Those of us who have the light should display the light and offer it so that the world will not sink into total darkness.\" **Note:** For more ideas on how you can find more peace and joy in your life, I recommend an essay I wrote at [www.weboflove.org/keystolife2](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife2).

This is one of the reasons I asked many philosophical and spiritual questions from a young age. I have been deeply interested in these topics my whole life. A few years ago, I came across a philosophical/spiritual essay that so moved me it brought tears to my eyes. It is the deepest, most profound essay of this type that I have ever read. I don't know how much it will resonate with you, but I invite you to take a look at the inspiring seven-page essay which so moved me at [https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers](https://www.WantToKnow.info/wingmakers). The basic message is that humankind is now experiencing a shift from the old paradigm of looking for the answers outside of ourselves to a new paradigm of looking deep inside to the Divine Essence that lies within each of us. The essay gives some excellent advice on how to facilitate that transition within ourselves and in our world. Below are a few short excerpts to give you a taste of what is written. **Principles of Self-Enlightenment ****by WingMakers** Each soul is designed to explore in a physical body new ways of experiencing life, and through this process of discovery to transform to a deeper level of understanding and expression of its Divine Essence. This Divine Essence is the fullest expression of the soul, and most closely exemplifies the Divine's capabilities therein. Divine Essence is a level of divine awareness that was \"seeded\" within your soul when it was initially conceived by the Divine. Divine Essence is also the natural state of the soul that has removed itself from the controlling aspects of hierarchical belief systems through the complete awakening of its indwelling Divine Intention. The self-enlightenment experience is initiated by the realization that you are capable of direct access to the Divine. This is the realization that the wisdom of the Divine is discovered deep within your own soul. In other words, your body, complete with its physical, mental, and emotional capabilities, is not the repository of your Divine Intention. Nor is your mind able to reach out and connect with this liberating aspiration - this glorious freedom to access All That Is. It is your soul that is the harbor of your Divine Essence. And it is your soul that is the vehicle of access to the awakening of your Divine Intention, which allows the enlightenment experience to unfold through the integration of your body, mind, heart, and soul. Self-enlightenment is the next stage of perception and expression for your soul. It is initiated when you design your life based upon principles that are symbolic of the Divine. As you become increasingly responsive to the Divine through the awakening of your indwelling Divine Intention, you will naturally gravitate towards life principles that symbolically express the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:philosophicalessay.txt:0:9b4b2fa1da5c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13740, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "philosophicalessay.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "philosophicalessay", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "to the awakening of your Divine Intention, which allows the enlightenment experience to unfold through the integration of your body, mind, heart, and soul. Self-enlightenment is the next stage of perception and expression for your soul. It is initiated when you design your life based upon principles that are symbolic of the Divine. As you become increasingly responsive to the Divine through the awakening of your indwelling Divine Intention, you will naturally gravitate towards life principles that symbolically express the formative principles of divine creation. There are wide ranges of expressions that can induce the self-enlightenment experience and liberate the soul from external controls. Inasmuch as these expressions can vary, the intent of the expressions is quite narrowly defined as the intent to expand into a state of integration whereby all aspects of your conscious self become increasingly aligned with your Divine Essence. The below principles are divine templates of creation. They are designed to help you experience life from the perspective of Divine Essence. They are bridges through which you can access the experience of wholeness by perceiving with your Divine Essence. There are three particular life principles that accelerate the self-enlightenment experience and help to align your perspective with the perspective of Divine Essence. They are: **1) Seeing the Divine in all 2) Nurturance of life ** ** 3) Gratitude** When you apply these principles, a deeper meaning will be revealed to the seemingly random events of your life experience - both in the universal and personal contexts. I very much respect each person's path in regards to philosophy, spirituality, and religion. I share this essay with you only as, no matter what path you have chosen, it may possibly inspire you (as it did for me) to open more deeply to the divine essence within you. Take care, and I wish you a wonderful day and week ahead.

A veteran of 35 years in the Marine Corps and twice a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor, Butler finally decided that \"war is a racket!\" His reputation for patriotism, integrity, and dedication to democracy, coupled with his proclivity to speak the truth as he saw it irrespective of official policy, made him a seemingly perfect front for the men who hated Roosevelt. They were people with a determination, if it were impossible to replace the president, to manipulate him through the person of an American Mussolini. Their short-sightedness prevented their realizing that Butler was obviously the wrong choice for the job. Jules Archer quotes testimony from the McCormack-Dickstein House Committee on Un-American Activities hearings (including testimony that was subsequently censored from public record) that details how Butler was approached by representatives of the arch-conservative American Liberty League; how they tried to persuade him to lead an army of veterans in demonstration against Roosevelt's silver standard; how Butler quickly concluded that the silver standard controversy was being used as a subterfuge to lead American veterans against Washington for truly sinister purposes; and how this hero, patriot, and Republican democrat, upon uncovering the full dimensions of the conspiracy, determined to go to Washington and blow it wide open. **John L. Spivak, a reporter assigned to cover the committee hearings, calls the story \"one of the most fantastic plots in American history. ...

According to retired Representative John W. McCormack, former Speaker of the House, if the late Major General Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps had not been a stubborn devotee of democracy, Americans today could conceivably be living under an American Mussolini, Hitler, or Franco. An ironic aspect of the conspiracy General Butler unmasked is that few Americans have ever heard about it, or even know anything about the general. As children all of us were taught about the treason of Aaron Burr and Benedict Arnold, whose betrayals were safely cobwebbed by the distant past. But school texts that deal with the New Deal are uniquely silent about the powerful Americans who plotted to seize the White House with a private army, hold President Franklin D. Roosevelt prisoner, and get rid of him if he refused to serve as their puppet in a dictatorship they planned to impose and control.

The largely anti-Roosevelt press of the New Deal era scotched the story as expeditiously as possible by outright suppression, distortion, and attempts to ridicule General Butler's testimony as capricious fantasy. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *ix* *x Forward* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Smedley Butler's whole life, however, was proof that he was a man of incorruptible character, integrity, and patriotism, with a deserved reputation for bluntly speaking the whole truth at all times, regardless of the consequences. He was named by Theodore Roosevelt \"the outstanding American soldier.\" The official Marine Corps record calls him \"one of the most colorful officers in the Marine Corps' long history\" and \"one of the two Marines who received two Medals of Honor for separate acts of outstanding heroism.\" He was decorated no fewer than twenty times. Former Speaker McCormack told the author, \"In peace or war he was one of the outstanding Americans in our history. I can't emphasize too strongly the very important part he played in exposing the Fascist plot in the early 1930's backed by and planned by persons possessing tremendous wealth.\" The crucial events of the plot to seize the White House unfolded between July and November, 1933, with hearings before the McCormack-Dickstein Committee begun in New York City on November 20, 1934. On November 26 the committee released a statement detailing the testimony it had heard, and its preliminary findings. On February 15, 1935, the committee submitted to the House of Representatives its final report, verifying completely the testimony of General Butler. This book may help break some of the seals of silence that have kept Americans from knowing the truth about that conspiracy. As the first effort to tell the whole story of the plot in sequence and full detail, it may serve as a fresh reminder of Wendell Phillips's warning about the price of liberty.

Bums, riffraff, drifters, and troublemakers-those were some of the descriptions being applied to the Bonus Army. Many of the ragged veterans who had marched on the Capital had been sleeping in doorways and under bridges, part of the vast army of twelve million unemployed. Some were the same men who had fought under Smedley Butler in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines campaign, the Boxer Rebellion, the Caribbean interventions, the Chinese intervention of 1927-1928, and World War I. Butler had come to Washington in 1932 at the urging of James Van Zandt, head of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, to lend moral support to veterans at a crucial moment. Congress had just voted down the Patman Bonus Bill to pay veterans the two-billion-dollar bonus promised them in bonus certificates payable in 1945. Bonus Army Commander Walter W. Waters, a former army sergeant, and other leaders feared that their discouraged followers would now give up and return home. When Waters introduced Smedley Butler to the huge crowd of veterans gathered along the Anacostia River to hear him, he was greeted with an enthusiastic roar of acclaim that echoed through Washington like thunder. They all knew Old Gimlet Eye, one of the most colorful generals who had ever led troops <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> 3 <![if !supportLists]>*4 *<![endif]>*The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> into battle. He was even more famous and popular among rank-and-file leathernecks, doughboys, and bluejackets for the fierce battles he had fought against the American military hierarchy on behalf of the enlisted men. He was also admired, respected, and trusted because of his one-man fight to compel Americans to remember their tragic war casualties hidden away in isolated veterans' hospitals. Smedley Butler was a wiry bantam of a man, shoulders hunched forward as though braced against the pull of a heavy knapsack, his hawk nose prominent in the leathery face of an adventurer. Silhouetted against a flaming sunset, he made a blazing speech of encouragement in the blunt language that had kept him in hot water with the nation's highest-ranking admirals and generals, not to mention Secretaries of State and Navy. \"If you don't hang together, you aren't worth a damn!\" he cried in the famous hoarse rasp that sent a thrill through every veteran who had heard it before. He reminded them that losing battles didn't mean losing a war. \"I ran for the Senate on a bonus ticket,\" he said, \"and got the hell beat out of me.\" But he didn't intend to stop fighting for the bonus, and neither should they, he demanded, no matter how stiff", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:5:c1803d214180", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13747, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "Navy. \"If you don't hang together, you aren't worth a damn!\" he cried in the famous hoarse rasp that sent a thrill through every veteran who had heard it before.

You are the best-behaved group of men in this country today. I consider it an honor to be asked to speak to you. ... Some folks say I am here after something. That's a lie. I don't want anything.\" All he wanted, he told the cheering veterans, was to see that the country they had served dealt with them justly. He concluded his exhortation by urging, \"When you get home, go to the polls in November and lick the hell out of those who are against you. You know who they are. ... No go to it!\" Afterward he was mobbed by veterans eager to speak to him. Until 2:30 A.M. he sat sprawled on the ground in front of his tent, listening sympathetically to tales of lost jobs, families in distress, and troublesome old wounds. He slept three hours, then woke up to resume talks with the veterans. Sharing a Bonus Army breakfast of potatoes, hard bread, and *The Plot 5* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> coffee, he learned that the food was running out, and veterans were muttering about rioting against Congress if it did. Before he left for his home in Newtown Square, a small town outside of Philadelphia, he warned the Bonus Marchers, \"You're all right so long as you keep your sense of humor. If you slip over into lawlessness of any kind, you will lose the sympathy of a hundred twenty million people in the nation.\" It was the government, however, that unleashed the violence. Under orders from President Herbert Hoover, General Douglas MacArthur led troops in driving the Bonus Army out of Washington at bayonet point and burning down their shacktowns. By August 1 rumors spreading from the last stronghold of the veterans, an encampment at Johnstown, Virginia, indicated that the infuriated Bonus Marchers were determined to organize a new nonpartisan political organization of veterans and wanted General Butler to lead it. Reporters pressed him to comment. \"I have heard nothing about it at all, although I was in Washington about two weeks ago to address the veterans,\" he replied with a shrug. \"I have neither seen nor heard from Mr. Waters or any of the other leaders of the Bonus Expeditionary Force.\" Meanwhile he phoned the governors of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:6:53a5eca7afd4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13748, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "that the infuriated Bonus Marchers were determined to organize a new nonpartisan political organization of veterans and wanted General Butler to lead it.

He phones Waters in Washington to urge that the remnants of the Bonus Army break camp and start back home under this plan, and he issued a blast at the Hoover Administration as heartless for its treatment of the veterans and its failure to help them, their wives, and their children return home without further humiliation. That November lifelong Republican Smedley Butler took the stump for Franklin D. Roosevelt and helped turn Herbert Hoover out of the White House. <![if !supportLists]>*5 *<![endif]>*The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **2** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> On July 1, 1933, General Butler's phone rang soon after he had had breakfast. Calling from Washington, an American Legion official he had met once or twice told Butler that two veterans were on their way from Connecticut to see him about an important matter and urged him to make time for him. About five hours later, hearing a car pull up into his secluded driveway at Newtown Square, Butler glanced out the porch window. His lips pursed speculatively as two fastidiously dressed men got out of a chauffeur-driven Packard limousine. At the door the visitors introduced themselves as Bill Doyle, commander of the Massachusetts American Legion, and Gerald C. MacGuire, whom Butler understood to have been a former commander of the Connecticut department. Butler led the visitors into his study at the rear of the house, and they took chairs opposite his desk. MacGuire, who did most of the talking, was a fat, perspiring man with rolls of jowls, a large mouth, fleshy nose, and bright blue eyes. He began a somewhat rambling conversation during which he revealed that he, too, had been a Marine, with a war wound that had left a silver plate in his head. Doyle established his combat credentials by mentioning that he also had a Purple Heart. Butler's compassion for wounded veterans made him patient as MacGuire encircled the subject of their visit in spirals that only gradually narrowed until their apex pierced the point. The point, it seemed, was that MacGuire and Doyle, speaking for a coterie of influential Legionnaires, were intensely dissatisfied with the current leadership of the American Legion.

The point, it seemed, was that MacGuire and Doyle, speaking for a coterie of influential Legionnaires, were intensely dissatisfied with the current leadership of the American Legion. Considering it indifferent to the needs of rank-and-file veterans, they revealed that they hoped to dislodge the regime at a forthcoming Legion convention to be held in Chicago. They urged *The Plot 7* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler to join them and stampede the convention with a speech designed to oust the \"Royal Family\" controlling the organization. Their dissatisfaction with the leadership of the American Legion did not find Butler unsympathetic. He had long been privately critical of the organization's close ties with big business and its neglect of the real interests of the veterans it presumably represented. These convictions were to be made dramatically public before the year was out, but now he declined his visitors' proposal on the grounds that he had no wish to get involved in Legion politics and pointed out that, in any event, he had not been invited to take part in the Legion convention. MacGuire revealed that he was chairman of the \"distinguished guest committee\" of the Legion, and was on the staff of National Commander Louis Johnson, a former Secretary of Defense. At MacGuire's suggestion Johnson had included Butler's name as one of the distinguished guests to be invited to the Chicago convention. Johnson had then taken this list to the White House, MacGuire said, and had shown it for approval to Louis Howe, Roosevelt's secretary. Howe had crossed Butler's name off the list, however, saying that the President was opposed to inviting Butler. MacGuire did not know the reason, but Bill Doyle assured Butler that they had devised a plan to have him address the convention anyhow. Butler remained silent. He was used to oddball visitors who called with all kinds of weird requests. Curiosity, and the leisure afforded by retirement, often led him to hear them out in order to fathom their motives. He thought about his visitors' finely tailored suits and the chauffeur-driven Packard an their claim to represent the \"plain soldiers\" of the Legion. The story about the rejection of his name on the Legion convention guest list by the White House struck him as more than peculiar, in view of the fact that the President had gratefully accepted his campaign help in a \"Republicans for Roosevelt\" drive eight months earlier. Why should F.D.R. suddenly be so displeased with him? It crossed his mind that the purpose of the story, true or false, might be intended to pique him against the Roosevelt Administration, for some obscure reason.

Keeping his suspicions <![if !supportLists]>*8 *<![endif]>*The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> to himself, he heard out his visitors in the hope of learning why they were so anxious to use him. They explained that they had arranged for him to attend the convention as a delegate from Hawaii, which would give him the right to speak. When he still declined, they asked whether he wasn't in sympathy with their desire to oust the \"Royal Family.\" He was, he said, because the leadership had simply been using the organization to feather their own nests, but he had absolutely no intention of attending the convention without an invitation.

Without waiting to inquire whether Butler had changed his mind, MacGuire quickly informed him that there had been a change of plans. The general had been right to object to coming to the convention as just another delegate, MacGuire acknowledged. It would have been ineffective, and a waste of the general's immense prestige. MacGuire outlined a new plan in which Butler would gather two or three hundred Legionnaires and take them to Chicago on a special train. They would be scattered throughout the audience at the convention, and when Butler made an appearance in the spectators' gallery, they would leap to their feet applauding and cheering wildly. The proceedings would be stampeded with cries for a speech that would not die down until Butler was asked to the platform. Incredulous at the audacity with which this scheme was being unfolded to him, Butler asked what kind of speech his visitors expected him to make. MacGuire produced some folded *The Plot 9* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> typewritten pages from an inside jacket pocket. They would leave a speech with him to read. MacGuire urged Butler to round up several hundred Legionnaires, meanwhile, to take to Chicago with him. Holding on to his fraying temper, Butler pointed out that none of the Legionnaires he knew could afford the trip or stay in Chicago. MacGuire quickly assured him that all their expenses would be paid.

Holding on to his fraying temper, Butler pointed out that none of the Legionnaires he knew could afford the trip or stay in Chicago. MacGuire quickly assured him that all their expenses would be paid. But Butler, who was constantly being approached with all kinds of wild schemes and proposals, was not prepared to take the plotters seriously until they could prove they had financial backing. When he challenged MacGuire on this point, the veteran slipped a bankbook out of his pocket. Without letting the name of the bank or the account be seen, he flipped over the pages and showed Butler two recent deposits-one for $42,000 and a second for $64,000-for \"expenses.\" That settled it. No wounded soldiers Butler knew possessed $100,000 bank accounts. His instincts sharpened by two years' experience, on loan from the Marines, as crime-busting Director of Public Safety for Philadelphia, warned him that there was something decidedly unsavory about the proposition. He decided to blend skepticism, wariness, and interest in his responses, to suggest that he might be induced to participate in the scheme if he could be assured that it was foolproof. He would profess himself interested, but unconvinced as long as he suspected that there was more to be learned about the scheme. So far they had told him practically nothing except what was barely necessary for the role they wanted him to play. He determined to get to the bottom of the plot, while trying not to scare them off in the process. After they had left, he read over the speech MacGuire had left with him. It urged the American Legion convention to adopt a resolution calling for the United States to return to the gold standard, so that when veterans were paid the bonus promised to them, the money they received would not be worthless paper. Butler was baffled. What did a return to the gold standard have to do with the Legion? Why were MacGuire and Doyle being paid to force this speech on the convention-and who was paying them? <![if !supportLists]>*9 *<![endif]>*The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **4** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler detected an odor of intrigue. Some kind of outlandish scheme, he was convinced, was afoot. Knowing little about the gold standard, why Roosevelt had taken the country off it or who stood to gain by its restoration and why, he began thumbing through the financial pages of newspapers and magazines-sections of the press he had never had any occasion to read. The first important fact he learned was that the government no longer had to back up every paper dollar with a dollar's worth of gold.

Knowing little about the gold standard, why Roosevelt had taken the country off it or who stood to gain by its restoration and why, he began thumbing through the financial pages of newspapers and magazines-sections of the press he had never had any occasion to read. The first important fact he learned was that the government no longer had to back up every paper dollar with a dollar's worth of gold. This meant that the Roosevelt Administration could increase the supply of paper money to keeps its pledge of making jobs for the unemployed, and give loans to farmers and homeowners whose property was threatened by foreclosure. Banks would then be paid back in cheapened paper dollars for the gold-backed dollars they had lent. Conservative financiers were horrified. They viewed a currency not solidly backed by gold as inflationary, undermining both private and business fortunes and leading to national bankruptcy. Roosevelt was damned as a socialist or Communist out to destroy private enterprise by sapping the gold backing of wealth in order to subsidize the poor. Butler began to understand that some wealthy Americans might be eager to use the American Legion as an instrument to pressure the Roosevelt Administration into restoring the gold standard. But who was behind MacGuire? A short while after MacGuire's second visit, he returned to see Butler again, this time alone. MacGuire asked how he was coming along in rounding up veterans to take with him to the convention. Butler replied evasively that he had been too busy to do anything about it. He then made it clear that he could no further interest in the plan unless MacGuire was willing to *The Plot 11* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> be candid and disclose the sources of the funds that were behind it. After some hesitation MacGuire revealed that they had been provided by nine backers, the biggest contributor putting up nine thousand dollars. Pressed to explain their motives, MacGuire insisted that they were simply concerned about helping veterans get their bonus and a square deal. People who could afford such contributions, Butler reflected ironically, were hardly the type who favored a two-billion-dollar bonus for veterans. When he prodded MacGuire further, the fat veteran revealed that one of his chief backers was a wealthy Legionnaire he worked for, Colonel Grayson M.-P. Murphy, who operated a brokerage firm at 52 Broadway in New York City. Butler pointed out the contradiction between MacGuire's claim that his group was concerned with the problems of the poor rank-and-file veteran and the fact that his backers were all obviously wealthy men. MacGuire simply shrugged and frankly admitted that as far as he personally was concerned, he was primarily involved in the transaction as a businessman and was being well taken care of for his efforts.

MacGuire simply shrugged and frankly admitted that as far as he personally was concerned, he was primarily involved in the transaction as a businessman and was being well taken care of for his efforts. It would be equally profitable for Butler, he hinted, if the general were disposed to cooperate. Butler pumped him about Colonel Murphy's connection with the plan. Murphy, MacGuire revealed, was one of the founders of the Legion and had actually underwritten it with $125,000 in 1919 to pay for the organizational field work. He had been motivated by a desire to see the soldiers \"cared for.\" When Butler questioned Murphy's motive in wanting the gold-standard speech made at the convention, MacGuire explained that he and the other backers simply wanted to be sure that the veterans would be paid their bonus in sound gold-backed currency, not in \"rubber money.\" He showed Butler several checks for large amounts signed by Murphy and two other men-Robert S. Clark and John <![if !supportLists]>*12 *<![endif]>*The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Mills. Clark's name rang a bell with Butler. He had known a Second Lieutenant Robert S. Clark in China during the Boxer Campaign who had been called \"the millionaire lieutenant.\" The money, MacGuire said, would be used to open an expense account for Butler in Chicago. He hoped that the general would now get busy rounding up veterans to take to the convention. Butler remained noncommittal. He intended to procrastinate as long as he could, continuing to pump MacGuire until had enough information to make a complete report to the government. The President, he felt, ought to know what schemes his rich opponents were up to overturn New Deal policies. After the visit, Butler brooded over the implication of MacGuire's revelation that his employer, key founder and sponsor of the American Legion, was involved. Tall, heavyset, Grayson Mallot-Prevost Murphy* not only operated one of Wall Street's leading brokerage houses but was also a director of Guaranty Trust, a Morgan bank, and had extensive industrial and financial interests as a director of Anaconda Copper, Goodyear Tire, and Bethlehem Steel. A West Point graduate, Murphy was a veteran of the Spanish-American War and World War I with the rank of colonel. Butler's bushy eyebrows rose when he also learned that the financier had been decorated by Benito Mussolini, who had made him a Command of the Crown of Italy. Butler found out that he had been one of twenty American officers who had met in Paris in February, 1919, reportedly on orders from the commanders of the A.E.F., to counter revolutionary unrest in Europe following the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:12:f50db849679f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13754, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "a veteran of the Spanish-American War and World War I with the rank of colonel.

Murphy had put up $125,000 to get the American Legion going, and it had been organized in the spring with a caucus of about a thousand officers and men. The Legion had then solicited funds and support from industrialists. Swift and Company executives had written other firms, \"We are all <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> * The Grayson Mallet-Prevost Murphy referred to here and throughout the book died on October 19, 1937. *The Plot 13* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Legion, the results it will obtain, and the ultimate effect in helping to offset radicalism.\" The average veteran who joined the Legion in the 1920's had been unaware that big-business men were backing it to use it as a strikebreaking agency. When workers struck against wage cuts, Legion posts were informed that the strikers were Communists trying to create national chaos so that the Reds could take over. Legionnaires were given baseball bats to break up strikes and civil rights demonstrations. The American Civil Liberties Union later reported, \"Of the forces most active in attacking civil rights, the American Legion led the field.\" The rank and file, however, had grown increasingly restless and impatient with the \"Royal Family\" that ran the Legion, especially after the Depression had left so many jobless. Veterans forced to sell apples on street corners were angered by a Legion leadership that opposed the bonus and government spending as inflationary. That was why so many thousands had bypassed the Legion to join the Bonus March on Washington. Adding up the facts, Butler was struck by a startling contradiction. MacGuire had claimed to speak for rank-and-file discontent with the Legion's bosses and professed to want to oust them, yet he was an agent for a top founder of the Legion who was obviously one of the powers behind the throne. MacGuire had revealed that the Legion still owed Murphy part of the $125,000 foundation money he had provided and had tacitly acknowledged that Murphy \"makes the kings.\" MacGuire obviously had to be lying in his claim that he-or Murphy-wanted to topple the present leadership.

On the Sunday morning he was in the city, the phone rang in his hotel room. It was MacGuire, who was in the lobby and asked to see him. Invited to Butler's room, MacGuire reminded the general that the time for the American Legion Convention was rapidly approaching. Was Butler finally ready to take a contingent of veterans to Chicago and make the gold-standard speech? Butler displayed increasing skepticism about the whole plan. In a gruff voice he challenged MacGuire's proposal as a bluff without any real money behind it. His visitor whipped a fat wallet out of his hip pocket, extracted a mass of thousand-dollar bills, and scattered them all over the bed. The eighteen thousand dollars, he said smugly, would amply cover the expenses of Butler and the veterans he led to Chicago. The gesture caught Butler by surprise; losing his temper, he accused MacGuire of trying to give him thousand-dollar bills whose number had been recorded, so that once he cashed them, the plotters would have proof of his complicity. MacGuire hastily assured him that he could have smaller denominations. In his vexation Butler snapped at the bond salesman to take back the money immediately, as he had no intention of getting involved in MacGuire's scheme. But then, as he regained control of his anger, he sought to make it appear that he was merely indignant that he was forced to deal with an emissary. He would negotiate, he told MacGuire firmly, only with principals. After some hesitation MacGuire agreed to have him contacted by Robert S. Clark, a banker who had inherited a large fortune from a founder of the Singer Sewing Machine Company. One week later Clark phoned Butler at his home. They arranged a meeting at the railroad station.

Butler drove him home for lunch, during which they exchanged memories of the Boxer Campaign. Afterward they adjourned to the spacious, glassed-in porch, and Clark got down to the business of his visit. He was going to the American Legion convention in a private car attached to the Pennsylvania Limited, he told Butler. He planned to have the train stop at Paoli to pick the general up, and they would continue on to Chicago together. A suite of rooms had already been reserved for Butler at the Palmer House. Clark would see to it, he told the general, that Butler was calling for a resolution demanding restoration of the gold standard. In discussing the speech, the millionaire was induced to reveal that the author was none other than John W. Davis, the 1924 Democratic candidate for President, and now chief attorney for J. P. Morgan and Company. Butler pointed out to Clark that the speech did not seem to have anything to do with the soldiers' bonus, which was presumably the purpose of his trip to Chicago. Shrugging, Clark blandly repeated MacGuire's assurance that those supporting the speech simply wanted to be sure that the bonus would be paid in gold-backed currency, not in worthless paper. Butler decided to draw blood and observe Clark's reaction. Sharp eyes honed on his visitor's face, he suggested that the speech had all the earmarks of big-business propaganda. The banker, taken aback, did not reply for a moment. He seemed to be debating with himself whether to deny the allegation or take Butler into his confidence. Then he astonished the general by a sudden burst of candor. He had a personal fortune of thirty million dollars, he revealed, and he was greatly worried about losing it to a Roosevelt inflation-runaway government spending unbridled by the need to back each paper dollar with gold. He was willing to spend fully half his fortune if it would save the other half. He was confident that if Butler made the speech at Chicago, the Legion would go on record as demanding a return to the gold standard. <![if !supportLists]>*16 *<![endif]>*The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> That would be an important step toward organizing the veterans of American to put pressure on Congress and the President for such a bill.

Why, Butler asked him curiously, did he think the President would allow himself to be pressured by such tactics? Clark expressed confidence that Roosevelt would yield because he belonged, after all, to the same social class that was solidly behind the gold standard. Once he had restored it, his fellow patricians would rally around him and defend his position against criticism. Butler was shocked by Clark's blatant snobbery, but even more by the millionaire's assumption that the wishes of economic royalists should-and would-prevail over the democratic processes of government. Once more his anger boiled over. In a voice that cracked with indignation, he exploded that he wanted nothing to do with a scheme to exploit veterans. Furthermore, he rasped, he intended to see to it that the veterans of the country were not used to undermine democracy but to defend it. Clark's face turned crimson. Chagrined, he reproached Butler for being stubborn and \"different,\" hinting that such things as the mortgage on Butler's house could be taken care of for him, and in a fully legal fashion. This crude attempt to bribe him was too much for the dumbfounded general. Bellowing his indignation, he roared an order at the millionaire to follow him into the living room. Clark meekly trailed him into a large hall resplendent with flags, banners, decorations, plaques, scrolls, citations, and other symbols of esteem that had been presented to the general during his long career in the Marines. The hall was flanked at both ends by huge canopies on tall poles-\"Blessings Umbrellas\" awarded by unanimous vote of the people of Chinese cities only to their greatest benefactors. Quivering with rage, Butler pointed out to Clark that most of the awards in the hall had been given to him by poor people all over the world, and he vowed that he would never betray their faith. Ordering Clark to inspect them until he understood the enormity of his mistake, Butler stormed off to his study, pacing back and forth in an effort to simmer down. In a few minutes a chastened Clark joined him and meekly *The Plot 17* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> asked permission to make a phone call to MacGuire at the Palmer House in Chicago.

MacGuire was reminded that had money enough to do the job alone and could \"send those telegrams.\" At the completion of the call, Clark then apologized so contritely that his host, mollified, forgave him. To lighten the strained atmosphere, then conversation now returned to the Boxer days until it was time to drive Clark to the station to catch a six o'clock train from Paoli. Butler felt ambivalent about having revealed his true feelings. On the one hand, it made him feel better to get them off his chest; tact and restraint and subterfuge were alien to his nature. On the other hand, it seemed hardly likely that after his explosion the plotters could possibly believe they could persuade or buy him. He would have no further opportunity to ferret out their plans. A few days later he carefully studied a newspaper account of the proceedings of the American Legion convention I Chicago. The story revealed that a huge flood of telegrams had poured into the convention urging delegates to endorse a return to the gold standard. A resolution to this effect had been proposed and carried. Butler felt mingled amusement and disgust. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **6** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> To the general's surprise MacGuire stopped off to see him, this time in a hired limousine, on the way back from the convention. The man said nothing about the contretemps with Clark, although Butler was certain he must have heard about it, and his manner was as buoyant and friendly as ever. He boasted to Butler about having put over the gold-standard resolution. *18 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The general pointed out wryly that no action had been taken at the convention to endorse the soldiers' bonus. MacGuire airily repeated his contention that there was no point in that until the country had sound currency. Shortly afterward MacGuire came to Newtown Square again and surprised the general with the news that a dinner had been arranged by Boston veterans in his honor. He was promised transportation in a private car, and, MacGuire beamed, Butler would be paid a thousand dollars to speak at the dinner-in favor of the gold standard, of course. Butler was dumbfounded at MacGuire's incredible persistence. Surely the indefatigable bond salesman had realized by this time that he was barking up the wrong tree!

But perhaps, the general speculated, MacGuire felt challenged to \"make the sale,\" in much the same manner that he undoubtedly sought to overcome the sales resistance of reluctant prospects for his bonds. And apparently MacGuire was convinced that only Smedley Butler had the prestige and popularity among veterans that his coterie needed to put over the scheme. Irked by the new attempt to bribe him, Butler rasped that he had never been paid a thousand dollars for any speech and had no intention of accepting such a sum to let words be put in his mouth. Chagrined but undiscouraged, MacGuire cheerfully promised to come up with some other more acceptable plan to utilize the general's talents as a public speaker. In October a former Marine running for office in Brooklyn, New York, begged Butler to make some campaign speeches in his behalf. Butler was hesitant because he was about to leave on a tour of the country for Veterans of Foreign Wars, speaking for the bonus and for membership in the V.F.W. as the best way to get it. But loyalty to the men who had served under him took him first to Pennsylvania Station. To his astonishment he was met by MacGuire. The bond salesman somehow knew where he was headed and asked to accompany him. Butler consented, more and more intrigued by the ubiquitous MacGuire who kept turning up everywhere he went like a bad penny. He found himself even growing perversely fond of MacGuire for his stubborn refusal to take No for *The Plot 19* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> an answer. In the Marines Butler had always had a soft spot for incorrigible rascals who brightened up monotonous routine by their unpredictable shenanigans. Besides, he was still curious to learn more about what the plotters in the gold scheme were up to. MacGuire now revealed a new plan to involve the general through his impending lecture tour for the V.F.W. Wasn't he, MacGuire probed, going to use the opportunity to speak out on public issues important to the veterans? Butler wasn't sure whether this was simply a shrewd guess or whether MacGuire somehow had eyes and ears all over the country. Butler declared that he believed that democracy was in danger from growing antidemocratic forces within the country and that he planned to appeal to the nation's veterans to unite against this threat. At the same time he wanted to alert them to the risk of being dragged into another war by the propaganda of organizations camouflaged with patriotic trappings. MacGuire looked thoughtful.

At the same time he wanted to alert them to the risk of being dragged into another war by the propaganda of organizations camouflaged with patriotic trappings. MacGuire looked thoughtful. Then he asserted that the group he represented really had the identical objectives. He urged Butler to let him go along on the tour. He would stay in the background, enlisting veterans in \"a great big superorganization to maintain our democracy.\" Butler lost no time in squelching that idea. He admitted that he couldn't keep MacGuire off any train he rode, but made it firmly clear that he would not be associated with the plans of MacGuire and his rich friends in any way. He softened the reprimand by saying that he did not want to hurt the feelings of a wounded veteran, but MacGuire would have to understand that he could not be used to aid money schemes. MacGuire said peevishly that he couldn't understand why Butler refused to be a businessman like himself. The general expressed blunt suspicions of MacGuire's real reasons for wanting to trail in the wake of this V.F.W. tour. MacGuire protested that he had no intention of doing anything subversive. Then he made the general a new offer. If Butler would merely insert in each of his V.F.W. speeches a short reference to the need for returning to the gold standard, in order to benefit veterans when a bonus bill was passed, MacGuire and his backers *20 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> would pay him $750 per speech-three times what the V.F.W. was paying him. Butler replied emphatically that he would refuse to abuse the veterans' trust in him even if the offer were for $100,000. Frustrated, MacGuire took his departure abruptly. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Soon afterward Butler began his swing around the country for the V.F.W. He was no longer bothered-for the moment--by the persistent attentions of Jerry MacGuire, who left for Europe on December 1, on a mission for his backers. MacGuire took his departure against the background of a steadily rising chorus of hatred for \"that cripple in the White House\" by big-business leaders. It was reflected in the anti--Roosevelt slant of both news and editorials in the business--oriented press. In the eyes of America's industrialists and bank-ers, the President, if not an actual secret Communist, was dedicated to destroying the nation's capitalist economy by the New Deal, which they labeled \"creeping socialism.\" Many believed that unless F.D.R. were stopped, he would soon take America down the same road that the Russians had traveled.

They were horrified by his recognition of the Soviet Union on November 16, 1933, seeing it as a sinister omen. They were equally appalled by his speech six weeks later promising that the United States would send no more armed forces to Latin America to protect private investments. Some business leaders envied their counterparts in Italy, who had financed Mussolini's rise to power. Il Duce's efficiency in \"making the trains run on time\" was highly lauded, along with the dictatorial control of labor unions by his corporate state. Thomas Lamont, a J. P. Morgan partner, praised the dictator for his methods of providing low-paying jobs, cutting the public debt, and ending inflation. \"We all count ourselves liberal, I suppose,\" Lamont told the Foreign Policy Association. \"Are we liberal enough to be willing for the Italian people to have the sort of government they apparently want?\" Butler, who had not known that MacGuire: had left for Eu-rope, received a postcard from him from the French Riviera, reporting only that he and his family were having a wonderful *The Plot **21* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> time. Another card came from MacGuire in June, 1934, this time from Berlin. Butler surmised that the bond salesman's long stay in Europe had to be on business, paid for by his boss or all his backers. But what kind of business? More shenanigans in connection with the gold standard? Continuing his tour for the V.F.W., Butler observed more and more storm signals flying in the United States as he traveled around the country. The nation was rapidly becoming polarized between the forces of Left and Right. Demagogues with apparently inexhaustible funds for propaganda and agitation led \"patriotic\" crusades against Communists, Jews, and \"Jewish bankers,\" who were alleged to be behind the New Deal. That June Roosevelt further inflamed big business by a whole new series of New Deal acts that crippled stock speculation, se up watchdog agencies over the telephone, telegraph, and radio industries, stopped farm foreclosures, prevented employers from hindering unionization and compelled them to accept collective bargaining. As an epidemic of turbulent strikes broke out, the orchestration of Roosevelt hatred in the nation's press rose to a fresh crescendo. To Herbert Hoover the New Deal represented \"class hatred . . . preached from the White House,\" \"despotism,\" and \"universal bankruptcy.\" Butler was intrigued by the July, 1934 issue of *Fortune, *the Luce magazine read by America's leading", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:20:5e7155ed21f2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13762, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "telephone, telegraph, and radio industries, stopped farm foreclosures, prevented employers from hindering unionization and compelled them to accept collective bargaining.

It was produced by Laird S. Goldsborough, foreign editor for *Time*, who asked *Fortune's *wealthy readers \"whether Fascism is achieving in a few years or decades such a conquest of the spirit of man as Christianity achieved only in ten centuries.\" He concluded, \"The good journalist must recognize in Fascism certain ancient virtues of the race, whether or not they happen to h momentarily fashionable in his own country. Among these are Discipline, Duty, Courage, Glory, Sacrifice.\" In that summer of 1934 it was not difficult to detect the acrid smell of incipient fascism in the corporate air. Smedley Butler large hawk nose was soon to detect more than a mere whiff of it. *22 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **7** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Resting at home after his exhausting V.F.W. tour, which had included emotionally draining visits to the casualties hidden away in eighteen veterans' hospitals, Butler received a phone call from a familiar voice. Jerry MacGuire insisted that lie had to see the general immediately because he had \"something of the utmost importance\" to impart. Butler and his wife had planned to drive into Philadelphia that afternoon, so, curiosity aroused, he agreed to meet Mac-Guire at the Bellevue Hotel. It was August 22, 1934, three days after a German plebescite had approved vesting sole executive power in Adolf Hitler as fhrer of Nazi Germany. Shortly before three o'clock Butler entered the empty hotel lobby, where he found the pudgy bond salesman waiting for him. MacGuire wrung his hand enthusiastically as though they were long-lost comrades from Butler's old 4th Battalion in Pan-ama. Leading the way to the rear of the lobby, MacGuire took him into the hotel's empty restaurant, which was not operating for the summer. They took a table in a secluded corner of the room, and Mac-Guire began describing how enjoyable his trip to Europe had been. Butler patiently waited for him to get down to business. He wondered, not without sympathy, whether it was the silver plate in MacGuire's head that made him so prolix. MacGuire finally asked whether the general planned to attend the forthcoming American Legion convention in Miami. Butler replied curtly that he did not. He felt irritated by MacGuire's arrogant assumption that the stale scheme of using the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:21:8c1d403576b0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13763, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "the room, and Mac-Guire began describing how enjoyable his trip to Europe had been.

MacGuire finally asked whether the general planned to attend the forthcoming American Legion convention in Miami. Butler replied curtly that he did not. He felt irritated by MacGuire's arrogant assumption that the stale scheme of using the Legion for his gold clique's propaganda was a matter of the \"utmost importance\" to Butler. MacGuire then insinuated that it was time to \"get the soldiers *The Plot **23* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> together.\" Butler agreed grimly, but his cryptic tone, he was sure, implied a considerably different purpose for organizing the veterans than MacGuire had in mind. MacGuire revealed what he had been up to on the Continent (hiring the previous seven months. His backers had sent him abroad to study the role that veterans' organizations had played in working for and bringing about dictatorships. In Italy MacGuire had found that Mussolini's real power stemmed from veterans organized in his Black Shirts; they had made him dic-tator and were the chief protectors of his regime. Beginning to suspect what MacGuire had in mind, Butler tried to seem matter-of-fact as he asked whether MacGuire thought Mussolini's form of government was a good example for American veterans to work toward. MacGuire didn't think so. His investigations on the Continent, he revealed, had convinced him that neither Mussolini nor Hitler, nor the kind of paramilitary organizations they had built, could be made attractive to the American veteran. But he *had *discovered an organiza-tion that could be, he revealed in elation. He had been in France during a national crisis brought about by nationwide wage slashes. Riots had erupted in Paris early in February, ending in the calling of a general strike that had paralyzed the country. Civil war had been averted only by the formation of a National Union ministry made up of all parties except Socialists, Communists, and Royalists. A key role in ending the crisis had been played by a right-wing veterans' organization called the Croix de Feu. It was a superorganization, MacGuire explained, an amalgamation of all other French veteran organizations, and was composed of officers and noncoms. The Croix de Feu had 500,000 members, and each was a leader of ten others, so that their voting strength amounted to 5,000,000. It occurred to Butler that if MacGuire's description was accurate, the Croix de Fen was an elitist outfit minus the democratic voice of the greatest majority of veterans-the buck privates, who were expected only to follow and obey, exactly as they had been ordered to do in wartime. MacGuire now told Butler that his group planned to build *24 The Plot to Seize the White House*", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:22:93f0e6faa133", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13764, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "was a leader of ten others, so that their voting strength amounted to 5,000,000.

MacGuire now told Butler that his group planned to build *24 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> an American version of the Croix de Fen. Asked its purpose, the fat man hesitated, then replied that it was intended to \"support\" the President. Butler asked wryly why Roosevelt should- need the support of 500,000 \"supersoldiers\" when he had the whole American people behind him. Looking petulant and impatient, MacGuire ignored the question, pointing out that the crux of the matter was Roosevelt's dilemma in not having enough money to finance the New Deal and the danger that he might disrupt the American system of finance to get it. MacGuire and his group were firmly determined that the President would not be allowed to do it. Despite MacGuire's exasperating circumlocution and the twists in his logic, a fresh pattern was becoming clear to Butler. Far from \"supporting\" Franklin Delano Roosevelt, MacGuire and the interests behind him were obviously planning to compel the President to yield to their demands about American finances. The American version of the Croix de Fen was intended to be a powerful paramilitary organization to enforce those demands. But when Butler pressed him on its purpose, MacGuire denied emphatically any intention to frighten the President. In fact, he explained, the whole idea was really to support and help Roosevelt, who was obviously overworked, by providing him with an \"Assistant President\" to take details of the office off his shoulders. It was quite constitutional, MacGuire insisted. The aide would be called a Secretary of General Affairs. According to MacGuire, the President himself had been grooming an aide for such a role-General Hugh S. Johnson, controversial administrator of the National Recovery Administration (N.R.A.). But, MacGuire confided, Johnson had been too loose-lipped to suit Roosevelt, and as a result was slated to be fired within three or four weeks. Pressed to explain how he acquired this information, MacGuire assured Butler that his group was close to the White House and had advance information on all such secret matters. Confused, Butler didn't know quite what to make of these oddly faceted revelations, but he was subsequently reminded of MacGuire's prediction when Johnson resigned in pique from the peace- administration soon afterward and began attacking Roosevelt *The Plot **25* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> and the New Deal in a syndicated column for the Scripps Howard press. Butler did not have to feign new interest in MacGuire's proposals; obviously much more was now involved", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:23:b040a30b94d0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13765, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "on all such secret matters.

Butler did not have to feign new interest in MacGuire's proposals; obviously much more was now involved than simply lobbying efforts for restoration of the gold standard. MacGuire, interpreting the general's absorption as an omen of cooperation, grew more candid about the plan of his group. They would work up public sympathy for the overburdened President, he explained eagerly, by a campaign explaining that Roosevelt's health was failing. The \"dumb\" public would accept the need to give him \"relief\" by having a Cabinet official take the chores of patronage and other routine worries of the office off his shoulders. Then the President's status would become like that of the President of France, a ceremonial figurehead, while the Secretary of General Affairs ran the country. Thus, at one stroke, the country would be rid of Roosevelt's misrule and would be put back on the gold standard. And now, MacGuire concluded triumphantly, how did the general feel about heading the new \"superorganization\" that would be the power behind bringing about these sweeping changes? Unable to contain himself any longer, Butler exploded that if MacGuire and his backers tried to mount a Fascist putsch, he would raise another army of 500,000 veterans to oppose them and the nation would be plunged into a new civil war.- Upset, MacGuire hastily assured the general that he and his group had no such intentions, but only sought to ease the burdens of the Presidency. Butler sarcastically expressed doubt that Roosevelt would appreciate their concern and turn his executive power over to their \"Secretary of General Affairs,\" while limiting himself to ceremonial functions. Besides, Butler pointed out tersely, any attempt to build a huge paramilitary army of half a million men would require enormous funds. MacGuire revealed that he now had $3 million in working funds and could get $300 million if it were needed. He added that in about a year Butler would be able to assemble 500,000 veterans, with the expectation that such a show of force would enable the movement to gain control of the government fully in just a few days. *26 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler was stunned.

Either MacGuire was a madman, psy-chotic, or fantastic liar, or what he was describing was a treason-ous plot to end democracy in the United States. He demanded to know who was going to put up all the money. MacGuire replied that Clark was good for $15 million and that the rest would come from the same people who had financed the \"Chicago propaganda\" about the gold standard at the Amer-ican Legion convention, and who were now behind the planned march on Washington. What plans, Butler wanted to know, did they have to take care of the veterans? The \"superorganization,\" MacGuire said, would pay privates ten dollars and captains thirty-five dollars a month for one year, and after that it would no longer be neces-sary. But how did the plotters plan to manage the legal aspects of setting up an Assistant President in the White House? Mac-Guire explained that the President would be induced to resign because of bad health. Vice-President Nance Garner, who didn't want to be President, would refuse the office. By the rule of succession, Secretary of State Cordell Hull was next in line, but he was far too old and could easily be set aside to make way for a Secretary of General Affairs to take Roosevelt's place as President. MacGuire again urged Butler to head the paramilitary army. The scale of the plot, as it was unfolding to him, took Butler's breath away. It occurred to him now that MacGuire's backers had been contemplating the creation of a Fascist veterans' army at the time MacGuire had first approached him to \"get the soldiers together\" behind their gold-standard campaign. That explained why MacGuire had wooed him so persistently, despite the general's obvious reluctance and outbursts of temper when patriotic indignation overcame his attempts to play along and learn what the plotters were up to. No false modesty prevented Butler from recognizing that he was perhaps the best-known, and certainly the most popular and charismatic, military figure in the United States. He also suited the plotters' plans perfectly because he was noted for a brilliant, hard-hitting style of oratory that, they undoubtedly reasoned, could be put to the service of demagoguery in the same spell- *The Plot **27* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> binding way Hitler and Mussolini had magnetized millions into following them. His rasping voice and fiery spirit captured audiences and held them hypnotized. His reputation for fearless honesty, for speaking his mind bluntly no matter whose corns he trod on, also made him the ideal candidate to sell the plotters' propaganda to the nation's veterans, if he could be persuaded to view their scheme as ultra-patriotic.

His reputation for fearless honesty, for speaking his mind bluntly no matter whose corns he trod on, also made him the ideal candidate to sell the plotters' propaganda to the nation's veterans, if he could be persuaded to view their scheme as ultra-patriotic. A combination of these reasons had unquestionably inspired Jerry MacGuire's insistent campaign to win him as the head of the putsch. It explained why MacGuire had refused to lake No for an answer, counting on his persuasive powers as a I bond salesman to break down Butler's sales resistance by camou-flaging the raw nature of the conspiracy, and tempting him into the plot with the biggest bribe ever offered to any American. The opportunity to become the first dictator of the United States. In a word, MacGuire was convinced that with Smedley Butler as their Man on the White Horse, the plotters would have their greatest chance of success. Increasingly uneasy and on guard, Butler now resolved to play along carefully until he had penetrated the full secret blueprint of the conspiracy. Keeping his voice cordial, he expressed interest in MacGuire's scheme, but exhibited enough doubts to induce him to reveal more in the effort to reassure Butler and win him over. Butler became convinced that if MacGuire was telling the truth, far richer and more powerful men than just Robert S. Clark had to be involved. Clark had told Butler that he had been willing to spend $15 million of his fortune in the plotters' schemes to restore the gold standard. But MacGuire had revealed that the people behind him could, and would if necessary, raise $300 million for the putsch. Butler determined to find out who they were. He demanded assurances from MacGuire that reputable and important people were really behind the plan to create an American Croix de Feu, pointing out that he could not afford to risk his reputation by getting involved in any second-rate adventure. Convinced that at last he was on the verge of winning the general's support, MacGuire eagerly sought to impress him with <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *28 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> the caliber of the influential movers and shakers of America who were involved in the plot. He revealed that in Paris he had made his headquarters at the offices of Morgan and Hodges. Butler tried to conceal his astonishment. There was only one Morgan in the financial world-J. P.

He revealed that in Paris he had made his headquarters at the offices of Morgan and Hodges. Butler tried to conceal his astonishment. There was only one Morgan in the financial world-J. P. Mor-gan and Company. MacGuire left no doubt in his mind that the nation's biggest financiers were, indeed, involved. According to the bond salesman, there had been a meeting in Paris to decide upon the selection of the man to head the superorganization. MacGuire and his group had held out for Butler, but the Morgan interests distrusted the general as \"too radical,\" preferring Douglas MacArthur instead. MacArthur's term as Chief of Staff expired in November, and the Morgan interests felt that if Roosevelt failed to reap-point him, he would be bitter enough to accept their offer. Butler observed that MacArthur would be likely to have difficulty in lining up veterans behind him, because his dispersion of the Bonus Army had made him highly unpopular. MacGuire indicated that the Morgan coterie's second choice was Hanford MacNider, an Iowa manufacturer who was a former commander of the American Legion. But MacGuire em-phasized that his own group was still insisting that Butler was the only military leader in the country capable of rallying the veterans behind him. The Morgan interests had acknowledged Butler's immense prestige and popularity, he revealed, but were apprehensive that as head of the paramilitary force Butler might lead it in the \"wrong direction.\" Butler observed that MacNider would have no more popular appeal than MacArthur because he had gone on record as op-posing the bonus. MacGuire then revealed that MacNider would be cued to change his stand, and would do so. Butler remem-bered this prediction when, three weeks later, MacNider sud-denly reversed his position and came out in support of the bonus. If Butler could not be persuaded to head the new super-organization, MacGuire said, the offer would definitely be made to MacArthur, whether or not the latter was reappointed Chief of Staff. He confided that there would be an administration fight over MacArthur's reappointment, but he would get it because he *The Plot **29* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> was the son-in-law of Philadelphian Edward T. Stotesbury, a Morgan partner. It was a bold prediction, since never before in American history had a Chief of Staff been allowed to succeed himself. Butler was all the more startled and impressed with MacGuire's sources of information when his prediction came true several months later. MacGuire also informed Butler that James Van Zandt, the national commander of the V.F.W., would be one of those asked to serve as a leader of the new superorganization. He would be approached by one of MacGuire's envoys at the forth-coming V.F.W. convention in Louisville, Kentucky. Butler asked when the new superorganization would surface and begin functioning, and what it would be called.

Butler asked when the new superorganization would surface and begin functioning, and what it would be called. MacGuire said that he didn't know the name of it yet but that the press would announce its formation in two or three weeks and that the roster of its founders would include some of the most im-portant men in America. One of them, MacGuire revealed, would be none other than former New York Governor Al Smith, who had lost the 1928 presidential race to Hoover as the candi-date of the Democratic party. Butler raised his bushy eyebrows in astonishment. It seemed incredible that the derby-hatted \"happy warrior,\" who had grown up in New York's East Side slums, could be involved in a Fascist plot backed by wealthy men. But he knew that Smith was now a business associate of the powerful Du Pont family, who had cultivated him through Du Pont official John J. Ras-kob, former chairman of the Democratic party. Under their in-fluence Smith had grown more and more politically conservative following his defeat, while still remaining a Democrat. Could it really be possible that a leading standard-bearer of the Democrats was committed to help overthrow the chief Demo-crat in the White House? In slight shock Butler asked MacGuire why Smith was involved. MacGuire replied that Smith had de-cided to break with the Roosevelt Administration and was preparing a public blast against it which would be published in about a month. Pressed for more information about the new superorganization, *30 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> MacGuire told Butler that it would be described publicly as a society \"to maintain the Constitution.\" Butler observed dryly that the Constitution did not seem to be in any grave danger, then he bluntly asked what MacGuire's stake was in the enter-prise. MacGuire shrugged that he was a businessman, and be-sides, he, his wife, and his children had enjoyed a long, expensive stay in Europe, courtesy of his backers.** Taking his leave, MacGuire said that he was going to Miami to agitate again for the gold standard, as well as to get the new paramilitary organization rolling. He promised to contact Butler again after the Legion convention. After he had gone, the bemused general was almost tempted to dismiss the whole plot as the product of a disordered imagi-nation-his or MacGuire's.

But a grim sense of foreboding told him that he was in the eye of a gathering storm. There were too many things that MacGuire had told him that rang true, and could not possibly have been invented. Even as Butler brooded over the affair and wondered what to do about it, another of MacGuire's uncannily accurate predictions ma-terialized two weeks after their talk. In September, 1934, the press announced the formation of a new organization, the American Liberty League, by discontented captains of industry and finance. They announced their objec-tives as \"to combat radicalism, to teach the necessity of respect for the rights of persons and property, and generally to foster free private enterprise.\" Denouncing the New Deal, they attacked Roosevelt for \"fomenting class hatred\" by using such terms as \"unscrupulous money changers,\" \"economic royalists,\" and \"the privileged princes of these new economic dynasties.\" *The Plot **31* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler's eyes widened when he read that the treasurer of the American Liberty League was none other than MacGuire's own boss, Grayson M.-P. Murphy, and one of its financiers was Robert S. Clark. Heading and directing the organization were Du Pont and J. P. Morgan and Company men. Morgan attorney John W. Davis was a member of the National Executive Com-mittee-the same Davis that Clark had identified as author of the gold-standard speech MacGuire had tried to get Butler to make to the American Legion convention in Chicago. Heavy contributors to the American Liberty League included the Pitcairn family (Pittsburgh Plate Glass), Andrew W. Mellon Associates, Rockefeller Associates, E. F. Hutton Associates, Wil-liam S. Knudsen (General Motors), and the Pew family (Sun Oil Associates). J. Howard Pew, longtime friend and supporter of Robert Welch, who later founded the John Birch Society, was- a generous patron, along with other members of the Pew family, of extremist right-wing causes. Other directors of the league included A1 Smith and John J. Raskob. Two organizations affiliated with the league were openly Fascist and antilabor. One was the Sentinels of the Republic, financed chiefly by the Pitcairn family and J. Howard Pew. Its members labeled the New Deal \"Jewish Communism\" and in-sisted \"the old line of Americans of $1,200 a year want a Hitler.\" The other was the Southern Committee to Uphold the Consti-tution, which the conservative Baltimore Sun described as \"a hybrid organization financed by northern money, but playing on the Ku Klux Klan prejudices of the south.\" Its sponsor, John H. Kirby, collaborated in anti-Semitic drives against the New Deal with the Reverend Gerald L. K.

Kirby, collaborated in anti-Semitic drives against the New Deal with the Reverend Gerald L. K. Smith, leader of the first Silver Shirt squad of American storm troopers. \"The brood of anti-New Deal organizations spawned by the Liberty League,\" the New York *Post *subsequently charged, \"are in turn spawning Fascism.\" Butler was stunned by this fulfillment of MacGuire's predic-tion. As he later testified, just at the time MacGuire had said it would, the American Liberty League had appeared and was all that MacGuire had said it would be. And it was obviously no *32 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> coincidence that Grayson M.-P. Murphy, Robert S. Clark, and the Morgan interests were deeply involved. Even yet another of MacGuire's predictions came true a fortnight later, when A1 Smith published a scathing attack on the New Deal in the *New Outlook, *breaking publicly with the President over economic policies. If Butler had had any lingering doubts about the authenticity of MacGuire's claim to have inside knowledge of what American big-business leaders were up to, the appearance of the American Liberty League on schedule, and A1 Smith's break with the White House, convinced him that MacGuire's revelations of a plot to seize the White House were no crackpot's fantasy. MacGuire had called the shots every time. Butler was now genuinely alarmed. For the first time it dawned upon him that if the American Liberty League was, indeed, the \"superorganization\" behind the plot that it seemed to be, the country's freedom was in genuine peril. Such money and power as the men behind the League possessed could easily mobilize a thinly disguised Fascist army from the ranks of jobless, embittered veterans and do what Mussolini had done in Italy with the financial support of the Italian plutocracy. Getting in touch with Van Zandt, Butler told the V.F.W. commander that he had been approached to lead a coup as head of a veterans' army. He warned that the conspirators intended to try to involve Van Zandt, too, at the V.F.W, convention in Louisville. Thanking him for the warning, Van Zandt assured Butler that he would have nothing to do with the plotters. Butler was tempted to leave for Washington immediately to warn the President or his advisers. He now knew enough to expose the whole plot.

But he was pragmatist enough to realize that on his unsupported word, without the slightest shred of evidence, he was likely to be greeted with polite skepticism, if not ridicule. Heads would shake. Poor Smedley Butler. How sad-a fine, brave Marine general like that, losing touch with reality. Too many campaigns, too many tropical fevers. At best they might believe that MacGuire had, indeed, told him all those fantastic things, but then MacGuire, obviously, *The Plot **33* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> had to be some kind of psychotic nut. And Butler would have to be an idiot to have taken him seriously, to have believed that many of the nation's greatest leaders of the business and fi-nancial world would get involved in a conspiracy to depose the President and take over the White House! MacGuire, of course, would deny everything. So would Robert S. Clark. So would everyone connected with the American Liberty League-if this was, indeed, the superorganization Mac-Guire had revealed was behind the plot. The enemies Butler had made among the military brass during his colorful career would help the press ridicule his revelation. \"Old Gimlet Eye,\" they would scoff, \"is at it again-stirring up a storm, making headlines. Worst publicity hound that ever wore a uniform!\" But Smedley Butler had never in his life backed off from his duty as he saw it. Convinced that the democracy he cherished was in genuine danger, he steeled himself for the ordeal of public mockery and humiliating attacks that he knew would follow his exposure of the conspiracy. He was enough of an expert tactician, however, to know that he couldn't win his battle without supporting troops. He would need corroborative testimony by someone whose word, when combined with his own, would have to be respected and force a full-scale investiga-tion. Butler confided in Tom O'Neil, city editor of the Philadelphia *Record. *Observing that the whole affair smacked of outright treason to him, he asked O'Neil to assign his star reporter to dig into the story. O'Neil agreed, and reporter Paul Comly French, whose news features also appeared in the New York *Post, *was instructed to seek confirmation of the plot. Butler knew and respected French, who had done an intelligent and honest job of covering his fight against crime and corruption in Philadelphia ten years earlier.

Even if he could somehow confirm the existence of the plot and identify the conspirators, he and the general were bound to meet with incredulity when they sought to expose the blueprint for treason and the traitors. Much would depend upon establishing and documenting the credibility of Smedley Butler, the chief witness. If the general's career showed him to be given to gross exaggeration or chronic lying, or to be an officer of dubious character whose word could not be trusted, then his sworn testimony against those he charged with treason would be held worthless. If, on the other hand, an examination of his life and career proved that he was a man of incorruptible character, integrity, and patriotism, then his testimony would have to be given the gravest consideration, especially when supported and corrobo-rated by the findings of French's investigation. Whatever the outcome, the reporter knew that the denoue-ment would be a stormy one. To Butler's enemies he was a highly controversial, unorthodox fighting man whose irrepressible temper and tongue kept him in the headlines. To his friends he was a patriotic war hero with strong convictions about democ-racy and a deserved reputation for bluntly speaking out the truth, regardless of consequences. What kind of man, actually, was the Marine general who was accusing many of America's leading financiers and indus-trialists of seeking him as the indispensable man for their Fascist plot to seize the White House? <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> PART TWO **<![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]>** **The Indispensable Man** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **1** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Smedley Darlington Butler was born July 30, 1881, in West Chester, Pennsylvania, the first of three sons.

His pa-ternal lineage traced back to Noble Butler, who came to America shortly after William Penn. His father, Thomas S. Butler, was a bluntly outspoken judge who spent thirty-two years in Congress, where he wielded great influence as chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee. Once when he had advocated a large Navy, a close Quaker friend reproached him, \"Thee is a fine Friend!\" \"Thee,\" the fine Friend snorted, \"is a damn fool!\" The Quaker archaisms *thee, thy, *and *thine *were used only within the family and sometimes to intimate friends. The Quakerism of both Thomas Butler and his son Smedley was of that order of earlier hot-tempered Quakers who belabored each other with wagon tongues, while pausing between the hearty blows they exchanged to invoke divine forgiveness. Smedley picked up some of his father's uninhibited language as early as age five, inviting maternal chastisement until his father went to his defense by roaring, \"I don't want a son who doesn't know how to use an honest *damn *now and then!\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *37* *38 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Reared in upper-class comfort with a politically prominent father, grandfather, and uncles, it was taken for granted that he was marked for prominence. Subtle pressures were exerted by four maiden aunts who adored and fussed over their first nephew, keeping him in golden curls and dressing him in a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit. Jeering peers who mistook the clothes for the boy found his fistwork as fancy as his finery. Stirred by tales of both his grandfathers in the Union Army, he developed a passionate love for tin soldiers, toy cannon, and books with pictures of battles. His mother, Maud Darlington Butler, sought to inculcate peaceful doctrines in her son by taking him to Hicksite Quaker meeting twice a week and send-ing him to the Friends' grade school in West Chester. However, his early fascination with things martial persisted. When he was twelve, he joined a West Chester branch of the Boys' Brigade, a preparedness youth movement that went in for military drills.

At Haverford Preparatory School near Philadelphia, a popular choice of old Quaker families, he joined both the baseball and the football teams. Although he was younger and lighter than his teammates, his fighting spirit, qualities of leadership, candor, and fair dealing made him highly popular and won him the captaincy of both teams. He was only a little over sixteen and a half on February 15, 1898, when the U.S. battleship *Maine *blew up in Havana Harbor at 9:40 P.M. Americans began chanting, \"Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain,\" around public bonfires, and volunteer com-panies marched happily off to war singing, \"We'll Hang General Weyler to a Sour Apple Tree.\" Young Butler found himself swept up by the excitement. Struggling with math and English seemed a hopelessly insipid pursuit, with the newspapers full of blazing accounts of the ter-rible brutality of Spanish masters of the little Caribbean island they had enslaved. Smedley yearned to join the noble crusade to liberate Cuba in the company of the fine fellows he saw march-ing off from West Chester daily. Fearful of revealing his aspirations to his parents, he attempted <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The Indispensable Man 39 <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> a fait accompli by seeking to enlist with the 6th Pennsylvania Volunteers in his hometown. Rejected as under age, he braced himself to corner his father in the sunlit library of their house on Miner Street one morning. \"Father,\" he said, \"I want to enlist. Thee could get me into the Navy, as an apprentice, if necessary.\" Thomas Butler tugged at his thick handlebar moustache with stubby fingers, regarding his slender son skeptically. \"I have known of thy desire to go to war. But thee is too young.\" Smedley's jaw jutted. \"If thee won't help me, I'll run away and join the general army!\" \"If thee does, it will avail thee nothing,\" his father said quietly. \"I will see that they discharge thee.\" One night the crestfallen youth overheard his father tell his mother privately that Congress had authorized an increase of the Marine Corps by two thousand men and twenty-four second lieutenants for the duration of the war. \"The Marine Corps is a finely trained body of men,\" his father said. \"Too bad Smedley is so young. He seems determined to go.\" A new idea took root.

Smedley had seen a Marine in West Chester-a young god in a magnificent uniform of dark blue coat decorated with many shiny buttons, and light blue trousers with scarlet stripes running down the seams. Wouldn't a fellow cut a fine figure in *that! *That night he fell asleep with visions of himself as a faultlessly tailored Marine charging up a Cuban hill, his Mamluk hilt sword pointed forward, inspiring the men behind him in a victorious charge. At breakfast, heart pounding, he gave his mother an ultimatum. \"I'm going to be a Marine. If thee doesn't come with me and give me thy permission, I'll hire a man to say he is my father. And I'll run away and enlist in some faraway regiment where I'm not known!\" His mother reluctantly agreed to accompany him by train to Marine Corps headquarters in Washington, without telling his father. In the competitive examination for Marine lieutenants he ranked second among two hundred applicants. Joyfully he heard the gates of childhood close behind him; ahead beckoned the exciting world of manhood and adventure. But he swallowed <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *40 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> hard when he had to face his father and admit that he had won acceptance in the Marine Corps by adding two years to his age. \"Well,\" his father sighed. \"if thee is determined to go, thee shall go. But don't add another year to thy age, my son. Thy mother and I weren't married until 1879!\" He could scarcely contain his pride when his lean, wiry frame was encased in a crisp new uniform. Only average in height with sloping shoulders, one higher than the other, the new second lieutenant nevertheless managed to look properly fierce because of a long, large nose and a pair of blazing, protruding eyes that gave him the bold look of a young adventurer. Huge-handed, he had a husky voice that quickly developed into a leatherneck growl, and a lively sense of humor that appealed to his fellow Marines. His first glimpse of war came the day he arrived at Santiago, Cuba, on July 1, 1898, past a Spanish cruiser still burning in the harbor. Rigid with excitement, he boarded another ship that took him to Guantanamo Bay, where he joined the Marine Bat-talion of the North Atlantic Squadron. Next day Mancil C.

He flung himself prone and hugged the earth, his heart beating wildly. \"What in hell is the matter?\" Goodrell demanded. \"That was a ... bullet.\" \"Well, what if it was? A little excitement now and then keeps you from going stale.\" Soldiering under Goodrell, who had had no formal military education, Butler became infused with the spirit of the Corps. He relished the bonds of comradeship, the fierce loyalties, the cool courage, the pride in being a Marine that united men who considered themselves a fighting elite. The officers were all professional soldiers who chewed tobacco, drank raw whiskey, cursed a blue streak, drilled the tails off their troops in garrison, and were experts on the Lee straightpull 6-mm. rifle, Gatling gun, and Hotchkiss revolving cannon. Thoroughly unorthodox, wild in their humor, they were fierce * * The Indispensable Man 41 <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> warriors who set an example for their men in battle by often fighting on after they were wounded. In young Butler's eyes they were heroes all. He was enormously proud of his first two decorations-the Spanish and West Indian Campaign medals. But he was even prouder simply of being a full-fledged leatherneck who had shared the bonds of a campaign with the Marines of Guan-tanamo. By the time his battalion returned home, he and two other young Marine officers-John A. Lejuene and Buck Neville- had become an inseparable trio. Lejuene and Neville were each destined to rise to the rank of commandant of the Marine Corps. \"The Spanish-American War was a high point in my life when I went to it at the age of sixteen,\" Butler later reminisced wryly, \"to defend my home in Pennsylvania against the Spaniards in Cuba.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **2** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Commissioned a first lieutenant on April 8, 1899, Butler left four days later with a battalion of three hundred Marines bound for the Philippines.

Stumbling onto concealed trenches and rifle pits, his company met with a blanket of heavy fire. The men went prone, waiting for his orders. Desperation overcoming fright, Butler sprang to his feet, waving the company to charge and open fire. The battle drove the insurgents back from the trench. He pursued them through waist-high rice paddies until they turned and fled. He grew increasingly confident of his ability to survive after <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *42 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> several more skirmishes had driven the Aguinaldo forces north to mountain strongholds. His pride in the Corps kept growing. When a Japanese tattoist turned up in the Navy yard at Cavite, he had an enormous Marine Corps emblem tattoed across his chest. Infection from the tattoist's needle brought him down with a raging fever. In June, 1900, he was ordered to a new Asian outpost of trouble under Major Littleton Tazewell Waller, a crusty bantam of a man with a fierce moustache. The Marines sailed for China to rescue the American legation, which had been imperiled by the Boxer uprising. The expedition numbered only a hundred Marines, but by the time they arrived in China, the situation had reached crisis proportions. All of North China was now up in arms against the foreign powers who had carved the country into colonial spheres of influence. The Chinese bitterly resented the alien flags that flew over the imperialist compounds and the foreign ships that dom-inated Chinese ports, flooding the country with Western goods. Most infuriating of all were entrance signs the foreign legations had posted at their luxurious clubs: \"Forbidden to dogs and Chinese.\" Eventually the allied nations had to send over 100,000 troops to protect their nationals. The eighteen-year-old Butler, who had no understanding of the political causes of the Boxer Rebellion, saw his role simply as that of a Marine doing his duty to protect American citizens on foreign soil. Waller received word that the legation com-pound at Tientsin, twenty-five miles inland, was in desperate straits. A small defending force of allied soldiers was trying to hold off fifty thousand attacking Boxers. Waller, Butler, and their ninety-eight men were joined by a column of four hundred Russians also en route to relieve the siege. At a gray mud village later known as Boxertown, bursts of heavy fire suddenly exploded from trenches on all sides. The Russians, who received the brunt of it, fell back swiftly through the lines of the Marines.

The Russians, who received the brunt of it, fell back swiftly through the lines of the Marines. Waller's men flattened on the plain, returning the fire. Three Marines were killed, nine wounded. Ordered to with-draw, Butler counted noses and found a private named Carter * * The Indispensable Man 43 <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> missing. With a lieutenant named Harding and four privates, he ran a gauntlet of fire to search for him. Locating Carter in a ditch, Butler found that his leg had been broken. While the four privates fought off Boxers, Butler and Harding removed their shirts to bandage Carter's legs together, carrying him off between them. It took them an excruciating four hours to fight seven miles through the whine of persistent bullets to catch up with the company. Tripped several times by his sword, Butler unbuckled it in exasperation and flung it away. During the weary retreat of the Marines, Butler constantly fought off an urge to collapse and give himself over to sleep or death, without caring too much which. Suddenly the crack of a bullet was followed by a dull sound right next to him. Startled, he looked up to see a stream of blood flowing down the face of a grizzled sergeant. The veteran Marine made no sound, just scowled, pulled his hat over the wound, and continued the pace of the march. It was an image of tough Marine courage that engraved itself on Butler's memory. Stumbling on through a fierce North China dust storm with a raging toothache, his heels rubbed raw by marches that began at 2:30 A.M., famished by hunger, Butler was so miserable that Boxer gunfire seemed the mildest of his torments. The Marines finally joined forces with a newly arrived column of three thousand international troops and fought their way through to the Tientsin compound. Routing a Chinese cohort, they broke the siege as overjoyed women and children rushed out to hug their rescuers. The international troops defending the Tientsin compound were soon reinforced by an allied army of seven thousand men. On July 13, 1900, they attacked the native walled city of Tient-sin to rout the Boxers from their stronghold.

Leading his company through a hail of Chinese shells and snipers' bullets, he climbed over the mud wall only to find him-self dropping into a moat. The Chinese had flooded the paddies between the walls. He and his men splashed through the morass, <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *44 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> slipping and lurching in waist-high muck as they sought to fire their weapons. When they approached the inner wall gate, thousands of Chinese on the wall poured down a withering fire, forcing Butler to order a retreat. A tall private next to him named Partridge was hit and seri-ously wounded. Butler and two Marines carried him above water level through the rain of bullets splashing around them. A burning sensation in his right thigh puzzled Butler momen-tarily until he realized he had been shot. Ignoring his wound, he continued to help carry Partridge until they reached some high ground. There he applied first aid to the private's wounds, then limped off in search of a medic for him. By the time he found a Marine doctor, blood was pouring copiously out of his own wound. He protested volubly when the doctor, who outranked him, insisted on treating him first. By the time he got the doctor back to Partridge, the private was dead. Grieved and angry, he refused to leave when the doctor ordered him to the rear with the other wounded. His first lieutenant, Henry Leonard, and a sergeant insisted on dragging him off to the other side of the mud wall. Here he was joined by a Marine lieutenant who had been wounded in the left leg. Tying their disabled legs together, they hobbled three-legged back to the nearest first-aid station. When they had been treated and bandaged, they helped dress the wounds of hundreds of casualties now pouring in. Recommending Butler for promotion, Major Waller declared, \"I have before mentioned the fine qualities of Mr. Butler in control of men, courage, and excellent example in his own per-son of all the qualities most admirable in a soldier.\" On July *23, *1900, a week before he turned nineteen, Butler was made captain while recuperating in the hospital.

They were part of a large, colorful international army that included French Zouaves in red and blue, Italian Bersaglieri with plumed helmets, Royal Welsh Fusiliers with ribbons down their napes, Bengal cavalry on Arab stallions, turbaned Sikhs, Germans in pointed helmets, and flamboyantly uniformed troops of half a dozen other coun-tries. Butler's leg wound throbbed painfully, and he suffered spells of sickness from polluted water and food. His stomach was not soothed by sights en route to Peking: two Japanese soldiers, eyes and tongues cut out, nailed to a door; an old Chinese mandarin pinned to his bed by a huge sword; village streets strewn with fly-covered corpses, their skulls smashed in. The Boxers were just as ruthless with Chinese \"traitors\" as with luck-less foreigners. In one village a Chinese family, frightened by the allied army's approach, jumped into a canal and tried to drown them-selves. Butler and his men rescued them and pinioned them firmly while an interpreter explained that the troops would not harm them. After some animated conversation, the interpreter told him, \"Captain, these people say that since you have saved their lives, you are responsible for them as guardians and must now take care of them.\" \"Good-bye!\" yelled Butler, racing off with his men. Reaching the outskirts of Peking, they ran into blistering fire from the top of the city's stone and mud wall. They joined a combined five-thousand-man American and British force hastily digging a trench before the city. One British private left the trench in an attempt to wipe out a Chinese strongpoint at one gate but was hit between the trench and wall. Butler's friend, Henry Leonard, sped out to rescue him but was shot and badly wounded. Clearing the trench at a bound, Butler raced through fire to reach him, but Leonard proved able to scramble back on his own, so Butler lifted the wounded Tommy on his back instead and staggered back to the trench with him.

Whirling and falling, he lost consciousness briefly. When he recovered, he heard one Marine say he'd been shot through the heart. He tried to speak but found he had no breath to vocalize. His shirt was torn open, and it was discovered that a bullet had struck the second button of his military blouse, flattening it and driving it into his chest. The button had gouged a hole in the eagle of the Marine Corps emblem he had had tattooed on his chest in the Philippines. The wound was not serious, although for weeks afterward his bruised chest ached painfully, and he spat blood when he coughed. He was later congratulated by General A. R. R. Dorward, commanding general of the British contingent, who called But-ler's rescue of the wounded Tommy the bravest act he had ever seen on the battlefield and recommended him for the Victoria Cross. But the American Government in those days did not permit an American officer to accept foreign decorations of any kind. By August 14 Peking was in the hands of the allies, and the Boxer Rebellion was crushed. Butler's company of Marines, the longest in China, had suffered the greatest casualties in the fighting-twenty-six killed or wounded.

The town of West Chester gave him a hero's reception at-tended by the Secretary of the Navy and the commandant of the Marine Corps. It was a heady tribute for a boy not yet twenty. His parents now suggested that since his enlistment period was about up, and he had done more than his duty in serving his country, he might want to return to his Quaker heritage in civilian life. As a boy he had sometimes talked of becoming a civil engineer. Why not go to college and study for it? He found himself powerless to explain why he felt bound to the blue brotherhood; to make his parents understand his deep pride in the Corps, the warm bonds of solidarity that united Marines, the enjoyable excitement of danger, the honor of being foremost in defense of the nation and its citizens. Any other way of life seemed pale and drab by comparison. \"I'm reenlisting,\" he told them. On October 31, 1902, he was put in command of a company of 101 men and shipped to the island of Culebra twenty miles east of Puerto Rico. There was trouble in Panama, and Butler's com-pany was part of two battalions being stationed in reserve on Culebra while the fleet, under Admiral George Dewey, con-ducted maneuvers offshore. Living on field rations and fighting scorpions, centipedes, and tarantulas, the Marines built docks and other naval constructions. In the midst of their perspiring labors Squadron Admiral Joe Coghlan sent 12,5 Navy gunnery experts ashore to challenge Butler and his men to a race in dragging five-inch coastal guns up four-hundred-foot hills. Admiral Dewey sent word that a victory shot was to be fired from the first gun mounted. Stripped to the waist, Butler worked like a madman along-side his men to prove the superiority of leathernecks over blue-jackets. At sunrise a jubilant Butler ordered his men to fire a victory shot. The shell sailed over Admiral Dewey's flagship, landing a mile beyond. Instead of congratulating the winners, <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *48 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> the furious hero of Manila Bay sent Butler an icy reprimand for \"reckless firing.\" Their reward was an order to dig a canal.

And the Navy insisted that they had to work under the broiling tropic sun in full uniform with leggings. Unwilling to inflict any ordeal upon his men that he was not willing to endure himself, Butler wielded a shovel in the ditch beside them. Soon their ranks began to be decimated by tropical fever. A Marine major asked the Navy flagship, which had an ice machine aboard, for ice to bring down their fevers. His re-quest scornfully refused, he returned to camp to find Butler un-conscious. The major ordered him rowed immediately across the bay to a temporary Navy hospital. Indignant at the Navy's treatment, the major wrote to Butler's father in Washington to tell him what was happening at Culebra. Thomas Butler let out an angry roar in the House Naval Affairs Committee. Secretary of the Navy William H. Moody sent swift orders to Admiral Dewey that no more Americans were to be used as forced labor on the miserable canal. The Navy brass fumed, convinced that it had been Captain Smedley Butler who had complained to his father. As soon as he was off the sick list, Admiral Coghlan put him in charge of sixty-five natives hired to finish the canal. Two weeks later, the canal finished, he col-lapsed with a relapse of tropical fever. While Butler was in the hospital, a belated award of the Philippine Campaign Medal made him think about his old bat-talion under Major Waller, who was now back in the Philippines under Army General Adna Chaffee fighting rebels. He was stunned when an uproar in the American press compelled Wal-ler's court-martial for killing ten Filipino native carriers who had balked at orders during a march. Waller had been acquitted, however, on grounds that he had merely been obeying \"kill and burn\" orders relayed from General Chaffee. Butler was distressed by the news. Having served under both Waller and Chaffee, he admired them as courageous officers whose code called for protecting, first, American civilians wher- <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The Indispensable Man 49 <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> ever they might be; then the men under them; then their comrades-in-arms. From his own experience in the Philippines and China, Butler guessed that Waller had suspected the car-riers of being rebels. It was impossible to tell apart insurrec-tionists and noncombatant natives. The twenty-one-year-old Marine captain was not yet troubled by doubts as to what the Marines were ordered to do in the service of their country, or why.

He shared the easy condescen-sion of most Marines of that swashbuckling era toward people of underdeveloped countries as naive natives who had to be patronized, directed, and protected by Americans. The Marines were an elite gendarmerie entrusted with the duty of maintaining international law and order on behalf of civilization. A Marine's only concern was carrying out his orders as expertly as possible, without questions. It was only later, as he gradually came to know native peoples better and learned to admire their age-old customs and traditions, that Smedley Butler felt impelled to question his role as an instrument of American foreign policy. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **4** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> When a revolution broke out in Honduras early in 1903, Butler's battalion was dispatched there aboard an old banana freighter, the *Panther, *as part of a squadron under Admiral Coghlan. On the second day out the ship's commander summoned all hands to the quarterdeck to complain that someone had been using profane language near his cabin. \"I know the guilty party cannot be one of these fine men,\" he declared, indicating the sailors, \"therefore it must have been one of these men enlisted from the slums of our big cities.\" Pointing to the Marines, he restricted their use of the deck. Butler restrained an impulse to <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *50 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> apply the tip of his boot to the seat of the commander's naval rectitude. \"Then and there,\" he recalled later, \"I made up my mind that I would always protect Marines from the hounding to which they were subjected by some of the naval officers.\" At the end of his duty in Culebra, his father had reproached him for not having kept him better informed as to what was going on in America's naval outposts. Now Butler did not hesi-tate to write his father field reports in the Plain Language, sometimes asking him to use his influence on the House Naval Affairs Committee on behalf of the Marine Corps.

After - seeing some duty in Panama, for which he won an Expeditionary Medal, he returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1905. A pretty Georgia-born girl named Ethel Conway Peters, some of whose family had been prominent in the affairs of Philadelphia since Colonial times, helped him make good use of his leave time. They were married on June 3o at Bay Head, New Jersey, in a military wedding. Commented the Philadelphia *Inquirer: *\"Cupid and Mars in a wedding by the sea at high noon today.\" Their honeymoon was a world trip made possible by orders assigning him to the Philippines as captain of Company E, Second Regiment. Arriving with his bride by way of Europe, India, and Singapore, he was stationed at a small naval base on Subic Bay, sixty miles north of Manila. Here, in November, 1906, his daughter Ethel was born. Butler's popularity led to her adoption by the regiment. Giving a dinner for the enlisted men, he carried her to the table on a pillow as guest of honor. Not surprisingly, she grew up a \"Marine brat\" and years later married a Marine lieutenant, John Wehle. With a detachment of fifty men Butler spent several months *The Indispensable Man 51* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> dragging six-inch guns up mountaintops to defend Subic Bay against possible attack by Japan, an attack that did not material-ize for another thirty-six years. He and his men lived ruggedly on hardtack, hash, and coffee. A Navy supply tug, which never brought them supplies or rations, continued to ignore them even when they signaled that they had run out of hash. Butler decided to sail to the Navy supply base across the bay. With two volunteers he set out in a native outrigger. A typhoon blew up suddenly behind them, ripping away their sail and snapping their paddles. For five hours they fought to keep from drowning until the storm finally blew the seafaring trio ashore at the supply base. Soaked and chilled, Butler lost no time in arranging to have the supply tug carry beef and vegetables back to his men. The hungry Marines cheered his return on the tug. The camp dock had been swept away by the typhoon, so they splashed out into the bay to form a chain that passed the food they splashed from tug to shore.

Butler was a hero to his men, but not to the Navy brass who heard about his bypass of official channels. A Navy board of medical survey decided that his taking the outrigger into a typhoon, and use of the tug to take supplies hack to his men, indicated signs of an \"impending nervous breakdown.\" He was ordered home. In October, 1908, despite the dim view of him taken by the Navy brass, be was promoted to the rank of major. His fitness reports submitted by his commanding officers could not be ig-nored; all unanimously rated him \"outstanding,\" commending him as a strict disciplinarian impatient of inefficiency, laziness, or cowardice. His contempt for red tape and his personal bravery were acknowledged to have made him one of the most popular and successful officials in the Corps. His units were distinguished by a high esprit de corps because of his devotion to his men, his concern for their welfare and pride in their accomplish-ments, and his democratic insistence upon rolling up his sleeves to work beside them physically. Soon after his second child, Smedley, Jr., was born, July 12, 1909, Butler was put in charge of the 4th Battalion, 1st Marine <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *52 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Regiment, and sent to Panama. Although he was stationed on the Isthmus for four years until the Panama Canal was opened, he was temporarily detached three times to command expedi-tions into strife-torn Nicaragua. Washington had decided to intervene openly in the internal affairs of that Central American country. Butler's orders each time were \"to protect American lives and property.\" He soon realized that this general order involved propping up Nicaraguan governments or factions that were favored in Washington for business reasons. The Conservative party was seeking to drive the Liberals out of power. Their revolt was led by Adolfo Diaz, secretary -treasurer of the La Luz Mining Company, in which Secretary of State Philander C. Knox was said to own stock. The Liberal Government had smashed Diaz's forces and pinned 350 survivors at Bluefields, where Butler had been sent with the 4th Battalion.

The Liberal Government had smashed Diaz's forces and pinned 350 survivors at Bluefields, where Butler had been sent with the 4th Battalion. The American Consul at Bluefields made it clear to Butler that the State Department wanted Diaz to prevail. Two Liberal generals prepared to take Bluefields with fifteen thousand well-armed men. Before the shooting could start, Butler sent them a message. The Marines were there only as neutrals protecting American residents, he told the attackers. The govern-ment forces could take the town but must leave their guns out-side the city so that no Americans were accidentally shot. Marine guards would be posted outside the city to collect all weapons from Nicaraguans entering it. How could they take the town, the dismayed generals pro-tested, without arms? And why weren't Diaz's forces inside the town also being disarmed? Butler thought fast. \"There is no danger of the defenders killing American citizens, because they will be shooting *outward,\" *he replied blandly, \"but your soldiers would be firing *toward us.\"* The ploy compelled the government forces to retract, giving the Conservative forces time to regroup and mount a counter-attack that soon overthrew the Liberals. Juan Estrada became the new President, with Diaz as Vice-President. Butler felt somewhat uneasy about the role the Marines had been compelled to play in this coup, especially since he knew *The Indispensable Man 53* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> that the American people had no idea of how Secretary of State Knox was using the armed forces in Central America, or why. But as a Marine officer he did not feel responsible for foreign policy. He saw his role simply as implementing that policy by dutifully carrying out his country's orders as he was sworn to do. Before the Marines returned to Panama, he was confronted by a host of Bluefields shopkeepers who presented him with unpaid bills signed by members of his battalion, including George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Yankee Doodle. From the handwriting Butler deciphered the true identity of these pseu-donyms and saw to it that they paid up. The first to defend his men against injustices, he also insisted that they scrupulously honor their word to tradesmen in whatever foreign land they were stationed, to protect the Corps's good name. One month later the Nicaraguan revolutionary pot boiled over again. General Luis Mena, the Conservative party's Min-ister of War, had overthrown Estrada as President and had been overthrown in turn by Diaz. Mena went into rebellion with government troops loyal to him and had returned to attack Managua, the capital. Butler was rushed to Managua with a force of 350 men and ordered to prop up the faltering Diaz government.

Finding Diaz in the field and government forces in the capital in chaos, he took command of them. The American minister informed him that American banking interests had taken over the national railroad as security for a loan to the Diaz government, so that it must now be protected as \"American property.\" But it ran through territory controlled by three thousand of Mena's troops, who had captured a train and held it against a small Marine force sent to retake it. Nicaraguan newspapers mocked the Americans' rout. Mena's forces refused to let any other trains through, cutting off supplies from the port. On August 25, 1912, Butler was ordered to retake the captured train and open the railroad line. Angry that a Marine officer had failed in the task and made the Corps \"a laughingstock,\" he wrote his wife, \"The idea prevails *very strongly *that Marines <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *54 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> are not soldiers, and will not fight.

His way was barred by machetes and bayonets, and he was warned to retreat or have his small force annihilated. Through an interpreter he informed the rebels that the bags in his hands held dynamite, and he in-tended to blow them off the map if they did not back off and let his men repossess the train. The rebel commander hesitated, then glumly ordered his men to yield. The Marines manned the train, and as it pulled away, Butler calmly emptied the two bags out of a rear window in sight of the rebels. They contained sand. Checking a bridge to make sure it was safe for the train to cross, be was suddenly confronted by a rebel general with an enormous moustache who whipped out a huge pistol and shoved it against Butler's stomach.

Emptying the cartridges out of the barrel, he calmly returned the gun to the crestfallen general and drew his own revolver. The vanquished rebel leader meekly marched back to the train as a hostage, and the train went through. Butler discovered that most Nicaraguans were supporting the rebellion against the Diaz government, which had hired brutal Honduran mercenaries to crush it. The people themselves had slain many mercenaries, who looted, raped, and murdered. Un-fortunately *The Indispensable Man 55* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> for American prestige, a few Americans had been conspicuous among them. Butler's hundred Marines aboard the train were regarded with general hostility as similarly vicious instruments of the Diaz regime. Butler and his men succeeded in opening the line between Managua and the port at Corinto. On the way back they had to build three new bridges and several miles of track. Returning to Managua after a fifteen-hundred-foot descent with the train's brakes gone, Butler collapsed into bed and pulled the covers over his face. During the whole week-long trip he had had just seventeen hours' sleep. By now the cynicism of the American presence in Nicaragua was becoming depressingly obvious to him. \"I expect a whole lot more rot about the property of citizens of ours . . . which has been stolen by the rebels and which I must see restored to their owners,\" he wrote his wife on September 13, 1912. The following day he complained of orders from Admiral William H. H. Southerland, who headed the fleet at Corinto, \"virtually changing our status from neutral to partisanship with the government forces.\" He was next ordered to open the railroad south to Granada, Mena's rebel headquarters. Another malaria attack delayed the expedition. Always restless and unhappy when illness forced him to be idle, Butler held ice in his mouth and drove down his temperature until the doctor reluctantly let him out of bed. Weak and haggard with 104 fever, he had to lie on a cot in a boxcar as his troop train pulled out of Managua. His eyes were so blood-shot and glaring that his men began calling him Old Gimlet Eye, a nickname that stuck. Under constant harassment by guerrilla forces, Butler finally sent word ahead to Granada to warn General Mena that the Americans were prepared to attack him if he ordered any further assaults on the train.

Hoping to impress the emissaries with his military power, Butler ordered poles put in the muzzles of two small field guns on flatcars and covered them with tents to give them the appearance of fourteen-inch guns. He further awed the emissaries <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *56 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> by receiving them seated on a wooden camp chair mounted on stilted legs like a primitive throne. Glaring down at them, he warned that unless Mena signed an agreement surrendering the railroad property and moving his troops out of the railroad area, Marine \"regiments\" would at-tack Mena's two-thousand-man force in Granada. His bluff worked so well that Mena not only agreed but, to Butler's amazement, also offered to surrender himself and his army if the Americans would provide a warship to take him safely to exile in Panama. The jubilant Marine major notified Admiral Southerland and the admiral at once agreed. Butler was made temporary governor of the District of Granada until elections could be held. He promptly released all political prisoners Mena had thrown into dungeons and returned all the property that had been confiscated from them. He next issued a proclamation ordering all loot taken from the people by both rebel and government forces to be restored. The astonished Granadans hailed him as a liberator. On September 30, 1912, Butler was dismayed when the admiral transmitted cabled orders from Secretary of the Navy George von L. Meyer to side openly with the Diaz regime and turn over to it all captured rebels. Apologetically he disarmed Mena and his troops, confining troops, confining them m their barracks under guard. \"I must say,\" he wrote his wife, \"that I hated my job like the devil . . . but orders are orders, and of course, had to be carried out.\" But he protested bitterly to Admiral Southerland at the betrayal of his promise to Mena. Southerland finally agreed to stand behind his pledge and explain to Meyer. Local Granadan politicians, deprived by Butler of their cus-tomary loot, loudly complained to the admiral that he was inter-fering in local affairs. Southerland felt compelled to relieve him as governor, sending him to crush the final remnants of the revolution. Zeledon's force of two thousand rebels was dug in at a fort on top of the Coyatepe Mountain, a stronghold that had never been taken in Nicaragua's stormy history.

In a forty-minute *The Indispensable Man 57* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> battle twenty-seven rebels were killed in their trenches, nine cap-tured, and the rest put to flight. Two Marines were killed. The fall of Coyatepe put the town of Masaya, the last rebel outpost, in Marine hands. As they occupied it, some four thousand government troops celebrated by entering the town, looting it, and getting drunk. Incensed, Butler expressed his bitterness in a letter to his wife, decrying \"a victory gained by us for them at the expense of two good American lives, all because Brown Brothers, bankers, have some money invested in this country.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **6** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Resting in Masaya, the major began longing to see his family. \"I feel terribly over missing my son's most interesting period of development, but ... this separation can't last forever,\" he wrote Ethel on October g. \"I get so terribly homesick at times that I just don't see how I can stand it.\" The Taft Administration had another unpleasant assignment for him-rigging the new Nicaraguan elections to make certain that Diaz was returned to power. Checking on the country's elec-tion laws, Butler found that the polls had to be open a sufficient length of time (\"at least that's the way we translated it\") and that voters had to register to be able to vote. He ordered a canvass of the district to locate four hundred Nicaraguans who could be depended upon to vote for Diaz. Notice of opening of the polls was given five minutes before-hand. The four hundred Diaz adherents were assembled in a line, and two hours later, as soon as they had finished voting, the polls were closed. Other citizens had either failed to register or didn't know balloting was going on. \"Today,\" Butler wrote Ethel sardonically, \"Nicaragua has enjoyed a fine `free election,' with only one candidate being <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *58 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> allowed to run-President Adolfo Diaz-who was unanimously elected.

He had a high regard for the Nicaraguan people and genuine com-passion for their suffering. On November 13, 1912, over five thousand Nicaraguans turned out in Granada to present him with a gold medal for saving them from troop disorders and looting. They also gave him a scroll signed by Granada's leading citizens, expressing gratitude for his \"brave and opportune intervention\" that \"put an end to the desperate and painful situation in which this city was placed-victim of all the horrors of an organized anarchy.\" They told him, \"From this terrible situation and from the anguish that the future held for us, we passed as by magic to a state of complete guarantee for life, property, and well-being for all, as soon as the American hoops entered the city. The tact and discretion with which you fulfilled your humane mission, so bristling with difficulties, was such that your name will be for-ever engraved in the hearts of the people.\" There were fireworks and a fiesta. \"The whole thing was very impressive and made me feel quite silly,\" he wrote sheepishly to his wife, \"but rather proud for my darlings' sakes.\" A people's committee urged him to stay on as police com-missioner of the district. The twenty-nine-year-old major found himself intrigued by the prospect of introducing honest law en-forcement in Granada. \"What would thee think,\" he wrote Ethel, \"of my accepting a $15,000 job as Chief of this Police down here, not to leave the Marine Corps, but to have a three-years' leave?\" But he finally decided against it. Despite his reservations about the ethics of the Nicaraguan campaign, it had filled him with exhilaration of adventure. \"This is the end of the expedition,\" he wrote his wife. \"Would like to <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The Indispensable Man 59 <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> have some parts of it over again; the excitement was fine.\" He indicated an early awareness that he was destined to play a meaningful role in American history: \"Be sure to keep all my letters as they are a diary of my life, and may be useful sometime in the future.\" With a second bronze star added to his Expeditionary Medal and a new Nicaraguan Campaign Medal, the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:52:5782b4288b26", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13794, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "!supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The Indispensable Man 59 <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> have some parts of it over again; the excitement was fine.\" He indicated an early awareness that he was destined to play a meaningful role in American history: \"Be sure to keep all my letters as they are a diary of my life, and may be useful sometime in the future.\" With a second bronze star added to his Expeditionary Medal and a new Nicaraguan Campaign Medal, the indefatigable young campaigner returned to Panama and his family. His second son, Thomas Richard, was born in October, 1913. With Woodrow Wilson in the White House, war clouds loomed with Mexico when bandit General Victoriano Huerta overthrew legally elected Mexican President Francisco Madero. In an angry exchange of notes, Wilson insisted that Huerta must hold new elections barring himself as a candidate. Wilson's choice was Huerta's rival for power, General Venustiano Carranza. Banning all arms shipments to Mexico, the President asked all Americans without urgent business there to leave the country and sent the fleet to cruise significantly in the Gulf of Mexico during a period of \"watchful waiting.\" Defying Wilson, Huerta began importing arms from Europe to crush Carranza. The President then violated his own embargo and rushed American arms to the Carranza forces. Full-scale fighting broke out all over Mexico, during which American in-dustrial property was destroyed and United States businessmen were compelled to flee attacks against them from both sides. In January, 1914, the Marines were ordered from Panama to the fleet standing off Vera Cruz. Ethel Butler took the children home to Pennsylvania, and her husband reported to the fleet flagship *Florida, *assigned to the staff of Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher. Welcoming him aboard, the admiral remarked on his courage and daring in the Chinese, Philippine, and Nicaraguan campaigns. He was just the man, the admiral thought, for a dangerous special mission for the War Department. How did Butler feel about going into Mexico as a \"civilian\" spy to make an expert analysis of Huerta's fighting forces in and around Mexico City, as well as to gather general intelligence, in case war was declared? He would carry no official orders of any <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *6o The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> kind, of course, and if he were caught, the Navy would have to disavow any knowledge of either him or his mission. \"How soon can I start, Admiral?\" he asked.

His disappearance from the *Florida *was carried on the ship's rolls as \"desertion.\" Ashore in Vera Cruz, he decided to disguise himself as an Englishman. There were many English in Mexico at the time traveling on business. Attiring himself in a tweed suit, spats, deer-stalker's hat, and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses with a black ribbon, he undertook a stage English accent. A fraudulent British passport and forged letters of introduction to important Britons in Mexico City completed his impersonation. He left Vera Cruz aboard the private railroad car of the line's superintendent, a secret Carranza supporter cooperating with the Americans. The train rolled toward Mexico City along the road American troops would use if they invaded. The superin-tendent stopped the train several times en route, letting Butler inspect electric power plants and reservoirs by introducing him to leading citizens as \"Mr. Johnson,\" a public utilities expert. Managing to stray inside some army forts on his own, he was apprehended several times but released. \"I carried a butterfly net and studied rocks,\" he grinned in recollection. \"They thought I was a nut and let me pass.\" In Mexico City he changed to American garb and posed as a private detective from the United States seeking a condemned murderer who had escaped and fled to Mexico. Mexican secret police escorted him to all the garrisons to help his search for the imaginary criminal. He soon had vital data on the troop strength and disposition of munitions dumps around Mexico City. Making military maps of everything he had seen, Butler buried them in the false bottom of his bag and took the train back to Vera Cruz. He became aware that two Mexicans were following him. Apparently he had aroused suspicions, and the Mexican secret service was keeping an eye on him. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The Indispensable Man 61 <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> In the early morning when the train reached Vera Cruz, it paused temporarily to allow a rail switch to be thrown that took it into the station.

They considered it odd for a \"British entomologist\" to have been visiting the American embassy. His baggage was opened and searched thoroughly, but nothing incriminating was found. Threatening \"you blighters\" with official reprisals from the Brit-ish Foreign Office, Butler bluffed them into letting him go.

At dawn when the six companies began marching through the city Mexican troops fired at them from rooftops and house windows, using machine guns as well as rifles. Marines rushed from house to house smashing in doors and searching for snip-ers. The Marines Butler led were not his own command, and he *62 The Plot to Seize the White, House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> was not sure of their behavior under fire. To inspire coolness he led them through Vera Cruz with no weapon of his own except a stick. The Marines in two columns kept close to the doorways for cover while he walked calmly down the center of the street for a better view of snipers in houses on both sides. Ignoring bullets spurting dust at his feet, he used the stick to point out snipers to his sharpshooters. By nightfall the Marines had won control of the city, but at a cost of 135 Americans killed or wounded, 7 of the casualties Butler's men. Mexican casualties were four or five times as great. Returning to Panama, Butler relieved tedious garrison duty by expending his inexhaustible energy in making Camp Elliott an exemplary Marine outpost.

One was now awarded to Butler for being \"eminent and conspicuous in command of his Battalion. He exhibited courage and skill in leading his men through the action of the 22nd and in the final occupation of the city [Vera Cruz].\" \"I've no more courage than the next man,\" he protested, \"but it's always been my job to take my fellows through a mess the quickest way possible, with the loss of the fewest men.

And soldiers who are scared aren't worth so much. They'll keep their lives, but the job won't get done.\" To the astonishment of the Navy Department, he refused to accept his Medal of Honor, explaining that he did not consider what he had done at Vera Cruz worthy of the nation's highest military award. Admiral Fletcher, questioned by the Navy, replied that Butler was wrong; he had certainly merited the Medal of Honor not only for his courageous leadership in the Vera Cruz battle but also for his heroism as a spy. *The Indispensable Man 63* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The Navy Department thereupon sent the medal back to the reluctant hero with a terse order to keep it and wear it, but for Butler a matter of principle was involved.

He returned the medal to Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, writing stubbornly, \"I must renew my request that the Department reconsider its action in awarding this dec-oration.\" The matter was shelved by the outbreak of World War I in August, 1914, but Butler was later pressured into accepting the medal. Wilson was keeping a careful and worried eye on Haiti. During 1914 four presidents of that volatile little republic were over-thrown. The Germans were threatening to intervene to protect their economic interests. Wilson suspected that they wanted to use the volatile little republic as a naval base, which would put them within easy striking distance of the Panama Canal and the Florida coast.

Wilson suspected that they wanted to use the volatile little republic as a naval base, which would put them within easy striking distance of the Panama Canal and the Florida coast. Then in 1915 a new Haitian president, pursued by an angry mob, was forced to seek sanctuary in the French legation. The mob dragged him out and killed him. Now the angry French Government threatened intervention. Squirming in an agony of indecision, the anti-imperialist Wilson finally decided to put Haiti under American control to prevent any of the warring European powers from seizing it. Besides, he told Secretary of State Robert Lansing, an Ameri-can occupation would give him a chance to bring law, order, democracy, and prosperity to the wretched people of the mis-ruled little country. Wilson's missionary impulse dovetailed neatly with less exalted plans by big-business interests. The National City Bank controlled the National Bank of Haiti and the Haitian railroad system. Dollar diplomacy also involved the sugar barons who saw Haiti's rich plantations as an inviting target for investment and takeover. Rioting in the capital of Haiti in August, 1915, gave Wilson the excuse he needed to intervene with warships and Marines under Colonel Littleton Waller, Butler's commanding officer. Haiti was placed under an American commissioner who con-trolled the republic's affairs through the Haitian President.

The government was not allowed to incur any \"foreign obligations\" without American consent, and an American customs official collected all money due Haiti. The Marines \"pacified\" the population and maintained the President's authority. When the Haitian National Assembly met in Port-au-Prince, Marines stood in the aisles with bayonets drawn until Philippe Dartiguenave, the Haitian selected by the American minister, was \"elected\" President by the Assembly. He was the first Haitian President to serve out his full seven-year term, only because of the occupation of the Marines. Under Dartiguenave American control of the island was assured by a treaty signed on September 16, 1915, which entitled the United States to administer Haitian customs and finance for twenty years, or longer if Washington saw fit. The Haitian constitution was revised to remove a prohibition against alien ownership of land, enabling Americans to purchase the most fertile areas in the country, including valuable sugar cane, cacao, banana, cotton, tobacco, and sisal plantations. Northern Haiti, however, remained in the grip of rebels known as Cacos, whose chiefs Dartiguenave labeled bandits.

Posing as nationalists, they were actually precursors of the brutal Tonton Macoutes of the later Duvalier regime, just as cruel to the peas-ants as the government's soldiers were. Butler led a reconnaissance force of twenty-six volunteers in pursuit of a Caco force that had killed ten Marines. Like the Cacos in the mountains, he and his men lived for days off the orange groves. For over a hundred miles they followed a trail of peels, estimating how long before the Cacos had passed by the dryness of the peels. A native guide they picked up helped them locate the Cacos' headquarters, a secret fort called Capois, deep in the mountain range. Studying the mountaintop fort through field glasses, Butler made out thick stone walls, with enough activity to suggest they were defended by at least a regiment. He decided to return to Cape Haitien for reinforcements and capture it. On the way back they were ambushed by a force of Cacos that outnumbered them twenty to one. Fortunately it was a pitch-black night, and *The Indispensable Man 65* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler was able to save his men by splitting them up to crawl past the Cacos' lines through high grass. Just before dawn he reorganized them into three squads of nine men each. Charging from three directions as they yelled wildly and fired from the hip, they created such a fearful din that the Cacos panicked and fled, leaving seventy-five killed. The only Marine casualty was one man wounded. When he was able to return with reinforcements, spies had alerted the Cacos, and Butler took a deserted Fort Capois without firing a shot. Only one last stronghold remained to be cleared-the mountain fortress at Fort Riviere, which the French, who had built it during their occupation of Haiti, considered im-pregnable. Butler was told it would be difficult to capture, even with a strong artillery battery. \"Give me a hundred picked volunteers,\" he said, \"and I'll have the colors flying over it tomorrow.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **8** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler earnestly assured his volunteers that they could do the job.

The Congressional Medal of Honor could not be awarded to an officer unless a high official of the military branch concerned first made a personal investigation and authenticated the citation. When Butler was recommended for the award, Roosevelt went to Haiti to investigate. He was taken by Butler on an inspection tour of Haiti and the ruins of Fort Riviere, which Butler had demolished with explosives after its capture to deny its reuse to the Cacos. In his memorandum Roosevelt wrote what he had learned from others about Smedley Butler's attack on the four-thousand-foot-high mountain fortress in November, 1915: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> This was the famous fortification captured by Butler and his 24 Marines in the Caco rebellion of a few months before. The top is a hog's back ridge a quarter of a mile long. Butler and his Marines left a machine gun at one end of the ridge while he and about 18 Marines crawled through the grass into the fort itself. Crawling down into a corner, they found a tunnel into the courtyard, serving as a drain when it rained. Butler started to crawl through it (about 2 1/4 ' high x 2' wide) and the old sergeant [Ross lams] said, \"Sir, I was in the Marines before you and it is my privilege.\" Butler recognized his right, and the sergeant crawled through first. On coming to the end within the courtyard, he saw the shadows of the legs of 2 Cacos armed with machetes guarding the place.

With a right and left he got both Cacos, stood up and dropped 2 or 3 others while his companions, headed by Smedley Butler, got through the drain hole and stood up. Then ensued a killing, the news of which put down all insurrections, we hope, for all time to come. There were about 300 Cacos within the wall, and Butler and his 18 companions killed [many] . . . others jumping over the wall and falling prisoner to the rest of the force of Marines which circled the mountain. I was so much impressed by personal inspection of the *The Indispensable Man 67* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> scene of the exploit that I awarded the Medal of Honor to the Marine Sergeant and Smedley Butler. Incidentally, But-ler had received the Medal of Honor at Tientsin at the time of the Boxer Rebellion.* He had been awarded at the capture of Vera Cruz in 1914 but declined to accept it. The third at Fort Riviere he did accept. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler saw pathos as well as bravery in the episode at Riviere. \"The futile efforts of the natives to oppose trained white soldiers impressed me as tragic,\" he declared. \"As soon as they lost their heads, they picked up useless, aboriginal weapons. If they had realized the advantage of their position, they could have shot us like rats as we crawled out one by one, out of the drain.\" But the power of the Cacos was broken, and the revolution was over. Surviving Cacos sought to keep the movement alive, but their ancient horse pistols, Spanish cutlasses, Napoleonic sabers, French carbines, and even flintlocks were futile against the superior weaponry and training of the Marines. President Dartiguenave awarded Butler the Haitian Medal of Honor, with great praise for his dynamic personality, intense determination, direct and unrelenting attacks against heavy odds, and masterful ability to lead men. Soon after peace was restored, Butler sent for his wife and children. They had seen little of him since the beginning of his tour in Panama, because of his three expeditions to Nicaragua followed by the Mexican and Haitian campaigns. They joined him at Port-au-Prince in a large, comfortable house with white verandas and a pleasant, shaded garden, located on the outskirts of the town.

It was Ethel Butler who disciplined the children, a matter of necessity because of his frequent absences. The children loved the exotic flavor of the tropical republic.

Young Ethel went to a convent taught by nuns in French and English. Never allowed into town, as it was considered unsafe, they were accompanied everywhere by a gendarme. One night while the family was seated on the veranda, a Caco concealed some-where on the hillside took a shot at their father, narrowly miss-ing him. Washington decided to reorganize the ineffective Haitian mil-itary, which had almost one general for every three privates in its thirteen-hundred-man army. Dartiguenave agreed to its re-placement by a native constabulary of three thousand men to be trained and directed by Butler. Although still only a major, Butler's rank as head of the Haitian Gendarmerie was major general, and his power that of Minister of the Interior. He was paid $3,000 a year as commandant of the Gendarm-erie, which cost the American Government $800,000 a year. Ostensibly under the direction of the Haitian President, the new force was actually controlled by Washington. All of its officers were Marines. Haiti's foreign minister demanded that the Gendarmerie be put under Haitian control. Butler refused, pointing out that accord-ing to an agreement signed by Dartiguenave, the commandant alone was made responsible for the force. The foreign minister angrily drew up a new constitution for Haiti that would force the Americans to relinquish their power over both the Gendarm-erie and Haiti itself, and prepared to introduce it in the Haitian National Assembly. Alarmed, Dartiguenave told Butler that the foreign minister had the support of a majority of the Assembly's legislators, who intended to ram the new constitution through the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Then they planned to vote to impeach Dartiguenave, ostensibly for violating the old constitution, in reality because they considered him an American pawn. The American minister, A.

Bailly-Blanchard, cabled a warning to Secretary of State Robert Lansing, who cabled back that since the new constitution was \"unfriendly\" to the United States, it must not be approved by the Haitian Legislature. Bailly--Blanchard was ordered to take any steps necessary to prevent *The Indispensable Man 69* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> its passage. He summoned Butler, Butler's regimental com-mander, Colonel Cole, and the top naval commander, Admiral Anderson, to a conference, and read them Lansing's cable. It was decided that Americans would have no legal justifica-tion for interfering in Haiti's internal affairs, but that Butler, as major general of the Haitian Constabulary, did have that right. Commanded to carry out the State Department's orders, Butler went to see Dartiguenave, who urged him to use the Gendarmerie to dissolve the National Assembly. But Butler had no relish for the role of dictator. If Dartigue-nave and his cabinet wanted the Assembly suspended, he in-sisted, then they had to take full responsibility. He refused to act until they had apprehensively signed a decree ordering dis-solution of the Assembly \"to end the spirit of anarchy which animates it.\" When Butler led his gendarmes to the National Assembly, he was greeted with loud, prolonged hissing. The gendarmes began cocking their rifles. Many, veterans of previous coups d'etat, were amazed at Butler's order to lower their guns. He then handed the President's decree to the presiding As-sembly officer to be read aloud to the chamber. Instead the latter launched into a wrathful tirade against the American occupation. His outburst threw the hall into an uproar. Fearful of being charged, the gendarmes again threw up their weapons, and Butler once more snapped an order to ground arms. The reluctant presiding officer finally read Dartiguenave's decree and bitterly declared the Assembly dissolved. The gloomy legislators then filed into the street, and the gendarmes locked the hall behind them. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *70 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **9** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The Marine Corps promoted Butler to lieutenant colonel in August, 1916.

He grew fond of Dartiguenave while acknowledging, \"I knew lie was an old political crook.\" Typical of the President's expenditures from the treasury was sixteen hundred dollars \"to have the hole in a carpet mended.\" Traveling all over Haiti without a gun, despite the Cacos, Butler established a postal service, a country school system, a network of telegraph lines, a civil hospital in Port-au-Prince, and a five-hundred-mile road system; he also restored lighthouses and channel buoys. Although these civic and economic improve-ments unquestionably benefited American investors, Butler's primary purpose was to improve life for the Haitians. \"I was, and have been ever since, very fond of the Haitian people,\" he wrote later, \"and it was my ambition to make Haiti a first-class black man's country.\" But no amount of Butler's \"good works\" could erase from Haitian minds the humiliating awareness that they had been robbed of their independence by a military occupation. Haitians had no shortage of legitimate grievances. The supreme power on the island was not Butler, who was preoccupied with the Gendarmerie, but the commanding officer of the Marines in Haiti, Littleton Waller, who was made a brigadier general in the fall of 1916. As the officer who had once been court-martialed for brutality toward Filipino natives, he did not inspire among his staff officers any vast respect for Haitian sensibilities. In the interior they talked as casually of shooting \"gooks\" as sportsmen talked of duck-hunting. Patrolling against the Cacos, some Marine officers looted the homes of native families they *The Indispensable Man 71* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> were supposed to protect. Others talked of \"cleaning out\" the island by killing the entire native population. Prisoners were beaten and tortured to make them tell what they knew about Cacos' whereabouts. Some were allowed to \"escape,\" then were shot as they fled. Haitians in the interior were forced to carry *bon habitant *(good citizen) passes. Any native stopped by a Marine and un-able to produce a *bon habitant *could be either shot or arrested. Understandably, many Haitians became convinced that all Amer-icans were racial bigots who hated black men. And behind the Americans in uniform were the American businessmen, who plundered the wealth of the island with impunity. Butler, now in his early thirties, did not take Haitian poli-ticians very seriously. He viewed most of them as banana re-public opportunists not too different from the crooked ward bosses who infested the American body politic.

His eyes opened increasingly, however, to the fact that he was being used by big-business interests to pacify the population in order to protect profitable American investments. \"The Haitian Government, such as it is, either yields perforce to American pressure,\" reported correspondent Herbert J. Selig-mann in *The Nation, *\"or finds itself in feeble and ineffectual opposition.... The present Government of Haiti, which dangles from wires pulled by American fingers, would not endure for twenty-four hours if United States armed forces were withdrawn; and the President, Dartiguenave, would face death or exile.\" Butler protested to Washington about some of the injustices of the occupation. On April g, 1916, he wrote to the State De-partment to point out that the Haitians logically objected to the retention of Marine officers in the Gendarmerie unless they were made subject to trial by Haitian courts. since otherwise <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *72 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> the United States could mount a coup d'etat whenever it chose to order one. His protest fell on deaf ears. By the spring of 1916 Haitian discontent was growing rapidly. Waller warned Butler to be on guard because Cacos, spreading the rumor that the Americans would soon pull out, were urging the people to rise and destroy them now. Butler felt deeply discouraged. Despite everything he had tried to do for the people, the dollar sign behind the occupation had made all his efforts useless. In July he wrote to Lejeune, \"All of us gendarmes are mighty tired, and I for one am going to ask to be relieved at the first opportunity presenting itself.\" In August Waller ordered him into Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic sharing the island with Haiti, to put down a revolt led by Celidiano Pantilion and \"stabilize the economy.\" The Dominican Government had defaulted its obligations to American banks and paid for its sins with an American occupa-tion to protect U.S. investments that lasted eight years. When he returned from Santo Domingo, mission accomplished, a letter was waiting for him from Lejeune. \"Assistant Secretary Roosevelt came back with glowing accounts of the splendid work being done by the Marine Corps in connection with the Gendarmerie,\" Lejeune wrote enthusiastically. \"You certainly de-serve the greatest credit for what you have", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:64:7abebd2f87d2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13806, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 65, "text": "economy.\" The Dominican Government had defaulted its obligations to American banks and paid for its sins with an American occupa-tion to protect U.S. investments that lasted eight years.

He grew quietly cynical about some of the compliments paid to him. In neighboring Santo Domingo revolutionists joined bandits in shaking down American plantation managers for money. Re-pulsed, they set cane fires and sought to prevent cane from being cut and ground. The American sugar interests there wanted Butler to come to their rescue once again. \"Members of the Sugar Association and myself,\" their spokes-man, businessman Frank H. Vedder, wrote to Roosevelt, \"desire to express to you our appreciation of . . . the improvement in conditions, the hard work being done by the marines in the *The Indispensable Man 73* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> field. . . . The dangers from bandit operations are by no means past or remote. Additional troops would be of great assistance in clearing up the situation.\" To Butler's relief Roosevelt replied, \"I appreciate, of course, that the complete elimination of bandit operations is at the present time exceedingly difficult, but I trust that the Acting Military Governor will be able to give all the protection neces-sary with the forces under his command.\" Butler sought to convince the State Department that the Haitians would never cease to be anti-American until Washing-ton allowed them to hold honest elections and choose their own President. Spies tipped off Dartiguenave, who grew chilly toward Butler for putting his job in jeopardy. But Haiti received little attention now from the State Depart-ment, which was carefully studying developments in World War I. Reading about the war from his remote outpost, Butler regarded it with loathing as \"madness . . . a European blood-bath.\" He fervently hoped that Wilson would have the good sense to keep American boys out of it. When the President took America into the war, however, Butler instantly appealed to Lejeune for a combat assignment in France, where he felt that he would at least be serving his country instead of Wall Street. Lejeune replied that the State Department was so pleased with his work as an administrator in Haiti that it had refused to transfer him to the European war front.

Unappeased, Butler moaned to Lejeune in June, 1917, \"The service is becoming more and more detestable every day, and the knowledge that I am not allowed to fight for my country makes it even more unbearable.\" He appealed to Roosevelt. \"Secretary Roosevelt and I,\" replied John McIlhenny, head of the U.S. Civil Service Commission, \"are of the same opinion that the work which you have in hand should not be interfered with or disturbed because it is the most potent factor in maintaining a peaceful occupation.\" An entreaty to his father also failed to work. \"Your father,\" wrote Representative W. L. Hensley, of the House Naval Affairs Committee, \"has gone into all these matters with the Secretary of War concerning your ambitions. They feel you are doing a <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> 74 The Plot to Seize the White House <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> great work where you are, and for you to be transferred from there would turn things topsy-turvy.\" Disconsolate, Butler threw himself into a new orgy of road-building. In forty-five days lie built a new road from Port-au--Prince to Cape Haitien, across twenty-one miles of the roughest, densest tropical country he had ever seen. After he had driven the first car over it, Secretary of State Lansing cabled congratula-tions. McIlhenny wrote him, \"I think your achievement in build-ing a road from Port-au-Prince to Cape Haitien in such a time and at such a cost is a miracle.\" \"Someone has misled you,\" he replied impatiently, \"concerning my value to this country, and to the aims of the U.S. down here, for I am simply a subordinate to the Chief of the American Occupation . . . and have no independent authority.\" By now Butler was strongly suspicious that he was being held in Haiti by the War Department's lack of confidence in his fit-ness for a command in France.

He had trodden on a good many other important toes as well during his two years in Haiti, and he had heard rumors spread by some naval officers that he had won all his medals and promotions because of his father's influence. He did not hesitate to try to use that influence when Thomas Butler became chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee in 1918. But his renewed pleas to be allowed to serve in the A.E.F. failed to move his father, and he remained bogged down disconsolately in Haiti. He grew increasingly unhappy with the government's management of the island's affairs. Under wartime censorship Port-au-Prince's newspapers were suppressed, and their editors jailed, for suggesting that since Mr. Wilson was so concerned about the fate of poor little nations overrun by powerful military aggressors that he had gone to war in Europe for them, he might consider rescuing little Haiti from *its *invaders. *The Indispensable Man 75* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Some years later when Harding succeeded Wilson in the White House, Dartiguenave called upon him to remove all Marines from Haiti and liberate the Haitian people. To dramatize his case, Dartiguenave accused Butler of having dissolved the Haitian National Assembly by force of arms, without authority, conveniently ignoring the fact that he had begged Butler to do it and that he had written him upon his departure, \"I regret to see you obliged to cease your services in this country, and I was well pleased with the broad and intelligent cooperation that you have constantly given to the Government.\" Dartiguenave's memorial to Harding, published widely in the United States, \"stirred up a hell of a commotion,\" as Butler put it. The Senate appointed an investigating committee with Sen-ator Medill McCormick, of Illinois, as chairman. Butler was summoned as a witness. A lawyer for the American N.A.A.C.P. demanded to know on what authority he had presumed to dis-solve the Haitian National Assembly. \"The President [Dartiguenave] himself dissolved the Congress,\" Butler replied. \"I merely carried his decree of dissolution to the Assembly.\" Haitian witnesses jeered at this assertion, but their faces fell when Butler produced the decree signed by Dartiguenave and his cabinet; it had been prudently saved among Butler's memor-abilia. The upset Haitian politicians denounced it as a forgery, but were compelled to acknowledge it as authentic when it was compared with other documents signed by Dartiguenave. His case won, Butler saw no need to embarrass the State Department by also revealing that Secretary of State Robert Lansing had secretly ordered \"any steps necessary\" to stop the National As-sembly from passing an anti-American constitution.

Soon afterward Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby asked Butler to return to Haiti as High Commissioner with a \"civilian financial adviser\" who, Butler knew, would represent American big-business investors and dictate economic policy. He had had enough of letting Wall Street profiteers use the Marines as their private army. He would prefer not to go, he told Denby, and certainly not with any civilian financial adviser. In that case, Denby said coldly, he need not go at all. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *76 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> In March, 1918, bursting with frustration over his inability to get into the action on France's battlefields, Butler decided to press the matter personally with Lejeune, who was now a gen-eral, during a medical leave to Washington for dentistry. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **10** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Lejeune finally succeeded in getting him detached from Haitian service, but to Butler's dismay, instead of being sent overseas, he was ordered to take over a swampy new Marine base at Quantico, Virginia, on the Potomac, thirty miles south of Wash-ington. Here he had to train regiments of raw boots for the front and glumly watch them pull out for France without him. He felt irked with his father for failing to use his influence to get him into combat. Thomas Butler had visited the front and had been greatly disturbed by the high casualties of American troops. Smedley wondered whether his father had refused to help him get overseas out of a dread of losing him in the European carnage. He persisted in nagging Marine headquarters for an overseas command, but his refusal to be discreet even now antagonized his superior officers. Learning that a move was afoot to raise the rank of the Marine commandant to lieutenant general, he spoke out against it as a rank piece of opportunism. No similar promotions were being suggested, he pointed out acidly, for the leathernecks in the trenches of France. His friends in the Corps moaned at this bull-in-a-china-shop gaffe, warning him that his indiscreet candor was hurting his career. He remained stubbornly convinced of his right to speak out vigorously against injustice in the Corps. He finally found a way to get overseas when the 13th Marines came to Quantico for training.

Josephus Daniels, Jr., son of the *The Indispensable Man 77* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Secretary of the Navy, was with the regiment. Meeting his father, Butler persuaded Daniels, Sr., that young Marines like his son needed the protection overseas of veteran Marine com-manders like Smedley Butler. Despite the opposition of the desk admirals in Washington, Butler was finally ordered overseas with the regiment. Bidding farewell to his family, Butler was happy in the con-viction that he was heading for the front at last. For twenty years, he told his wife, he had been preparing for the big war that he had dreaded, yet had anticipated. At last he would be serving his country in its greatest hour of crisis. In his patriotic zeal his qualms about the commercial intrigues he had learned to suspect behind troop movements were swept away. Anchoring at Brest on September 24, 1918, he and his men were assigned to a dreary Army debarkation center, Camp Pon-tanezen, consisting of seventeen hundred acres of mud flats oc-cupied by 75,000 American soldiers, of whom 16,000 had the flu. Returning casualties had complained of scandalous conditions at Pontanezen, where they had been forced to await ships home lying in mud, hungry, chilled, and medically neglected. Day after day he waited impatiently for his orders to move up to the fighting zone. After two weeks he was handed a tele-gram from A.E.F. Commander General John J. Pershing in-forming the thirty-seven-year-old Butler that he had been promoted to the rank of brigadier general, making him the youngest Marine ever to achieve that rank. And he was finally assigned his new command-in charge of Camp Pontanezen. Butler read the telegram three times, unable to believe it. Then be let out a roar of fury. The bastards! *The unutterable bastards! *They couldn't do this to him. After twenty years as a fighting Marine, to be denied the opportunity to lead his men into battle and be forced to sit instead in a dirty mud hole a light-year away from the fighting! To make matters worse, he discovered that one officer after another had been put in charge of the miserable concentration camp and pest trap that was now his responsibility, only to fail dismally in their attempts to clean it up. It was obvious to him that he had been handed a \"lemon\" of a command, ending his *78 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> dreams", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:69:5853f491a586", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13811, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 70, "text": "mud hole a light-year away from the fighting!

Bitter, he added Pershing to his list of enemies in top echelons. Pershing, actually, had been motivated only by the desperate need for a good administrator who could do something about the mess at Pontanezen, the linchpin for troops and equipment com-ing into France and for wounded and sick troops going home. Butler's record as an able administrator in Haiti and Quantico had marked him as the man for the job. So he was forced to watch glumly as the 13th Marines left for the front, leaving him behind in command of an all-Army outfit in Brest. Shaking off his despond and self-pity, Butler went to work. Not long afterward writer Mary Roberts Rinehart arrived with orders from Secretary of War Newton Baker to investigate the terrible conditions at Pontanezen. Touring the camp talking to the troops, she was astonished to find morale high. One private told her enthusiastically, \"I'd cross hell on a slat if Butler gave the word!\" She wrote later: <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> In charge of the camp was that dynamo of energy, courage and sheer ability, General Smedley Butler of the Marines. And Butler was no red tape man. In defiance of regulations he was issuing double rations of food, and serv-ing hot soup all day long to those who needed it. He had issued, also, six blankets to each man, and as the ground under the tents was nothing but mud, he had raided the wharf at Brest of the duck-boards no longer needed for the trenches, carried the first one himself up that four-mile hill to the camp, and thus provided something in the way of protection for the men to sleep on. To have produced the morale I found under existing con-ditions was nothing short of a miracle of ability, and I said so. Even the flu, taking its daily toll of men in the hospital nearby, was practically non-existent in the camp. . . . I had never seen General Butler before, and I went prepared to send in a blistering report to Washington. . . . But the men were in fine condition, and cheerful. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Her report to Baker was so glowing that the Secretary of War promised to send Butler everything he needed.

Soon after the Armistice Butler threw the gears of camp opera-tion *The Indispensable Man 79* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> into reverse. In a single day 26,000 men were processed onto ships, 2,000 newcomers were processed into France, and 10,000 men fresh from the line were processed into camp. Every man back from the front was deloused, bathed, and freshly dressed and equipped within twenty-four hours. The camp was the outstanding marvel of American efficiency on French soil, During an inspection visit by Pershing, the commander of the A.E.F. noticed that as Butler drove him around the camp, doughboy after doughboy failed to salute them. Irked, he snapped to Butler, \"Don't you think they should be taught to salute?\" \"Well, General,\" Butler said with a shrug, \"if the Army had them from six months to six years and they haven't learned to salute, you can't expect a Marine to teach them in six days!\" He was always on the side of the powerless against the brass. One day while he was absent his superior, General Helmick, made a surprise inspection of Pontanezen. Finding wastefulness in one mess, Helmick savagely tongue-lashed the lieutenant in charge. When Butler learned about it, he phoned the Army Chief of Staff. \"If the general has any complaint with the camp,\" he stormed, \"tell him to pick on me and not on a young lieutenant who is doing his level best!\" When Helmick came to see him, Butler pounded on the desk and told his superior what he thought of him for \"jumping on a boy.\" After Butler's angry outburst had subsided, Helmick replied, \"Now, Smedley, I'll talk. I've let you abuse me, your commander, for two reasons. First, because you've been of such tremendous value to my organization, and second, because I know I didn't do the right thing by that boy. I realize also that you've worked yourself into a state of nervous collapse to make the camp a success. I know you don't mean what you're saying. I never per-mit myself to be aroused by a tired man's utterances, when that tired man is a good man.\" \"General, by God,\" Butler said hoarsely, struck with admira-tion, \"you are some commander!\" Helmick then went with Butler to the young lieutenant and apologized to him publicly in front of all the cooks and KP's. *80** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Torn between court-martialing him for his frequent intransi-gence toward higher authority and decorating him for his ac-complishments in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:71:2eed0296fb29", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13813, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 72, "text": "by a tired man's utterances, when that tired man is a good man.\" \"General, by God,\" Butler said hoarsely, struck with admira-tion, \"you are some commander!\" Helmick then went with Butler to the young lieutenant and apologized to him publicly in front of all the cooks and KP's. *80** The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Torn between court-martialing him for his frequent intransi-gence toward higher authority and decorating him for his ac-complishments in an almost impossible job, the Army finally awarded him its Distinguished Service Medal. The Navy felt impelled to follow suit with its own Distinguished Service Medal. The French awarded him their Order of the Black Star. He wore these decorations proudly beside his World War I Victory Medal with French clasp. But the reward he treasured most was the gratitude of hun-dreds of thousands of doughboys back from the misery of the trenches, grateful for his efforts to ease their hardships as they waited for evacuation home. He did a lot of hard thinking as he watched the wounded and maimed pass through Pontanezen, some with their nervous systems irreparably shattered. \"Gradually it began to dawn on me to wonder,\" he related later, \"what on earth these American boys are doing getting wounded and killed and buried in France.\" This uneasy reflec-tion began to plant seeds of doubt in his mind about the ethics of his chosen calling. <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **11** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> With America once more at peace and Congress slashing military funds drastically, the future of the Marine Corps looked bleak. Butler was indignant when Marine Corps headquarters failed to protest its reduction to a mere appendage of the Navy. In disgust he announced his decision to retire and wrote his father urging that John Lejeune be appointed the new commandant in 1920 to save the Corps. Thomas Butler saw eye to eye with his son on the need to preserve the Marine Corps's independence and agreed that Le-jeune, who had distinguished himself in the Battle of Meuse--Argonne, was the man to fight for it in Congress. So on January *The Indispensable Man 81* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> 30, 1920, Lejeune became the new commandant. He, in turn, coaxed Butler into staying on in command of Quantico to help in the struggle to save the Corps. To dramatize the Corps's need of funds for modernization, Butler held summer maneuvers that restaged the Battle of the Wilderness between Grant and Lee. On the first day it was \"fought\" as it had happened; next day it was restaged with a significant difference-the use of modern equipment. The pres-ence of President Warren G. Harding, a Civil War buff, helped win widespread news coverage.

Harding, a Civil War buff, helped win widespread news coverage. Butler's shrewd tactic was highly effective in getting a reluctant Congress to vote adequate funds for the Corps. It was a forty-mile march from Quantico to the battleground. As usual wearing no insignia to identify him, Butler marched at the head of the column walking his horse, carrying full gear on his back in the hot July sun. When one soldier faltered, Butler told him gently, \"Son, I'm more than twenty years older than you, but we're going to do this together.\" He said later, \"I wanted to show them that they could force themselves to do things that would be necessary in war.\" And they all did. His troops never learned that following one such battlefield exercise the forty-year-old commander experienced a minor heart attack, for which a doctor prescribed rest and digitalis. The word that spread through Quantico was that it was useless to try to fall out of a hike, because the Old Man would just pick up your pack, add it to his own, and hike right alongside you with it. The humdrum garrison life of peacetime, with no alarums and excursions to divert him, took its toll of Butler's temper. \"I was itching for a scrap-action-something with a snap to it,\" he admitted later. But he was never irascible in any matter that pertained to ailing Marines who had served under him. In August, 1920, a private wrote him, \"I have been a patient in St. Elizabeth's hospital for the Insane since Sept. 20, 1918. I am writing to ask if you will arrange to have me transferred to one of the institu-tions in Philadelphia, so that I can be close to the folks at home.\" \"I will look into the matter and let you know,\" Butler replied gently. \"You can be assured that everything will be done for *82 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> your comfort, for you are one of the prize soldiers of the Marine Corps, and we all like you very much.\" He grew increasingly incensed at what he considered the in-gratitude of the nation toward its veterans. Once the war crisis was over and Americans felt safe, he reflected, the shattered heroes of yesterday were ignored as the \"bums\" of today. He was particularly embittered by the indifference of big business toward the men in uniform who had so often been called upon to spill blood for corporate profits.

Once the war crisis was over and Americans felt safe, he reflected, the shattered heroes of yesterday were ignored as the \"bums\" of today. He was particularly embittered by the indifference of big business toward the men in uniform who had so often been called upon to spill blood for corporate profits. The profiteering of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the price they charged for transporting troops led him to write his father angrily, \"I am at a loss to understand why the Pennsylvania people are so antagonistic to men in uniform. The railroad can haul civilians from Washington to Philadelphia and back every Sunday for *$3.78 *and want $14.00 to haul soldiers. . . . These Pennsylvania people are a lot of damned hogs and I hope that something will happen to them.\" Butler raised Marine Corps morale by developing a great foot-ball team that became the talk of the sports world, and began building a sports stadium with volunteer Marine labor and with cement contributed by cement companies. Proliferating veterans' groups vied with each other for the distinction of adding his name to their letterheads. He tactfully declined invitations to join, offering his view that all such groups \"must be nonpolitical, and should never be heard on the floors of Congress.\" In June, *1923, *he sent regrets to the Marine Corps Veterans Association explaining, \"I have very decided views on associations, and I am not a member of any but the American Legion, and most inactive, at that-only joining it because Gen-eral Lejeune requested me to do so.\" He considered the Legion too political and undemocratic, with leaders who used it as a mouthpiece for big-business interests. Late in 1923* *Butler's career took an unorthodox twist. W. Freeland Kendrick, the new mayor of Philadelphia, urged him to take a leave from the Marines to become the city's Di-rector of Public Safety. The job was that of a \"supercop,\" in charge of the police and firemen, with the task of smashing the links between crime and politics in Philadelphia. *The Indispensable Man 83* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Under Prohibition the city had become one of the most cor-rupt municipalities in the country. Over eight thousand places sold bootleg liquor without fear of prosecution; gangsters ran wide-open gambling joints and brothels; robberies, holdups, and other crimes were soaring. All attempts to clean up the City of Brotherly Love had failed because of a profitable alliance among gangsters, speakeasy operators, and crooked ward bosses, who bribed and controlled the police. Kendrick, a conservative Republican politician, had been elected mayor on a law-and-order campaign and was now under heavy pressure to keep his pledge.

Kendrick, a conservative Republican politician, had been elected mayor on a law-and-order campaign and was now under heavy pressure to keep his pledge. He was advised to bring in an outsider, preferably a military man, who could not be bought, bluffed, or bullied, to head the police. Brigadier General Smedley Butler, now a vigorous forty-two and a colorful war hero with an impressive list of credits in *Who's Who in the Services, *seemed a perfect choice to please the voters. He had even had police experience organizing the Haiti Gendarmerie. But Butler declined the job. On November 21 he wrote Kendrick, \"While this position would appeal to me very greatly if I believed there were the slightest chance of success, I am convinced that the present political conditions existing would ... throw away the work of a lifetime in a perfectly hopeless un-dertaking.\" He was relieved when the Navy ordered him to report for orders to the Scouting Fleet. But Kendrick and the Republican party of Pennsylvania now needed him desperately to still a storm of public criticism. So Kendrick, Congressman Bill Vare, and Pennsylvania's two senators went to the White House to plead with President Calvin Coolidge that Butler be given a year's leave of absence to clean up Philadelphia. Only a man with Butler's reputation for total honesty, and the ability to discipline men while capturing their imagination and winning their loyalty, they told Coolidge, could reorganize the Philadelphia police force. The President finally agreed and sent word to Butler that the White House would like him to tackle the job in the interests of good government. His father warned him against it as a political quicksand, but Butler did not see <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *82 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> how he could refuse a mandate from both the people of Philadelphia and the President. His reluctant consent brought wondering letters from old comrades all over the world, many of whom imagined that he had resigned from the Corps. Butler assured them that it was only temporary. \"This job is a terrible one and I will probably be cut to pieces,\" he wrote to Lieutenant Colonel H. L. Roosevelt in Paris. \"On January 7 I will be sworn in as a Philadelphia cop, for better or worse.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **12** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler told a reporter for the Philadelphia *North American, *\"Kendrick has his neck in a noose with me.

If he reverses me just once I'll quit, and the resignation will be in the form of a telephone call telling him I am on my way back to Quantico, and that the keys to my office are on my desk. I do not care whether the state laws or city ordinances are right or wrong. From January 7 they are going to be enforced.\" He was not opposed to drinking in principle, he added. What was at stake was enforcement of the law, pure and simple, not the ethics of Prohibition. Even before he took office, \"Boss\" Vare sent an emissary to him, Judge Edwin O. Lewis, to offer Vare's \"suggestions\" for key appointments in reorganizing the police department. None too politely, Butler made it clear what Lewis and Vare could do with their suggestions. He rented a home in nearby Overbrook, but his wife and chil-dren seldom saw him there because he spent seven days a week on the job, working until after midnight. Sworn in on January 7, 1924, he took the oath of office in his Marine uniform, but half an hour later changed it for one of his own design. Blue with gold trim, it had a cape taken from the *The Indispensable Man 85* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Marine mess jacket with a flaring red lining. It was dramatic and impressive, and meant to be. He promptly summoned all police inspectors to his office. \"I want the lieutenants in your forty-two districts to clean up in forty-eight hours,\" he snapped, \"or face immediate demotion. That is all.\" Then he visited each one of the districts until he had spoken to every man on the force. The new motto, he announced, was short and sweet: \"Clean up or get out!\" In his first week on the job he raided and shut down 973 liquor and gambling joints, without even warning Mayor Ken-drick. Philadelphians were electrified. The police winked at each other, convinced that Butler was a smart \"grandstander\" who would make a big splash for the headlines, then quiet down and take it easy.

He demanded from his men a dedication to duty equal to his own, but many of them, cut off from former sources of graft, were hostile and resistant to the new broom sweeping too clean. \"Sherman was right about war,\" Butler sighed wearily, \"but he should have tried leading the Philadelphia police!\" Nevertheless he began to show results. Worried Philadelphia bootleggers began unloading their stocks at cut prices. Many crooks and gamblers began streaming out of the city in search of more hospitable territory. Encouraging excessive zeal among his forces, Butler took re-sponsibility for police who went too far on raids by using axes freely to destroy furniture and fixtures, searching private homes and vehicles on suspicion, and closing premises that had a right to stay open to sell nonintoxicating beverages. Magistrates began refusing to issue search warrants to permit police to enter known speakeasies masquerading as private residences. Many cases were dismissed on grounds of insufficient or illegal evidence. Butler realized that he would have to modify his tactics, and astonished Philadelphians by frankly confessing his mistakes to both the press and the police. \"Guard against anything that will embarrass Mayor Kendrick's administration,\" he now ordered police. \"Keep away from the *86 The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> hippodrome stuff. I must admit that I have sinned in this latter respect more than any of you, and the only excuse I have to offer is that I was unduly excited and enthusiastic.\" Such candor won the affection and respect of reporters, who found Butler colorful copy and loved to join him for midnight suppers on Chestnut Street. There was never any question he would not answer for them directly and honestly. But if they were for him, their publishers-with the exception of the Phila-delphia Record-were not; their editorial pages sought to ridicule and discredit him relentlessly, \"They insisted on treating me like a queer animal from the circus,\" Butler related. \"My chance remarks were twisted and distorted to paint me in the worst light. . . . About fifty of the minor officials and correspondents of the newspapers became my loyal friends, but they had no influence in shaping the editorial point of view.\" By March angry Republican ward leaders were furious at Butler for disrupting their network of police control. They vig-orously applauded City Treasurer Thomas J. Watson at a meet-ing when he shouted, \"This country, as well as the Republican organization, would be a hell of a sight better off without Butler!\" The Philadelphia", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt:77:b0efeb4e84f4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 13819, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "plottoseizethewhitehouse.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "plottoseizethewhitehouse", "chunk_index": 78, "text": ".

They vig-orously applauded City Treasurer Thomas J. Watson at a meet-ing when he shouted, \"This country, as well as the Republican organization, would be a hell of a sight better off without Butler!\" The Philadelphia City Council closed ranks against him. \"My foolish notion that the laws of our country applied to rich and poor alike accounted for the growing feeling of antipathy toward me,\" he recalled later, adding, \"By the end of 1924 I had been cussed, discussed, boycotted, lied about, lied to, strung up, and reviled. Several times I was on the point of resigning. The only reason why I continued in my unpopular and uncomfort-able position was to see what the hell was going to happen next!\" Try as he might, he was unable to break the power of the ward bosses. In April he was forced to admit that be had been double-crossed by about half of his police lieutenants, who had bowed to ward-boss pressure to permit shuttered saloons, gambling houses, and speakeasies to reopen. Studying the structure, he found that every ward had one police station. The ward leader named the captain of the sta-tion, and the police thus belonged to the ward leader. In an <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *The Indispensable Man 87* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> attempt to destroy the power of the ward bosses, Butler now cut the stations down from forty-six to thirty-three. Infuriated politicians, racketeers, and realtors, who hated him for having cost them the rents of fifteen hundred closed brothels as well as the income from other illegally operated properties, joined forces to demand that Kendrick fire him. But nearly five thousand church congregations adopted resolu-tions in July demanding that the mayor give full support to the general. Added to this pressure were thousands of letters from women's clubs, civic groups, business organizations, and indi-viduals. Kendrick, alarmed at being caught between the voters and the brokers of power, wavered back and forth. A report that he was preparing to knuckle under to the politi-cal bosses brought another roar of protest from the citizenry. A mass meeting of four thousand Philadelphians resolved that Butler must be kept in office: \"Since General Butler has been in command here, more has been accomplished for the suppression of vice and crime than in any period of like duration in this city!\" They flooded Secretary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur with letters urging that Butler's leave of absence from the Marines be extended for another three years.

President Calvin Coolidge reluctantly agreed to extend the general's leave for one more year, but he pointed out to the citizens of Philadelphia that the Federal Government could not continue indefinitely to be responsible for solutions to local problems: \"The practice of detailing officers of the United States military forces to serve in civil capacities in the different states on leaves of absence is of doubtful propriety and should be em-ployed only in cases of emergency. . . . Local self-government cannot be furnished from the outside.\" Reappointed, by the end of the year Butler had raided almost 4,000 speakeasies, shutting down 2,566, and had seized over a thousand stills, arresting 10,000 violators of the Volstead Act. But to his dismay, political pressure in the court system resulted in only 2,000 indictments by the grand jury, with only 300 con-victions. Police magistrates, who were handpicked by the poli-ticians, imposed only token fines on all but 4 percent of arrested speakeasy operators. Struggling to get honest law enforcement, <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *88** **The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Butler complained to the press, was like submitting to Chinese water torture: \"Drops of water have been dripping on my head since I have been here. . . .Either I am unpopular, or the enforcement of the liquor laws is unpopular in this city. . . . When the people of Philadelphia or any other city stop playing the game of `Enforce the law against others but not against me,' they will begin to win the fight against lawlessness.\" He was bitter when he learned of a secret deal between the brewers of Philadelphia and the Republican State Campaign Committee. A royalty of two dollars for each barrel of illegal beer distributed was to be paid into the Republican campaign fund, provided the politicians put the White House under heavy pressure to recall Butler to duty with the Marines. Toward the end of 1925, whether this deal was responsible or not, Coolidge refused to extend Butler's leave. The general was ordered to report after the first of the year to command the Marine post at San Diego. With his recall assured, Mayor Kendrick now shrewdly sought to make points with pro-Butler voters by declaring that he wished it were possible to keep the general as Director of Public Safety for the remainder of his own administration.

A \"Keep Butler\" movement sprang up all over Philadelphia. Forced to go along with it, Kendrick told one mass meeting, \"To announce that General Butler is to leave his post here would be tantamount to inviting an army of criminals to Philadelphia.\" But the mayor lost no time in grooming his successor. Meanwhile Butler had become increasingly irked by the fact that the pressure of powerful hotels and the Hotel Association had kept their ballroom social affairs, at which liquor was served to young teen-age girls from socially prominent Philadelphia families, from being raided for liquor violations. Ordering a raid on a formal ball at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, he seized evidence showing that bootleg liquor was being served. Confronting Kendrick, he demanded that the mayor institute pad-lock proceedings against the Ritz-Carlton. \"And I mean the *whole *hotel,\" he insisted. \"Something must <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> The Indispensable Man 89 <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> he done to teach these big fellows that they must obey the law as well as the little fellows!\" A howl of outrage was heard in the ranks of the Republican party's wealthiest adherents. Politicians were threatened with a wholesale withdrawal of campaign contributions unless Butler was now unceremoniously dumped. Greatly upset, Kendrick urged him to \"lay off\" the big hotels. To the mayor's horror, Butler firmly announced his intention to organize a special po-lice squad in evening clothes to invade all Philadelphia hotels, and signal for raids whenever they found liquor-law violations. His fighting spirit was now thoroughly aroused. Although he longed to get back to his beloved Marine Corps, it rankled him to leave a mission incomplete. If he left Philadelphia now, he would have enforced the law against small operators who boot-legged liquor to the poor, but not against the big operators who made it available to the rich. His egalitarian nature pressed him to balance the scales. He also felt an obligation to the honest cops who had defied the ward bosses to support his fight against corruption. Once he was gone, he feared, they would be punished for their loyalty to him. He decided that he owed it to them to sacrifice his career in the Marine Corps to stay on and finish the job, especially since Kendrick had made it clear-or so Butler believed-that he needed and wanted him.

Appalled, the hotel owners of the city joined with local politicians in a demand that Kendrick fire Butler immediately. The mayor was reminded that the Hotel Association's coopera-tion with City Hall was absolutely essential for the success of a sesquicentennial celebration of American independence being planned for Philadelphia. Worried and upset, Kendrick called Butler to his office and told him, \"I don't want any resigned generals around me. You ought to go back to the Service where you belong. The President doesn't want you here.\" <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> *90** **The Plot to Seize the White House* <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> **13** <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> <![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]> Shocked at the mayor's spineless surrender, Butler stalked out, storming, \"Oh, hell, I can't talk to such a weak fish!\" Kendrick then fired him by phone. In choice Marine language, Butler told Kendrick exactly what he thought of him. Clearing his desk, the general withdrew a blue-steel Army Colt .q5 from it and inserted it in a holster engraved, \"To General Smedley D. Butler from W. Freeland Kendrick.\" \"Give him this letter of resignation and the pistol,\" he told his aide. \"He can publish the letter and he can do what he pleases with the gun. I'm going back to the troops!\" His letter of resignation declared, \"Last week I decided that it was in keeping with my promise to the police of Philadelphia that if they stood up with me, I would do everything in my power to remain in Philadelphia.... I am being dismissed from public service because I am making the greatest sacrifice any Marine can make, and I should, without any other ties, be of more service to the City of Philadelphia than I was before.\" He had been fired, he charged, because \"the gang that has ruled Philadelphia for many years\" had been out to get him, and did. The Philadelphia *Record; *which had consistently supported Butler during his two years as the city's supercop, declared, \"He was honest; that was taken for granted or he would not have been appointed. But he was 100 percent honest. We think we are doing the mayor no injustice in expressing the belief that this was a little more than he had counted on.\" Reviewing his experience in Philadelphia, Butler declared ironically, \"The fact the mayor didn't know me led to my being chosen.
