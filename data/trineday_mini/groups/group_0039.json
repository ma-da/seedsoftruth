overturn Roundup trial loss cites Monsanto reckless disregard for consumer safety Monsanto owner Bayer AG has lost another appeals court decision in the sweeping U S Roundup litigation continuing to struggle to find a way out from under the crush of tens of thousands of claims alleging that Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides cause cancer In a decision handed down on Monday the 1st Appellate District in the Court of Appeal for California rejected Monsanto s bid to overturn the trial loss in a case brought by husband and wife plaintiffs Alva and Alberta Pilliod We find that substantial evidence supports the jury s verdicts the court stated Monsanto s conduct evidenced reckless disregard of the health and safety of the multitude of unsuspecting consumers it kept in the dark This was not an isolated incident Monsanto s conduct involved repeated actions over a period of many years motivated by the desire for sales and profit The court specifically rejected the argument that federal law preempts such claims an argument Bayer has told investors offers a potential path out of the litigation Bayer has said it hopes it can get the U S Supreme Court to agree with its preemption argument In May 2019 a jury awarded the Pilliods more than 2 billion in punitive and compensatory damages after lawyers for the couple argued they both developed non Hodgkin lymphoma caused by their many years of using Roundup products The trial judge lowered the combined award to 87 million In appealing the loss Monsanto argued not only that the Pilliod claims were preempted by federal law but also that the jury s causation findings were flawed the trial court should not have admitted certain evidence and that the verdict is the product of attorney misconduct Monsanto also wanted the damage awards further slashed Court slams company In the appeals court decision the court left the award unchanged and said that Monsanto had not shown that federal law did preempt such claims as those made by the Pilliods The court also said there was substantial evidence that Monsanto acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others supporting the awarding of punitive damages The evidence showed that Monsanto failed to conduct adequate studies on glyphosate and Roundup thus impeding discouraging or distorting scientific inquiry concerning glyphosate and Roundup the court said The court also chastised Monsanto for not accurately presenting all of the record evidence in making its appeal But rather than fairly stating all the relevant evidence Monsanto ha s made a lopsided presentation that relies primarily on the evidence in its favor This type of presentation may work for a jury but it will not work for the Court of Appeal The court added The trial described in

Monsanto In yet another court loss for Monsanto owner Bayer AG an appeals court rejected the company s effort to overturn the trial victory notched by a California school groundskeeper who alleged exposure to Monsanto s glyphosate herbicides caused him to develop cancer though the court did say damages should be cut to 20 5 million The Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District of California said Monday that Monsanto s arguments were unpersuasive and Dewayne Lee Johnson was entitled to collect 10 25 million in compensatory damages and another 10 25 million in punitive damages That is down from a total of 78 million the trial judge allowed In our view Johnson presented abundant and certainly substantial evidence that glyphosate together with the other ingredients in Roundup products caused his cancer the court stated Expert after expert provided evidence both that Roundup products are capable of causing non Hodgkin s lymphoma and caused Johnson s cancer in particular The court further noted that there was overwhelming evidence that Johnson has suffered and will continue to suffer for the rest of his life significant pain and suffering The court said that Monsanto s argument that scientific findings about glyphosate s links to cancer constituted a minority view was not supported Notably the appeals court added that punitive damages were in order because there was sufficient evidence that Monsanto acted with willful and conscious disregard of others safety Mike Miller whose Virginia law firm represented Johnson at trial along with the Baum Hedlund Aristei Goldman firm of Los Angeles said he was cheered at the court s confirmation that Johnson developed cancer from his use of Roundup and that the court affirmed the award of punitive damages for Monsanto s willful misconduct Mr Johnson continues to suffer from his injuries We are proud to fight for Mr Johnson and his pursuit of justice Miller said Monsanto owes annual interest at the rate of 10 percent from April of 2018 until it pays the final judgment The reduction in damages is tied in part to the fact that doctors have told Johnson his cancer is terminal and he is not expected to live very much longer The court agreed with Monsanto that because compensatory damages are designed to compensate for future pain mental suffering loss of enjoyment of life physical impairment etc Johnson s short life expectancy legally means the future non economic damages awarded by the trial court must be reduced Brent Wisner one of Johnson s trial attorneys said the reduction in damages was the

that not only did Monsanto s herbicides cause Johnson to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma but that the company knew of the cancer risks and failed to warn Johnson The lawsuit involved two Monsanto glyphosate herbicide products Roundup and Ranger Pro The trial judge lowered the total verdict to 78 million but Monsanto appealed the reduced amount Johnson cross appealed to reinstate the 289 million verdict The Johnson trial was covered by media outlets around the world and put a spotlight on questionable Monsanto conduct Lawyers for Johnson presented jurors with internal company emails and other records showing Monsanto scientists discussing ghostwriting scientific papers to try to shore up support for the safety of the company s products along with communications detailing plans to discredit critics and to quash a government evaluation of the toxicity of glyphosate the key chemical in Monsanto s products Internal documents also showed that Monsanto expected the International Agency for Research on Cancer would classify glyphosate as a probable or possible human carcinogen in March of 2015 the classification was as a probable carcinogen and worked out a plan in advance to discredit the cancer scientists after they issued their classification Tens of thousands of plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against Monsanto making claims similar to Johnson s and two additional trials have taken place since the Johnson trial Both those trials also resulted in large verdicts against Monsanto Both are also under appeal In June Bayer said it had reached a settlement agreement with attorneys representing 75 percent of the roughly 125 000 filed and yet to be filed claims initiated by U S plaintiffs who blame exposure to Monsanto s Roundup for their development of non Hodgkin

appeals court to again cut Roundup damage award owed to California groundskeeper with cancer Bayer is asking a California appeals court to trim 4 million from the amount of money it owes a California groundskeeper struggling to survive cancer that a trial court found was caused by the man s exposure to Monsanto s Roundup herbicides In a petition for rehearing filed Monday with the Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District of California lawyers for Monsanto and its German owner Bayer AG asked the court to cut from 20 5 million to 16 5 million the damages awarded to Dewayne Lee Johnson The appeals court reached an erroneous decision based on a mistake of law according to the filing by Monsanto The issue turns on how long Johnson is expected to live Because evidence at trial found Johnson was expected to live no more than two years he should not receive money for future pain and suffering allocated for any longer than two years despite the fact that he continues to outlive predictions the company argues Under the calculations requested by Monsanto the court should cut from 4 million to 2 million the amount ordered for future non economic damages pain and suffering That would reduce the overall compensatory damages past and future to 8 253 209 While still insisting it should not owe any punitive damages if punitive damages are awarded they should be tallied at no more than a 1 to 1 ratio against the compensatory bringing the total to 16 506 418 Monsanto argues in its filing Johnson was initially awarded 289 million by a jury in August 2018 making him the first plaintiff to win at the trial level over claims that exposure to Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides causes non Hodgkin lymphoma and that Monsanto hid the risks The trial judge lowered the award to 78 million Monsanto appealed seeking either a new trial or a reduced award Johnson cross appealed seeking reinstatement of his full damage award The appeals court ruled last month that there was

settlement Chhabria wrote in the order Prior to the judge s order multiple parties filed notices of their own opposition to the Bayer plan citing major deviations from ordinary practices called for in the proposed settlement In response on Wednesday the group of lawyers who had structured the deal with Bayer filed a notice of withdrawal of their plan The proposed settlement plan for future class action litigation was separate from the settlement agreement Bayer made with lawyers for plaintiffs who have already filed cases and is designed to help Bayer contain and manage future liability Under

in the United States have claimed they developed NHL because of their exposure to Roundup or other Monsanto made glyphosate based herbicides Preemption Argument Bayer sees the preemption argument as critical to its ability to limit the ongoing litigation liability The company has made it clear that it hopes at some point to get a U S Supreme Court finding that under the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act FIFRA the U S Environmental Protection Agency s EPA position that Monsanto s herbicides are not likely to cause cancer essentially bars complaints that Monsanto didn t warn of any cancer risk Critics of that position point to a 2005 U S Supreme Court ruling in a case titled Bates v Dow Agrosciences which established that the EPA s approval of a product does not rule out claims of a failure to warn brought under state law Citing the law and the Bates precedent more than a dozen federal and state courts have rejected the preemption argument But some legal experts argue the rejections of the preemption argument in the Roundup litigation are flawed and believe Bayer has a solid defense on that issue If Bayer can ultimately get a U S Supreme Court win on the preemption question it could thwart the key claims brought by tens of thousands of plaintiffs and potentially save Bayer from significant ongoing legal liability costs In the first trial against Monsanto a unanimous jury awarded plaintiff Dewayne Johnson 289 million the plaintiff in the second trial was awarded 80 million and the jury in the third trial awarded more than 2 billion to husband

that there is no valid evidence of a cancer connection between its weed killing products and cancer Bayer said the move to stop selling the herbicides to consumers was to manage litigation risk and not because of any safety concerns The company said it will continue to sell its glyphosate based herbicides for commercial use and for use by farmers Bayer also said last week it was setting aside 4 5 billion on top of roughly 11 billion already earmarked for Roundup litigation settlements to cover potential long term exposure to liability associated with claims from cancer victims such as

prior trials that her analysis of several scientific studies shows that there is a credible link between glyphosate based herbicides such as Monsanto s Roundup and non Hodgkin s lymphoma The current

exposed Meanwhile plaintiffs attorneys continue to worry about what they believe to be geofencing by Monsanto Geofencing is a popular advertising technique that delivers specific messaging content to anyone within a specific geographic area designated by the company or group paying for the ad The area can be very small a mile radius around a specific address for instance Anyone within that designated area using an app on a smart phone such as a weather app or a game would then be delivered the ad Targeted individuals don t have to be searching for information it just appears on their smart phone Plaintiffs attorneys raised the issue in the Hardeman case and had concerns that Monsanto was pushing messaging to jurors through geofencing in the first Roundup cancer trial which was brought by groundskeeper Dewayne Lee Johnson In the Pilliod case the issue was discussed Thursday in court as the plaintiffs attorneys sought a judicial order to prohibit Monsanto from the tactic but the judge was skeptical and declined to issue such an order Here is part of the exchange All can be seen in the trial transcript PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEY BRENT WISNER Your Honor I think there s one and I

owner Bayer AG on Monday filed a petition with the U S Supreme Court seeking the high court s review of one of its trial losses in the nationwide Roundup cancer litigation The move is widely seen as Bayer s best hope for putting an end to claims that exposure to Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides such as the popular Roundup brand cause non Hodgkin lymphoma and the company failed to warn users of the risks The company has thus far lost three out of three trials and there are currently more than 100 000 existing plaintiffs as well as many more potential future plaintiffs expected to bring similar claims Bayer has been trying to settle the cases and come up with a plan to limit block or settle future claims Bayer s writ of certiorari asks the court to review the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in the case of Hardeman v Monsanto During the month long trial in 2019 lawyers for plaintiff Edwin Hardeman presented jurors with a range of scientific research showing cancer connections to Monsanto s herbicides as well as evidence of many Monsanto strategies aimed at suppressing the scientific information about the risks of its products Internal Monsanto documents showed the company s scientists had engaged in secretly ghost writing scientific papers that the company then used to help convince regulators of product safety The plaintiffs attorneys argued that Monsanto should have warned consumers about the risks that its products could cause cancer Lawyers in the other trials Monsanto lost presented similar arguments and evidence of cancer risk FIFRA fight Bayer has said it hopes the Supreme Court will agree with Bayer s position that the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act FIFRA which governs the registration distribution sale and use of pesticides in the United States preempts those failure to warn claims that are central to the Roundup lawsuits Because the Environmental Protection Agency EPA has approved labels with no cancer warning the failure to warn claims should be barred the company maintains The petition filed Monday urges the Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding the Hardeman trial loss on the grounds that FIFRA preempts a state law failure to warn claim where the warning cannot be added to a product without EPA approval and EPA has repeatedly concluded that the warning is not appropriate The petition also asks the court to address whether or not the Ninth Circuit s standard for admitting expert testimony is inconsistent with this Court s precedent and Federal Rule of Evidence 702 Bayer argues that the admission of expert testimony in the Hardeman case departed from federal standards enabling plaintiff s causation witnesses to provide unsupported testimony on the

the case Roundup s safety profile In its petition Bayer argues The Ninth Circuit s errors mean that a company can be severely punished for marketing a product without a cancer warning when the near universal scientific and regulatory consensus is that the product does not cause cancer and the responsible federal agency has forbidden such a warning Hardeman lawyer Aimee Wagstaff said her legal team had been preparing for Bayer s bid for Supreme Court review While paying out billions of dollars to settle claims Monsanto continues to refuse to pay Mr Hardeman s verdict That doesn t seem fair to Mr Hardeman Even so this is Monsanto s last chance Hail Mary Wagstaff said We are eager and ready to beat Monsanto at the Supreme Court and put this baseless preemption defense behind us once and for all Bayer cites broad impact The petition states that the decision in the Hardeman case which was part of the multidistrict litigation handled in federal court will undoubtedly influence still others pending across the country Bayer said in a statement The Petition underscores that consistent regulatory assessments in the U S and worldwide and the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence support the conclusion that glyphosate based herbicides are safe and not carcinogenic In light of the EPA s approval of the Roundup label without a cancer warning any state law failure to warn claims premised on such warning would plainly conflict with federal law and thus are preempted Courts across the U S have divided on this basic question of when federal law preempts state law which makes review by the U S Supreme Court both important and necessary Indeed it has been 16 years since the Supreme Court ruled on FIFRA preemption and the prior case did not involve a warning that EPA had rejected Lawyers for Hardeman did not respond to a request for comment Bayer has so far said it has earmarked more than 16 billion toward settling the Roundup litigation", "chunk_id":

after Bayer bought Monsanto for 63 billion and almost immediately saw share prices plummet due to the Roundup liability Bayer announced that it will pay 10 1 billion to 10 9 billion total to resolve roughly 75 percent of the claims by an estimated 125 000 people who allege exposure to Monsanto s Roundup weed killers caused them to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma The deal includes plaintiffs who have retained attorneys with the intent to sue but whose cases have not yet been filed Bayer said Within that total a payment of 8 8 billion to 9 6 billion will resolve the current litigation and 1 25 billion is being set aside to support potential future litigation the company said The plaintiffs included in the settlement are those signed with the law firms that have been leading the Roundup

fought litigation and a year of intense mediation I am glad to see our clients will now be compensated said Mike Miller of the Miller law firm The Miller firm and the Baum Hedlund firm worked together to win the first case to go to trial that of California groundskeeper Dewayne Lee Johnson Andrus Wagstaff won the second trial and The Miller Firm won the third case to go to trial In all the three trials resulted in jury verdicts totaling more than 2 3 billion though the trial judges in each case lowered the verdicts The juries in all three trials found that Monsanto s glyphosate herbicides such as Roundup caused non Hodgkin lymphoma and that Monsanto covered up the risks and failed to warns users Each of the three trial verdicts are going through the appeals process now and Bayer said the plaintiffs in those cases are not included in the settlement Bayer said future Roundup claims will be part of a class agreement subject to approval by Judge Vince Chhabria of the U S District

his orchard More than 100 other farmers have made similar legal claims Bayer said it will pay up to a total of 400 million to resolve the multi district dicamba litigation that is pending in the U S District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri with claims for the 2015 2020 crop years Claimants will be required to provide proof of damage to crop yields and evidence that it was due to

patients The Bayer AG annual shareholders meeting got underway Tuesday in Germany drawing the attention of not only investors and analysts but also activists lawyers and cancer patients who want to see Bayer make amends for alleged misdeeds by Monsanto which Bayer bought two years ago The meeting was to be an in person event in Bonn Germany but due to fears about large gatherings that could spread the Covid 19 virus Bayer instead is hosting a video webcast of the meeting On Monday the company announced a good start to 2020 reporting higher sales and profits through all divisions driven in part by strong demand within its Consumer Health division related to the Covid 19 pandemic The shareholders meeting comes as Bayer is facing legal claims in the United States brought by roughly 52 500 plaintiffs alleging that exposure to Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides such as Roundup caused them or their loved ones to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL They allege Monsanto was aware of the risks and should have warned consumers but instead sought to manipulate the scientific record and regulators Three trials have been held to date and Bayer lost all three as juries awarded more than 2 billion to four plaintiffs though trial judges later reduced the awards The trial losses angered investors and pushed share prices to the lowest levels in roughly seven years erasing more than 40 percent of Bayer s market value at one point Some investors called for Bayer CEO Werner Baumann to be ousted for championing the Monsanto acquisition which closed in June of 2018 just as the first trial was getting underway Bayer and plaintiffs attorneys have been engaged in settlement talks for the last year and appeared close to a deal that would resolve a majority of the claims before the

has a high tendency to spread to the central nervous system and can also involve the liver spleen and bone marrow according to the court filings Ezra s mother Destiny Clark is the plaintiff in the case which was heard in Los Angeles County Superior Court A different Roundup trial is underway in San Bernardino County Superior Court Ezra Clark was directly exposed to Roundup many times as he accompanied his mother while she sprayed Roundup to kill weeds around the property where the family lived according to court documents Ezra has autism and his mother said it calmed him to play outdoors while she worked in the yard which meant he often played in areas freshly sprayed with Roundup according to the court filings Fletch Trammell lead attorney for Clark said his case was subject to a bifurcation order that organized the case into two phases In the first phase he was limited to presenting evidence that focused on the child s personal exposure to Roundup and whether or not it could have been enough to have contributed to his disease The case would have proceeded to a second phase had the plaintiff won the first phase but the loss in the first phases ends the trial This was nothing like any of the other three trials Trammell said The jury was asked to address one key question in the first phase Whether or not the child s exposure to Roundup was a substantial factor in his development of Burkitt s lymphoma In a 9 to 3 decision the jury found that it was not Trammell said the jury decision was because the jury doubted the child s exposure to Roundup could have been enough to cause cancer The decision did not address the larger question of the alleged carcinogenicity of Roundup overall he said But Bayer which bought Monsanto in 2018 as the first Roundup trial was getting underway said the jury s decision was in line with scientific research showing glyphosate the main ingredient in Roundup is safe and does not cause cancer The jury carefully considered the science applicable to this case and determined that Roundup was not the cause of his illness the company said in a statement 80 hours During the trial Trammel presented evidence indicating Ezra was

Bayer AG is making progress toward a sweeping settlement of thousands of U S lawsuits brought by people alleging they or their loved ones developed cancer after exposure to Monsanto s Roundup herbicides Recent correspondence from plaintiffs lawyers to their clients underscored that progress confirming a large percentage of plaintiffs are opting to participate in the settlement despite complaints by many plaintiffs that they are facing unfairly small payout proposals By some calculations the average gross settlement will leave little to no compensation perhaps a few thousand dollars for individual plaintiffs after attorneys fees are paid and certain insured medical costs are reimbursed Nevertheless according to a letter sent to plaintiffs in late November by one of the lead law firms in the litigation more than 95 percent of the eligible claimants decided to participate in the settlement plan negotiated by the firm with Bayer A settlement administrator now has 30 days to review the cases and confirm the plaintiffs eligibility to receive settlement funds according to the correspondence People can choose to opt out of the settlement and take their claims to mediation followed by binding arbitration if they wish or try to find a new lawyer who would take their case to trial Those plaintiffs could have a difficult time finding a lawyer to help them take their case to trial because the law firms agreeing to the settlements with Bayer have agreed not to try any more cases or assist in future trials One plaintiff who asked not to be identified by name due to the confidentiality of the settlement proceedings said he is opting out of the settlement in hopes of obtaining more money through mediation or a future trial He said he requires ongoing tests and treatments for his cancer and the proposed settlement structure would leave him nothing to cover those ongoing costs Bayer wants a release by paying as little as possible without going to trial he said The rough estimate on average gross payouts per plaintiff is about 165 000 lawyers and plaintiffs involved in the discussions have said But some plaintiffs could receive far more and some less depending upon the details of their case There are many criteria determining who can participate in the settlement and how much money that person may receive To be eligible the Roundup user has to be

NHL Plaintiffs diagnosed with a type of NHL called Primary Central Nervous System CNS lymphoma receive a 10 percent boost to their points tally for example People can also have points deducted based

blood cancers before using Roundup their points are cut by 30 percent If the span of time between a claimant s Roundup exposure and the diagnosis of NHL was less than two years the points are cut 20 percent The settlement funds should begin to flow to participants in the spring with final payments hopefully made by summer according to lawyers involved Plaintiffs can also apply to be part of an

endangers access to justice for millions of people in the proposed class would prevent Monsanto s victims from holding it accountable and would reward Monsanto in numerous respects The group reiterated in its filing the fear that if Bayer s proposed settlement is approved it will set a dangerous precedent for plaintiffs in future unrelated cases It will hurt the proposed class members not help them This type of settlement would also provide an untenable template for other corporate tortfeasors to avoid appropriate liability and consequences for their conduct the proposed class settlement is not how a system of justice works and thus such a settlement should never be approved The 2 billion proposed settlement is aimed at future cases and is separate from the 11 billion Bayer

period If Bayer elects not to continue the compensation fund after the initial settlement period it will pay an additional 200 million as an end payment into the compensation fund the settlement summary states Substantial compensation offered The law firms that drafted the agreement with Bayer said in their filing to the court that the settlement is structured to provide potential future plaintiffs with what most serves their interests including an option for substantial compensation if they develop non Hodgkin lymphoma The plan calls for the establishment of a compensation fund to make awards of between 10 000 and 200 000 per individual class member Accelerated Payment Awards of 5 000 would be available on an expedited basis requiring just a showing of exposure and diagnosis Those people first exposed to Roundup products at least 12 months prior to their diagnosis would be qualified for awards Awards of more than 200 000 could be made for extraordinary circumstances Those qualified class members who were diagnosed with NHL before January 1 2015 would not receive awards more than 10 000 according to the plan The settlement would provide free legal advice and provide support to assist class members in navigating registering and applying for Settlement benefits Additionally the proposal states that the settlement will fund medical and scientific research into the diagnosis and treatment of NHL Notably the plan states that no one will lose their right to sue unless they choose to accept compensation from the compensation fund and no one needs to make that choice until that individual class member is diagnosed with NHL They would not be able to seek punitive damages but could seek other compensation Any class members who do not file a claim and accept

soon develop symptoms the NBFA filing states The NBFA wants to see Roundup products removed from commerce or other changes made to protect farmers the filing states The concerns of the NBFA need to be addressed by the court particularly as Bayer looks to settle a class action with a set of attorneys who purport to be representing the future interests of all farmers who have been exposed to Roundup

farmers cannot spray over their fields with the dicamba products they will be largely defenseless against weeds resistant to other herbicides causing potentially significant financial consequences from yield losses When Monsanto BASF and DuPont Corteva rolled out their dicamba herbicides a few years ago they claimed the products would not volatize and drift into neighboring fields as older versions of dicamba weed killing products were known to do But those assurances proved false amid widespread complaints of dicamba drift damage More than one million acres of crops not genetically engineered to tolerate dicamba were reported damaged last year in 18 states the federal court noted in its ruling The EPA s mission is to protect human health and the environment said National Family Farm Coalition board president Jim Goodman Their contempt for this mission could not be more clearly expressed than their flagrant disregard of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling to stop over the top applications of dicamba immediately to prevent millions of acres of farmers crops from being destroyed In February a Missouri jury ordered Bayer and BASF to pay a peach farmer 15 million in

William Shapiro quizzed Monsanto toxicologist Donna Farmer about emails and documents dating back to the late 1990s that focused on research and the company s handling of that research into whether or not the company s herbicide products could cause cancer In one line of questioning Shapiro asked Farmer about emails in which she and other company scientists discussed the company s response to outside research that concluded the company s glyphosate based herbicides were genotoxic meaning they damaged human DNA Genotoxicity is an indicator that a chemical or other substance may cause cancer Shapiro focused during one series of questions on work done by a scientist named James Parry who Monsanto hired as a consultant in the 1990s to weigh in on the genotoxicity concerns about Roundup being raised at the time by outside scientists Parry s report agreed there appeared to be potential genotoxic activity with glyphosate and recommended that Monsanto do additional studies on its products In an internal Monsanto email dating from September 1999 written to Farmer and other company scientists a Monsanto scientist named William Heydens said this about Parry s report let s step back and look at what we are really trying to achieve here We want to find develop someone who is comfortable with the genetox profile of glyphosate Roundup and can be influential with regulators and

hole referred to problems with communication not about any cancer risk She also said that she and other Monsanto scientists did not have concerns with the safety of glyphosate or Roundup but did have concerns about how to respond to paper and research by outside scientists raising such concerns Shapiro pressed Farmer on her reaction to Parry s finding You thought it would be okay on behalf of Monsanto to receive information as you did from Dr Parry that this Roundup product was genotoxic or could be you thought it would be okay to go ahead and continue to sell the product correct Farmer replied We didn t agree with Professor Parry s conclusions at the time that it may be could be capable of being genotoxic We had other evidence We had regulators who had agreed with our studies and conclusions that it was not genotoxic Her answer was interrupted as Shapiro objected saying he was asking a yes or no question and Farmer s attempt to respond beyond that should be stricken The judge agreed and struck part of the response Continuing his questioning Shapiro asked Well that didn t work out to have Dr Parry be the spokesperson for Monsanto did it Dr Farmer I would disagree with you

couple owned Now the roles are reversed as Elaine must help Chris face his own cancer Chris Stevick who often mixed Roundup for his wife and tested the sprayer used to dispense the weed killer was diagnosed last month with chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL a type of non Hodgkin lymphoma Unlike Elaine s aggressive type of NHL known as central nervous system lymphoma Chris s cancer is a type that tends to grow slowly He was diagnosed after a physical examination showed abnormalities in his blood and prompted further tests The diagnosis has prompted a scramble among lawyers involved in the sprawling Roundup products liability litigation given that the Stevick s lawsuit against Monsanto is set as the next federal case to go to trial With the trial date of Feb 24 2020 looming Elaine Stevick s lawyers asked Monsanto s attorneys if the company would agree that Chris Stevick s cancer claims could be joined with his wife s for the February trial in San Francisco The attorneys argue that at the very least Chris Stevick s diagnosis is admissible evidence at his wife s trial as additional proof of their claim that Roundup exposure can cause non Hodgkin lymphoma Monsanto s attorneys oppose the joining of the claims and say that Elaine Stevick s trial should only proceed in February if there is no mention made of her husband s cancer Alternatively Monsanto requests that the February trial be delayed and the company be given time to do discovery into Chris Stevick s diagnosis The issue is to be discussed in a case management conference Thursday which the Stevicks plan to attend U S District Judge Vince Chhabria said ahead of the hearing that he is tentatively of the view that a continuance of the trial will be necessary if the couple wants to try their claims together He also said that if Elaine Stevick proceeds on her exposure claims alone evidence of her husband s cancer diagnosis will likely be inadmissible If the judge confirms that joining the claims would indeed require a continuance Elaine Stevick will choose to proceed on her own in February said attorney Mike Miller Earlier this year another husband and wife suffering from cancer Alva and Alberta Pilliod were awarded more than 2 billion in damages in their lawsuit against Monsanto though the judge in the case lowered the damage award to 87 million The Pilliod trial was the third Roundup

involved in more than one of the cases and all have overlapping expert witnesses setting up organizational and resource challenges for both sides Multiple trials that had been set for this fall were delayed until next year In the meantime both sides of the litigation are keeping an eye on the California Appellate Court where lawyers for plaintiff Dewayne Lee Johnson and lawyers for Monsanto are awaiting a date for oral arguments in their cross appeals Monsanto is seeking to overturn the unanimous jury decision handed down against the company in August 2018 The trial judge in that case lowered the jury award from 289 million to 78 million and Johnson is appealing for the reinstatement of the full 289 million Johnson was the first to go to trial against Monsanto and his victory sent share prices in Bayer plummeting just two months after Bayer closed the purchase of Monsanto in June 2018 Johnson was granted trial preference due to predictions by his doctors that he did not have long to live Johnson has outlived those predictions though his health continues to decline As the litigation drags on several plaintiffs have died or are nearing death or have suffered such extreme

for Monsanto owner Bayer AG and for plaintiffs suing Monsanto told a federal judge on Thursday that they were continuing to make progress in settling sweeping nationwide litigation brought by people who claim Monsanto s Roundup caused them to develop cancer In a video hearing Bayer lawyer William Hoffman told U S District Judge Vince Chhabria the company had reached deals or was close to reaching deals to resolve more than 3 000 lawsuits that are grouped together in multidistrict litigation MDL filed in U S District Court for the Northern District of California The company separately has already settled thousands of cases outside the MDL cases that have been proceeding through state courts But controversy and conflict have dogged the overall settlement offers with allegations from some plaintiffs firms that Bayer reneged on agreements reached months ago and some plaintiffs firms unwilling to agree to what they consider inadequate offers from Bayer There was no discussion of those complaints however in Thursday s hearing with both sides expressing optimistic views The company has moved forward and finalized several agreements with firms we re also hopefully going to finalize additional agreements in the next several days Hoffman told the judge Where we are right now these figures are somewhat estimates but I think they are reasonably close There are approximately 1 750 cases that are subject to agreements between the company and law firms and another approximately 1 850 to 1 900 cases that are in various stages of discussion right now Hoffman said We are working to put in place a program to accelerate discussions and hopefully bring agreements to fruition with those firms Plaintiffs lawyer Brent Wisner told the judge it was important to note that there remain a handful of cases within the MDL that are not settled yet But he said We anticipate they will be shortly Judge Chhabria said that given the progress he will continue a stay of the Roundup litigation until November 2 but that he will start moving cases to trial if they are not resolved by that point Bayer Bad Dealing Alleged The cooperative tone expressed in Thursday s hearing was a far cry from a hearing held last month when plaintiffs attorney Aimee Wagstaff told Judge Chhabria that Bayer was not honoring tentative settlement agreements made in March and intended for finalization in July Bayer announced in June that it had reached a 10 billion settlement with U S law firms to resolve most of more than 100 000 Roundup cancer claims But at that time the only major

plan to delay any new Roundup cancer claims for years and shift the key question of whether or not the weed killer causes cancer from a jury to a hand picked panel of scientists faces potential opposition from some of the plaintiffs attorneys who initiated and led the mass tort claims against Roundup maker Monsanto sources close to the litigation said Several members of the lead law firms who won three out of three trials pitting cancer patients against Monsanto are considering challenging the terms of a proposed class action settlement negotiated between Monsanto owner Bayer AG and a small team of lawyers who have not previously been at the forefront of the Roundup litigation the sources said The class action settlement proposal is an element of the sweeping 10 billion Roundup litigation settlement Bayer announced June 24 In each of the trials held to date juries found that the weight of scientific evidence proved that Roundup exposure caused the plaintiffs to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL and that Monsanto covered up the risks But under the proposal that question would go to a five member science panel not a jury It s basically depriving a plaintiff of their constitutional right to a jury trial said one source close to the litigation The p roposed class settlement would apply to anyone exposed to Roundup who had not filed a lawsuit or retained a lawyer as of June 24 2020 regardless of whether or not that person already had been diagnosed with cancer they believe was due to Roundup exposure The plan was put together by Bayer and the law firms of Lieff Cabraser Heimann Bernstein Audet Partners The Dugan Law Firm and lawyer Samuel Issacharoff Reiss Professor of Constitutional Law at New York University School of Law The agreement was reached after nearly one year of unrelenting efforts of negotiations lawyer Elizabeth Cabraser said in a declaration to the court supporting the proposed class settlement It would set a standstill period in which plaintiffs in the class cannot file new litigation related to Roundup And it calls for class members to release any claims against Monsanto for punitive damages and for medical monitoring related to Roundup exposure and NHL Notably the plan states that rather than go forward with another jury trial a panel of scientists will first be set up to determine the right answer to the threshold question of whether or not there is a causal link between Roundup and NHL The plan calls for Bayer to pay up to 150 million for the fees and costs of the attorneys involved and class representative service

emergency chemical giants BASF and DuPont have asked a federal court to allow them to intervene in a case in which the court earlier this month ordered their dicamba herbicides to be immediately banned along with a dicamba product made by Monsanto owner Bayer AG The action by the chemical companies follows a June 3 ruling by the U S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that said the Environmental Protection Agency EPA had violated the law when it approved the dicamba products developed by Monsanto Bayer BASF and DuPont owned by Corteva Inc The court ordered an immediate ban on use of each of the company s dicamba products finding that the EPA substantially understated the risks of the dicamba herbicides and failed entirely to acknowledge other risks The EPA flouted that order however telling farmers they could continue to spray the herbicides in question through the end of July The consortium of farm and consumer groups that originally filed the case against the EPA rushed back to court last week asking for an emergency order holding the EPA in contempt The court gave the EPA until the end of the day Tuesday June 16 to respond Uproar in Farm Country The order banning the companies dicamba products has triggered an uproar in farm country because many soybean and cotton farmers planted millions of acres of dicamba tolerant crops developed by Monsanto with the intent of treating weeds in those fields with the dicamba herbicides made by the three companies The dicamba crop system provides for farmers to plant their fields with dicamba tolerant crops which they can then spray over the top with dicamba weed killer The system has both enriched the companies selling the seeds and chemicals and and helped farmers growing the special dicamba tolerant cotton and soy deal with stubborn weeds that are resistant to glyphosate based Roundup products But for the large number of farmers who do not plant the genetically engineered dicamba tolerant crops widespread use of dicamba herbicides has meant damage and crop losses because dicamba tends to volatize and drift long distances where it can kill crops trees and shrubs that are not genetically altered to withstand the chemical The companies claimed their new versions of dicamba would not volatize and drift as older versions of dicamba weed killing products were known to do But those assurances proved false amid widespread complaints of dicamba drift damage More than one million acres of crop damage was reported last year in 18 states the federal court noted in its ruling Many

facility in Beaumont Texas that currently operates 24 hours a day nearly continuously through the year if it is not able to produce its dicamba herbicide brand called Engenia BASF has spent 370 million in recent years improving the plant and employs 170 people there the company said Noting significant investments in its product BASF also told the court that there is enough of its product currently throughout its customer channel to treat 26 7 million acres of soybeans and cotton BASF has an additional 44 million worth of the Engenia dicamba product in its possession enough to treat 6 6 million acres of soybeans and cotton the company said DuPont Corteva made a similar argument telling the court in its filing that the ban directly harms the company as well as the many farmers across this country that are in the midst of the growing season It will damage the company s reputation if its herbicide is banned the company told the court Moreover DuPont Corteva expects to generate significant revenues from the sales of its dicamba herbicide called FeXapan and will lose that money if the ban is enforced the company said Monsanto was active in the case supporting the EPA

lawyers say Thousands of farmers from multiple states are expected to join mass tort litigation pending in federal court over claims that weed killing products developed by the former Monsanto Co and other chemical companies are destroying and contaminating crops including organic production a group of lawyers and farmers said on Wednesday The number of farmers seeking legal representation to file suit against Monsanto and BASF has surged over the last week and a half after a staggering 265 million jury award to a Missouri peach farmer who alleged the two companies were to blame for the loss of his livelihood according to Joseph Peiffer of the Peiffer Wolf Carr Kane law firm Peiffer said more than 2 000 farmers are likely to become plaintiffs There are already over 100 farmers making claims against the companies that have been combined in multidistrict litigation in U S District Court in Cape Girardeau Missouri Earlier this month the bellwether trial for that litigation ended with a unanimous jury awarding the family owned Bader Farms 15 million in compensatory damages and 250 million in punitive damages to be paid by Bayer AG the German company that bought Monsanto in 2018 and by BASF The jury concluded that Monsanto and BASF conspired in actions they knew would lead to widespread crop damage because they expected it would increase their own profits We now have the road map to get justice for dicamba victims The Bader verdict in Missouri sent a clear signal that you can t profit off of hurting innocent farmers and get away with it said Peiffer The crop damage research and increasing farmer complaints forecast a much bigger problem than Monsanto Bayer and BASF want to admit U S Right to Know asked the Environmental Protection Agency EPA which approved the dicamba herbicides despite scientific evidence of the risks to provide a national tally for the total number of dicamba drift complaints But while the EPA said it was taking the reports very seriously it declined to provide a tally and said it was up to state agencies to handle such complaints The EPA also indicated it was not certain the damage reported by farmers was in fact due to dicamba The

obtained hundreds of internal Monsanto and BASF corporate records demonstrating the companies were aware of the harm their products would create even as they publicly professed the opposite He said one BASF document referred to dicamba damage complaints as a ticking time bomb that has finally exploded Bader and the other farmers allege that Monsanto was negligent in rolling out genetically engineered cotton and soybeans that could survive being sprayed with dicamba herbicides because it was known that using the crops and chemicals as designed would lead to damage Dicamba has been used by farmers since the 1960s but with limits that took into account the chemical s propensity to drift far from where it was sprayed When Monsanto s popular glyphosate weed killing products such as Roundup started losing effectiveness due to widespread weed resistance Monsanto decided to launch a dicamba cropping system similar to its popular Roundup Ready system which paired glyphosate tolerant seeds with glyphosate herbicides Farmers buying the new genetically engineered dicamba tolerant seeds could more easily treat stubborn weeds by spraying entire fields with dicamba even during warm growing months without harming their crops according to Monsanto which announced a dicamba collaboration with BASF in 2011 The companies said their new dicamba herbicides would be less volatile and less prone to drift than old formulations of dicamba But they refused to allow for independent scientific testing The EPA approved the use of Monsanto s dicamba herbicide XtendiMax in 2016 BASF developed its own dicamba herbicide that it calls Engenia Both XtendiMax and Engenia were first sold in the United States in 2017 DuPont also introduced a dicamba herbicide and could also face multiple farmer lawsuits according to the plaintiffs lawyers In their legal claims farmers allege that they have experienced damage both from the drift of old versions of dicamba and drifting newer versions as well The farmers claim that the companies hoped fears of drift damage would force farmers to buy the special GMO dicamba tolerant seeds in order to protect their cotton and soybean fields

Stephens from Yucaipa California was diagnosed with non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL in 2017 and has suffered from numerous health complications amid multiple rounds of chemotherapy since then Because of her poor health a judge in December granted Stephens a trial preference meaning her case was expedited after her lawyers informed the court that Stephens is in a perpetual state of pain and losing cognition and memory Several other cases have either already been granted preference trial dates or are seeking trial dates for other plaintiffs including at least two children suffering from NHL the plaintiffs allege was caused by exposure to Roundup products Monsanto was purchased by Bayer AG in 2018 and is no longer a stand alone company but is the named defendant in ongoing litigation which began in 2015 after cancer experts consulted by a unit of the World Health Organization determined glyphosate the active ingredient in Monsanto s Roundup is a probable human carcinogen with a particular association to NHL Some old evidence some new The Stephens case is expected to involve many of the same expert witnesses and same documents and deposition testimony that helped plaintiffs win the prior trials said Stephens lawyer Fletch Trammell Two new experts who have not testified previously in Roundup trials will be called however said Trammell They are Barry Boyd an oncologist from Yale Cancer Center and Luoping Zhang an adjunct professor of toxicology at the School of Public Health at the University of California Berkeley Zhang is the lead author of a meta analysis published in 2019 that determined research showed a compelling link between exposures to glyphosate based herbicides such as Roundup and increased risk for NHL The analysis found that people with high exposures to the popular pesticides have a 41 percent increased risk of developing NHL Monsanto has long maintained that there is no legitimate scientific research showing a definitive association between glyphosate and NHL or any type of cancer A 2020 meta analysis could be useful to Monsanto s defense That report concluded that there is no overall evidence of an increased risk for NHL in

manipulation of scientific literature about its herbicides these emails detail the inner battle within a major scientific publishing house over how it should confront Monsanto s covert meddling They

September 2016 as an Independent Review of the carcinogenic potential of the weed killing agent glyphosate the main ingredient in Monsanto s Roundup herbicide and other brands The five papers published as part of the review directly contradicted the findings of the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC which in 2015 found glyphosate to be a probable human carcinogen The 16 authors of the papers concluded that the weight of evidence showed the weed killer was unlikely to pose any carcinogenic risk to people At the end of the papers the authors stated that their conclusions were free of Monsanto s intervention Underscoring the supposed independence of the work the declaration of interest section stated Neither any Monsanto company employees

months out of the headlines lawyers for both sides of the nationwide Roundup cancer litigation are gearing up for overlapping trials in the new year as several more cancer patients seek to blame Monsanto for their diseases Six trials are currently set to take place starting in January with one in February two in March and additional trials scheduled almost every month from April through October 2021 Thousands of additional plaintiffs still are working to get trial dates set for their claims The plaintiffs in the upcoming January trials include two children who were stricken by non Hodgkin lymphoma allegedly after being repeatedly exposed to Monsanto herbicides at very young ages Also set for January is the trial for a woman named Sharlean Gordon who has suffered several debilitating recurrences of her cancer Another trial will present the claims of five plaintiffs who claim Monsanto s herbicides caused their cancers Notably two of the trials in January will take place in the St Louis Missouri area where Monsanto was headquartered for decades before its acquisition in June 2018 by Germany s Bayer AG Those two trials will be the first to go before jurors in Monsanto s home town Gordon s case was supposed to go to trial in the area last August but was postponed as were others set for the second half of 2019 as Bayer and plaintiffs attorneys initiated settlement talks It is still possible that some sort of settlement individual case specific or larger could happen before January but the lawyers on both sides are preparing for a schedule that presents numerous logistical challenges Each trial is expected to last several weeks and not only are some lawyers involved in trying cases with overlapping trial schedules but a small group of expert witnesses will be testifying in multiple cases taking place at the same time Three trials have taken place so far in the sprawling mass tort litigation which began in 2015 after the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC classified a chemical called glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen with a particular association to non Hodgkin lymphoma Since the 1970s glyphosate has been the active ingredient in Monsanto branded herbicides and is currently considered the most widely used herbicide in the world Plaintiffs attorneys say that the current line up of cases represent even

patients There was renewed talk of a potential settlement this week between Bayer AG and tens of thousands of cancer patients as a key court hearing looms next week According to a report in Bloomberg lawyers for Bayer have reached verbal agreements with U S lawyers representing at least 50 000 plaintiffs who are suing Monsanto over claims that Roundup and other Monsanto herbicides caused the plaintiffs to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma The details as reported by Bloomberg appear to be mostly unchanged from prior verbal agreements between Bayer and plaintiffs attorneys that fell apart during the Coronavirus related courthouse closings With the courthouses still closed trial dates have been postponed taking the pressure off Bayer But a new pressure point looms with next week s hearing in the appeal of the first Roundup cancer trial The California Court of Appeal First Appellate District is set to hear oral arguments on cross appeals in the case of Johnson v Monsanto on June 2 That case which pitted California groundskeeper Dewayne Lee Johnson against Monsanto resulted in a 289 million damage award for Johnson in August 2018 The jury found not only that Monsanto s Roundup and related glyphosate based brands presented a substantial danger to people using them but that there was clear and convincing evidence that Monsanto s officials acted with malice or oppression in failing to adequately warn of the risks The trial judge in the Johnson case later lowered the damages to 78 5 million Monsanto appealed even the reduced award and Johnson cross appealed seeking reinstatement of the full jury award In appealing the verdict Monsanto asked the court to either reverse the trial decision and enter a judgment for Monsanto or reverse and remand the case for a new trial At the very least Monsanto asked the appeals court to reduce the portion of the jury award for future noneconomic damages from 33 million to 1 5 million and to wipe out the punitive damages altogether The appeals court judges gave an early hint about how they were leaning on the case notifying lawyers for the two sides that they should be prepared to discuss the question of damages in the June 2 hearing Plaintiffs attorneys have taken that as an encouraging sign that the judges may not be planning to order a new trial Under the terms of the settlement that has been discussed for the last several months Bayer would pay out a total of 10 billion to bring closure to cases held by several large firms but would not agree to put warning labels on its glyphosate based weed killers

proceedings Following Tuesdays jury finding that Roundup use caused plaintiff Edwin Hardeman s cancer the second phase of Hardeman V Monsanto began this morning in California with a shift away from the scientific evidence and on to allegations that Monsanto has spent years suppressing information about the dangers of its glyphosate based herbicides While Hardeman s lead counsel Aimee Wagstaff was sanctioned in the first phase for barely giving a nod to such claims in the second phase the focus is squarely on Monsanto s conduct in studying manufacturing and selling its popular Roundup products Roundup has been Monsanto s billion dollar baby for decades Wagstaff said in an interview Wednesday morning The evidence demonstrates Monsanto was far more interested in protecting its bottom line or Roundup s continued sales than making sure the product was safe In the meantime people like Mr Hardeman got cancer and are dying We are confident the jury will do the right thing in phase two and send Monsanto a message it needs to hear The jury verdict finding Roundup causes cancer is the second such jury determination in seven months and indicates Bayer which purchased Monsanto last summer has a hard road ahead defending against thousands of plaintiffs who all claim exposure to Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides caused their cancers Another trial gets underway next week in Oakland California Bayer shares fell more than 12 in early trading Wednesday after the jury s determination that Roundup was a substantial factor in causing Hardeman s cancer Judge Vince Chhabria plans to continue to keep a tight rein on what the jury will be allowed to hear however He generally has agreed with requests from Monsanto to prohibit evidence about Monsanto s actions after 2012 the year Hardeman stopped using Roundup The rationale is that the company s actions after the plaintiff stopped using the product have no bearing on Hardeman s development of non Hodgkin lymphoma Plaintiff s attorneys argued that there are many internal Monsanto emails dated after 2012 that illustrate a pattern of behavior showing how the company has long worked to ghostwrite scientific papers manipulate regulators and attack and silence critics That evidence is critical to establishing Monsanto s liability and damages the plaintiff s attorneys have told Chhabria In a discussion Tuesday about the evidence for the second phase the judge indicated he sees a middle ground saying conduct that occurred post 2012 that sheds light on what was happening pre 2012 should generally be

Monsanto records show the company s role in ghostwriting an article that appeared on Forbes contributors platform and they show that the company was behind a story published by Reuters in 2017 that

Gilles Éric Séralini after publication of his 2012 study findings about rats fed water dosed with Roundup Internal Monsanto records show a coordinated effort to get the Seralini paper retracted including this email string Monsanto employees apparently were so proud of what they called a multimedia event that was designed for maximum negative publicity against Seralini that they designated it as an achievement worth recognition The plaintiff s attorneys will also not be able to introduce evidence of Monsanto s efforts to kill a toxicity review of glyphosate by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry The judge is allowing portions of a 2015 internal Monsanto email in which company scientist Bill Heydens discusses plans to ghostwrite a series of new scientific papers

Bayer s latest attempt to limit its legal liability from future cancer claims associated with its glyphosate based herbicides citing numerous glaring flaws in a settlement proposed to apply to Roundup users who have not yet sued the company but may want to do so in the future Saying parts of the plan were clearly unreasonable and unfair to cancer sufferers who would be part of the class settlement U S Judge Vince Chhabria castigated Bayer and the small group of lawyers who put the plan together in conjunction with Bayer He pointed out that the company has been losing trials left and right in claims brought by people suffering from non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL who alleged exposure to Monsanto s Roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides were the cause Bayer has owned Monsanto since 2018 and has been struggling to defend the cancer claims ever since Cancer victims have won three trials held to date and tens of thousands of other plaintiffs have filed lawsuits alleging exposure to Monsanto s herbicides caused them to develop NHL while Monsanto spent decades hiding the risks Elizabeth Cabraser one of the lawyers who structured the settlement plan said the proponents were disappointed by the ruling and continue to believe that a multi billion dollar class settlement that includes free legal services and substantial compensation to claimants NHL diagnostic assistance research into NHL treatment and Roundup label reform to inform users and the public on all the science regarding a Roundup NHL link would provide tremendous financial health and safety benefits for class members But one of the lead objectors to the plan lawyer Majed Nachawati said Cabraser had attempted to create a sham settlement that would have harmed the legal rights of thousands of injured Americans Bayer issued a statement following the judge s order saying it would consider the future of glyphosate based products in the U S residential market though any changes there would not affect the availability of glyphosate based products in markets for professional and agricultural users The company said discussions about the future of residential Roundup products was part of a five point plan the company would now pursue The new package of measures which combine a number of legal and commercial actions is designed to help the company achieve a level of risk mitigation that is comparable to the

question to future juries is because of the trial losses the company has so far suffered The reason Monsanto wants a science panel so badly is that the company has lost the battle of the experts in three trials the judge wrote in his order At present the playing field on the issue of expert testimony related to causation is slanted heavily in favor of plaintiffs The ruling comes after a lengthy hearing last week held to discuss widespread opposition by personal injury attorneys across the United States to the settlement proposal The proposed plan called for Bayer to put up roughly 2 billion for a series of actions that would help the company avoid future Roundup cancer trials The class action settlement would apply to people exposed to Roundup products as of Feb 3 2021 who have not yet sued Monsanto or retained a lawyer to do so The settlement plan would set up a framework for addressing new claims brought by those exposed individuals who develop NHL they attribute to their Roundup exposure It would apply to people who already have NHL but who have not yet sued the company and to people who develop NHL in the future The plan was structured by Bayer in coordination with a small team of plaintiffs lawyers who stood to be paid millions of dollars for their participation Proponents of the proposed class action plan told the judge it will save lives and provide speedy compensation to people who get NHL they blame on Roundup exposure But opponents said the proposal actually did little for cancer patients while benefiting Bayer and the lawyers who helped develop the plan At the heart of the objections is the view that if approved the class action plan could limit the due process rights of people to go to trial and seek punitive damages awards in the future if they are diagnosed with NHL after Roundup exposure while allowing Bayer to keep selling Roundup products with no express warning of a cancer risk on the label The limiting of plaintiffs ability to seek punitive damages while not limiting Bayer s ability to keep selling Roundup distinguishes this settlement from any similar class action according to an opposition brief filed by the nonprofit

her multiple times as she addressed the jury and ordering her to alter her presentation He also instructed the jury more than once not to consider what Wagstaff said as evidence In court on Tuesday he

coming in front of you now for what three years So I m used to this communication back and forth And the fact that I was prepared for anything that you had to say to me and that you interrupted my

enforcing the rules the pretrial rules MS WAGSTAFF You just said the fact that I was able to compose myself is evidence of intent and that is just not fair Plaintiffs attorneys in the case believe that the judge s directive to separate the trial into two phases and sharply limit the evidence they can present to the jury is extremely favorable to Monsanto and prejudicial to their ability to meet the burden of proof in the case They also say that the judge s guidance on what evidence can come in and what cannot is confusing And they point out that Monsanto s attorney also in opening statements introduced evidence that was banned by the judge though he was not sanctioned Below is a bit more from Tuesday s proceedings THE COURT And that is that is relevant to intent That is relevant to bad faith The fact that the Plaintiffs have made so clear that they are so desperate to get this information into Phase One is evidence that it was not just a mistake that they happen to put this information in their opening statements MS MOORE Your Honor I did not say we were desperate What I was trying to explain is that the way the trial is set up is unusual And I think Your Honor that you recognize that after the bifurcation order came out that this is a unique situation where you limit a trial when we are talking about product case like this to only science in the first phase and it

UPDATED May 18 with pretrial order As Bayer AG works to put an end to costly litigation over alleged connections between Roundup herbicide and cancer the company faces a critical hearing on Wednesday in federal court in San Francisco At issue in the hearing is a proposed 2 billion class action settlement structured by Bayer in coordination with a small team of plaintiffs lawyers as a means to address potential future lawsuits Proponents of the proposed class action plan say it will save lives and provide speedy compensation to people who get NHL But the plan has generated widespread opposition from law firms around the country who say the proposal actually does little for cancer patients while benefiting Bayer and the lawyers who structured the proposal and who will be paid millions of dollars in fees if the plan goes through The class action settlement would apply to people exposed to Roundup products as of Feb 3 2021 who have not yet sued Monsanto or retained a lawyer to do so The settlement plan would set up a framework for addressing new claims brought by those exposed individuals who develop non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL they attribute to their Roundup exposure The class action plan which is separate from an 11 billion settlement of Roundup litigation announced by Bayer last June to address already filed lawsuits needs approval from U S District Judge Vince Chhabria A prior class action settlement plan submitted last year was scorned by Chhabria and then withdrawn The judge has been overseeing the federal multidistrict Roundup litigation involving thousands of plaintiffs from around the United States On Tuesday Judge Chhabria issued a pretrial order stating that Wednesday s hearing will focus on big picture concerns with the proposed settlement Bayer bought Monsanto in 2018 and has been struggling ever since to defend the line of glyphosate based herbicide products such as Roundup that Bayer inherited in the acquisition Cancer victims have won three trials held to date and tens of thousands of other plaintiffs have filed lawsuits alleging exposure to Monsanto s herbicides caused them to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma while Monsanto spent decades hiding the risks A Big Prize Likening the class action settlement proposal to a carnival barker hawking a big prize veteran consumer attorney Gerson Smoger told the court in a recent filing This is not merely an unfair deal It is a deal designed to allow Monsanto to poison future generations Monsanto knows it can only do this if it can put shackles on our system of justice After four attempts it should be clear that this proposed settlement cannot be remedied This Court should deny preliminary approval and end this exercise in allowing a corporation to buy its own justice system

who have notified the court they object to the proposed class action settlement which has been rewritten multiple times already to try to appease objections At the heart of the objections is the view that if approved the class action plan could limit the due process rights of people to go to trial and seek punitive damages awards in the future if they are diagnosed with NHL after Roundup exposure while allowing Bayer to keep selling Roundup products with no express warning of a cancer risk on the label The limiting of plaintiffs ability to seek punitive damages while not limiting Bayer s ability to keep selling Roundup distinguishes this settlement from any similar class action according to an opposition brief filed by the nonprofit legal group Public Justice The plan is a blueprint for how manufacturers can cut off victims rights to seek punitive damages from injuries caused by hazardous pesticides the group said Importantly there has never been a release of punitive damages in a class action settlement involving a hazardous product that was still on the market If this Court approves this Settlement it would be the first time that has ever happened in the history of American jurisprudence the Public Justice brief states The critics also object to the proposed formation of a science panel designed to provide evidence about whether or not the company s glyphosate based herbicides actually are carcinogenic a four year stay of future litigation and many other components of the plan Proponents cite plan benefits The legal team pushing the class action settlement forward counters that the plan actually is a good thing for people who may develop NHL in the future This settlement will save lives It will deliver notice outreach and information including on the product label itself to Roundup users among them those overlooked by the tort system to date that they may be at risk and should take action the proponents of the plan said in a court filing According

"text": "U S Right to Know With less than a week to go before opening statements in the Feb 25 federal civil trial over accusations that Monsanto s glyphosate based weed killers cause cancer lawyers for both sides were readying for jury selection that starts Wednesday In pre trial proceedings lawyers for plaintiff Edwin Hardeman and the legal team representing Monsanto now a unit of Bayer AG have already been arguing over jury selection based solely on written responses provided by prospective jurors and many have already been stricken by U S District Judge Vince Chhabria for cause On Wednesday attorneys will question the prospective jurors in person Monsanto s attorneys are particularly concerned about potential jurors who know about the case that Monsanto lost last summer In that trial plaintiff Dewayne Lee Johnson won a unanimous jury verdict on claims similar to Hardeman s that Monsanto s herbicides caused his non Hodgkin lymphoma and that Monsanto failed to warn of the risks Johnson was awarded 289 million by jurors but the judge in the case reduced the verdict to 78 million The stakes in this case are high The first loss hit Bayer hard its share price is down nearly 30 percent since the verdict and investors remain skittish Another loss in court could provide another blow to the company s market capitalization particularly because there are roughly 9 000 other plaintiffs waiting for their day in court In preparation for the trial opening on Monday morning Judge Chhabria said in a Feb 15 hearing that he will separate out all jury candidates on a Monsanto list who say they have heard about the Johnson case for specific questioning about their knowledge of that case Among those already stricken from the jury pool based on their written questionnaires were several people who indicated they had negative perceptions about Monsanto While the judge agreed with Monsanto s request to remove those people from the jury pool he refused a request from plaintiff s attorneys to strike a prospective juror who said the opposite the juror wrote that he feels that they Monsanto typically are very honest and helpful to society and said he believed Monsanto s Roundup herbicide was safe Judge Chhabria said I didn t think anyone in the Bay Area felt that way In other pre trial action lawyers from both sides were in Australia preparing for

trial Evidence or Monsanto s marketing materials is excluded for both phases Comparisons between Monsanto and the tobacco industry are excluded An email from Monsanto discussing work with the American Council on Science and Health is excluded from the first phase Arguments that glyphosate is needed to feed the world are excluded for both phases Certain EPA documents are excluded An analysis by the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifying glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen is restricted One piece of evidence plaintiff s attorneys plan to introduce is a new meta analysis A broad new scientific analysis of the cancer causing potential of glyphosate herbicides The study found that people with high exposures to the herbicides have a 41 increased risk of developing non

Cancer Litigation Turmoil both in and outside courtrooms appears to be growing for Monsanto a unit of German owner Bayer AG as the company works to meet overlapping deadlines for appeal actions in the three Roundup cancer trials Monsanto has lost so far at the same time that the company must prepare for new trials at the end of this summer The weight of the litigation burden was laid out by a Monsanto Bayer attorney in a recent California Court of Appeal filing seeking more time to file a brief in Monsanto s appeal of the first case it lost last summer That plaintiff in that case Dewayne Lee Johnson was awarded 289 million by a San Francisco jury who determined that Johnson s non Hodgkin lymphoma was caused by his exposure to Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides As part of the 289 million the jury ordered 250 million in punitive damages after Johnson s attorneys presented evidence that Monsanto suppressed the evidence of the risks of its herbicides The trial judge lowered the damage award to 78 million and Johnson is cross appealing to reinstate the full verdict Monsanto s appeal argues among other things that if the court refuses to reverse the judgment there should be no punitive damage award at all even if Johnson is awarded a small amount for compensatory damages In the recent filing Bryan Cave attorney K Lee Marshall told the court he needs an extension of time to prepare the next brief that is due in the Johnson appeal because of the various deadlines in the multiple cases Monsanto is defending against He cited post trial motion deadlines in Pilliod v Monsanto in which a jury ordered Monsanto pay more than 2 billion in damages and deadlines in Hardeman v Monsanto in which a jury ordered the company to pay roughly 80 million in damages Monsanto is seeking to overturn both those verdicts as well Last week Monsanto filed notice in federal court that it along with insurer Liberty Mutual Insurance Co had posted a 100 million bond as it plans to appeal the Hardeman verdict The company has a July 2 hearing on its request for the trial judge to set aside the verdict and order a new trial In light of the imminent post trial motion briefing deadlines in Hardeman and Pilliod I am and will be devoting a significant amount of time over the next several weeks to the post trial motions that challenge the enormous verdicts in those cases These time

they expect oral arguments to be set for the appeals by September or October with a final ruling expected within 90 days following oral arguments possibly by Thanksgiving If Monsanto loses its bid for a new trial in the Hardeman case the company is expected to file an appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in a process that would likely drag into next spring attorneys involved in the

patient over her claims Roundup caused her disease A California woman suing Monsanto over allegations that her use of Roundup weed killer caused her to develop cancer testified Monday that she had a hard time remembering many details about the extent of her use of the pesticide struggling to answer several questions posed by a Monsanto attorney In cross examination Monsanto attorney Bart Williams pressed plaintiff Donnetta Stephens on how much and when she had used the company s popular herbicide before she was diagnosed with non Hodgkin lymphoma in 2017 Peppering Stephens with questions about changes in information she provided in depositions and interrogatories the company s lawyer sought to cast doubt on the span and volume of her actual use and exposure In testimony last week Stephens son David Stephens recalled his mother s frequent use of Roundup and her tendency to wear sleeveless shirts and shorts when outside spraying the weed killer He described recalling her use when he was a child and seeing that use continuing when he was an adult But in Monday s testimony Williams sought to undermine Donnetta Stephens credibility implying that her son and husband were the architects of many of her answers about her use of Roundup provided in pre trial documents He said that Stephens and her husband had changed your story about the length of time you had used Roundup saying initially her use dated back to 2003 but then saying the use began in 1985 Stephens acknowledged that her memories of her use were aided by information from her family You and I agree that one should not swear to something accuracy if you don t know whether it is true or not That is my question Monsanto s lawyer addressed Stephens At that time I believed it to be true yes sir she replied You believed it to be true solely because that s what your husband or your son said correct Williams asked Yes Stephens answered The line of questioning was anticipated in a June filing by Stephens lawyers explaining to the judge that Stephens is in frail health after six cycles of chemotherapy and has suffered significant memory loss making her unable to recall certain Roundup exposures She had told lawyers initially that her exposure extended over 14 years but amended that to say it was closer to 30 years after being reminded of her use of Roundup products at a property where she had previously lived according to her lawyers In their June filing Stephens lawyers said Monsanto s attorneys were accusing them and Stephens of engaging in gamesmanship and allegation they denied

Monsanto which is scheduled to go to trial Tuesday Hogan further frustrated Monsanto by ordering Thursday that the trial could be audio and video recorded and broadcast to the public Lawyers for Monsanto had argued that the trial should not be broadcast because the publicity could endanger witnesses and former Monsanto executives Judge Hogan ruled that the trial would be open to audio and video recording and broadcast from its beginning on Jan 21 through the end of the trial with several exceptions including no coverage of jury selection The trial will be the first to take place in St Louis the former hometown for Monsanto before the company was acquired by Bayer in June 2018 Monsanto lost the first three trials that have so far taken place In those three trials a total of four plaintiffs claimed exposure to the company s glyphosate based herbicides caused them each to develop types of non Hodgkin lymphoma and that Monsanto covered up evidence of the risks Representatives for both sides have been working with a court appointed mediator since last May to try to resolve the litigation As settlement talks have progressed Bayer has successfully negotiated arrangements with certain plaintiffs law firms to postpone and or cancel several trials including one that had been set to get underway in the St Louis area the last week of January Among the cases pulled from the trial schedule are two cases involving cancer stricken children and a case involving a woman who has suffered extensive debilitation from her bout with non Hodgkin lymphoma But while other firms pull back from trial plans the Virginia based Miller Firm which is the lead counsel for the group of plaintiffs in the Wade case has pushed forward The Miller Firm already has two trial victories under its belt having represented the first trial plaintiff Dewayne Lee Johnson and the most recent trial plaintiffs Alva and Alberta Pilliod The other trial that has thus far taken place on claims brought by

holds that the EPA s regulatory scheme preempts claims such as Plaintiffs Judge Hogan said in her ruling Every court presented with this issue has rejected it With respect to the company s argument that a jury should not be entitled to consider punitive damages the judge said that would be a matter for consideration after seeing evidence presented at trial She wrote Defendant argues that because Roundup has been consistently approved by the EPA and other regulatory agencies its conduct cannot be considered willful wanton or reckless as a matter of law Plaintiffs respond that they will present evidence of Monsanto s reckless disregard for the safety of others and despicable and vile conduct which has been held sufficient to submit the claim of punitive damages to the jury in other cases

sole question that they must answer to close out the first phase of the trial and potentially move into the second phase The six jurors let Judge Vince Chhabria know on Friday that as they deliberate they want to have plaintiff Edwin Hardeman s testimony read back to them Chhabria said that would take place first thing Monday morning At Monsanto s request the trial has been divided into two phases The first phase deals only with the question of whether or not jurors find that Hardeman s exposure to Roundup was a substantial factor in causing his non Hodgkin lymphoma If the jurors unanimously answer yes to that question the trial moves into a second phase in which Hardeman s attorneys will put on evidence aimed at showing that Monsanto knew of the cancer risks of Roundup but actively worked to hide that information from consumers in part by manipulating the scientific record If the trial does go to the second phase the plaintiff will lack one key expert witness Charles Benbrook after the judge ruled that he would sharply limit Benbrook s testimony regarding Monsanto s corporate conduct Hardeman s lead counsel Aimee Wagstaff and her co counsel Jennifer Moore plan to spend the day in the courthouse Monday as the jury deliberates after again raising the ire of Judge Chhabria Chhabria was annoyed Friday that the lawyers took longer than he expected to get to the courthouse after they were notified that all parties must convene to address the jurors request to hear Hardeman s testimony again Chhabria sanctioned Wagstaff the first week of the trial for what he called

hearing with attorneys for both sides at 12 30 pm Pacific time to discuss the scope of the second phase if a second phase is held Among the issues to be discussed plaintiff s lawyers are renewing their request to be able to presenttestimony about Monsanto s efforts to discredit French scientist Gilles Éric Séralini after publication of his 2012 study findings about rats fed water dosed with Roundup Internal Monsanto records show a coordinated effort to get the Seralini paper retracted including this email string Monsanto employees apparently were so proud of what they called a multimedia event that was designed for maximum negative publicity against Seralini that they designated it as an achievement worth recognition Evidence demonstrates that the Séralini story is central toMonsanto s failure to test as well as its efforts to manipulate public opinion Edwin Hardeman s attorneys argue As well they say in their court filing the testimony reveals that Monsanto responded to the studyby attempting to undermine and discredit Dr Séralini which is further evidence that Monsanto doesnot particularly care whether its product is in fact giving people cancer but focuses instead onmanipulating public opinion and undermining anyone who raises genuine and legitimate concernsabout the issue The Séralini Story is Relevant to Monsanto s Efforts to Undermine Scientists RaisingConcerns about Glyphosate Hardeman s attorneys argue Lawyers for Hardeman want expert witness CharlesBenbrook to be allowed to testify about this example of Monsanto s corporate conduct post

prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his exposure to Roundup was a substantial factor in causing his non Hodgkin s lymphoma It will take all six jurors to answer yes to that question in order for the trial to continue If the jurors are split in how they answer the question the judge has said he would declare a mistrial The judge guided the jurors in how to consider that question and how to

Time Closing arguments are completed The jury has received instructions for deliberations Closing arguments got underway Tuesday With the first phase of Hardeman V Monsanto winding down plaintiff Edwin Hardeman s attorneys issued a strong objection to Judge Vince Chhabria s plans for instructing the jury about how to consider the issue of causation The way Chhabria worded his instructions makes it impossible for Hardeman to prevail attorney Jennifer Moore wrote in a letter to the judge California law sets for instructions that causation is determined when a substance or action is a substantial factor in causing an outcome But the judge s instructions would require jurors to find that Roundup was the sole factor that caused Hardeman s non Hodgkin lymphoma Moore argued Judge Chhabria replied by saying he could not give the standard California multiple causation instruction because plaintiff s attorneys failed to present evidence that Hardeman s cancer was due to multiple factors He did say however that he could modify the instructions slightly to try to address the concerns In the final instruction Chhabria added wording that said asubstantial factor does not have to be the only cause of the harm Monsanto has argued that Hardeman s cancer is not due toexposure to glyphosate based herbicides but more likely due to the hepatitis C Hardeman had for many years This is

hepatitis C Hardeman had for many years Levine testified that she has seen many many thousands of patients with non Hodgkin s lymphoma and she is in factconsidered a specialist in that specific disease Judge Chhabria said last week that he would like to see this first phase of the trial wrapped up early this week meaning the case should be with the jury soon A verdict requires all six jurors to be unanimous in their finding regarding whether or not Hardeman s exposure to Roundup was a substantial factor in causing his cancer The judge will define for jurors what that means See Friday s entry for more details If the jury does not unanimously decide either for Hardeman or Monsanto then the case would be a mistrial Chhabria has also said that if that happens he is considering retrying it in May If the jury finds for Hardeman on causation the trial would quickly move into Phase II using the same jury And that is where things will really start to get interesting Hardeman s attorneys

2019 Phase 1 Nears End Judge Ponders Jury Instructions Lawyers for plaintiff Edwin Hardeman rested their case on Friday giving Monsanto a turn to put on its own witnesses in this first phase of the case Judge Chhabria has indicated he would like to see the first phase of the trial wrapped up by early next week and he has ordered attorneys for both sides to be ready to discuss and debate two proposed sets of instructions for him to give the jury for deliberations regarding the definition of causation For Hardeman s case to be allowed to proceed to a Phase 2 in which damages could be awarded the group of six jurors must be unanimous in finding that Roundup caused his non Hodgkin lymphoma so the judge s instructions about how the element of causation is defined is a critical point The judge s first option reads as follows To prevail on the question of medical causation Mr Hardeman must prove by apreponderance of the evidence that Roundup was a substantial factor in causing his nonHodgkin s lymphoma A substantial factor is a factor that a reasonable person would consider tohave contributed to the harm It must be more than a remote or trivial factor If you conclude that Mr Hardeman has proven that his exposure to Roundup was asubstantial factor in causing his NHL then you should find for Mr Hardeman even if you believe that other risk factors were substantial factors as

could be the cause of Hardeman s cancer including a struggle with hepatitis C Hardeman s team has said that he was cured in 2006 of hepatitis C but Monsanto s team argues that cell damage from the hepatitis was a potential contributor to his cancer Monsanto expert witness Dr Daniel Arber in his pre trial report wrote that Hardeman has many risk factors for NHL and said There is no indication that Roundup played any role in the development of his NHL and there are no pathological features to suggest a cause of his lymphoma Judge Chhabria has ruledthat Arber cannot testify that the hepatitis C caused Hardeman s NHL but ruled Thursday that Arber can explain that Hardeman s lengthy exposure to hepatitis C left him at riskof developing NHL even after his virus had been successfully treated Several new documents have been filed by both parties related to evidence and jury instructions See them at Monsanto Papers Hardeman page March 7 2019 Judge Has Harsh Words for Monsanto Judge

in legal circles garnering them awards and international notoriety But behind the scenes of victory the aftermath of the first ever Roundup cancer trial has plunged Johnson s attorneys into a bitter legal battle of their own with allegations swirling of self dealing drug use and disloyal and erratic conduct In a lawsuit and counterclaim filed in Orange County Circuit Court in Virginia The Miller Law Firm accuses attorney Tim Litzenburg someone who has portrayed himself as Johnson s lead trial attorney of stealing the firm s confidential client information with the intent of setting up his own separate law firm even as he was failing to show up for preparatory meetings for Johnson s trial The complaint also alleges that Litzenburg admitted to using drugs during the Johnson trial Multiple members of Mr Johnson s trial team observed Mr Litzenburg acting disoriented and frantic at court the complaint states When he was permitted to argue a motion before the Court his delivery was jumbled and incoherent Members of the trial team were concerned that Mr Litzenburg was actively under the influence of drugs in the courtroom The trial itself ended up being handled by other attorneys and Litzenburg was not present for the close of the trial nor the day that the jury returned a 289 million verdict against Monsanto Roughly one month later on September 11 2018 The Miller Firm terminated Litzenburg s employment the lawsuit states Litzenburg who is now affiliated with the firm of Kincheloe Litzenburg Pendleton did not respond to a request for comment other than to say it was an unfortunate distraction from his work at his new firm In past comments Litzenburg described his separation from The Miller Firm as due to a misunderstanding with Mike Miller one of the firm s founders

witness for the plaintiff Dr Dennis Weisenburger was being cross examined Wednesday by Monsanto attorneys after extensive direct testimony for cancer victim Edwin Hardeman Hardeman s attorneys said they were nearing the end of the first phase of presenting their case Weisenburger a pathologist specializing in studying the causes of non Hodgkin lymphoma testified Tuesday for more than four hours walking jurors through scientific evidence he said shows Monsanto s Roundup herbicide is a substantial cause of cancer in people who are exposed He followed testimony by Hardeman who spoke for just less than an hour under direct examination about his use of Roundup for decades before his cancer diagnosis in 2016 The Guardian recapped Hardeman s testimony in which he said thathe sprayed Roundup once a month for three to four hours at a time around his property and sometimes felt like chemical mist blowing onto his skin Plaintiff s attorneys expected to rest their case today but Weisenburger s testimony ran so long that they now plan to rest the case when court resumes on Friday No proceedings are scheduled for Thursday See documents pertaining to testimony on the Monsanto Papers page

property for years how his repeated exposure actually occurred Monsanto attorneys on Monday sought to nix the sprayer demonstration plan arguing that it would invite the jury to make anysort of speculation about how the use of the sprayer could haveinfluenced exposure but Chhabria sided with Hardeman s lawyers saying he would allow a brief demonstration with the sprayer He even made a bit of a joke THE COURT I mean one helpful bit of guidance I canprovide now is that the Plaintiffs are not allowed to spray youwith the sprayer MS MATTHEWS Monsanto attorney Okay THE COURT And they are definitely not allowed tospray me with the sprayer In another move applauded by Hardeman s legal team Chhabria said Monday that testimony about the Parry report can be presented to jurors Monsanto objected but the judge agreed with plaintiff s counsel that the door has been opened to the Parry report by Monsanto s efforts to contest evidence of genotoxicity with glyphosate herbicides Dr James Parry was a consultant hired by Monsanto in the 1990s to weigh in on genotoxicity concerns being raised at the time by outside scientists Parry s report recommended that Monsanto do additional studies to clarify the potential genotoxic activity of glyphosate See this snippet from Monday s discussion of this topic THE COURT Okay Well Monsanto has a report from a doctor that it hired that that raised concerns about the genotoxicity of glyphosate So it seems to me that you are you have already saidsomething to the jury even before we get to your second point you have already said something to the jury that iscontradicted to a degree by an internal Monsanto document Andso why shouldn t they be able to cast doubt on Monsanto sassertion to the jury that genotox doesn t matter byestablishing that Monsanto hired a doctor to or hired an expert to look at the issue of genotoxicity in the late 90sand the expert raised concerns about genotoxicity I mean Monsanto itself investigated genotox hired somebody to investigate genotox and that personconcluded that genotox that it s possibly genotoxic After Hardeman s testimony next up with be expert witness Dennis Weisenburger professor of the

from today s proceedings Plaintiff Edwin Hardeman was scheduled to take the stand today along with expert witness Dennis Weisenburger professor of the Pathology Department of the City of Hope Medical Center in Omaha Nebraska But one juror apparently is too ill to endure the long trial day so testimony is being postponed Weisenburger who specializes in the study of non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL was a key witness for the general pool of plaintiffs a year ago when he testified before Judge Vince Chhabria as the judge weighed then whether or not to let the mass of Roundup cancer claims move forward Weisenburger has published over 50 papers in peer reviewed journals about the causes of NHL Before news of the trial delay plaintiffs had expected to rest their case on Tuesday with Monsanto s witnesses taking the stand by Wednesday The whole first phase of the trial was expected to have been concluded by Friday or Monday lawyers said The case will only move into a second phase if the jurors first agree that Hardeman s exposure to Roundup was the cause of his non Hodgkin lymphoma Hardeman used Roundup from to treat weeds and overgrowth on a 56 acre property he and his wife owned in Sonoma County He reported using Roundup and or related Monsanto brands from 1986 to 2012 Hardeman was diagnosed with B cell NHL in February of 2015 Without the jury present the judge focused on discussion of several pieces of evidence Hardeman s attorneys want to introduce in the first phase arguing that Monsanto opened the door to evidence that otherwise was not allowed See the plaintiff s discussion of introducing evidence related to a controversial mouse study from the 1980s and evidence pertaining to genotoxicity concerns raised by a Monsanto consultant and in contrast Monsanto s

triggered a flood of emails from lawyers and other individuals offering support and expressing outrage at the judge s action March 1 2019 Something to Chew On Transcript from today s proceedings Here is an interesting tidbit to chew on over the weekend In light of Judge Vince Chhabria s unusual handling of the first Roundup cancer lawsuit to come to trial in federal court see previous entries for bifurcation and other background and the vitriol with which he has been addressing plaintiff Edwin Hardeman s legal counsel many observers have asked what gives The bifurcation his decision to sanction plaintiff s lead counsel his threat to dismiss the case entirely and his repeated comments about how shaky the plaintiffs evidence is obviously appear to favor Monsanto s defense at least in the early stages of the trial Could there be some connection between Chhabria and Monsanto Chhabria has a pretty stellar background Born and raised in California he obtained his law degree in 1998 from theUniversity of California Berkeley School of Law graduatingwith honors He served as law clerkfor two federal judges and for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and worked as an associate for two law firms before joining the San Francisco City Attorney s Office where he worked from 2005 to 2013 He was nominated by President Obama for the seat he holds now in the summer of 2013 But interestingly one of those law firms where Chhabria worked has raised eyebrows Covington Burling LLP is a well known defender of a variety of corporate interests including Monsanto Co Covington was reportedly instrumental in helping Monsanto defend itself against dairy industry concerns over the company s synthetic bovine growth hormone supplement known as rBGH for recombinant bovine growth hormone or the brand name Posilac Chhabria worked at the firm between 2002 2004 a time period when Monsanto s legal battle over Posilac was in high gear The firm was reportedly involved in the issue in part by sending letters to virtually all U S dairy processors warning that they faced potential legal consequences if they labeled their consumer products as rbGH Free Covington is perhaps best known for its work for the tobacco industry A judge in Minnesota in 1997 ruled that the firm was willfully disregarding court orders to turn over certain documents pertaining to claims that the tobacco industry engaged in a 40 year conspiracy to mislead the public about the health impacts of smoking and hide damaging scientific research from public view Shortly before Obama selected Chhabria

also no stranger to the world of corporate power and influence How those dots connect in this case is so far unclear February 28 2019 Trial Takes a Day Off Thursdays are dark days for the Roundup cancer trial meaning lawyers jurors and witnesses have a day to catch their breath and regroup And after the fast and furious first three days of the trial they probably can use the break After losing another juror on Wednesday morning the trial proceeded with the testimony of plaintiff s expert witness and former U S government scientist Christopher Portier The testimony was provided via a video recorded in Australia last week During an afternoon break in Portier s testimony Judge Chhabria took a few moments to explain himself for certain comments he made to plaintiff s lead counsel Aimee Wagstaff on Tuesday before sanctioning her for what he said was misconduct in her opening statement to the jury see prior blog entries for details The following is a brief excerpt THE COURT Before we bring in the jury I want to make a quick statement to Ms Wagstaff I was reflecting on the OSC hearing last night and I wanted to clarify one thing I gave a list of reasons why I thought your conduct was intentional and one of those reasons was that you seemed to have prepared yourself in advance for that you would get a hard time for violating the pretrial rulings In explaining that I used the word steely and I want to make clear what I meant by that I was using steely as an adjective for steeling yourself which is to make yourself ready for something difficult and unpleasant My point was that I perceived no surprise on your part and since lawyers typically seem surprised when they are accused of violating pretrial rulings that was relevant to me on the issue of intent But steely has another meaning as well which is far more negative And I want to assure you that that s not the meaning that I was using nor was I suggesting anything about your general character traits So I know you

WAGSTAFF Thank you Your Honor February 27 2019 Judicial Threats and Judge Jokes UPDATE Another juror has just been dismissed One of the seven women jurors has been dismissed in morning proceedings That leaves one man and six women A total of six jurors are required and all must be unanimous in their verdict As day three opens in the first federal trial over claims that Monsanto s Roundup products can cause cancer U S District Judge Vince Chhabria has made it clear that he has no fondness for plaintiff Edwin Hardeman s legal team Chhabria on Tuesday issued a ruling sanctioning Hardeman s lead counsel Aimee Wagstaff for what the judge deemed as several acts of misconduct fining her 500 and ordering her to provide a list of all others on her team who participated in drafting her opening statement so that those lawyers may also be sanctioned At issue various remarks made by Wagstaff that Judge Chhabria thought exceeded the tight restrictions he has placed on what evidence the jury can hear Chhabria wants jurors to hear only about scientific evidence without context about Monsanto s conduct seeking to influence the scientific record and knowledge of certain scientific findings Additionally even though there were no restrictions in place pertaining to the introduction of plaintiff Hardeman to the jury the judge took issue with Wagstaff s manner of introduction and description of how he came to learn he had non Hodgkin lymphoma In Monday s proceedings the judge made his anger at Wagstaff clear interrupting her multiple times as she addressed the jury and ordering her to alter her presentation He also instructed the jury more than once not to consider what Wagstaff said as evidence In court on Tuesday he chastised Wagstaff and said that he knew her actions were intentionally aimed at flouting his directives because she did not wither under his coming down hard on her in court Monday during her opening statement Below is a portion of those

that is based on assumptions on the Court s part THE COURT That is based on my observations of body language and facial expressions MS WAGSTAFF Well actually Your Honor I would just like to talk about

communication back and forth And the fact that I was prepared for anything that you had to say to me and that you interrupted my opening statement a few times in a row should not be used against me The fact that I have composure when you are attacking me it should not be used against me THE COURT I was not attacking you I was enforcing the rules the pretrial rules MS WAGSTAFF You just said the fact that I was able to compose myself is evidence of intent and that is just not fair Plaintiffs attorneys in the case believe that the judge s directive to separate the trial into two phases and sharply limit the evidence they can present to the jury is extremely favorable to Monsanto and prejudicial to their ability to meet the burden of proof in the case They also say that the judge s guidance on what evidence can come in and what cannot is confusing And they point out that Monsanto s attorney also in opening statements introduced evidence that was banned by the judge though he was not sanctioned Below is a bit more from Tuesday s proceedings THE COURT And that is that is relevant to intent That is relevant to bad faith The fact that the Plaintiffs have made so clear that they

the company s market capitalization particularly because there are roughly 9 000 other plaintiffs waiting for their day in court In preparation for the trial opening on Monday morning Judge Chhabria said in a Feb 15 hearing that he will separate out all jury candidates on a Monsanto list who say they have heard about the Johnson case for specific questioning about their knowledge of that case Among those already stricken from the jury pool based on their written questionnaires were several people who indicated they had negative perceptions about Monsanto While the judge agreed with Monsanto s request to remove those people from the jury pool he refused a request from plaintiff s attorneys to strike a prospective juror who said the opposite the juror wrote that he feels that they Monsanto typically are very honest and helpful to society and said he believed Monsanto s Roundup herbicide was safe Judge Chhabria said I didn t think anyone in the Bay Area felt that way In other

formulations or attacks on IARC s classification of glyphosate As for the 2015 Heydens email chain attorney s for Hardeman argue the correspondence is illuminating to the causation question Heydens

documents filed in federal court are threatening to expose Reuters news reporter Kate Kelland for acting as Monsanto s puppet in driving a false narrative about cancer scientist Aaron Blair and the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC that classified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen In 2017 Kelland authored a controversial story attributed to court documents that actually appears to have been fed to her by a Monsanto executive who helpfully provided several key points the company wanted made The documents Kelland cited were not filed in court and not publicly available at the time she wrote her story but writing that her story was based on court documents allowed her to avoid disclosing Monsanto s role in driving the story When the story came out it portrayed cancer

January 15 court filing Plaintiff s attorneys cited internal Monsanto correspondence dated April 27 2017 they say show that Monsanto executive Sam Murphey sent the desired narrative to Kelland with a slide deck of talking points and portions of the Blair deposition that was not filed in court The attorneys said the correspondence shows the Monsanto executive asking her to publish an article

Monsanto still have not been released Plaintiff s attorneys also write in their letter brief that Monsanto s internal documents show Kelland was seen as a a key media contact in their efforts to discredit IARC There is nothing inherently wrong in receiving story suggestions that benefit companies from the companies themselves It happens all the time But reporters must be diligent in presenting facts not corporate propaganda This story was used by Monsanto to attack IARC on multiple fronts including an effort by Monsanto to get Congress to strip funding from IARC At the very least

hardship and challenge cause hearing with counsel and Court set for 2 15 2019 10 30 AM in San Francisco Courtroom 04 17th Floor before Judge Vince Chhabria January 7 2019 The new year is off to a strong start for Monsanto as the Bayer unit heads into its second trial over allegations that its Roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides cause cancer In a Jan 3 ruling U S District Judge Vince Chhabria rejected arguments by attorneys representing cancer victims and sided with Monsanto in deciding to block jurors from hearing a large portion of evidence that plaintiffs say shows efforts by Monsanto to manipulate and influence regulators in a first phase of the trial In deciding to bifurcate the trial Chhabria said that jurors will only hear such evidence if they first agree that Monsanto s weed killer did significantly contribute to causing the plaintiff s non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL A significant portion of the plaintiffs case involves attacks on Monsanto for attempting to influence regulatory agencies and manipulate public opinion regarding glyphosate These issues are relevant to punitive damages and some liability questions But when it comes to whether glyphosate caused a plaintiff s NHL these issues are mostly a distraction and a significant one at that the judge s order states He did provide a caveat writing if the plaintiffs have evidence that Monsanto manipulated the outcome of scientific studies as opposed to agency decisions or public opinion regarding those studies that evidence may well be admissible at the causation phase Jury selection is set to begin Feb 20 with the trial set to get underway on Feb 25 in San Francisco The case is Edwin Hardeman v Monsanto Meanwhile plaintiff Lee Johnson who was the first cancer victim to take Monsanto to trial winning a unanimous jury verdict against the company in August has also won his request to the 1st District Court of Appeals for speedy handling of Monsanto s appeal of that jury award Monsanto opposed Johnson s request for calendar preference but the court granted the request on Dec 27 giving Monsanto 60 days to file its opening brief December 20 2018 U S District Judge Vince Chhabria said on Thursday that he would not rule until January on the disputed issue of bifurcation of the first federal trial which is set to get underway in February Attorneys for plaintiffs and for Monsanto were

Friday to de designation requests concerning several hundred internal Monsanto records seeking to keep most of them sealed in opposition to requests from plaintiffs attorneys Company lawyers did agree to the release of some internal documents which could be made public this week In the meantime both sides are awaiting a ruling from U S District Court Judge Vince Chhabria on a motion made by Monsanto attorneys to reverse bifurcate the first federal court trial in the mass Roundup cancer litigation That trial is set to begin Feb 25 and is considered a bellwether that will set the stage for how and if other cases proceed and or are resolved Monsanto would like the federal court trials to be conducted in two phases a first phase focused on medical causation did the company s herbicides cause the specific plaintiff s cancer and a second phase to address liability only if plaintiffs prevail in the first phase The issues of causation and compensatory damages are separate and distinct from Monsanto s alleged negligence and company conduct and would involve testimony from different witnesses the company argued Bifurcation would avoid undue delay in resolving this case Plaintiffs attorneys object to the bifurcation saying the idea is unheard of in modern multi district litigation MDL which is what Chhabria is overseeing More than 600 lawsuits are pending in his court alleging that Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides caused plaintiffs cancers and Monsanto failed to warn consumers of the dangers of its products It is simply never done and for good reason plaintiffs attorneys argued in a Dec 13 court filing The purpose of a bellwether trial is to allow each side to test their theories and evidence against a real world jury and hopefully learn important information about the strengths and weaknesses of the case to inform collective resolution Imposing a one sided procedural hurdle one that would be a de facto outlier for the 10 000 cases proceeding around the country does not accomplish that goal It renders any verdict in this MDL no matter which side prevails unhelpful The next hearing in the case is set for Jan 4 December 14 2018 Plaintiff

that their cancers forms of non Hodgkin lymphoma are due to their long exposure to Roundup Their advanced ages and cancer diagnoses warrant a speedy trial according to court filings by their attorneys

invaded his pelvis and spine Alva was diagnosed in 2011 while Alberta was diagnosed in 2015 They used Roundup from roughly the mid 1970s until only a few years ago The Pilliod suit echoes others in

Cachan questioned Farmer about several issues that were raised earlier by plaintiffs attorneys telling Farmer it was her chance to explain details about several matters that Stephens lawyers had presented as evidence of Monsanto wrong doing One such issue involved comments Farmer wrote in a 2003 email to colleagues about the importance of distinguishing between the chemical glyphosate and the Roundup formulation which is made with glyphosate as the active ingredient In the email Farmer wrote The terms glyphosate and Roundup cannot be used interchangeably nor can you use Roundup for all glyphosate based herbicides any more For example you cannot say that Roundup is not a carcinogen we have not done the necessary testing on the formulation to make that statement The testing on the formulations are not anywhere near the level of the active ingredient Plaintiffs lawyers have pointed to that language as part of a broad argument disputing Monsanto s contention that thorough testing of Roundup has demonstrated it does not cause cancer In testimony Tuesday Farmer said that she merely was trying to be very precise when explaining to colleagues the distinctions between products She was not indicating in the email that there was any question about whether or not Roundup might cause cancer Farmer testified She pointed out that in that internal email she also wrote there is no

the questioning by Monsanto s lawyer Farmer told jurors that regulators had never required the company to conduct animal carcinogenicity testing on Roundup She said not only had the U S EPA not demanded such testing but regulators in Canada Europe Australia and Japan had similarly not required any such animal testing on Roundup products She also told jurors that while it was true that Roundup products contain formaldehyde it was a very very small amount and posed no danger to human health Regulators agreed there was no reason for concern Farmer testified We produce formaldehyde

continues to battle legal claims over alleged dangers of its widely used Roundup herbicides the company is trying to block orders to turn over internal records about its work with public relations and strategic consulting contractors In a series of filings in St Louis Circuit Court Monsanto argues that it should not have to comply with discovery requests involving certain dealings between it and the global public relations firm FleishmanHillard despite the fact that a special master has found Monsanto should hand those documents over Monsanto is asserting that its communications with FleishmanHillard should be considered privileged similar to attorney client communications and that Monsanto should not have to produce them as part of discovery to the lawyers representing the cancer patients suing Monsanto FleishmanHillard became the agency of record for Monsanto s corporate reputation work in 2013 and its employees became deeply involved with the company working at Monsanto s offices nearly every day and gaining access to online repositories of non public confidential information the company said The fact that some of these communications involve the creation of public messaging does not strip them of privilege Monsanto said in its court filing FleishmanHillard worked on two projects for Monsanto in Europe regarding re registration of glyphosate and worked with Monsanto lawyers on a specific project for jury research The nature of the work done by the public relations firm required privileged communications with Monsanto s legal counsel the company said Earlier this year Monsanto owner Bayer AG said it was ending Monsanto s relationship with FleishmanHillard after news broke that the public relations firm engaged in a Europe wide data collection scheme for Monsanto targeting journalists politicians and other stakeholders to try to influence pesticide policy Monsanto has taken a similar position with respect to communications involving its work with corporate image management company FTI Consulting which Monsanto hired in June 2016 The absence of an attorney on a privileged document also does not automatically render that document susceptible to a privilege challenge Monsanto said in its filing Earlier this year an FTI employee was caught impersonating a journalist at one of the Roundup cancer trials trying to suggest story lines for other reporters to pursue that favored Monsanto The company also wants to avoid handing over documents involving its relationship with Scotts Miracle Gro Company which has been marketing and

settlement that is financially reasonable and will bring reasonable closure to the overall litigation he said Though the company refers to it as glyphosate litigation the plaintiffs allege that their cancers were not caused by exposure to glyphosate alone but by exposure to glyphosate based formulated products made by Monsanto Many scientific studies have shown that the formulations are much more toxic than glyphosate by itself The U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA has not required long term safety studies on Roundup formulations throughout the 40 plus years the products have been on the

court coronavirus delays Even as the spread of the coronavirus closes courthouse doors to the public and lawyers legal maneuvering continues over claims of danger associated with Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides Two nonprofit advocacy groups the Center for Food Safety CFS and the Center for Biological Diversity CBD filed an amicus brief on behalf of cancer patient Edwin Hardeman on March 23 Hardeman won a jury verdict against Monsanto of 80 million in March of 2019 becoming the second winning plaintiff in the Roundup litigation The trial judge reduced the jury award to a total of 25 million Monsanto appealed the award nonetheless asking an appellate court to overturn the verdict The new legal brief supporting Hardeman counters one filed by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA that backs Monsanto in the Hardeman appeal The CFS and CBD brief states that Monsanto and the EPA are both wrong to assert that the EPA s approval of glyphosate herbicides preempts challenges to the safety of the products Contrary to Monsanto s claims Mr Hardeman s case is not preempted by EPA s conclusion relative to glyphosate because Roundup is a glyphosate formulation that EPA has never evaluated for carcinogenicity Moreover significant flaws and biases undermined EPA s evaluation of glyphosate s carcinogenicity and the district court was correct in allowing testimony to that effect the brief states Monsanto wants this Court to believe that glyphosate is synonymous with Roundup The reason is simple if the terms are interchangeable then they argue EPA s finding that glyphosate is not likely to be carcinogenic would apply to Roundup and might preempt Mr Hardeman s case However as the evidence presented at trial demonstrated glyphosate and Roundup are very much not synonymous and Roundup is far more toxic than glyphosate Moreover EPA has never evaluated Roundup for carcinogenicity Glyphosate formulations like Roundup contain additional ingredients co formulants to improve performance in some way EPA understands these formulations are more toxic than glyphosate alone yet nevertheless focused its cancer evaluation on pure glyphosate Separate lawsuit names EPA In a separate legal action last week the Center for Food Safety filed a federal lawsuit against the EPA over its continued support of glyphosate The claim made on behalf of a coalition of farm workers

s win sometime in April But that now appears extremely unlikely as other cases scheduled for March have now been pushed into April As well all in person sessions for oral arguments in the appeals

cancer in 2015 and another 1 billion to her husband Alva Pilliod who was diagnosed in 2011 with non Hodgkin lymphoma that spread from his bones to his pelvis and spine The couple who are both in their 70s started using Roundup in the 1970s and continued using the herbicide until only a few years ago The jury also awarded the couple a total of 55 million in damages for past and future medical bills and other losses In ordering punitive damages the jury had to find that Monsanto engaged in conduct with malice oppression or fraud committed by one or more officers directors or managing agents of Monsanto who were acting on behalf of the company Pilliod v Monsanto is the third Roundup cancer case to go to trial And it is the third to conclude that Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides can cause cancer and that Monsanto has long known about and covered up the risks In March a unanimous jury in federal court in San Francisco ordered Monsanto to pay roughly 80 million in damages for failing to warn plaintiff Edwin Hardeman of the cancer risks of Roundup herbicide Last August jurors in state court in San Francisco ordered Monsanto to pay 289 million in damages to school

ghostwritten studies and articles aimed at discrediting independent scientists whose work found dangers with Monsanto s herbicides When the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry sought to evaluate glyphosate toxicity in 2015 Monsanto engaged the assistance of EPA officials to delay that review Monsanto enjoyed a close relationship with certain officials within the Environmental Protection Agency EPA who have repeatedly backed Monsanto s assertions about the safety of its glyphosate products The company internally had worker safety recommendations that called for wearing a full range of protective gear when applying glyphosate herbicides but did not warn the public to do the same Pilliod attorney Brent Wisner suggested to jurors in his closing arguments that they consider punitive damages in the range of 1 billion to send a message to Monsanto and Bayer about the need to change the company s practices The jury saw for themselves internal company documents demonstrating that from day one Monsanto has never had any interest in finding out whether Roundup is safe Wisner said following the verdict Instead of investing in sound science they invested millions in attacking science that threatened their business agenda Michael Miller who served with Wisner as co lead trial counsel said Unlike the first two Monsanto trials where the judges severely

February though the process of paying all the plaintiffs is expected to stretch out a year or more Communications sent out from law firms to their Roundup clients sketch out both the process each

Firm has been at the forefront of the Roundup litigation since the outset unearthing many of the damning internal Monsanto documents that helped win all three Roundup trials held to date The Miller Firm handled two of those trials bringing in lawyers from the Los Angeles firm of Baum Hedlund Aristei Goldman to help with the case of Dewayne Lee Johnson after Miller Firm founder Mike Miller was

settlements in order for them to proceed According to the information provided to plaintiffs settlements are desired now because of a number of risks associated with continuing to pursue additional trials Among the risks identified Bayer has threatened to file for bankruptcy and if the company did take that route settling Roundup claims would take far longer and likely ultimately result in far less money for plaintiffs The Environmental Protection Agency EPA issued a letter last August telling Monsanto that the agency won t allow for a cancer warning on Roundup That helps Monsanto s future chances of prevailing in court Covid related court delays mean additional Roundup trials are unlikely for a year or more It is not unusual for plaintiffs in mass tort litigation to walk away

scientists called ghostwriting has already been revealed in documents presented as part of ongoing court proceedings against Monsanto but several pages of email correspondence made public late Wednesday show both the company s motivation and internal employee celebrations of the actions One important example revealed in the emails documents events in 1999 and 2000 when Monsanto scientists government relations professionals and other executives were completing a multi year project to develop content for publication in a scientific journal that would promote the safety of the company s herbicides The emails show substantial involvement by Monsanto employees in the final work but no Monsanto employee was named as an author The listed authors were three scientists Gary Williams Robert Kroes and Ian Munro who did not work for the company William Heydens a senior Monsanto scientist appears in the emails to be deeply involved in the writing of the Williams paper In one email dated July 30 1999 he sent Munro a draft of the manuscript and said that he had sprouted several new gray hairs during the writing of this thing He also wrote that he was attaching text tables and references and let Munro know that everyone at Monsanto has agreed with adding you as an author The resulting paper was titled Safety evaluation and risk assessment of the herbicide Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate for humans The paper said the use of Roundup herbicide does not result in adverse effects on development reproduction or endocrine systems in people or animals It was concluded that under present and expected conditions of use Roundup herbicide does not pose a health risk to humans Monsanto issued a press release touting the breadth and importance of the findings

emphasized why the Williams paper was so significant for Monsanto s business plans This human health publication on Roundup herbicide and its companion publication on ecotox and environmental fate will be undoubtedly be regarded as the reference on Roundup and glyphosate safety she wrote in the email dated May 25 2000 Our plan is now to utilize it both in the defense of Roundup and Roundup Ready crops worldwide and in our ability to competitively differentiate ourselves from generics Carr later authored an email asking if Roundup logo polo shirts could be given to eight people who worked on the Williams and Geisy papers as a token of appreciation for a job well done The end of the 1990s was a critical period for the company because Roundup was facing increasing scrutiny as concerns mounted among independent scientists who were finding evidence that the products could cause cancer Monsanto had just rolled out Roundup Ready glyphosate tolerant seeds designed to allow farmers to spray the herbicides directly onto food crops and any health concerns associated with the weed killer could hinder growth of the company s new seed business Additionally the company s patent on glyphosate was expiring in the year 2000 and Monsanto would be facing competition from generic brands Now the hard work by public affairs begins in utilizing these reference documents to the

of plaintiff Donnetta Stephens in her lawsuit against Monsanto appeared in person in the courtroom earlier in the week but answered questions from Monsanto s lawyer via Zoom on Thursday due to travel commitments Portier was also an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the three prior Roundup trials In each of the prior trials juries agreed that Monsanto s glyphosate herbicides caused the plaintiffs to develop a type of cancer called non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL In hours of testimony that stretched over several days Portier told jury members about studies done on human cell lines as well as studies conducted on laboratory animals and studies of exposure and disease incidence in humans The evidence of a cancer connection was strongest in the animal studies and was supported by the additional research he said I am certain that glyphosate can cause tumors in animals including malignant lymphomas in mice Portier testified When asked his opinion on the question of whether or not real world Roundup exposure can cause NHL in people Portier said I believe that it does I think the strength of that belief is almost certain but not quite Regular Roundup user Lawyers for Stephens say that she was a regular user of Roundup herbicide for more than 30 years and it was that extended exposure to the glyphosate based products made popular by Monsanto that caused her NHL Stephens was diagnosed in 2017 and has suffered from numerous health complications amid multiple rounds of chemotherapy since then Because of her poor health a judge in December granted Stephens a trial preference

million in punitive damages the jury ordered a year ago this month in the first Roundup cancer trial according to a brief in the case filed Monday The brief filed by lawyers for Dewayne Lee Johnson responds to arguments by Monsanto made in the appeal and cross appeal lodged in the state appellate court The appeal was initiated last year by Monsanto following an Aug 10 2018 jury decision that marked the first of three courtroom losses for the agrochemical giant and its owner Bayer AG The jury in the Johnson case awarded 289 million in total damages including 250 in punitive damages The trial judge then lowered the punitive amount to 39 million for total damages of 78 million While Monsanto wants the entire jury decision thrown out Johnson s attorneys are asking for the total of 289 million to be restored by the appeals court Johnson is one of roughly 18 400 people suing Monsanto over allegations that Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides such as Roundup cause non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL and claims that Monsanto has spent decades covering up the risks Both sides in the Johnson appeal are awaiting the scheduling of oral arguments which are expected within the next couple of months A decision by the appeals court could come before the end of the year The appellate decision could be pivotal Bayer shares plummeted after the Johnson verdict and have continued to be weighed down by two more jury decisions against Monsanto in two subsequent trials Bayer has indicated it is ready to talk about a global settlement of the Roundup cancer litigation and a decision by the appeals court could substantially impact the direction and outcome of settlement talks In the brief filed Monday Johnson s lawyers argued that Monsanto s conduct was so reprehensible as to warrant much more than a slap on the wrist and cited precedent court decisions finding that punitive damage awards equal to 5 percent of a defendant s net worth is appropriate for minimally reprehensible behavior Based on Monsanto s stipulated net worth of 6 8 billion the punitive damage award of 250 million equals 3 8 and is a light punishment considering Monsanto s highly reprehensible behavior

by the jury comports with due process and should be upheld Monsanto s brief contradicts the Johnson position on every point and states that there is no legal reason to reinstate the 250 million punitive damage award The company asserts that because the EPA and other international regulators back the safety of its herbicides the courts should do the same Monsanto had no duty to warn of a risk that far from being a prevailing scientific view worldwide regulators agree does not exist the Monsanto brief states Reinstatement of the 250 million punitive damage verdict would result in the largest judicially approved award of punitive damages in California history in a case with exceedingly thin evidence of malice or oppression There is no basis for an award of punitive damages in this

hold out attorney What will it take to get Mike Miller to settle That is the pressing question as one of the lead lawyers in the nationwide Roundup cancer litigation has thus far refused to align with fellow litigators in agreeing to settle cases on behalf of thousands of cancer patients who claim their diseases were caused by exposure to Monsanto s herbicide products Mike Miller head of the Orange Virginia based law firm that bears his name has been unwilling to accept the terms of settlement offers discussed in mediation talks between Monsanto s German owner Bayer AG and a team of plaintiffs attorneys That recalcitrance is a critical sticking point that is interfering with a resolution sources close to the litigation say Instead Miller s firm is launching two new trials this month including one that started today in Contra Costa California and one that starts Tuesday in St Louis Missouri It is possible that Miller could agree to a settlement at any point interrupting trial proceedings however Miller also has a trial set for February in the U S District Court in San Francisco That case brought by cancer patient Elaine Stevick would be the second trial to be held in federal court Miller s move to continue to try cases separates him from other leading Roundup plaintiffs firms including the Baum Hedlund Aristei Goldman law firm of Los Angeles and the Denver Colorado based Andrus Wagstaff firm Like the Miller firm Baum Hedlund and Andrus Wagstaff represent several thousands plaintiffs Those firms have agreed to cancel or postpone multiple trials including two that involved young children with cancer in order to facilitate a settlement Some sources have pegged a potential settlement number at 8 billion 10 billion though some analysts have said that number would be hard to justify to Bayer investors who are keeping a close eye on the developments Critics accuse Miller of acting in a way that could hurt the ability of thousands of plaintiffs to obtain payouts from Bayer but supporters say he is championing his clients interests and refusing to accept terms he finds less than optimal Miller is a veteran litigator who has a long history of

leverage to Bayer in settlement talks Conversely though if Miller were to win the trials that could offer fresh leverage for the plaintiffs to ask for more money The pressure to settle has been ratcheting higher for both sides Complicating factors include a ballooning of the number of plaintiffs signed by law firms around the United States amid the publicity of a possible settlement Some media reports have pegged the total number of plaintiffs at 80 000 while some sources have said the number is well over 100 000 A large part of that number however reflects plaintiffs that are signed

Monsanto acquisition A California shareholder of Bayer AG on Friday filed a lawsuit against the companies top executives claiming they breached their duty of prudence and loyalty to the company and

Trust is the sole named plaintiff in the suit which was filed in New York County Supreme Court The named defendants include Bayer CEO Werner Baumann who orchestrated the 63 billion Monsanto purchase and Bayer Chairman Werner Wenning who announced last month he was stepping down from the company earlier than planned The suit claims that Wenning s decision came after Bayer improperly obtained a copy of the then draft shareholder lawsuit through corporate espionage The lawsuit also claims that Bayer s recent announcement of an audit of its acquisition actions is bogus and part of the ongoing cover up and intended to create a legal barrier to this case to protect Defendants from their accountability The action is a shareholder derivative complaint meaning it is brought on behalf of the company against company insiders It seeks compensatory damages for shareholders and disgorgement of all compensation paid to the Bayer Managers and Supervisors who participated in bringing about this Acquisition The suit also seeks return of funds paid to banks and law firms involved in the acquisition The defendants include not only Baumann and Wenning but also some present and former Bayer directors and top managers as well as BOFA Securities Inc Bank of America Credit Suisse Group AG and the law firms of Sullivan Cromwell LLP and Linklaters LLP A Bayer spokesman did not respond to a request for comment The lawsuit comes a little more than a month before Bayer s April 28 annual shareholders meeting in Bonn Germany At last year s annual meeting 55 percent of shareholders registered their unhappiness with Baumann and other managers over the Monsanto deal and the subsequent loss of roughly 40 billion in market value Bayer s purchase of Monsanto has been clouded by tens of

trial scheduled to start next week in California Cotton v Monsanto has been postponed A new trial date is now set for July And on Tuesday Chhabria issued a stern order reminding both sides of the need for secrecy as the settlement talks proceed At the request of the mediator the parties are reminded that settlement discussions are confidential and that the Court will not hesitate to enforce the

Court to Overturn Verdict Against Monsanto Groups representing farm medical and biotechnology interests have filed briefs with the California Court of Appeal aligning with Monsanto in asking the court to overturn last summer s jury verdict that found Monsanto s glyphosate herbicides cause cancer and determined that the company spent years covering up the risks The groups are urging the appeals court to either throw out the win a San Francisco jury gave to school groundskeeper Dewayne Lee Johnson in August of 2018 or to invalidate an order for Monsanto to pay punitive damages to Johnson The Johnson trial was the first against Monsanto over claims that its glyphosate based herbicides such as Roundup can cause non Hodgkin lymphoma Johnson is one of more than 18 000 plaintiffs making similar claims The lawsuits allege that Monsanto was aware of scientific research showing an association between its herbicides and cancer but rather than warn consumers the company worked to suppress the research and manipulate scientific literature The jury in the Johnson case decided Monsanto should pay 289 million in damages including 250 million in punitive damages The trial judge in the case later slashed the punitive damage amount reducing the total award to 78 million Two other juries in subsequent trials over similar claims have also found in favor of plaintiffs and ordered large punitive damages against Monsanto Monsanto appealed the verdict and Johnson cross appealed seeking reinstatement of the full 289 million Oral arguments are expected in this appeals court this fall with a potential decision from the appeals court before the end of the year One of the parties filing a brief supporting Monsanto s position is Genentech Inc a San Francisco biotech company with a history of doing research for cancer treatments In its appeal to the court Genentech argues that it has expertise as a science company and sees the Johnson verdict as a threat to scientific progress Courts must ensure the proper use of science in the courtroom in order for innovation to flourish in the marketplace the Genentech brief states Genentech announced earlier this year a fast track review from the Food and Drug Administration for a drug treatment for people with non Hodgkin lymphoma In backing Monsanto s appeal Genentech echoed complaints by Monsanto that Johnson s lawyers did not properly present expert scientific testimony Genentech writes to highlight the importance of the proper screening of scientific expert testimony for companies with scientifically innovative products and consumers who rely on their innovations The company also sided with Monsanto on the issue of punitive damages arguing that companies should not be subject to punitive damages if their

they routinely second guess the safety decisions of regulators On Tuesday the California Farm Bureau Federation filed its own brief supporting Monsanto The farm bureau which says it represents 36 000 members said the case is of vital concern to farmers and ranchers who depend on crop protection tools to grow food and fiber Even though the Johnson verdict does not impact the regulation of glyphosate herbicides the farm bureau argues in its brief that the industry fears restrictions on the chemical The farm group additionally argued that the trial court s decision disregards federal law as well as state law because it conflicts with the EPA s finding that glyphosate is not likely to cause cancer Additionally California associations representing doctors dentists and hospitals weighed in on behalf of Monsanto arguing that the jury s decision in the Johnson case was subject to emotional manipulation and not based on scientific consensus The answer to the complex scientific question the jury was required to resolve in this case should have been based on accepted scientific evidence and rigorous scientific reasoning not the jury s policy choices Even worse there is reason to suspect the jury s analysis was based on speculation and emotion the associations said in their brief Johnson s attorney Mike Miller said he feels real good about the chances of victory in the appeals

court that they have uncovered evidence of fraud in a secret deal between Monsanto and a lone plaintiff s lawyer who has not been active in the litigation until recently In a series of filings made Thursday with the U S Court of Appeals for the 11 th Circuit lawyers from three firms involved in the three successful Roundup trials alerted the court to what they said was an effort by Monsanto to buy a favorable appellate court ruling The agreement between Monsanto and one plaintiff and his attorney is a pay to appeal scheme according to plaintiffs lawyers Aimee Wagstaff Brent Wisner and Jennifer Moore The legal team asks the court to dismiss the appeal they allege is the focus of the scheme The lawyer involved in cutting the deal with Monsanto is Ashleigh Madison of Southeast Law LLC in Savannah Georgia Madison confirmed various terms of the arrangement with Monsanto to Wagstaff s firm in an email and phone conversations recounted in a declaration according to the filings made Thursday When contacted for comment Madison denied the allegations and said her client s best interests are her top priority She said she looks forward to further addressing the matter before a court of law as our system of justice intends Bayer which bought Monsanto in 2018 also said the claims made by Wagstaff Wisner and Moore are false The company issued a statement saying it has been completely transparent about its desire to appeal Roundup failure to warn cases on federal preemption grounds and the deal with Madison and her client is an appropriate path for such an appeal

out in their filing this week that while there is robust scientific evidence associating Roundup exposure to NHL there is a lack of scientific evidence associating Roundup to MFH differentiating the

issue of federal preemption The district court judge found in favor of Monsanto agreeing the Carson claim was preempted and the company had no duty to warn of a cancer risk The judge ruled in favor of Carson however on claims that Monsanto was negligent and the design of Roundup products was defective Monsanto has since told Carson and his attorney to drop the claims they won on and appeal the

he gets an additional substantial payment If Carson drops the appeal he would simply have to return the 100 000 settlement payment because he would be in breach of its terms Thus plaintiffs

that the papers were conceptualized from the outset as a strategy by Monsanto to discredit IARC One of Monsanto s top scientists not only reviewed the manuscripts but had a hand in drafting and

punitive Lawyers for Monsanto have objected to any discussion of Monsanto s wealth and the 63 billion Bayer paid for Monsanto but the judge has allowed some financial information to be shared with jurors Jurors may not ever be told exactly how much money Monsanto has made over the years in sales of its glyphosate herbicides but a look at just one year of financials 2012 the year Hardeman stopped using Roundup shows the company made roughly 2 billion in total profits that year Judge Chhabria noted in discussions with attorneys out of the presence of the jury that Hardeman s attorneys might want to argue that Monsanto spent a lot of money on advertising and payouts to executives rather than conducting long term safety studies on its products The money issues might be relevant to jurors deliberation over potential punitive damages Chhabria said It may be relevant to Monsanto s ability to pay but it seems even more relevant to the issue of what was knowable both liability and punitive damages whether Monsanto s conduct was extreme and outrageous Judge Chhabria said Why can t they argue look at all the money Monsanto has been willing to spend on advertising and it s not willing to you know conduct any sort of objective inquiry into the safety of its product It is not as much about the company s ability to pay as it is about the company s conduct with respect to the safety of its product Chhabria said Look at all these things that the company is spending extreme amounts of money on and it s not willing to lift a finger to conduct any sort of objective inquiry about the safety of its product That I assume is their argument Chhabria said the evidence of Monsanto s finance could be probative of the outrageousness of the company s conduct Pilliod Trial

According to the complaint Gordon purchased and used Roundup for at least 15 continuous years through approximately 2017 and was diagnosed with a form of non Hodgkin lymphoma in 2006 Gordon has gone through two stem cell transplants and spent a year in a nursing home at one point in her treatment She is so debilitated that it is difficult for her to be mobile Her case like that of the thousands of others filed around the United States alleges use of Monsanto s glyphosate based herbicides caused her to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma She s been through hell said St Louis attorney Eric Holland one of the legal team members representing Gordon She s horribly injured The human toll here is tremendous I think Sharlean is really going to put a face on what Monsanto s done to people Gordon said

investors are calling for Bayer CEO Werner Baumann to be ousted for championing the Monsanto acquisition which closed in June of last year just as the first trial was getting underway Bayer maintains that there is no valid evidence of cancer causation associated with Monsanto s herbicides and says it believes it will win on appeal But U S District Judge Vince Chhabria has ordered Bayer to begin

This excerpt from Merchants of Poison How Monsanto Sold the World on a Toxic Pesticide details how Monsanto and Bayer led attacks on the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer as well as other scientists and journalists who raised cancer concerns about glyphosate Attacking experts In the documentary film Merchants of Doubt Marc Morano a former staffer for U S Senator James Inhofe R OK described working to thwart action on climate by attacking the scientists speaking out about the crisis You ve got to name names and you ve got to go after individuals Morano said That s just what he did to some of the world s most renowned climate scientists We went after climate scientists James Hansen and Michael Oppenheimer Morano added and we had a lot of fun with it Attacking experts is a key industry spin tactic one the pesticide industry has been deploying for decades Sixty years ago when Rachel Carson published Silent Spring her scientific analysis of the harms of DDT Monsanto engaged in targeted personal attacks to try to undermine her research They derided Carson as a spinster a priestess of nature and even accused of being a mass murderess responsible for the lost lives of African children wrote Audubon magazine s Frank Graham Jr These character assaults he notes had nothing to do with the science or merits of pesticide use Character assassination has been deployed against countless scientists since But companies and their public relations proxies go after more than just the scientists they also attack journalists public interest groups and anyone raising concerns about their products These attacks serve two purposes they work to undermine the credibility of people who raise concerns and at the same time they can have a chilling effect causing critics to think twice about putting themselves in industry crosshairs Orchestrating outrage against IARC cancer researchers We see this tactic at work in Monsanto s now Bayer response to the 2015 report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC naming glyphosate a probable human carcinogen The ruling posed an existential threat to the world s most widely used

glyphosate ruling Monsanto had already begun engaging industry partners in a plan to in their words orchestrate outcry and outrage about the cancer agency The Monsanto strategy parallels those used by the tobacco industry and others but the glyphosate story is notable for its intensity Jonathan Samet American Journal of Public Health The examples below highlight the lengths to which Monsanto and its allies were willing to go and feel they needed to go to marginalize silence and discredit critics of glyphosate These examples also show the hidden influence pesticide companies wield as they weave their narrative through powerful third party allies in media academia and the highest levels of government Personal attacks on scientists One key industry partner Monsanto engaged in its plan to discredit the IARC scientists report on glyphosate was the Genetic Literacy Project GLP a group that claims it is the most visited biotechnology focused web source in the world While its tagline is science not ideology and its founder Jon Entine describes himself as an independent journalist the GLP s political mission is clearly stated in its tax filings to prevent legislative overreach in genetic engineering One of its top funders in recent tax filings was Bayer Entine and his group have a long history of promoting and arguing for deregulation of pesticides industrial chemicals plastics fracking and the oil industry often with attacks on scientists journalists and academics who raise concerns about those products Documents show that in March 2015 Monsanto Regulatory Affairs Lead Eric Sachs reached out to Entine and asked him to write about the IARC report on glyphosate Entine agreed to attend a briefing with Monsanto executives and he also asked if Monsanto was interested in expanding follow up on GLP s GMO science website content He emphasized that GLP s reach had expanded dramatically in the past year Following that email exchange GLP went on to publish dozens of articles critical of the cancer agency many of them personal attacks on the scientists involved in the glyphosate review and some of them written by former chemical industry lobbyists and

compelling links between glyphosate based herbicides and non Hodgkin lymphoma in a February 2019 meta analysis Entine and his board member Geoffrey Kabat suggested those scientists committed deliberate fraud Kabat is an epidemiologist with a long history of defending toxic products for example he has published several papers favorable to the tobacco industry including one that claims the

not ideology its funding sources trace back to some of the largest most consistent funders of climate science denial These include the Searle Foundation which also backs Morano s group ClimateDepot as well as the Scaife and Templeton Foundations which have supported GLP for many years More recently GLP funders include not just Bayer but also the Charles Koch Foundation and DonorsTrust which has been called the dark money ATM for stealth efforts to deregulate toxic industries All these foundations are leading backers of climate science disinformation according to the sociologist Robert Brulle

Red Flag employee notes You ll recall that following engagement by Red Flag a number of months ago the first piece in Reuters was quite critical of IARC The emails show how the Monsanto PR team also helped Kelland find an anonymous source to criticize IARC and offered her exclusive materials At one point Kelland shared with Monsanto executives a draft article she had written about glyphosate before it went to print The most influential of Kelland s articles ran in June 2017 and claimed that Aaron Blair a prominent epidemiologist and chair of the IARC glyphosate working group had withheld key data in the glyphosate assessment Had that data been included Kelland claimed IARC would have been less likely to call glyphosate a probable human carcinogen The story reverberated around the world with reprints and reports lifted from the article appearing in many leading newspapers even including Mother Jones Questions about Kelland s reporting began surfacing shortly after publication Kelland had characterized her source as court documents from a deposition Blair had given in a Monsanto legal case But the deposition was not filed in court and Kelland did not provide her readers with access to the original documents so it was initially impossible to verify her claims When former Reuters reporter Carey Gillam who worked for U S Right to Know at the time gained access to the documents she reported that Blair s full testimony contradicted key claims in Kelland s article Two years after the articles were published internal documents released in litigation revealed that Kelland s source for the documents was Sam Murphy a Monsanto media relations executive In an email to Kelland dated April 27 2017 Murphey included not only Blair s testimony but suggestions for how to frame the article along with a slide deck and talking points that emphasized key points Monsanto wanted to make that the IARC chair concealed crucial data that undermines IARC s conclusions Murphy

Malkan s 2017 article in Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting Reuters vs UN cancer agency Are corporate ties influencing coverage Attacking journalists Danny Hakim is lying to you and it s not his first rodeo either declared a blog by the American Council on Science and Health in March 2017 The attack on Hakim a New York Times journalist came in the wake of his reporting on corporate interference in the science on glyphosate pesticides and pollinator declines and the failure of GMO crops to increase yields The ACSH blog derided Hakim as a journalist with this caveat if we can even call him that Mean spirited attacks on journalists like this are another common feature of pesticide industry spin The strategy often carried out by front groups like ACSH that receive hidden industry funding seeks to undermine journalists who report critically on industry players while lifting up those who write favorably about companies and their products Examples abound ACSH has described Liza Gross a

Mother Jones has experienced industry harassment for reporting critically on GMOs and pesticides multiple emails tweets and other communications were sent to him and his editors by Monsanto s third

person just one reporter working from a home office in the Midwest juggling three kids with irregular writing deadlines Gillam wrote in the Guardian So the knowledge that a multibillion dollar corporation spent so much time and attention trying to figure out how to thwart me is terrifying When corporate power is so intensely brought to silence messengers to manipulate the public record and public opinion truth becomes stifled And we should all be afraid Suing the New York Times Attacks on the New York Times reporter Eric Lipton went far beyond smears After Lipton reported on undisclosed ties between University of Florida Professor Kevin Folta and Monsanto Folta sued Lipton and the New York Times claiming defamation Folta made wide ranging motions in the lawsuits in attempt to obtain documents from people involved in the story including employees of U S Right to Know A just dismissed Folta s requests as downright silly and laughable The New York Times pushed back on Folta s claims noting that Lipton s reporting on Folta s ties to Monsanto was based on Folta s own email communications Folta dropped the lawsuit in April 2019 but did not answer queries about who paid for the two year legal fight Meanwhile this kind of attack on journalists can have a chilling effect on others who want to dig into similar storylines For more details on the lawsuit and legal documents see our fact sheet on Kevin Folta Deploying women to attack organic food Another tool in the corporate attack toolbox recruit women to go after organic moms and other concerned citizens who are trying to cut down on exposures of glyphosate and other pesticides Why target mothers According to Pew research 80 percent of women with children do most of the food shopping and most of the meal preparation in their households for women with spouses but no children the number was 68 percent for shopping and 75 percent for meal prep And market trends are clear demand for organic food continues to outpace conventional foods that allow synthetic pesticides with many consumers citing health concerns about pesticides as their reason for choosing organic As Fortune magazine reported in 2015 concerns over

shifting away from conventional food companies Monsanto and other pesticide companies have pushed back by teaming up with groups and writers who disparage these concerns In 2017 Monsanto partnered with the non profit Independent Women s Forum IWF on a Food and Fear lecture series that encouraged women to ignore alarmist concerns about toxic chemicals in food Reasonable moms should push back on organic food alarmism according to a 2016 IWF podcast That same year IWF asked Monsanto for 43 000 to fund a Super Women of Science lecture series designed to undercut support for a California law to label toxic chemicals in food and consumer products The Independent Women s Forum has a long history of defending corporate interests Founded in 1993 the spent 3 million in 2019 toward its mission to engage more individuals in the civic process and build support for policies that empower individuals This mission belies the group s actual work product defense work for corporate donors such as Monsanto and arguing for deregulation of polluting industries on behalf of its funders including the Scaife Foundation Searle Freedom Trust DonorsTrust and other leading donors of the climate science denial network Babes and skeptics for pesticides Monsanto and Bayer have also allied with a particular genre of female writers and public speakers science communicators who claim to correct misinformation about chemical risks The Washington Post featured Sci Babe in a 2018 column about skeptics who are using science to fight a wave of bad nutrition advice on the Internet SciBabe also took up the glyphosate debate for Self magazine Should you worry about herbicides in your food Nope she concluded claiming inaccurately that no studies have found a causal link between glyphosate and cancer Neither Self nor the Washington Post mentioned SciBabe s conflicts of interest that her talks have been sponsored by the likes of Monsanto and DuPont and that she contracted with the artificial

are more examples More broadly than glyphosate defense these writers serve up similar messaging fare they heap scorn on the organic food industry argue synthetic chemicals in food are nothing to worry about and oppose efforts to increase transparency or restrict hazardous chemicals in food or farming often under the banner of freedom for women The tactic harkens back to one of Edward Bernays most famous stealth PR efforts the Torches for Freedom campaign designed to eliminate the social taboo of women smoking and increase sales for his tobacco industry clients Bernays s salvo opened on March 31 1929 when a woman named Bertha Hunt stepped out onto a crowded street at New York s Easter Parade and created a scandal by lighting a Lucky Strike cigarette The contrived stunt that was made to look spontaneous and independent is widely considered to be one of the first public relations campaigns The same freedom for women framing also plays out in the pesticide debate One example is a 2019 book Food Bullying by Michele Payn who describes herself as a kickboxing professional speaker and a mom tired of food bullies and keyboard cowards Her book claims to reveal the 5 75 trillion secret food marketers don t want you to know that organically grown low pesticide non GMO unprocessed foods made without chemical additives are no better for your health and the environment Payne advises mothers to stand up to the bullies and simplify safe food choices by not worrying about risks like pesticides Praise for Payn s book came from a familiar ring of pesticide defenders many of whom

The film was funded independently by Kickstarter according to the Sci Moms website Among the donors listed in the credits employees of Monsanto Syngenta and the Alliance for Science The film gives special thanks to Vance Crowe Monsanto s director of millennial engagement at the time SciMom co founder Kavin Senapathy co authored several articles in Forbes with similar messaging denouncing the fear of pesticides attacking the organic industry as a marketing scam and warning that radical environmentalists are more of a threat to the planet than pesticide industry products Forbes deleted these articles after the New York Times reported that Henry I Miller who co authored Senapathy s articles in Forbes had published a piece about glyphosate in Forbes that had been ghostwritten by Monsanto Miller is also a longtime defender of oil and tobacco industry interests Senapathy later tried to distance herself from Miller and Monsanto s Vance Crowe in an article for Undark magazine But she continues to pen articles promoting GMOs using standard pesticide industry spin downplaying risk and making false assurances of safety about chemical intensive food and farming For more on the industry connected work of Kavin Senapathy see our fact sheet Surveilling friends and foes of pesticides Monsanto s attack tactics especially its efforts to discredit scientists who raised cancer concerns about glyphosate are well documented And so too are the pesticide industry s efforts to closely monitor its critics and gather information for its attacks In May 2019 a whistleblower from Bayer s PR firm FleishmanHillard shared with French journalists a multitude of information the firm was tracking on 200 journalists politicians scientists nonprofit leaders and others flagged as

to say that in the product defense model the investigator starts with an answer then figures out the best way to support it David Michaels The Triumph of Doubt Dark Money and the Science of Deception The following is an excerpt from Merchants of Poison How Monsanto Sold the World on a Toxic Pesticide by Stacy Malkan with Kendra Klein PhD and Anna Lappé The analysis draws from thousands of pages of internal corporate documents released during lawsuits brought by farmers groundskeepers and everyday gardeners suing Monsanto over allegations that exposure to Roundup caused them to develop cancer as well as documents obtained through public records requests in a years long investigation by U S Right to Know We report on five tactics revealed in the documents about Monsanto s product defense campaign for glyphosate and why this matters for public health In this first tactic we discuss what the documents reveal about scientific misconduct that occurred over decades Corrupting Science Doubt is our product quipped a tobacco industry executive in a now infamous 1969 memo 1 More than a decade earlier the science on cigarettes was already clear smoking caused cancer But to avoid regulation and keep its products on the market the tobacco industry worked for decades to create doubt about the science linking cigarettes to health harms To do so the tobacco industry s PR firm Hill Knowlton hatched an initiative the Tobacco Institute Research Center TIRC that would go on to spend the next 40 years and 300 million designing and conducting research on cigarettes 2 Funded by and working in the interest of the industry the Center had no interest in answering a scientific question noted Harvard historian Allan Brandt The goal was to maintain vigorous control over the research program to use science in the service of public relations These tobacco industry efforts Brandt wrote would ultimately become the cornerstone of a large range of efforts to distort scientific processes for commercial ends during the second half of the 20th century 3 As the tobacco industry wove its influence through research and academic institutions the fossil fuel industry used similar PR tactics If you really want to change someone s mind in a big way you don t give them a single fact or point to a contradiction in an argument explained the Climate Reality Project in a 2019 report about the

investigative reporting in the wake of the IARC ruling reveal evidence of the company working to shape the scientific research on glyphosate for decades Long standing concerns about glyphosate Glyphosate is one of the most studied herbicides in the world Bayer claims on its website 11 The herbicide the company claims has been subject to rigorous testing and oversight by regulatory authorities whose conclusions consistently support the safety of glyphosate and glyphosate based herbicides when used as directed Indeed as Bayer notes regulatory authorities in the U S Europe and elsewhere have stated glyphosate does not pose a cancer risk But how robust were those reviews Whose research were they based on Were they conducted with transparency and using the best scientific methods Evidence from the Roundup cancer trials undercuts Bayer s rhetoric and before it Monsanto s about rigorous scientific scrutiny and regulatory oversight In videotaped testimony Monsanto s longtime CEO Hugh Grant admitted the company never conducted an epidemiological analysis of glyphosate to determine if people who used it had an increased risk of cancer 12 The record shows that the company also did not conduct studies on formulated Roundup products the chemical combination of glyphosate and other ingredients such as surfactants to determine cancer risk 13 you cannot say that Roundup is not a carcinogen We have not done the necessary testing on the formulation to make that statement Donna Farmer Monsanto Yet concerns about cancer date back to the chemical s earliest days on the market A 1983 Monsanto study found that mice exposed to glyphosate developed rare tumors at statistically significant rates 14 15 Based on concerns about kidney tumors in the mice EPA toxicologists signed a consensus review of glyphosate in March 1985 stating they were classifying glyphosate as a Category C oncogen a substance possibly carcinogenic to humans 16 But after Monsanto pressured the agency EPA s top brass overruled its own scientists concerns 17 assuring instead that glyphosate posed no cancer risk a position EPA still holds today 18 While Monsanto employees

damage 20 Years later Heydens would acknowledge vulnerabilities in the science that could trigger a cancer warning for glyphosate from the IARC In a 2014 email Heydens wrote while we have vulnerability in the area of epidemiology we also have potential vulnerabilities in the other areas that IARC will consider namely exposure genotox and mode of action Heydens would know In 1999 he did not conduct the tests necessary to understand these risks despite the advice of an outside expert to do so 21 These internal communications among Monsanto executives suggest a remarkable lack of willingness to do the necessary testing even as Monsanto scientists and consultants noted concerns Revelations about how Monsanto scientists handled its research on glyphosate prompted U S District Court Judge Vince Chhabria who oversaw multi district legislation involving cancer risk of glyphosate based Roundup herbicides to observe in 2019 there is strong evidence from which a jury could conclude that Monsanto does not particularly care whether its product is in fact giving people cancer focusing instead on manipulating public opinion and undermining anyone who raises genuine and legitimate concern about the issue 22 there is strong evidence from which a jury could conclude that Monsanto does not particularly care whether its product is in fact giving people cancer focusing

studies Parry suggests William Heydens Monsanto In the late 1990s Dr James Parry an expert on genotoxicity hired by Monsanto to review studies on glyphosate concluded the chemical could be genotoxic meaning it could induce genetic mutation chromosomal breaks or chromosomal rearrangements that have the potential to cause cancer In a series of internal emails from 1999 Monsanto executives discussed whether to drop Parry or work closely with him to edit the presentation of information 23 Monsanto s Heydens advised his colleagues let s step back and look at what we are really trying to achieve here We want to find develop someone who is comfortable with the genotox profile of glyphosate Roundup and who can be influential with regulators and Scientific Outreach operations when genotox issues arise 24 Heydens continued My read is that Parry is not currently such a person and it would take quite some time and studies to get him there We simply aren t going to do the studies Parry suggests we should seriously start looking for one or more other individuals to work with emphasis in original Notably Heydens added we are currently very vulnerable in this area Internal emails indicate that the Monsanto team ultimately did decide to drop Parry and find another scientist to write about genotoxicity In a September 1999 email Monsanto toxicologist Donna Farmer suggested that the only person who could dig us out of this genotox hole is the Good Dr Kier 25 It would seem the doctor delivered In 2013 Dr Kier a former Monsanto scientist co authored a review paper concluding that glyphosate based herbicides do not appear to present significant genotoxic risk 26 Emails reveal that Monsanto scientists played a significant role in shaping that paper One helped draft the paper and several

scientific papers The Kier and Kirkland paper is just one example of how Monsanto employees shaped the peer reviewed scientific literature on glyphosate Additional internal documents reveal how widespread this practice was In an article in the Journal of Public Health Policy Carey Gillam and Sheldon Krimsky note multiple email exchanges authored by Monsanto employees that discuss as an ostensibly normal business practice ghostwriting papers that when published appear to be authored by independent academic scientists or consultants with academic credentials 29 These papers have in turn shaped the public s understanding of Monsanto herbicides and regulators policy frameworks around them One of the most influential of these studies was an April 2000 paper published in Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology Characterized by the authors as a comprehensive safety evaluation and risk assessment for humans of glyphosate and its use in Roundup allegedly independent scientists Gary Williams Robert Kroes and Ian Munro concluded that Roundup herbicide does not pose a health risk to humans 30 Regulators around the world have relied on this paper as foundational proof of the safety of glyphosate Now the hard work by public affairs begins Lisa Drake Monsanto But how independent are these authors and their findings In an email the summer before the paper s publication Monsanto s

discussed commissioning a meta study to respond to what the company expected would be a negative carcinogenicity ruling One option for keeping costs down he noted would involve us doing the writing

least one of them 40 In response to these revelations the journal s publisher Taylor Francis initiated a review and its team of legal and ethical experts found the authors had hidden Monsanto s true involvement in the papers Internal emails reveal a protracted disagreement between the publishing group which wanted to retract at least three of the five papers and the journal editor Roger McClellan who refused to do so citing concerns about his reputation and the sensitive position Monsanto was in with trials underway involving glyphosate 41 42 As of the summer of 2022 the journal has not

form the basis not just for news stories and regulatory decisions but for bodies of knowledge and common understandings about whether products pose risks or not Their influence is profound This is why companies like Monsanto work to shape these sources of information They matter Capturing the U S Environmental Protection Agency The cornerstone of Monsanto s now Bayer s defense of glyphosate has

while serious questions about public health remain in limbo In These Times An investigation by journalists Valerie Brown and Elizabeth Grossman in In These Times of government documents dating back 40 years reveals how Monsanto influenced EPA decisions on glyphosate Throughout the 1970s Brown and Grossman write EPA staff repeatedly raised red flags about the inadequacy of testing data that Monsanto was submitting in support of glyphosate s original registration but they report those concerns were buried or overruled often by higher ups within the agency 45 In one early incident an EPA scientist raised concerns in a 1978 memo about a study conducted by one of Monsanto s contract labs The lab not only failed to record what happened in the experiment but also reported on specimens that were supposedly taken from the uteri of male rabbits an organ not found in male rabbits This is only the most egregious example of the unreliable data made available to the EPA during its original regulatory review in the 1970s Brown and Grossman report The journalists note that many other memos they examined were either incomplete or had otherwise unacceptable toxicology screening tests Brown and Grossman conclude Glyphosate is a clear case of regulatory capture by a corporation acting in its own financial interest while serious questions about public health remain in limbo The record suggests that in 44 years through eight presidential administrations EPA management has never attempted to correct the problem 46 Trying to stop a domestic IARC Internal records show that Monsanto executives also counted on allies within the EPA to help keep its products on the market For example Monsanto emails show a persistent effort by multiple officials within the EPA to try to stop the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ATSDR a department of the U S Department of Health and Human Services from reviewing the science on glyphosate 47 In June 2015 Monsanto s science and policy lead Eric Sachs sent a text message to former EPA toxicologist Mary Manibusan to inquire if she knew anyone in the ATSDR to help the company 48 Manibusan replied Sweetheart I know lots of

ATSDR review If I can kill this I should get a medal 52 In a letter filed with the court in 2017 a 30 year career EPA toxicologist Marion Copley accused Rowland of playing political conniving games with the science to favor pesticide manufacturers Citing evidence from animal studies and the data Copley wrote It is essentially certain that glyphosate causes cancer 53 While Rowland may have helped delay the ATSDR review of glyphosate he was not able to stop it the agency released its draft report in 2018 and a final toxicological profile on glyphosate in 2020 noting links between glyphosate and cancer 54 Nevertheless the EPA continues to assert that glyphosate does not cause cancer 55 However in 2022 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the EPA disregarded its own rules when assessing glyphosate and ordered the agency to re examine glyphosate s impacts on health and the environment 56 Influencing EU safety assessments Like the EPA the European Food Safety Authority EFSA

constitute a conflict and so did not need to be reported in public disclosures 63 Fraud and corruption has also come to light at laboratories the pesticide industry relied on to conduct risk assessments for government agencies in both the U S and Europe In February 2020 revelations surfaced that 24 scientific studies submitted to European regulators to prove the safety of glyphosate came from a large German laboratory that has been accused of fraud and other wrongdoing in service of corporations trying to get their products approved by regulatory agencies 64 Similar problems arose in

conducted for Monsanto on glyphosate were invalid 65 The company repeated the studies and no IBT data is used to support glyphosate registration today however the scandal which included criminal

animals are consuming large amounts of GM crops every day for long periods and 2 the forecasted health effects are not apparent in publicly available datasets 68 A year later Alison van Eenennam an animal geneticist at the University of California Davis published a paper in the Journal of Animal Science and Biotechnology that was based on the same datasets that Vicini was referring to and echoed the messages he sought to promote 69 That van Eenennaam was a former Monsanto employee was not noted by the journal 70 The paper s conclusions appear to have been part of a coordinated PR push Before the official publication date Monsanto collaborator Jon Entine whose group now receives money from Bayer published a lengthy article in Forbes claiming that van Eenennam s study was the most comprehensive study of GMOs and food ever conducted and proved that the debate about GMO safety is over 71 Claims that the debate is over or that there is a consensus of safety about GMOs are topline arguments of the pesticide industry and its PR allies 72 However these claims are not supported by an objective analysis of the refereed literature according to a statement signed by 300 independent scientific researchers and scholars 73 These researchers assert that there is no consensus on GMO safety They described blanket safety assurances as an artificial construct that has been falsely perpetuated by industry stakeholders 74 Making general claims about the safety of genetic engineering is unscientific illogical and absurd wrote Belinda Martinau a geneticist who helped", "chunk_id":

geneticist who helped develop the first genetically engineered food in a letter to the New York Times because each product is different the safety of each one must be assessed individually 75 The World Health Organization concurs according to its FAQ it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM foods because individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed on a case by case basis 76 Genetic engineering including newer genome editing techniques have unpredictable outcomes says Michael Antoniou a molecular geneticist at King s College London To understand health impacts he said You basically need to conduct a long term feeding trial in animals and see what happens and that s just not going on anywhere in the world for regulatory purposes at all It is important to also note due to patents involved studies on genetically engineered seeds and crops are largely controlled by companies that own the intellectual property rights since in most cases researchers must ask for permission to research patented materials 77 As noted previously just four companies Bayer Corteva formerly DowDuPont BASF and Syngenta ChemChina controlled 75 percent of plant breeding research 60 percent of the commercial seed market and 76 percent of global agrichemical sales in 2019 78 The bottom line according to the researchers no consensus statement scientific research in the field of GM crop safety is nuanced complex often contradictory or inconclusive confounded by researchers choices assumptions and funding sources and in general has raised more questions than it has currently answered In their view decisions about food and agriculture should not be based on misleading and misrepresentative claims made by an internal circle of likeminded stakeholders but rather should be supported by strong scientific evidence on the long term safety of GM crops and foods obtained in a manner that is honest ethical rigorous independent transparent and sufficiently diversified to compensate for bias 79 Relying on insufficient science The examples described in Tactic 1 Corrupting Science demonstrate some of the many methods Monsanto employees used to influence the science on glyphosate These examples raise questions about the validity rigor and bias in the studies conducted or influenced by Monsanto to assess the safety of their products In the

Companies can get away with selling dangerous products he said because the current science regulators rely on for toxicity testing is wildly out of date 80 A 2021 report from the Institute of Cancer Research at the Medical University of Vienna underscores this point in regard to glyphosate research Researchers reviewed 53 safety studies on glyphosate submitted to regulators by large chemical companies and found that most of the studies do not comply with modern international standards for scientific rigor 81 82 Most of the studies did not even include tests that are most able to detect cancer risks The quality of these studies not of all but of many of these studies is very poor Siegfried Knasmueller Medical University of Vienna In the next two tactics we describe how Monsanto using the scientific findings they helped craft worked with a range of third party allies including leading academic institutions to disseminate their messaging about the safety and necessity of glyphosate

pages of internal corporate documents released during lawsuits brought by people suing Monsanto over allegations that exposure to glyphosate based Roundup caused them to develop cancer and many more

Co opting Academia In the fall of 2014 as voters in Oregon and Washington were poised to vote on whether genetically engineered foods should be labeled industry allies grew worried about Monsanto s plan to feature scientists in ads for the anti labeling campaign I m a little skeptical that a letter with a lot of scientist signatures will be enough to counter the flood of fear mongering Val Giddings the former vice president of the biotechnology trade association wrote to Monsanto s Lisa Drake 1 Giddings suggested the company instead consider creating TV spots featuring attractive young women preferably mommy farmers to persuade voters to vote against labeling requirements Drake shot down that idea Doesn t poll as well as credible third party scientists she told Giddings I know it is hard to believe but I have seen the poll results myself and that is why the campaigns work the way they do 2 Monsanto s PR helpers strategize about how to defeat GMO labeling Indeed the voices of authority especially academic experts receive the highest marks on trust according to global surveys 3 In this context the growing private sector influence over universities and land grant institutions in particular is concerning From 1970 to 2014 public funding to land grant universities for agricultural research and development grew by just 20 percent while private funding grew by 193 percent to 6 3 billion according to an analysis from the Agricultural Policy Analysis Center 4 Today hundreds of millions of dollars flow from agribusiness including pesticide companies into land

money purchases is enormous the Food and Water Watch analysis concluded Corporate money shifts the public research agenda toward the ambitions of the private sector whose profit motivations are often at odds with the public good The tobacco industry and fossil fuel industry have long recognized the benefits of working with academics and influencing academic agendas through institutional funding We now have ample evidence of how Monsanto too has influenced academic institutions and enlisted academics in its campaign to shape consensus on the safety of glyphosate and crops genetically engineered to tolerate the chemical How much money did Monsanto and other pesticide companies give to land grant universities and to individual professors What benefits do corporate donors get in return for these investments And why is so much of this information hidden from the public These are some of the questions that prompted Gary Ruskin at U S Right to Know USRTK to launch an investigation in 2015 using the Freedom of Information Act FOIA and state public record laws to research how Monsanto and other pesticide firms work with and pay academics In the years since USRTK has obtained and reported on thousands of industry and government documents many of which are now posted in the USRTK collections in the University of California San Francisco UCSF Food and Chemical Industry Document Libraries 7 The documents shed light on how food and chemical corporations rely on many third party allies including academics to promote their products They also make clear that inquiries into the ties between industry and academia were questions that Monsanto and other pesticide companies wanted to avoid answering Fighting transparency at public universities A confidential Monsanto memo dated July 2019 noted USRTK s plan to FOIA universities will impact the entire industry and has the potential to be extremely damaging 8 The 31 page memo details Monsanto s plan to form a coordinated defense to counter the public record requests involving PR firms trade groups 11 Monsanto employees and academic allies to protect Monsanto s reputation and what the company dubbed freedom to operate or FTO and to protect its relationships with academics The memo gives guidance to employees on how to avoid disclosing details about funding while conveying complete transparency in our relationship with

is via university foundations which are not required to disclose their donors In the case of the University of Florida Foundation there was specific guidance for how to answer questions about donations If asked whether Monsanto was a gold donor to the foundation for example the company document suggested this answer I have not been able to secure information to address your mention of Monsanto as a gold donor The company was a gold donor a fact that had already been reported by the New York Times in 2015 10 Undisclosed partnerships with academics and universities The FOIA research turned up a number of examples of how Monsanto relied on academics to shape the narrative about its products and help keep them unregulated In 2015 Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Eric Lipton reported on this influence in a front page New York Times article Food industry enlisted academics in GMO labeling war emails show 11 The article reports on internal company documents first obtained by U S Right to Know showing how Monsanto paid academics to promote genetically engineered foods in an effort to keep these products unlabeled and unregulated Monsanto relied on academics Lipton reported for the gloss of impartiality and weight of authority that come with a professor s pedigree 12 Professors researchers scientists have a big white hat in this debate Bill Mashek Ketchum PR As one example Monsanto gave a 25 000 grant to University of Florida Professor Kevin Folta to run promotional programs for GMOs 13 even as Folta publicly claimed to have no ties to Monsanto 14 15 The programs involved Folta traveling to other universities to train students and academics on how to promote GMOs and argue that they should not be labeled After the Monsanto funding became public Folta donated the money to a food bank but he continued receiving money from pesticide companies without full disclosure about his sources of industry funding 16 In documents reported by the New York Times

Ketchum wrote to Folta in 2014 Keep it up 17 In 2015 Monsanto s Lisa Drake engaged Folta to help boost the profile of GMOs on WebMD a website that Vox characterized as the most popular source of health information in the United States 18 Over the past six months Drake wrote to Folta we have worked hard through third parties to insert fresh and current material on WebMD relating to biotechnology health and safety Before that effort she said the material popping up about the topic dredged up highly negative input from Organic Consumer Association and the anti GMO critics While Drake noted that recent pieces that had been placed by third parties had improved the search results somewhat she was seeking Folta s support to do more It is a fairly simple process she said and asked Folta to consider submitting a blog on the safety and health of biotech and gave him instructions for how to do so Folta s response Can do My pleasure 19 Monsanto s influence with academia doesn t simply run through individual professors The University of Florida Foundation has also received significant funds from pesticide and seed companies more than 12 million for the 2013 14 academic year including a 1 million grant from gold donor Monsanto 20 The University of Florida in turn has been a stalwart ally in communicating industry friendly messaging In a 2014 email to Monsanto Professor David Clark from the university s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Plant Innovation Program IFAS described how the institution s stance on GMOs is harmonious with Monsanto s 21 As an example of this harmonious messaging Clark shared a video of Jack Payne IFAS senior vice president stating there is no science that agrees with these folks that are afraid of GMOs 22 I thought your talk was excellent and it is harmonious with the stance we are taking on GMOs at the University of Florida University of Florida IFAS Director David Clark to Monsanto s Robb Fraley Clark also noted

has mounted a passionate defense of pesticides On his Talking Biotech podcast Folta has claimed that the health risk of consuming pesticides through food is probably somewhere between 10 000 and a million times lower than a car accident He has also said that he drank glyphosate and would do it again to demonstrate its harmlessness 24 AgBio Chatter with industry and academics Internal documents also shed light on how Monsanto and its PR firms worked to coordinate messaging and lobbying efforts with their academic allies using a private email list called AgBioChatter The list included two Monsanto executives DuPont s former director of scientific affairs two higher ups at the biotechnology industry trade association and more than a dozen academics with industry connections many of them affiliated as experts or ambassadors with the pesticide industry funded marketing campaign GMO Answers described in Tactic 5 run by Ketchum Several of the academics also served in leadership roles for industry front groups connected with pesticide companies such as Genetic Literacy Project Academics Review and Sense About Science described in Tactic 3 These groups along with the listserv itself identified under the name Academics AgBioChatter appear among the industry partners in Monsanto s PR plan to defend glyphosate 25 Chemical industry executives and industry friendly academics discussed lobbying and PR strategies on the AgBioChatter list obtained via FOIA Emails from the listserv highlight messaging themes for example efforts to frame science documenting health concerns about pesticides as agenda driven while studies that claim safety are pro science 26 Another major theme involved efforts to discredit industry critics Records show that former Monsanto Communications Director Jay Byrne peppered the listserv with calls to action and messaging suggestions to confront influencers who raised concerns about GMOs including the scholar and environmental activist Vandana Shiva plant scientist and former Purdue Professor Don Huber and the nonprofit group Consumers Union As we describe in Tactic 4 attacks on critics have been a key component of Monsanto s communications

favorable policy In one example the Hawaii based Hawaii Crop Improvement Association HCIA a trade group funded by Corteva CropSciences formerly DowDuPont and Bayer recruited and paid academics including Kevin Folta to travel to the state in 2014 to help lobby against proposed pesticide restrictions there The industry trade group set up the meetings and coordinated the scientists messaging according to internal emails 27 One email describes key messages to be presented to the Kauai Business Council including Giving them peace of mind about the pesticides being used and the crops being grown including glyphosate 28 Despite these industry ties Folta promoted the trip as an effort by independent expert scientists who went to Hawaii simply to share science 29 The lack of public disclosure about pesticide industry ties to academics who lobby for industry interests is a recurring problem In another example Bruce Chassy a professor emeritus of food and nutrition at the University of Illinois appeared frequently in the media as an independent expert promoting GMOs and lobbying to keep them unlabeled In May 2016 the Associated Press quoted Chassy twice in a single week as an independent expert on the topic 30 But he too was receiving funds from Monsanto Two months earlier Monica Eng of WBEZ revealed that Chassy had received 57 000 from Monsanto over a two year period to travel write and promote GMOs and that Monsanto donated at least 5 1 million to the University of Illinois Foundation between 2005 and 2015 31 Internal documents posted by the New York Times further reveal that for years Chassy had been lobbying federal regulators to deregulate GMOs while receiving funds from Monsanto 32 In 2011 when the EPA proposed a data requirement to better understand the health and environmental impacts of genetically engineered crops Chassy organized a lobbying effort to defeat it 33 According to Chassy s notes from a conference call shared with Monsanto executives and others the goal was to ensure the EPA proposal never sees the light of day 34 For this lobbying effort Chassy enlisted other high profile academics the internal documents show including Nina Fedoroff a molecular biologist at Penn State University who was at that time president of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science AAAS the world s largest multidisciplinary

lobbyist for the biotechnology industry trade group 38 Interspersed in Chassy s emails to Sachs were queries about whether Monsanto had sent a check to the University of Illinois Foundation in support of Chassy s biotechnology outreach and education activities 39 Industry funded boot camps for journalists scientists Professors Chassy and Folta also collaborated with the pesticide industry to arrange a series of messaging training programs at public universities described as boot camps to shape coverage of pesticides and GMOs in the popular press Independent scientists and researchers can play a unique role in reframing the GMO debate because the public holds them in such high esteem noted a promotional flier for the Biotech Literacy Project boot camps The three day conferences held at University of Florida in 2014 40 and University of California Davis in 2015 41 were dedicated to helping scientists and journalists work together to bring science to the public in a way that is accessible and persuasive according to the agendas Expenses for the two events ran to over 300 000 and routed through a nonprofit group called Academics Review co founded by Chassy 42 Although the group claimed to be independent of industry tax records show that Academics Review received most of its funding including funding for the boot camps from the Council for Biotechnology Information CBI a trade group funded by chemical giants BASF Bayer DowDuPont and Syngenta 43 The agenda left no doubt about the public relations purpose of the boot camps to provide broad communications skills training that participants could use for reframing the food safety and GMO debate and lobbying for those products Participants will be provided both training and hands on assistance in developing the

who had written a report condemning the organic industry as a marketing scam in 2014 45 A panel on GMOs and chemicals was led by Hank Campbell president of the industry funded American Council on Science and Health ACSH a group that frequently defends glyphosate and other products made by its funders 46 Keynote speakers at the UC Davis event included Yvette d Entremont who blogs as SciBabe and mounts an ardent defense of pesticides in her writings and public appearances including talks at farming conferences sponsored by Monsanto and DuPont 47 In one podcast for example d Entremont claims We ve proven very very carefully that once they get into the food supply pesticides are safe for people 48 While SciBabe s website 49 cites her former job as an analytical chemist it omits that she worked for Amvac Chemical Corporation 50 which according to a Los Angeles Times investigation did booming business selling older dangerous pesticides and fighting to keep those chemicals on the market as long as possible hiring scientists and lawyers to do battle with regulatory agencies 51 SciBabe was also keynote speaker at an industry funded boot camp at UC Davis that coached journalists and academics on how to defend GMOs and pesticides Payoff for the pesticide industry s investment in events like the boot camps can be seen in the post event press A few weeks after the UC Davis event Popular Science ran a flattering Q A with SciBabe presenting d Entremont as a credible source on science 52 The piece was written by Brooke Borel a journalist who had attended the boot camp In 2014 a month after attending the University of Florida boot camp Marc Gunther penned an article in the Guardian claiming that nonprofit organizations like Friends of the Earth and Consumers Union two groups that have been ardent critics of glyphosate can t be trusted on GMOs 53 Gunther an editor at large at the Guardian noted that he came up with the idea for his article after reading a critique of

alleged that labeling GMOs would cost a typical family 500 a year 56 Funded by the same industry trade group whose members include Monsanto that funded the boot camps the study design had been debunked A Consumers Union rebuttal details the flaws in the study design finding that the industry funded study dramatically overestimates the cost of GMO labeling 57 Another journalist faculty member of the 2014 boot camp Washington Post columnist Tamar Haspel used her space in the Post a year later to defend glyphosate The article appeared at a politically important moment just days before a key Congressional vote on a bill that made it illegal for states to label GMOs Haspel s article downplaying cancer concerns of glyphosate quoted David Ropeik a risk analyst who had shared a panel

laws thereby removing any barriers to their access to African markets for their contentious high risk products Statement on Cornell Alliance for Science by the Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa A central strategy of the Alliance has been to recruit and train global fellows in communications focusing on fellows from regions with pushback on policies favorable to the biotech industry particularly African countries that have resisted GMO crops In 2018 for example twenty seven Global Leadership Fellows were chosen from seven countries Nigeria Uganda Kenya Ghana Zambia Zimbabwe and Tanzania to attend a 12 week training program to learn strategic planning grassroots organizing the science of crop biotechnology and effective communications to help them advocate for access to biotechnology 61 More than half the fellows were journalists or marketing professionals The Gates Foundation has also donated heavily to efforts in Africa to transition farmers away from traditional seeds and crops to commercial seeds and synthetic fertilizer to grow commodity crops for the global market promising those efforts would boost agricultural productivity and lift small scale farmers out of poverty The foundation has donated over 600 million to its flagship project in the region the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa AGRA which works in 11 countries to transition farmers to high input industrial agriculture 62 63 But these efforts have failed to improve food security according to a 2022 review commissioned by AGRA donors 64 The program has also been criticized by African food sovereignty groups 65 faith leaders 66 and researchers 67 who say AGRA is increasing corporate control in food systems damaging the environment and increasing debt for farmers 68 Although its main focus is promoting GMO seeds and crops Alliance fellows have also defended glyphosate based Roundup products using similar messaging and tactics that appear in Monsanto s strategy documents As one example the Cornell based group jumped into the glyphosate debate with a scathing critique of the IARC cancer report echoing the anti IARC theme described in Monsanto s PR plan 69 In a 2017 blog

cancer report echoing the anti IARC theme described in Monsanto s PR plan 69 In a 2017 blog on the Alliance for Science website Mark Lynas a writer for the group described the highly respected IARC cancer research panel as a flaky offshoot of the World Health Organization and claimed its glyphosate report was a witch hunt orchestrated by people overcome with hysteria and emotion who committed an obvious perversion of both science and natural justice by reporting cancer concerns Glyphosate Lynas claimed is the most benign chemical in world farming 70 In another example of playing defense for the pesticide industry the Alliance served a key function in trying to discredit the U S Right to Know s USRTK FOIA investigation into the industry s academic partnerships echoing Monsanto s strategy to counter these investigations As one of its first public efforts the Alliance launched a petition opposing the USRTK public records investigation describing the FOIA requests as an anti science bullying tactic that would stifle academic freedom 71 Similar messaging appears in Monsanto s U S Right to Know FOIA communication plan which notes among its objectives position this activist tactic as an attack on scientific integrity and academic freedom 72 The Monsanto plan even suggests reaching out to a key ally at the Gates Foundation for help In a section describing plans to enlist academic support the document suggests consider asking Robb Fraley to engage Rob Horsch underline in original The note refers to Monsanto executive Fraley engaging Horsch a former Monsanto executive who was at that time leader of the Gates Foundation s Agricultural Development team The Gates funded Cornell Alliance for Science used Monsanto s attack on science framing to try to discredit a FOIA investigation into the pesticide industry s ties with academics While Cornell Alliance for Science says it does not receive any funds from industry these examples show how Monsanto s allies provided aid to the company at key moments in the public debate about glyphosate safety It is also worth noting that the Alliance s main funder the Gates Foundation has had financial ties to Monsanto In 2010 the Gates Foundation Trust came under criticism for buying 500 000 shares of Monsanto stock 73 Although the Trust sold the stock the financial ties continued through Gates Foundation Trustee Warren Buffet s company Berkshire Hathaway which is also the largest holding of the Gates Foundation Trust In 2018 Buffett and Berkshire played a key role in supporting the merger between Bayer and Monsanto As the financial press reported at the time Buffet increased Berkshire s stake in Monsanto stock by 19 million shares a 62 percent jump just as Bayer was closing in on the merger signaling support for the deal to investors at a crucial moment As", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:usrtk.org_monsanto_tactic-2-post.txt:10:d4f9f9d3878f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 23693, "dataset":

genetically engineered crops and pesticide use To create an enabling environment for GMOs requires that pesticide companies operate with fewer restrictions so along with promoting GMOs the Alliance has focused its communications firepower on fighting important political battles to stop pesticide regulations notably in Hawaii In the last couple of decades some of the world s biggest agrichemical companies including Bayer have taken over massive agricultural land tracts on the islands for genetically engineered crop field trials and seed development 76 Drawn by the year round growing season and lax regulatory environment these companies have made Hawaii ground zero for open air testing of restricted use pesticides pesticides that are not available to the general public because of their toxicity concerns I have personally witnessed families and lifelong friendships torn apart Fern Holland Hawaii Alliance for Progressive Action describes the impact of the vicious divide and conquer tactics used by Gates funded Cornell Alliance for Science In the face of the widespread pesticide spraying on the islands and health and environmental concerns linked to these pesticides including glyphosate community advocates have fought to pass pesticide regulations 77 As one of these advocates shared in an op ed in the Cornell Daily Sun In 2013 as the efforts to pass these county level regulations picked up steam Cornell Alliance for Science associates came to our island to undermine community concerns about pesticides It was the beginning of a massive public relations disinformation campaign designed to silence community concerns 78 By 2016 the Alliance had launched a local chapter the Hawaii Alliance for Science to counter the communities organizing for regulation 79 The writings of Joan Conrow the managing editor of Cornell Alliance for Science 80 give a sense of their tactics In her blog Kauai Eclectic and other media outlets Conrow accused local advocacy groups working for pesticide reforms of tax evasion 81 compared a food safety group to the Ku Klux Klan 82 and critiqued media reports that raise concerns about pesticides 83 Despite these attacks

described the Alliance s work in Hawaii as vicious divide and conquer tactics to silence those critical of the pesticides used on biotech crops These tactics she noted have had a huge impact on the close knit rural communities of the islands I have personally witnessed families and lifelong friendships torn apart she shared 84 The Hawaii community groups were not the only ones to speak out about the Cornell Alliance Many scientists and advocates have documented similar concerns about inaccurate claims and misleading information promoted by the group and its spokespeople 85 86 Nevertheless the Gates Foundation renewed its funding commitment in the Alliance in 2020 and the Alliance announced it is expanding its scope to counter conspiracy theories and disinformation campaigns that hinder progress in climate change synthetic biology agricultural innovations and other key issues 87 As we demonstrate in this section prestigious academic institutions entities often trusted by the public and viewed as independent provided valuable platforms for Monsanto and other pesticide companies to move their product defense messaging for glyphosate and the GMO seeds designed to tolerate the chemical These academic allies are at the core of the industry s public relations spin In the next section we take a closer look at the role other impartial and scientific sounding groups play in the pesticide industry s disinformation network and how Monsanto moved its glyphosate defense messaging through a wide range of these third party allies groups that took their messaging cues from the

pesticide data provided by Dow Chemical For years U S regulators relied on falsified data provided by Dow Chemical to allow unsafe levels of the chemical chlorpyrifos into American homes according to a new analysis from University of Washington researchers The analysis reexamines work from the 1970s sponsored by Dow and submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to guide the agency in establishing what scientists refer to as a no observed adverse effect level or NOAEL Such thresholds are used to determine what types of use and at what level a chemical exposure can be allowed and still be considered safe According to the new analysis published online July 3 in the journal Environmental International the inaccurate findings were the result of a chlorpyrifos dosing study conducted by researcher Frederick Coulston and colleagues from the Albany Medical College in the early 1970s for Dow The authors of the new paper reexamining that prior work are Lianne Sheppard Seth McGrew and Richard Fenske of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences School of Public Health at the University of Washington While the study was authored by the Coulston group the analysis was completed by a Dow statistician and concluded that 0 03 mg kg day was the chronic NOAEL level for chlorpyrifos in humans But the new analysis by the University of Washington researchers found that wildly overstated the margin of safety Had the data been properly analyzed a lower NOAEL of 0 014 mg kg day would have been found they said The Coulston study did not undergo peer review but still was used by the EPA for risk assessments throughout much of the 1980 s and 1990 s the University of Washington researchers reported The researchers concluded During that period EPA allowed chlorpyrifos to be registered for multiple residential uses that were later cancelled to reduce potential health impacts to children and infants Had appropriate analyses been employed in the evaluation of this study it is likely that many of those registered uses of chlorpyrifos would not have been authorized by EPA This work demonstrates that reliance by pesticide regulators on research results that have not been properly peer reviewed may needlessly endanger the public Widely used Commonly known as the active ingredient in the brand name Lorsban chlorpyrifos insecticides were introduced by Dow Chemical in 1965 and have been used widely in agricultural settings The largest agricultural market for chlorpyrifos is corn but the pesticide is also used by farmers growing soybeans fruit and nut trees Brussels sprouts cranberries and cauliflower as well as other row crops Residues of the chemical are commonly found in food Non agricultural uses include golf courses turf

has shown mounting evidence of the dangers of chlorpyrifos particularly to young children Scientists have found that prenatal exposures to chlorpyrifos are associated with lower birth weight reduced IQ the loss of working memory attention disorders and delayed motor development The American Academy for Pediatrics which represents more than 66 000 pediatricians and pediatric surgeons has warned that continued use of the chemical puts developing fetuses infants children and pregnant women at great risk Chlorpyrifos is so dangerous that the European Food Safety Authority has stated that there is no safe exposure level The EPA reached an agreement with Dow in 2000 to phase out all residential uses of the chemical because of research showing the chemical is dangerous to the developing brains of babies and young children In 2012 chlorpyrifos was banned from use around schools In February 2020 after pressure from consumer medical scientific groups and in face of growing calls for bans around the world Corteva AgriScience a successor corporation to a merger of Dow and DuPont said it would phase out production of chlorpyrifos The chemical however remains legal for other companies to make and sell Human subjects The study that is the subject of the new paper by the University of Washington researchers was overseen in 1971 by the Albany Medical College s Institute of Experimental Pathology and Toxicology The study included 16 healthy adult male inmates from a pool of volunteers at Clinton Correctional Facility a maximum security prison in Dannemora New York The volunteers were randomized into four experimental groups including one control group whose members received a daily placebo The members of the three other groups received daily chlorpyrifos treatments at three different doses The study took place over 63 days The new analysis found several problems with the study including the omission of eight valid baseline measurements for one of the three treatment groups Such an omission of valid data without justification is a form of data falsification that violates all standard codes of ethical research practice and is classified as outright research misconduct the University of Washington researchers concluded The researchers said that chlorpyrifos passed through the regulatory process without much debate even though there was growing evidence that it might pose a health hazard in residential environments The Coulston Study misled regulators by omitting valid data and may have adversely impacted public health for several years the

Release For Immediate Release Tuesday April 20 2021 at 9am EDT For More Information Contact Gary Ruskin 1 415 944 7350 or Mélissa Mialon 33 671756537 The food industry has been trying to revise the standards and principles by which science is conducted in ways that benefit industry such as by promoting the acceptance of public private partnerships and permissiveness about conflicts of interest according to a study published today in the journal Globalization and Health The food industry s work in this area has been led by the International Life Sciences Institute a nonprofit organization founded by a Coca Cola executive and funded by the food industry The new study found that ILSI s work on scientific integrity ignores the risks of accepting corporate funding and fails to provide guidelines to protect from these risks The study is based on documents obtained from public records requests by U S Right to Know an investigative public health group as well as others from the public domain and from the UCSF Food Industry Documents Archive What is worrying is that the food industry built a niche literature on scientific integrity through a third party that wasn t known until recently as acting for large food companies said Mélissa Mialon the lead author of the study and research fellow at the Trinity Business School of Trinity College Dublin Researchers and institutions concerned about conflicts of interest may fail to recognize that influence from corporations in the literature they cite and use to advance scientific integrity principles Big Food wants to manipulate the standards of research and science to defend processed foods that promote obesity diabetes and other ills said Gary Ruskin executive director of U S Right to Know one of the co authors of the study It is eroding the integrity of science which crucially must be independent of and impartial to powerful corporations and their drive for profits The study notes that the food industry like the alcohol and tobacco industries tries to influence science s very principles such as scientific integrity and the good conduct of research The study concludes that ILSI s work on scientific integrity conflicts of interest and public private partnerships waters down independent work in that space puts profits before science and undermines efforts to address undue influence of industry actors on public policy research and practice In recent years ILSI has been the subject of critical reporting including three articles from The New York Times Most of ILSI s work in the area of scientific integrity was

published in peer reviewed journals endorsed by Federal agencies and professional nutrition and food science societies and cited broadly throughout the scientific community The study argues that it is important to counter these practices as they risk shaping scientific standards to suit the industry s interests rather than public health ones The study found that ILSI is a leading actor not only in the food industry but more broadly in the scientific community on the development of scientific integrity standards and principles It notes that In the very process of developing scientific integrity principles food companies may use their connections with these reputable individuals and organizations to further their influence on science and policy The food industry efforts to refashion the principles of science seem to repeat the actions of the tobacco industry In a 2001 article in the American Journal of Public Health Elisa Ong and Stanton Glantz wrote of tobacco industry s

Sunday May 17 th 2020 at 8pm EDT For More Information Contact Gary Ruskin 1 415 944 7350 The influential global nonprofit group International Life Sciences Institute ILSI says that its mission is to improve the well being of the general public but a study published today in Public Health Nutrition adds evidence that it is in fact a food industry front group The study based on documents obtained by U S Right to Know via state public records requests uncovered a pattern of activity in which ILSI sought to exploit the credibility of scientists and academics to bolster industry positions and promote industry devised content in its meetings journal and other activities ILSI is insidious because they say they work for health when really they defend the food industry and its profits said Gary Ruskin executive director of U S Right to Know a consumer and public health group Across the world ILSI is central to the food industry s product defense to keep consumers buying the ultra processed food sugary beverages and other junk food that promotes obesity type 2 diabetes and other ills The study reveals how ILSI promotes the interests of the food and agrichemical industries including ILSI s role in defending controversial food ingredients and suppressing views that are unfavorable to industry that corporations such as Coca Cola can earmark contributions to ILSI for specific programs and how ILSI uses academics for their authority but allows industry hidden influence in their publications In the study the co authors call for ILSI to be recognised as a private sector entity rather than an independent scientific non profit The study also reveals new details about which companies fund ILSI and its branches For example ILSI North America s draft 2016 IRS form 990 shows a 317 827 contribution from PepsiCo contributions greater than 200 000 from Mars Coca Cola and Mondelez and contributions greater than 100 000 from General Mills Nestle Kellogg Hershey Kraft Dr Pepper Snapple Group Starbucks Coffee Cargill Unilever and Campbell Soup ILSI s draft 2013 Internal Revenue Service form 990 shows that it received 337 000 from Coca Cola and more than 100 000 each

science denial playbook Sign up for our free weekly newsletter Merchants of Poison How Monsanto Sold the World on a Toxic Pesticide a new report by Stacy Malkan with Kendra Klein PhD and Anna Lappé

Roundup as a case study this is the first comprehensive review of Monsanto s product defense strategy including the tactics used to manipulate science attack scientists and journalists and influence regulatory agencies to protect profits from glyphosate the world s most widely used herbicide The report also names the astroturf operations front groups professors journalists and other third party allies Monsanto now owned by Bayer relied on to defend glyphosate despite decades of science linking the toxic chemical to cancer reproductive impacts and other health concerns The analysis draws from thousands of pages of internal corporate documents released during lawsuits brought by farmers groundskeepers and everyday gardeners suing Monsanto over allegations that exposure to Roundup caused them to develop cancer as well as documents obtained through public records requests in a years long investigation by U S Right to Know a public interest research group Read excerpts from the report

914 843 6738 Connie Hoe conniehoe jhu edu 49 6221 565344 The International Food Information Council promotes food and beverage company interests and undermines the accurate dissemination of scientific evidence related to diet and health according to a study published yesterday in the journal Globalization and Health IFIC is widely cited in the media as a source on consumer sentiment and matters related to food and health The study was produced by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and U S Right to Know a nonprofit investigative public health group U S Right to Know obtained nearly 30 000 pages of documents for the study through federal and state public records requests The study found that IFIC often engages in consumer preference shaping which includes the use of key opinion leaders and multimedia communications to promote narratives sympathetic to business interests The group also is involved in manufacturing doubt which is using specific evidence and rhetoric to create doubt about negative health impacts of specific foods or food groups IFIC conducts product defense and science denial for the ultra processed food industry said Gary Ruskin executive director of U S Right to Know and one of the co authors of the study It works to protect food industry profits not your health The study concludes that IFIC uses media outlets to preemptively counter information about the negative health impacts of added sugars and ultra processed foods IFIC and its affiliates disseminate a narrow subset of nutrition and health information consistent with corporate interests and in opposition to public health policies associated with improved population health Based on our review of scientific evidence presented to large media outlets by academic researchers on behalf of IFIC there is reason to consider IFIC a purveyor of nutrition based misinformation the study says IFIC often appears as a source in the media For example during the last year IFIC has been cited in the New York Times USA Today Newsweek US News World Report Consumer Reports Good Housekeeping Huff Post Martha Stewart Living SHAPE and Men s Health among others As a part of its media outreach IFIC produces consumer surveys The study reports that IFIC its consumer surveys and IFIC supported academic researchers consistently focus on individual or person level changes to diet and health This individualistic narrative is consistent with those promoted by other health harming industries such as the tobacco and alcohol industries IFIC was established to work

as an industry partner in its efforts to defend the reputation of Roundup weedkiller from cancer concerns IFIC is based in Washington DC and sometimes works closely with federal agencies IFIC states that its current partners include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and four programs within the U S Department of Agriculture USDA It is not the proper role of federal agencies like the CDC and FDA to legitimize corporate front groups and especially not ones that promote products that detract from our health Ruskin said Other IFIC partners include the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine NASEM World Health Organization WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO

of Nutrition and Dietetics accepted millions of dollars from food pharmaceutical and agribusiness companies had policies to provide favors in return and invested in ultra processed food company stocks according to a study published today in Public Health Nutrition The Academy says it is the world s largest organization of nutrition and dietetics practitioners representing more than 112 000 credentialed practitioners including registered dietitian nutritionists and other food and nutrition professionals The study was produced by public health scholars and U S Right to Know a nonprofit investigative public health group that obtained tens of thousands of pages of internal Academy documents through state public records requests The study describes a symbiotic relationship between the Academy and corporations and found the Academy acts as a pro industry voice with policy positions that sometimes clash with its mission to improve health globally The documents reveal a depressing chapter of corruption at this influential nutrition group said Gary Ruskin executive director of U S Right to Know and one of the study s co authors If we re going to get healthier live longer and lower our astounding rates of obesity and diabetes we ve got to clean out the corruption at health groups like the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics The study reveals that the Academy accepted more than 15 million from corporate and organizational contributors in the years 2011 and 2013 2017 according to its draft IRS forms 990 The top contributors to the Academy in 2011 and 2013 2017 were

interest Ruskin said Public health groups should not invest in companies that make products that detract from our health or directly conflict with their mission The Academy appears to have allowed quid pro quo purchases of rights and benefits by corporate sponsors Internal communications show that the Academy distinguishes its sponsors from its supporters Corporate sponsors pay a fee and in return the Academy provides a right or a benefit Corporate supporters provide a charitable contribution with no explicit expectation of a commercial return The study found striking similarities between the Academy and other cases of institutions captured by corporations such as ILSI and the Global Energy Balance Network orchestrated by the soft drink industry to promote its commercial agenda in scientific institutions See links for background on ILSI and GEBN The study notes that Although AND has changed some of its internal policies to manage corporate interference and funding it continues to advance corporate interests in several ways and serves as a voice for its corporate sponsors The current AND ANDF policies and public statements are not sufficient to explain why the AND continues to accept financial contributions of corporations whose products such as ultra processed foods and formula milks are associated with ill health Today s study in Public Health Nutrition is

s failure to comply with the Freedom of Information Act FOIA and provide documents in response to six requests about its interactions with The Coca Cola Company The public records requests are part of an investigation USRTK is conducting into Coca Cola s influence at the CDC and the company s impact on public policy Public health evidence suggests that the consumption of sugary sodas is implicated in the obesity epidemic and may be responsible for tens of thousands of deaths per year Nevertheless evidence gathered to date indicates that CDC staff provided political guidance to Coca Cola allowed Coca Cola to lobby the CDC and accepted contributions from Coca Cola via the CDC Foundation which has disclosed such contributions as recently as last year We are suing the CDC to uncover the extent and nature of the CDC s relationship with Coca Cola said Gary Ruskin co director of U S Right to Know a consumer and public health watchdog group Just as it is wrong for the CDC to assist tobacco companies it is also wrong for CDC to assist obesogenic companies like Coca Cola Since 2016 USRTK has filed 19 FOIA requests with the CDC With the documents we received via FOIA from CDC and other sources we helped expose former CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald s collegial relationship with Coca Cola and the company s former VP and Chief Science and Health Officer Rhona Applebaum in the New York

GMOs and pesticides defend toxic chemicals and junk food and attack people who raise concerns about those products as anti science Yet Jon Entine Trevor Butterworth and Henry Miller are funded by the same groups that finance climate science denial By Stacy Malkan British writer George Monbiot has a warning for those of us trying to grasp the new political realities in the U S and the U K We have no hope of understanding what is coming until we understand how the dark money network operates he wrote in the Guardian Corporate America may have been slow to warm up to Donald Trump but once Trump secured the nomination the big money began to recognize an unprecedented opportunity Monbiot wrote His incoherence was not a liability but an opening his agenda could be shaped And the dark money network already developedby some American corporations was perfectly positioned to shape it This network or dark money ATM as Mother Jones described it refers to the vast amount of hard to trace money flowing from arch conservative billionaires such as Charles and David Koch and allies and corporations into front groups that promote extreme free market ideas for example fights against public schools unions environmental protection climate change policies and science that threatens corporate profits We have no hope of understanding what is coming until we understand how the dark money network operates Investigative writers Jane Mayer Naomi Oreskes Erik Conway and others have exposed how the story of dark money and the story of climate change denial are the same story two sides of the same coin as U S Senator Sheldon Whitehouse described it last year in a speech The strategies of the Koch led influence buying operation including propaganda operations that spin science with no regard for the truth are probably the major reason we don t have a comprehensive climate bill in Congress Whitehouse said While these strategies have been well tracked in the climate sphere less reported is the fact that the funders behind climate science denial also bankroll a network of PR operatives who have built careers spinning science to deny the health risks of toxic chemicals in the food we eat and products we use every day The stakes are high for our nation s health Rates of childhood cancer are now 50 higher than when the war on cancer began decades ago and the best weapon is one we are hardly using policies to limit exposure to cancer causing chemicals If we want to win the war on cancer we need to start with the thousand physical and chemical agents evaluated as possible

agents of harm has had less to do with science and more to do with the power of highly profitable industries that rely on public relations to counteract scientific reports of risks Davis noted Defending toxic chemicals and junk food When products important to the chemical and junk food industries run into trouble with science a predictable cast of characters and groups appear on the scene using well worn media strategies to bail out corporations in need of a PR boost Their names and the tactics they use lengthy adversarial articles often framed by personal attacks will be familiar to many scientists journalists and consumer advocates who have raised concerns about toxic products over the past 15 years Public records requests by U S Right to Know that have unearthed thousands of documents along with recent reports by Greenpeace The Intercept and others are shining new light on this propaganda network Key players include Jon Entine Trevor Butterworth Henry I Miller and groups connected with them STATS Center for Media and Public Affairs Genetic Literacy Project Sense About Science and the Hoover Institute Despite well documented histories as PR operatives Entine Butterworth and Miller are presented as serious science sources on many media platforms appearing in the Wall Street Journal New York Times Los Angeles Times Newsweek Philadelphia Enquirer Harvard Business Review and most often Forbes without disclosure of their funding sources or agenda to deregulate the polluting industries that promote them Their articles rank high in Google searches for many of the chemical and junk food industry s top messaging priorities pushing the narratives that GMOs pesticides plastic chemicals sugar and sugar substitutes are safe and anyone who says otherwise is anti science In some cases they are even gaining in influence as they align with establishment institutions such as the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation Cornell University and the University of California Davis Yet their funding sources trace back to the same ultra free market ideologues from oil pharmaceutical and chemical fortunes who are financing climate science denial Searle Freedom

protections for our food system would do well to keep an eye on these modern propagandists and their messaging Jon Entine Genetic Literacy Project STATS Jon Entine a former journalist presents himself as an objective authority on science Yet ample evidence suggests he is a longtime public relations operative with deep ties to chemical companies plagued with questions about health risks Over the years Entine has attacked scientists professors funders lawmakers and journalists who have raised concerns about fracking nuclear power pesticides and chemicals used in baby bottles and children s toys A 2012 Mother Jones story by Tom Philpott describes Entine as an agribusiness apologist and Greenpeace details his history on their Polluter Watch website Entine is now director of the Genetic Literacy Project a group that promotes genetically engineered foods and pesticides The site claims to be neutral but it s clearly designed to promote a pro industry position and doesn t try to look neutrally at the issues said Michael Hansen PhD senior scientist at Consumers Union The message is that genetic engineering is good and anybody who criticizes it is a horrible ideologue but that s just not indicative of where the scientific debate actually is Entine claims for example that the scientific consensus on GMO safety is stronger than for global warming a claim contradicted by the World Health Organization which states it is not possible to make general statements about GMO safety and by hundreds of scientists who have said there is no scientific consensus on GMO safety The Genetic Literacy Project also has not been transparent about its connections to Monsanto As one example the site published several pro GMO academic papers that emails later revealed were assigned to professors by a Monsanto executive who provided talking points for the papers and promised to pump them out all over the internet Another example Genetic Literacy Project partners with Academics Review on the Biotechnology Literacy Project pro industry conferences that train scientists and journalists on how to best engage the GMO debate with a skeptical public The key will be keeping Monsanto in the background so as not to harm the credibility of the information Academics Review which published a report in 2014 attacking the organic industry presents itself as an independent group

Previous funding sources also include climate science denial supporters and undisclosed pass through funding The Genetic Literacy Project and Entine previously operated under the umbrella of Statistical Assessment Services STATS a group located at George Mason University where Entine was a fellow at the Center for Health and Risk Communication from 2011 2014 STATS was funded largely by the Scaife Foundation and Searle Freedom Trust between 2005 and 2014 according to a Greenpeace investigation of STATS funding Kimberly Dennis the president and CEO of Searle Freedom Trust is also chairman of the board of Donors Trust the notorious Koch connected dark money fund whose donors cannot be traced Under Dennis leadership Searle and Donors Trust sent a collective 290 000 to STATS in 2010 Greenpeace reported In 2012 and 2013 STATS received loans from its sister organization the Center for Media and Public Affairs which received donations during those years from the George Mason University Foundation which does not disclose funding sources Entine has at times tried to distance himself and GLP from these groups however tax records show Entine was paid 173 100 by the Center for Media and Public Affairs for the year ending June 30 2015 By 2014 emails show Entine was trying to find a new home for Genetic Literacy Project and wanted to establish a more formal relationship with

and junk food industries such as phthalates BPA vinyl plastic corn syrup sugary sodas and artificial sweeteners He is a formercontributor at Newsweek and has written book reviews for the Wall Street Journal From 2003 to 2014 Butterworth was an editor at STATS funded largely by Scaife Foundation and Searle Freedom Trust In 2014 he became the founding director of Sense About Science USA and folded STATS into that group A recent exposé by Liza Gross in The Intercept described Sense About Science its director Tracey Brown Butterworth STATS and the founders of those groups as self appointed guardians of sound science who tip the scales toward industry Sense About Science purports to help the misinformed public sift through alarming claims about health and the environment but has a disturbing history of promoting experts who turn out to have ties to regulated industries Gross wrote When journalists rightly ask who sponsors research into the risks of say asbestos or synthetic chemicals they d be well advised to question the evidence Sense About Sciencepresents in these debates as well Sense About Science USA posted this response to the piece and Butterworth said via email he was disappointed with the Intercept s misleading article which lumped people and organizations with no connection to Sense About Science USA together He said his group takes no corporate funding and is legally independent from the UK Sense About Science He also said I have never been involved in industry messaging campaigns in any capacity paid or not Some journalists have concluded otherwise Reporters at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel The Atlantic and Consumer Reports portrayed Butterworth as a key player in the chemical industry s aggressive PR efforts to defend the chemical BPA In 2009 journalists Susanne Rust and Meg Kissinger of the Journal Sentinel described Butterworth as BPA s most impassioned defender and an example of chemical industry public relations writers who do not disclose their affiliations The most impassioned defense of BPA on the blogs comes from Trevor Butterworth STATS they wrote claims to be an independent media watchdog but is funded by public policy organizations that promote deregulation Its sister organization the Center for Media and Public Affairs has a history of working for corporations trying to deflect concerns about the safety of their products Butterworth said his reporting on BPA reflected the evidence at the time from authoritative sources and STATS posted responses", "chunk_id":

Trevor Butterworth STATS they wrote claims to be an independent media watchdog but is funded by public policy organizations that promote deregulation Its sister organization the Center for Media and Public Affairs has a history of working for corporations trying to deflect concerns about the safety of their products Butterworth said his reporting on BPA reflected the evidence at the time from authoritative sources and STATS posted responses here and here to the critical reporting A more recent example of how Butterworth s writings played a key role in corporate lobby efforts to discredit troublesome science can be seen in his work on the controversial artificial sweetener sucralose In 2012 Butterworth wrote a Forbes article criticizing a study that raised concerns about the cancer risk of sucralose He described the researchers Dr Morando Soffritti and the Ramazzini Institute as something of a joke In 2016 a food industry front group featured Butterworth s 2012 article and something of a joke critique in a press release attacking a new Soffritti panic study that raised concerns about sucralose Reporters at The Independent The Daily Mail The Telegraph and Deseret News picked up Butterworth s quotes discrediting the researchers and identified him only asareporter from Forbes Similarly in 2011 Butterworth was a featured expert at the International Sweeteners Association Conference and claimed in their press release there is no evidence of a risk to health from sucralose He was identified as a journalist who regularly contributes to the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal Emails obtained by USRTK show that Coca Cola VP Rhona Applebaum described Butterworth to the leaders of the Global Energy Balance Network a Coca Cola front group working to spin the science on obesity as our friend and a journalist who was ready and able to work with them Butterworth said he never worked with that group Butterworth is now affiliated with Cornell University as a visiting fellow at the Cornell Alliance for Science a group launched in 2014 with a 5 6 million Gates Foundation grant to promote GMOs The Gates funded group now partners with Sense

misinformation The Alliance for Science is a public relations campaign that trains spokespeople and creates networks of influence particularly in African countries to persuade the public and policymakers to accept GMOs and pesticides The Bill Melinda Gates Foundation launched the effort in 2014 with a 5 6 million grant and has since donated 22 million to the effort Originally called the Cornell Alliance for Science the group dropped Cornell from its name in November 2022 and moved off the Cornell edu website The Alliance for Science is now based at the Boyce Thompson Institute an independent nonprofit research institute on the Cornell campus This fact sheet documents evidence that the Alliance used Cornell s name reputation and authority to promote false and misleading messaging about GMOs and pesticides and to advance the PR and political agendas of the world s largest chemical and seed corporations Scientists say Alliance for Science shares misinformation The Cornell Alliance for Science launched in 2014 with a Gates Foundation grant and a promise to depolarize the debate around GMOs Its key focus is training spokespeople and creating networks of influence particularly in African countries to persuade policymakers and the public to accept GMOs and pesticides In 2020 the Alliance for Science expanded its mission with a fresh 10 million Gates Foundation grant to counter conspiracy theories and disinformation campaigns that hinder progress in climate change synthetic biology agricultural innovations However the Alliance for Science is itself a purveyor of misinformation according to scientists food policy experts and others who have critiqued the the group and its fellow Mark Lynas at length In a 2023 peer reviewed critique molecular geneticist Michael Antoniou et al analyzed a Lynas co authored paper that attempts to equate critics of agricultural GMOs and people who make false claims about climate change COVID 19 and vaccines Antoniou and co authors found Lynas et al s publication suffers from critical flaws such as an absence of scientific evidence to support the arguments presented omission of relevant evidence on health and the environment a reliance on spurious analogies and a failure to distinguish misinformation In sum it is evident that Lynas et al resort to inaccurate and potentially libellous accusations spurious analogies selective and uncritical reporting and misrepresentations of the state of the science on GM foods and crops and their associated pesticides in an apparent attempt to promote and defend these products African groups have also documented false statements and misleading tactics the Alliance for Science has used in its efforts to promote GMOs in Africa Widespread criticism The

extensive and has been refuted point by point by some of the world s leading agroecologists and biologists wrote Eric Holt Giménez in April 2013 Lynas joined Cornell as a visiting fellow later that year disingenuous and untruthful Africa based groups have critiqued Lynas at length The Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa a coalition of more than 40 food and farming groups across Africa has described Lynas as a fly in pundit whose contempt for African people custom and tradition is unmistakable Million Belay director of AFSA said Lynas is a racist who is pushing a narrative that only

2019 article by Alliance fellow Nassib Mugwanya provides another example of misleading content on agroecology The article claims traditional agricultural practices can t transform African agriculture According to an analysis by the Community Alliance for Global Justice the article reflects the typical misleading messaging pattern in Alliance materials presenting GMO crops as the pro science position while painting alternative forms of agricultural development as anti science groundless and harmful Particularly notable the critique said are strong usages of metaphors e g agroecology likened to handcuffs generalizations omissions of information and a number of factual inaccuracies Using Monsanto playbook to defend pesticides Another example of misleading industry aligned Alliance messaging can be found in the group s defense of glyphosate based Roundup The herbicides are a key component of GMO crops with 90 of corn and soy grown in the United States genetically engineered to tolerate Roundup In 2015 after the World Health Organization s cancer research panel said glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen Monsanto organized allies to orchestrate outcry against the independent science panel to protect the reputation of Roundup according to internal Monsanto documents Mark Lynas used the Cornell platform to amplify the Monsanto messaging describing the cancer report as a witch hunt orchestrated by anti Monsanto activists who abused science and committed an obvious perversion of both science and natural justice by reporting a cancer risk for glyphosate Lynas used the same flawed arguments and industry sources as the American Council on Science and Health a front group Monsanto paid to help spin the cancer report While claiming to be on the side of science Lynas ignored ample evidence from Monsanto documents widely reported in the press that Monsanto interfered with scientific research manipulated regulatory agencies and used other heavy handed tactics to manipulate the scientific process in order to protect Roundup In 2018 a jury found the that Monsanto acted with malice oppression or fraud in covering up the cancer risk of Roundup

also an area that reports high exposures to pesticides and concerns about pesticide related health problems including birth defects cancer and asthma These problems led residents to organize a years long fight to pass stronger regulations to reduce pesticide exposures and improve disclosure of the chemicals used on agricultural fields As these efforts gained traction the Alliance engaged in a massive public relations disinformation campaign designed to silence community concerns about the health risks of pesticides according to Fern Anuenue Holland a community organizer for Hawaii Alliance

declined to provide it prompting a legal challenge from D Arcy Hande a retired archivist at U of S on behalf of the Academic Integrity group The legal challenge which U S Right to Know helped to fund was unsuccessful with the court ruling that there was a ground rule for the symposium which established an environment of confidentiality Hande said in an interview that the symposium appeared to be a frank discussion about how to control the narrative rather than respond to concerns about pesticide industry collaborations with the university Because U of S is publicly funded he believes the public has a right to know what was discussed It s like an old boys club The court ruling is concerning Hande said because of its emphasis on the use of the Chatham House Rule an informal agreement used to

Monsanto s Cami Ryan made suggestions for the invite list Emails relating to Monsanto Genetic Literacy Project papers Monsanto assigned papers August 2013 Monsanto s Eric Sachs wrote to a group of professors including Phillips I have started an important project to produce a series of short policy briefs on important topics in the agricultural biotechnology arena the topics were selected because of their influence on public policy GM crop regulation and consumer acceptance He asked Phillips to write about how over burdensome regulation of GMOs stifles the innovation important for helping support global food security Monsanto s urgent request to move forward September 9 2014 Sachs emailed Phillips to urge him to review proposed edits to his paper The project is on a stronger path now Sachs wrote He explained the strategy to connect the author s perspectives from this series of briefs to the controversy about GM crops and food that we believe will be triggered in the coming weeks by the new NRC Panel report on GM crops Next week is the first of two public hearings at the US NAS National Academy of Sciences in Washington and a virtual who s who of the GM crop

under public pressure to start testing samples of U S food for the presence of a pesticide that has been linked to cancer has some early findings that are not so sweet In examining honey samples from various locations in the United States the FDA has found fresh evidence that residues of the weed killer called glyphosate can be pervasive found even in a food that is not produced with the use of glyphosate All of the samples the FDA tested in a recent examination contained glyphosate residues and some of the honey showed residue levels double the limit allowed in the European Union according to documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request There is no legal tolerance level for glyphosate in honey in the United States Glyphosate which is the key ingredient in Monsanto Co s Roundup herbicide is the most widely used weed killer in the world and concerns about glyphosate residues in food spiked after the World Health Organization in 2015 said its cancer experts determined glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen Other international scientists have raised concerns about how heavy use of glyphosate is impacting human health and the environment Records obtained from the FDA as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and the U S Department of Agriculture detail a range of revelations about the federal government s efforts to get a handle on these rising concerns In addition to honey the records show government residue experts discussing glyphosate found in soybean and wheat samples glyphosate controversies and the belief that there could be a lot of violation for glyphosate residues in U S crops Even though the FDA annually examines foods for residues of many pesticides it has skipped testing for glyphosate residues for decades It was only in February of this year that the agency said it would start some glyphosate residues analysis That came after many independent researchers started conducting their own testing and found glyphosate in an array of food products including flour cereal and oatmeal The government and Monsanto have maintained that any glyphosate residues in food would be minimal enough to be safe But critics say without robust testing glyphosate levels in food are not known And they say that even trace amounts may be harmful because they are likely consumed so regularly in many foods The residue issues are coming into the spotlight at the same time that the EPA is completing a risk assessment to determine if use of this top selling herbicide should be limited The agency has scheduled public meetings on the matter Oct 18 21 in Washington The EPA s risk assessment report was initially due out in 2015 but still has not been finalized The agency now says it will be completed in", "chunk_id":

one internal email describes trouble locating honey that doesn t contain glyphosate It is difficult to find blank honey that does not contain residue I collect about 10 samples of honey in the market and they all contain glyphosate states an FDA researcher Even organic mountain honey contained low concentrations of glyphosate the FDA documents show According to the FDA records samples tested by FDA chemist Narong Chamkasem showed residue levels at 107 ppb in samples the FDA associated with Louisiana based Carmichael s Honey 22 ppb in honey the FDA linked to Leighton s Orange Blossom Honey in Florida and residues at 41 ppb in samples the FDA associated with Iowa based Sue Bee Honey which is marketed by a cooperative of American beekeepers as pure all natural and America s Honey Customers can be assured that Sue Bee Honey is 100 pure 100 all natural and 100 American the Sioux Honey Association states In a Jan 8 2016 email Chamkasem pointed out to fellow FDA scientists that the EU tolerance level is 50 ppb and there is no amount of glyphosate allowed at all in honey in the United States But Chris Sack an FDA chemist who oversees the agency s pesticide residue testing responded by reassuring Chamkasem and the others that the glyphosate residues discovered are only technically a violation The bee farmers are not breaking any laws rather glyphosate is being introduced by the bees Sack wrote in response While the presence of glyphosate in honey is technically a violation it is not a safety issue Sack said the EPA had been made aware of the problem and was expected to set tolerance levels for honey Once tolerance levels are set by EPA if they are set high enough the residues would no longer be a violation When contacted this week the EPA said there are currently no pending requests to set tolerance levels for glyphosate in honey But the agency also said there is no dietary risk concern from exposure to glyphosate residues in honey at this time Sioux Honey Vice

from bees located near clover and alfalfa in the upper Midwest he said Beekeepers located in the South would have honeybees close to cotton and soybean fields Alfalfa soybeans and cotton are all genetically engineered to be sprayed directly with glyphosate The FDA results are not the first to find glyphosate in honey Sampling done in early 2015 by the scientific research company Abraxis found glyphosate residues in 41 of 69 honey samples with glyphosate levels between 17 and 163 ppb with the mean average being 64 ppb Bee keepers say they are innocent victims who see their honey products contaminated simply because they might be located within a few miles of farms where glyphosate is used I don t understand how I m supposed to control the level of glyphosate in my honey when I m not the one using Roundup one honey company operator said It s all around me It s unfair The FDA did not respond to a question about the extent of its communications with Monsanto regarding residue testing but the records released show that Monsanto has had at least some interaction with the FDA on this issue In April of this year Monsanto s international regulatory affairs manager Amelia Jackson Gheissari emailed FDA asking to set up a time to talk about enforcement of residue levels in the USA particularly glyphosate The FDA routinely looks for residues of a number of commonly used pesticides but not glyphosate The look for glyphosate this year is considered a special assignment and came after the agency was criticized by the U S Government Accountability Office in 2014 for failing to test for glyphosate The FDA has not released formal results of its testing plans or the findings but Sack made a presentation in June to the California Specialty Crops Council that said the agency was analyzing 300 samples of corn 300 samples of soy and 120 samples each of milk and eggs He described some partial results achieved through April that showed glyphosate levels found in 52 samples of corn and 44 samples of soybeans but not above legally allowed levels The presentation did not mention honey The presentation also stated that glyphosate testing at the FDA will be expanded

nonprofit group Beyond Pesticides in a meeting in Washington in January Documents obtained through FOIA show a plan to test in syrups and oils in 2017 Soybeans and Wheat Like the FDA the USDA has dragged its feet on testing Only one time in 2011 has the USDA tested for glyphosate residues despite the fact that the agency does widespread testing for residues of other less used pesticides In what the USDA called a special project the agency tested 300 soybean samples for glyphosate and found more than 90 percent 271 of the samples carried the weed killer residues The agency said then that further testing for glyphosate was not a high priority because glyphosate is considered so safe It also said that while residues levels in some samples came close to the very high levels of glyphosate tolerance established by EPA they did not exceed those levels Both the USDA and the FDA have long said it is too expensive and is unnecessary to test for glyphosate residues Yet the division within the USDA known as the Grain Inspection Packers Stockyards Administration GIPSA has been testing wheat for glyphosate residues for years because many foreign buyers have strong concerns about glyphosate residues GIPSA s testing is part of an export cargo sampling program documents obtained from GIPSA show Those tests showed glyphosate residues detected in more than 40 percent of hundreds of wheat samples examined in fiscal 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 The levels vary the data shows GIPSA has also been helping FDA access soybeans to test In a May 2015 email GIPSA chemist Gary Hinshaw told an FDA food safety official that it isn t difficult to find soybeans containing glyphosate In a December 7 2015 email from FDA chemist Terry Councell to Lauren Robin also a chemist and an FDA consumer safety officer Councell said that glyphosate was present even in processed commodities though way below tolerance The fact that the government is aware of glyphosate residues in food but has dragged its feet on testing for so long frustrates many who are concerned about the pesticide", "chunk_id":

Research from Tufts GDAE finds the billion dollar Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa is not living up to its promises A longer version of this article ran in The Ecologist By Stacy Malkan Massive investments spent promoting and subsidizing commercial seeds and agrichemicals across Africa have failed to fulfill their purpose of alleviating hunger and lifting small scale farmers out of poverty according to a new white paper published by the Tufts University Global Development and Environment Institute A report based largely on the research False Promises was published July 10 by African and German nonprofits that are calling for a shift in support to agroecological farming practices The research led by Timothy A Wise examines the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa AGRA an international nonprofit launched by the Bill Melinda Gates and Rockefeller foundations in 2006 with promises to double yields and incomes for 30 million farming households while cutting food insecurity in half in 20 African countries by 2020 In pursuit of that vision AGRA collected nearly 1 billion in donations and disbursed 524 million primarily in 13 African countries on programs promoting the use of commercial seeds chemical fertilizers and pesticides This Green Revolution technology package is further supported by subsidies Wise reports that African national governments spent 1 billion per year in the target countries subsidizing the purchase of seeds and agrichemicals Despite the public support AGRA has provided no comprehensive evaluation or reporting on its impacts The Tufts researchers relied on national level data for agricultural productivity poverty hunger and malnutrition to assess progress We find little evidence of widespread progress on any of AGRA s goals which is striking given the high levels of government subsidies for technology adoption the researchers report The paper documents slow productivity growth no significant increases in food security or small farmer incomes in the target countries and worsening hunger It s a failing model failing results it s time to change course Timothy A Wise The evidence suggests that AGRA is failing on its own terms the paper concludes In an interview Wise summed up his findings about the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa It s a failing model failing results it s time to change course AGRA said it is very disappointed in the research Over the last 14 years AGRA has achieved its successes but has also learned a lot the group said in a statement AGRA said the Tufts paper failed to meet basic academic and professional standards of peer review and asking the subject to comment on the findings and accused Wise of having a history of writing unfounded allegations and

and ethical and said they prefer to have transparency and engagement with reporters and others directly around the issues He said AGRA will do a full evaluation against its targets and results at the end of 2021 Wise whose 2019 book Eating Tomorrow was critical of aid approaches that push high cost industrial models for agricultural development in Africa said he reached out to AGRA several times beginning in January with questions for his research If AGRA or the Gates Foundation has data that contradicts these findings they should make them available Wise said Among the key findings he reported The number of hungry people in AGRA s 13 focus countries has jumped 30 percent during AGRA s well funded Green Revolution Productivity increased just 29 over 12 years for maize the most subsidized and supported crop far short of the goal of a 100 increase Many climate resilient nutritious crops have been displaced by the expansion in supported crops such as maize Even where maize production has increased incomes and food security have scarcely improved for AGRA s supposed beneficiaries small scale farming households Despite the Gates Foundation s promise to help millions of smallholder farmers many of them women there is no evidence AGRA is reaching a significant number of smallholder farmers While some medium sized farms may see productivity improvements those are overwhelmingly farmers mostly men with access to land resources and markets Wise points to Rwanda as an example of what he described as AGRA s failings Widely considered an AGRA success story Rwanda has seen maize yields grow by 66 However the data indicates weak overall productivity improvements across staple crops as farmers abandoned more nutritious local crops to grow maize Meanwhile the number of undernourished has increased 13 in the AGRA years Rwanda s former Agriculture Minister Agnes Kalibata now heads AGRA and was recently named to lead a planned U N World Food Summit in 2021

the AGRA model Africans don t need unaccountable American and European agro chemical and seed companies to develop them Mayet said We need global trade financial and debt justice to re cast Africa s position in the global economy and that gives us the space to democratically build our future In the context of the COVID crisis especially she said this new report strengthens the argument that

George Floyd and the global uprising for racial justice Belay discussed a false narrative about African food systems thatis seeded by a cohort of actors including philanthrocapitalists Aid Agencies governments academic institutions and embassies who talk about transforming African agriculture but what they are doing is creating a market for themselves cleverly couched in a nice sounding language We are told that our seeds are old and have little capacity to give us food and they have to be hybridized and genetically modified to be of use we are told that what we need is more calories and we need to focus on seeds of few crops we are told that we are not using our land effectively and it should be given to those who can do a better job of it we are told that our knowledge about farming is backward and we need to modernize with knowledge from the West we are told we need business to invest billions of dollars and without these saviors from the North we cannot feed ourselves Our world is defined simply by producing more not in having healthy nutritious and culturally appropriate food produced without harming the environment he wrote It is the same knee that justified colonialism on Africa I think the only way to remove this knee and breathe is to recognize the knee understand its ways of working and organize to defend ourselves Belay wrote His group advocates for agroecology

sixteen different districts and they all involve common factual issues concerning the propensity of paraquat to cause Parkinson s Disease The cases will include complex scientific and regulatory issues the panel said Centralization will eliminate duplicative discovery avoid inconsistent pretrial rulings and conserve the resources of the parties their counsel and the judiciary the panel stated in its order The panel determined the cases will be transferred to the federal court in the Southern District of Illinois and assigned to U S Judge Nancy Rosenstengel for handling Lawyer Majed Nachawati whose firm is among those representing hundreds of plaintiffs suing Syngenta and Chevron applauded the decision and said the litigation is monumentally important It was Nachawati s firm that requested the MDL Syngenta a Swiss company owned by a larger Chinese chemical company developed and markets the paraquat based Gramoxone brand while Chevron has been a distributor of Syngenta s paraquat products in the United States The formation of the paraquat multidistrict litigation MDL underscores the legal threat Syngenta faces in the litigation An MDL was also formed for the lawsuits filed against Monsanto over allegations that its Roundup weed killers cause non Hodgkin lymphoma ultimately tens of thousands of people sued the company for such claims and Monsanto s owner Bayer AG is now facing settlement payouts of more than 10 billion Syngenta said in a statement that it agrees with the decision to coordinate the various federal lawsuits before one judge This will help the parties and the courts proceed in a timely and efficient way the company said Chevron did not respond to a request for comment Used since the 60s Paraquat has been used in the United States since 1964 as a tool to kill broadleaf weeds and grasses Farmers often use paraquat before planting crops or before those crops emerge It has long been known to be extremely dangerous to anyone who ingests even

risk of developing Parkinson s disease And in 2011 AHS researchers reported that participants who used paraquat or another pesticide were twice as likely to develop Parkinson s disease as people who were not exposed to those chemicals Syngenta maintains that newer and better research including by AHS scientists has discounted a tie between paraquat and Parkinson s In addition to the cases brought on behalf of people suffering from Parkinson s additionally a class action lawsuit was filed in federal court in Iowa on May 3 by a law firm representing people who fear they may get the disease in the future The suit seeks equitable relief in the form of medical monitoring including but not limited to the costs of diagnostic testing for farmers and others exposed to paraquat who are allegedly

September 2015 front page New York Times article revealed that Monsanto enlisted academics and paid them secretly to oppose GMO labeling laws WBEZ later reported on one example how a University of Illinois professor received tens of thousands of dollars from Monsanto to promote and lobby for GMOs and pesticides and his university received millions none of those funds were disclosed to the public Documents reported in the Boston Globe Bloomberg and Mother Jones describe how Monsanto assigned scripted and promoted pro GMO papers from professors at Harvard Cornell and other universities papers published with no mention of Monsanto s role At the University of Saskatchewan Monsanto coached a professor and edited his academic articles according to documents reported by the CBC At the

Food and Drug Administration FDA forecast sharp increases in the levels of 2 4 D in American food after regulators approved new genetically modified GMO crops that tolerate being sprayed directly with

groups alleged the regulatory agency violated its duties under the Pesticide Act and violated its duties to protect endangered species The group said the agency s approval of Dow s Enlist Duo product which combines glyphosate and 2 4 D was part of a disturbing industry wide trend in which crops are genetically engineered to withstand being sprayed with multiple pesticides While these GE crop systems initially provide a quick fix way to kill weeds the intensive spraying triggers rapid evolution of weed resistance to the chemicals Just as overuse of antibiotics breeds resistant bugs and more antibiotics to kill them so these GE crop systems drive a toxic spiral of increasing weed resistance and pesticide use In July 2020 the U S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the claims and ruled that Dow s Enlist Duo could stay on the market The court agreed with the petitioners that the EPA did not properly assess harm to the monarch butterflies associated with increased use

that concludes it is not likely to cause cancer and has taken no meaningful actions to limit its use But as the litigation expands and foreign leaders take action restricting glyphosate products that could change Glyphosate is considered the world s most widely used weed killer Globally approximately 1 8 billion pounds of the herbicide is used per year 15 fold increase from the mid 1990s In the United States use has grown from roughly 40 million pounds to close to 300 million pounds in that same stretch according to data compiled by agricultural economist Charles Benbrook Though best known as the active ingredient in Roundup and other Monsanto products the off patent chemical is key in many other brands sold by rival chemical companies Monsanto engineered the rise in use of glyphosate when it introduced genetically altered glyphosate tolerant crops in the mid 1990s designed to withstand direct doses of the chemical The Roundup Ready cropping system made farming easier and more efficient but as the use of glyphosate expanded research surrounding the chemical s impacts also grew Researchers have documented a decline in soil health because of overuse of glyphosate and the chemical has been tied to the declining health of important pollinators including bees and butterflies Weed resistance to glyphosate has prompted farmers to combine glyphosate with dicamba and 2 4 D

lawsuits directly challenge Monsanto s position that its herbicides are proven safe and assert that the company has spent decades hiding the cancer causing dangers of its popular Roundup herbicide products The evidence of deception includes ghostwriting of scientific literature that proclaimed glyphosate herbicides safe and collaborations with certain officials with the EPA to suppress scrutiny of glyphosate herbicide toxicity Monsanto insists it has done nothing wrong and Bayer officials are standing behind the subsidiary Monsanto officials said jurors acted on emotion rather than on sound scientific evidence and they accused Wisner of engaging in misconduct a punch below the belt by imploring jurors to become part of history with a large damage award for Johnson They also complained about comparisons between Monsanto s actions regarding glyphosate and the actions of tobacco industry players in protecting cigarettes even though lead Monsanto attorney George Lombardi is known in part for also defending tobacco companies in litigation But in issuing punitive damages the jury found that there was clear and convincing evidence that Monsanto s officials acted with malice or oppression in failing to adequately warn of the risks As defined by the court those words translate to a determination that Monsanto s actions were vile base or contemptible enough to be looked down on and despised by reasonable people In the days following the verdict hundreds of potential new clients were inundating law firms with requests to be added to the litigation Lawyers estimate there could be 10 000 or more plaintiffs in all who will ultimately file claims The next Roundup trial is slated to begin October 22 in St Louis Missouri and involves an Arkansas man diagnosed with non

Correct Errors in New Scientific Paper Finding Problems with Glyphosate UPDATED June 5 with comment from Scientific Reports The authors of a newly published paper examining the impacts of exposure to the world s most widely used herbicide declared some shocking news The team from Washington State University found that descendants of rats exposed to the chemical glyphosate developed prostate kidney and ovarian diseases obesity and birth abnormalities The findings published in April in the scientific journal Scientific Reports added to the global debate about the safety of glyphosate and Monsanto s Roundup and other glyphosate based weed killers But perhaps more stunning than that news the research team also stated in their paper that the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC a specialist scientific arm of the World Health Organization had retracted its finding that glyphosate was a probable human carcinogen The error is one of many in the paper reported to the authors over a month ago that has yet to be corrected But none perhaps is more glaring than the one about IARC IARC had issued a lengthy paper in 2015 that concluded by classifying glyphosate as a 2A human carcinogen That IARC classification sparked thousands of lawsuits against Monsanto the longtime purveyor of Roundup and other glyphosate herbicides and fueled debate around the globe The IARC classification also helped prompt many European countries to start moving to limit or ban glyphosate use Cities school districts and retailers across the United States have also stopped using or selling glyphosate products Monsanto s German owner Bayer AG has lost 40 percent of its shareholder value due to the persistent concerns about Monsanto s glyphosate herbicides But according to the WSU team the IARC classification that triggered it all was retracted in 2016 They wrote In March 2015 the International Agency of Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a Grade 2a carcinogen based on prevalence of liver and kidney tumors in chronic feeding studies Shortly after this statement was retracted in 2016 A retraction by IARC of its finding would be highly significant Indeed Monsanto in 2015 did seek a retraction but IARC has defended its work as have numerous independent scientists from multiple countries And notably IARC has never retracted its finding of glyphosate as a 2A probable carcinogen The classification has not been changed and is still valid said IARC spokeswoman Veronique Terrasse The Washington State research team was led by Michael Skinner professor of the WSU School of Biological Sciences Seemingly the error would be easy to correct But when contacted about the error Skinner said he had no intention of correcting the statement because no correction was

time at the Common Ground Country Fair in Unity Maine Only about 2 000 people live in the tiny town but an estimated 57 000 people jammed the single lane roads to swarm this year s three day event in late September The fair was part celebration and part education a festival of first hand knowledge about how to produce food in ways that focus on enhancing not endangering human and environmental health Young and old gathered in yellow and white striped tents to discuss such topics as the marketing of organic lowbush wild blueberries how to develop micro dairies and science that shows healthy chemical free soils can better sequester carbon from the atmosphere as a mitigant to the climate crisis In a jangly parade running through the middle of the fairgrounds children and adults dressed as honeybees fresh vegetables sunflowers and trees and carried colorful signs calling for protections from the threats posed by industrial agriculture One small child carried a sign that read No sprays on me The messages carried through that parade and across the fairgrounds speak to the fact that alongside this jovial festival of food and farming are mounting concerns about a lack of leadership in Washington and federal promotion of the permissive use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in farming as well as the monoculture cropping practices that have become a mainstay of U S agriculture and are stripping away essential biodiversity This week a group of state leaders cut the ribbon on a project to help address those concerns by promoting sustainable solutions in Maine that they intend

ghostwriting by Monsanto means how it has influenced and still is influencing material found in peer reviewed scientific journals Thisarticlewasoriginallypublishedin EnvironmentalHealthNews By Carey Gillam and Nathan Donley Consumers and journalists around the world were stunned earlier this month when Monsanto after being forced in a court of law for the first time to defend the safety of its popular weed killer Roundup was found liable for the terminal cancer of California groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson The unanimous 12 member jury found that Mr Johnson s exposure to Monsanto s weedkiller was a substantial contributing factor to his disease and that there was clear and convincing evidence that Monsanto acted with malice or oppression because the risks were evident and Monsanto failed to warn of those known risks Aside from dueling expert testimony on both sides the jury was provided with internal company emails and work plans indicating that Monsanto had been corrupting the scientific record by ghostwriting literature asserting safety As the jury s decision sets in and thousands of additional plaintiffs who have filed similar suits wait for their day in court it is worth taking time to understand exactly what ghostwriting by Monsanto means how it has influenced and still is influencing material found in peer reviewed scientific journals We offer this example When the scientific journal Critical Reviews in Toxicology CRT published a series of papers reviewing the carcinogenic potential of weed killing agent glyphosate the main ingredient in Monsanto s Roundup in September 2016 the findings were so significant that they were widely reported by media outlets around the world The papers published in a special issue of CRT entitled An Independent Review of the Carcinogenic Potential of Glyphosate directly contradicted the findings of the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC which in 2015 found glyphosate to be a probable human carcinogen The authors of the 2016 review found that the weight of evidence showed the weed killer was unlikely to pose any carcinogenic risk to people The findings were critical to Monsanto the company was facing doubts by European regulators about allowing glyphosate to remain on the market As well Monsanto was facing a growing mass of lawsuits claiming its weed killer caused people to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma Sixteen scientists from four independent panels signed their names to the published work declaring to readers that their conclusions were free of Monsanto s intervention Underscoring the supposed independence of the work the declaration of interest section stated Neither any Monsanto company employees nor any attorneys reviewed any of the Expert Panel s

through litigation show that the papers were conceptualized from the outset as a deceptive strategy for Monsanto One of Monsanto s top scientists not only reviewed the manuscripts but had a hand in drafting and editing them The finished papers were aimed directly at discrediting IARC s classification In one internal email Monsanto s chief of regulatory science William Heydens told the organizer of the panel I have gone through the entire document and indicated what I think should stay what can go and in a couple spots I did a little editing The internal documents show that Heydens even argued over statements that he wanted included but that author John Acquavella deemed inflammatory and not necessary criticisms of IARC Draft documents show Heydens edits contradicted Acquavella s edits even though Heydens was not supposed to have even reviewed the papers Heydens went so far as to state I would ignore John s comment and I don t see a reason for deleting the text that John did below Other edits show Heydens attempting to control the tone of the manuscript stating The deleted statement below has nothing to do with IARC criticism and should be put back in John over stepped the bounds here and I can live with deleting the text below assuming that exposure text above is added back in He also argued for putting a deleted phrase back in because it gave clarity about IARC s approach This is not inflammatory it is descriptive he wrote The importance of the papers to Monsanto as a tool to counter IARC s classification of glyphosate as a probable carcinogen was laid out in a confidential document dated May 11 2015 naming several of the scientists who could be used as authors to give the papers credibility The internal documents speak of ghost writing strategies aimed at using non company scientists as authors to lend credibility to the findings When placed under oath in a deposition Heydens acknowledged that the manuscripts were sent to him and he read parts of some

and herbicides in growing our food We learn for instance in reading the latest report that traces of pesticides were found in 84 percent of domestic samples of fruits and 53 percent of vegetables as well as 42 percent of grains and 73 percent of food samples simply listed as other The samples were drawn from around the country including from California Texas Kansas New York and Wisconsin Roughly 94 percent of grapes grape juice and raisins tested positive for pesticide residues as did 99 percent of strawberries 88 percent of apples and apple juice and 33 percent of rice products according to the FDA data Imported fruits and vegetables actually showed a lower prevalence of pesticides with 52 percent of fruits and 46 percent of vegetables from abroad testing positive for pesticides Those samples came from more than 40 countries including Mexico China India and Canada We also learn that for the most recently reported sampling among the hundreds of different pesticides the FDA found traces of the long banned insecticide DDT in food samples as well as chlorpyrifos 2 4 D and glyphosate DDT is linked to breast cancer infertility and miscarriage while chlorpyrifos another insecticide has been scientifically shown to cause neurodevelopmental problems in young children Chlorpyrifos is so dangerous that the European Food Safety Authority has recommended a ban of the chemical in Europe finding that there is no safe exposure level The herbicides 2 4 D and g lyphosate are both linked to cancers and other health problems as well Thailand recently said it was banning glyphosate and chlorpyrifos due to the scientifically established risks of these pesticides Despite the prevalence of pesticides found in U S foods the FDA along with the Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the U S Department of Agriculture USDA assert that pesticide residues in food are really nothing to worry about Amid heavy lobbying by the agrichemical industry the EPA has actually supported

most recent FDA analysis only 3 8 percent of domestic foods had residue levels that were considered illegally high or violative For imported foods 10 4 percent of the foods sampled were violative according to the FDA What the FDA did not say and what regulatory agencies routinely avoid saying publicly is that the tolerance levels for certain pesticides have risen over the years as the companies that sell the pesticides request higher and higher legal limits The EPA has approved several increases allowed for glyphosate residues in food for instance As well the agency often makes the determination that it need not comply with a legal requirement that states the EPA shall apply an additional tenfold margin of safety for infants and children in setting the legal levels for pesticide residues The EPA has overridden that requirement in the setting of many pesticide tolerances saying no such extra margin of safety is needed to protect children The bottom line The higher the EPA sets the tolerance allowed as the legal limit the lower the possibility that regulators will have to report violative residues in our food As a result the U S routinely allows higher levels of pesticide residues in food than other developed nations For example the legal limit for the weed killer glyphosate on an apple is 0 2 parts per million ppm in the United States but only half that level 0 1 ppm is allowed on an apple in the European Union As well the U S allows residues of glyphosate on corn at 5 ppm while the EU allows only 1 ppm As legal limits rise for pesticide residues in food many

close ties to the companies that sell agricultural pesticides released a report seeking to soothe consumer worries and discount the scientific research The report which was issued Oct 21 stated that there is no direct scientific or medical evidence indicating that typical exposure of consumers to pesticide residues poses any health risk Pesticide residue data and exposure estimates typically demonstrate that food consumers are exposed to levels of pesticide residues that are several orders of magnitude below those of potential health concern Not surprisingly the three authors of the report are closely tied to the agrichemical industry One of the report s authors is Steve Savage an agrichemical industry consultant and former DuPont employee Another is Carol Burns a former scientist for Dow Chemical and current consultant for Cortevia Agriscience a spin off of DowDuPont The third author is Carl Winter Chair of the Department of Food Science and Technology at the University of California at Davis The university has received approximately 2 million a year from the agrichemical industry according to a university researcher though the accuracy of that figure has not been established The authors took their report directly to Congress holding three different presentations in Washington D C designed to promote their message of pesticide safety for use in media

70 million pounds applied across the nation each year according to the U S Geological Survey It is an endocrine disruptor and also linked to various cancers premature birth and birth defects The herbicide has been banned for use in the European Union since 2004 In the U S it is one of the most commonly reported contaminants in groundwater and public drinking water according to the EPA While atrazine is applied to a wide range of crops it is primarily used on sugarcane soy sorghum and corn the USDA notes that more than 65 percent of all corn crops in the U S have been treated with the herbicide It is also a weed killer for golf courses fields and residential and commercial lawn spaces across the United States Atrazine is among the most prevalent herbicides used in Canada and Australia as well The primary manufacturer of atrazine is Syngenta a Swiss based corporation owned by the Chinese state owned company ChemChina Studies of atrazine suggest health dangers Endocrine disruption A significant body of scientific research suggests that atrazine is an endocrine disruptor An endocrine disruptor is a general term for a chemical that impedes normal functioning of the endocrine system which regulates all biological processes in the body from conception through adulthood and into old age including the development of the brain and nervous system the growth and function of the reproductive system as well as the metabolism and blood sugar levels according to the EPA Endocrine disruption in humans In humans atrazine has been linked to irregular estrogen levels and menstrual cycles abnormal birth weight and unexplained infertility In a 2011 study published in the journal Environmental Research scientists compared women s menstrual cycles in areas of Illinois where atrazine was widely used on crops with Vermont where it was used rarely The public drinking water in Illinois had double the amount of atrazine than in Vermont though both places were within the legal limits Researchers found that the women in agricultural areas of Illinois were five times more likely to report having irregular menstrual cycles than those in Vermont The Illinois women were also more likely to report lower estrogen levels The researchers wrote We present preliminary evidence that atrazine exposure at levels below the US EPA Maximum Contaminant Level is associated with

pesticides experienced longer menstrual cycles and increased odds of missed periods compared with women who never used pesticides And specifically when they used probable endocrine disrupting pesticides including atrazine women had a 60 to 100 increased odds of experiencing long cycles missed periods and intermenstrual bleeding compared with women who had never used pesticides In a study published in 2001 in Environmental Health Perspectives researchers collected and analyzed self reported information from about 2 000 couples living on farms regarding the effects of various pesticides on the risk of spontaneous abortion in a farm population in Ontario Canada They found that preconception exposure to atrazine was among the pesticides associated with a 20 to 40 percent relative increase in risk of spontaneous abortion in pregnancies less than 20 weeks gestation Researchers wrote Our findings of an association between preconception exposure and an early abortion may imply that for some pesticides preconception exposures lead to gross chromosomal anomalies On the other hand our finding of an association between late abortions and postconception exposure may suggest that postconception exposure to specific pesticides tends to damage the fetus or fetus placenta complex rather than cause chromosomal anomalies In a 2007 study published in Environmental Health Perspectives researchers compared steroidogenic factor 1 SF 1 expression in atrazine responsive and non responsive cell lines and transfected SF 1 into nonresponsive cell lines to assess SF 1 s role in atrazine induced aromatase They found that atrazine responsive adrenal carcinoma cells H295R expressed 54 times more SF 1 than nonresponsive ovarian granulosa KGN cells Exogenous SF 1 conveyed atrazine responsiveness to otherwise nonresponsive KGN and NIH 3T3 cells Atrazine induced binding of SF 1 to chromatin and mutation of the SF 1 binding site in ArPII eliminated SF 1 binding and

maintaining proper reproductive function For female animals researchers concluded Female mammalian models have addressed the effects of atrazine at numerous life stages Gestational and prenatal studies have demonstrated a significant delay in vaginal opening and a controversial effect on mammary gland epithelium Adult exposure studies report robust alterations in reproductive hormones In combination atrazine is reported to elicit a prolonged estrous cycle and histological alterations of ovarian tissue including an increase in atretic follicles For males the researchers wrote Prenatal and adult studies show decreased levels of testosterone and altered testicular morphology in response to atrazine exposure In addition numerous steroidogenic genes and upstream regulators are altered due to atrazine exposure in both granulosa and Leydig cells In a meta analysis published in 2021 in Environmental Science and Pollution Research researchers analyzed the results of 36 relevant studies related to male rats exposed to atrazine They found that when compared to rats that were not exposed to atrazine those exposed experienced a significant decrease in the weight of the testis seminal vesicles epididymis and other organs The serum testosterone concentration was also reduced in atrazine exposed rats Researchers wrote that atrazine may significantly reduce the number of sperm in the epididymis along with daily sperm production Rats had worse sperm motility and they produced more dead sperm than non exposed rats The researchers concluded Atrazine exposure may have toxic effects on many aspects of the rodents male reproductive system and has a cross species effect and a dose dependent trend Pathways related to oxidative stress and apoptosis may be responsible for the toxicity of the male reproductive system In a study published in 2020 in Frontiers in Endocrinology researchers examined the effects of long term exposure to atrazine beginning in utero in male mice and how it affected their metabolic and reproductive traits Researchers then examined whether mating these males to females unexposed to atrazine changed in vitro embryo characteristics The scientists wrote

Leydig cells Researchers wrote Atrazine induced changes in cAMP levels were sufficient to stimulate prolactin release in pituitary cells and androgen production in Leydig cells indicating that it acts as an endocrine disruptor both in cells that secrete by exocytosis of prestored hormones and in cells that secrete by de novo hormone synthesis In a study published in 2017 in Scientific Reports French researchers examined the effects of atrazine exposure on meiosis They found that embryonic exposure to atrazine increases the level of 8 oxo guanine in the nucleus of meiotic cells reflecting oxidative stress and affecting meiotic double strand break repair chromosome synapsis and crossover numbers Finally embryonic exposure to atrazine reduces the number of primordial follicles and increases the incidence of multi oocyte follicles in adult mice Our data demonstrate that embryonic exposure to atrazine disrupts prophase I of meiosis and affects normal follicle formation in female mice A 2019 study conducted by researchers at the University of Melbourne and published in the journal Reproduction Fertility and Development found that when male mice were exposed to atrazine at levels permitted in public drinking water in Australia they experienced reduced sperm viability and increased weight gain The herbicide also altered the expression of key metabolic genes in the liver and testis Researchers concluded that a chronic reduction in sperm quality and increased weight gain could have negative consequences on the reproductive capacity of males and further studies should

estrous cycle stages vaginal cytology along with plasma hormone estradiol progesterone prolactin and corticosterone levels The scientists found that both types of rats experienced significant decreases in body weights of both Sprague Dawley and Fischer 344 female rats when exposed to atrazine They also had a significant reduction in ovarian and uterine weights and a decrease in circulating

pigs by examining the biochemical and histopathological parameters of the ovarian function They specifically examined serum 17β oestradiol 17β E and progesterone P concentrations When compared with pigs not exposed to atrazine the researchers found that the atrazine treated pigs had a significantly higher serum P concentration and significantly lower serum 17β E concentration before the next expected oestrus which then did not occur The pigs exposed to atrazine also experienced more multiple ovarian follicular cysts and benign cysts A 2020 study conducted by researchers at the University

researchers investigated county level atrazine use with the rate of infant diagnoses of gastroschisis a rare birth defect where an opening in the newborn s abdomen wall causes the intestines to spill outside the body The research included data of all live births in the U S along with data on atrazine application in the U S between 2009 and 2019 The study authors found that higher county levels of

of mothers with low levels of estimated residential atrazine exposure those with high levels had nearly a two fold increase in risk for choanal atresia or stenosis This congenital condition is caused by a narrowing or blocking of the back of the nasal passage which can lead to life threatening respiratory symptoms A 2012 study published in Maternal and Child Health Journal examined maternal exposure to atrazine and the risk of gastroschisis Researchers examined birth data in Texas between 1999 and 2008 They found the risk of gastroschisis in newborns significantly increased in mothers who were less than 25 years old and exposed to high levels of residential atrazine exposure compared to low exposure Interestingly the association was not seen in mothers over 25 years old who were also exposed to high levels of atrazine Research presented in 2010 at the 30th Annual Meeting of the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine found by using data from the Washington State Birth Certificate

for countries where atrazine is still in use Preterm delivery In a 2017 study published in Environmental Research and conducted by scientists at the University of Illinois at Chicago researchers found that exposure to atrazine in public drinking water was associated with an increased rate of preterm delivery The study examined more than 130 000 single births between 2004 and 2008 in 46 counties in the midwest that were part of the EPA s Atrazine Monitoring Program AMP The study authors wrote Our findings do raise concerns about the potential adverse effects of these common water contaminants on human development and health and the adequacy of current regulatory standards Abnormal birth weight and unexplained infertility In a 2008 study published in the journal PLoS ONE researchers from the University of California at San Francisco tested the effects of atrazine on human placental cells in vitro They found that the herbicide increased the activity of a gene associated with abnormal human birth weight when over expressed in the placenta Atrazine also targeted a second gene that has been found to be amplified in the uterus of women with unexplained infertility Low birthweight In a study published in 2018 in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health researchers examined adverse birth outcomes between 2006 and 2008 in Ohio communities with high atrazine

needed to refine no observed adverse effect levels for neurotoxic outcomes In a 2023 study published in Food and Chemical Toxicology researchers examined the toxic effects of atrazine on the hippocampus and examined whether lycopene offers protective benefits of atrazine induced impairment in male mice The researchers wrote Atrazine can cause spatial learning and memory impairments by inducing histopathological changes in the hippocampus and ferroptosis in the hippocampal cells Slowed metabolism and weight gain In a 2009 study published in PLoS ONE researchers examined the effects of chronic atrazine exposure on mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in rats Researchers fed the rats drinking water with low concentrations of atrazine for five months They found that the rats exposed to atrazine had a decreased basal metabolic rate and increased body weight intra abdominal fat and insulin resistance without changing food intake or physical activity level They concluded These results suggest that long term exposure to the herbicide ATZ might contribute to the development of insulin resistance and obesity Gestational diabetes A small study published in 2007 in the journal Diabetes Care examined data from the Agricultural Health Study to see whether exposure to certain pesticides including atrazine put pregnant women in their first trimester at higher risk of gestational diabetes Researchers found that risk of gestational diabetes was significantly associated when women self reported ever having used atrazine The exposure of three other herbicides 2 4 5 T 2 4 5 TP atrazine or butylate and three insecticides diazinon phorate or carbofuran were also significantly associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes Renal failure A 2016 study published in Occupational and Environmental Medicine examined the link between end stage renal disease ESRD and dozens of pesticides from data in the Agricultural Health Study a prospective cohort study of licensed pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina The results showed that farmers who were chronically exposed to atrazine and other pesticides throughout their lives were at higher risk of kidney failure The more significant use of atrazine was associated with a higher risk of the disease The researchers wrote Our findings support an association between ESRD and chronic exposure

participants applying atrazine more than 20 days per year having an odds ratio of 1 5 Endocrine disruption in aquatic life In amphibians and various fish atrazine has been shown to damage reproductive organs and systems In 2010 Dr Tyrone Hayes of the University of California Berkeley conducted research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences PNAS that showed African clawed frogs experienced complete feminization and chemical castration when living in water contaminated with atrazine at levels within the legal limit in public drinking water in the United States Hayes writes Our study showed that atrazine induced females are indeed genetic males Furthermore we showed that feminization is persistent and complete resulting in reproductively functional females capable of producing viable eggs Prior to his 2010 study Hayes published several other studies with similar results In a 2002 study published in Nature Hayes examined the effects of atrazine contamination in water on wild leopard frogs in various regions of the U S He found that in males atrazine was linked to significant gonadal abnormalities including incomplete development Hayes wrote these results are supported by laboratory observations which together highlight concerns over the biological effects of environmental atrazine on amphibians A 2011 review published in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology which included Hayes along with 21 co authors around the world presented a state of the art summary of the mechanisms by which atrazine acts as an endocrine disruptor to produce these effects The researchers wrote Atrazine demasculinizes male gonads producing testicular lesions associated with reduced germ cell numbers in teleost fish amphibians reptiles

after it was found to surpass the regulatory limits of pesticide 0 1µg L in groundwater according to the European Chemicals Agency ECHA In the EU Commission s decision letter regarding atrazine in 2004 the commission wrote The Committee is of the opinion that available monitoring data does not demonstrate that concentrations of atrazine or its breakdown products will not exceed 0 1 μg l in groundwater and it expects that for soils with pH above six concentrations of atrazine and its breakdown products will not exceed 0 1 μg l The letter continued In particular available monitoring data were insufficient to demonstrate that in large areas concentrations of the active substance and its breakdown products will not exceed 0 1 μg l in groundwater Moreover it cannot be assured that continued use in other areas will permit a satisfactory recovery of groundwater quality where concentrations already exceed 0 1 μg l in groundwater These levels of the active substance exceed the limits in Annex VI to Directive 91 414 EEC and would have an unacceptable effect on groundwater In other words the EU committee found that atrazine not only regularly exceeded the maximum limits in groundwater but also deemed there were insufficient monitoring and measures in place to mitigate such excess On its Substance Infocard the ECHA warns about atrazine According to the harmonised classification and labelling CLP00 approved by the European Union this substance is very toxic to aquatic life is very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects may cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure and may cause an allergic skin reaction In the EU atrazine is also subject to export notification and explicit consent requirements of the prior informed consent regulation PIC the ECHA told U S Right to Know In other words any exporting of atrazine from the EU to third countries requires consent from the receiving end before the export takes place In 2012

especially during heavy rains according to the USDA Research has shown that atrazine can remain in soil and groundwater for decades A study published in 2014 in the journal Water Research found that in Germany even 20 years after the ban of atrazine the groundwater concentrations of sampled observation wells remain on a level close to the threshold value of 0 1 μg l 1 without any considerable decrease In a commentary piece published in 2010 regarding atrazine s persistence scientists in Germany wrote in the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research that even more than 18 years after it was banned in Germany atrazine remains the most abundant pesticide in groundwater samples They continued That after decades of weathering atrazine is still detectable and metabolites apparently with triazine ring intact are still abundant in soil underscores the need to assess the environmental behavior of this herbicide on longer time scales Click here to see a map from the U S Geological Survey of estimated atrazine use across the United States in 2019 What are the legal levels of atrazine in drinking water In the U S the maximum contaminant level MCL of atrazine is 3 µg L parts per billion in public drinking water In the European Union atrazine is banned for use but the EU s Water Directive Framework has set a general precautionary standard level for pesticides in groundwater at 0 1µg L 30 times lower than the U S limit on atrazine According to the EU s 2006 Groundwater Directive the decision to set the level at 0 1µg L includes the objective to achieve water quality levels that do not give rise to significant impacts on and risks to human health and the environment Atrazine contamination in groundwater A 2018 report published by the Environmental Working Group found that around 30 million Americans in 28 states have some level of atrazine in their drinking water In general levels of atrazine in tap water are highest in the late spring and early summer when farmers typically spray their crops with the herbicide The report also found that several locations monitored in the EPA s Atrazine Monitoring Project had at times particularly during the late

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry tested soils in Belgium and Germany and found that atrazine application history dramatically influences its degradation and mineralization Their soil tests also suggested that atrazine is not completely mineralized and remains extractable even in adapted soils and appears to be conserved on long time scales after the last application A study conducted by scientists at the U S Geological Society and published in 2021 in the journal Environmental Science and Technology found that of the 442 U S streams tested atrazine contaminated 55 percent of surface water and 70 percent of the groundwater Atrazine related lawsuits In 2012 dozens of U S water utility companies hit Syngenta with a federal class action lawsuit alleging that the company knew the herbicide was contaminating local drinking water supplies The lawsuit also cited atrazine s potential danger it posed to the environment and pregnant women Syngenta agreed to a settlement and paid 105 million which was split between the water utility companies In 2020 advocacy groups sued the EPA after it reapproved the use of atrazine claiming that the government agency failed to uphold its duties to monitor and confirm the herbicide did not pose risks to public health through water contamination California In 2016 the state of California added atrazine to its Prop 65 list of toxic chemicals and listed the herbicide as causing developmental toxicity and reproductive toxicity Recent changes proposed by the EPA In June 2022 the EPA proposed for public comment changes to atrazine use in the United States in order to reduce runoff and leaching As shown on the EPA website they are as follows Prohibit application when soils are saturated or above field capacity i e the soil s ability to retain water Prohibit application during rain or when a storm event likely to produce runoff from the treated area is forecasted to occur within 48 hours following application Prohibit aerial applications of all formulations and Restrict annual application rates to 2 pounds of active ingredient or less per acre per year or less for applications to sorghum field corn and sweet corn Farmers

integrative biology of University of California Berkeley has studied atrazine for decades In 1997 Hayes was recruited to conduct research for the herbicide on an expert committee for Syngenta then Novartis While conducting his research he discovered that when exposed to atrazine male frogs underwent significant reproductive changes and developed abnormal gonads Hayes explained to Mother Jones in 2012 that for decades scientists had been sounding the alarm about decreasing amphibian populations all over the world We re asking How come there aren t any new frogs Atrazine isn t killing the frogs But if they re reproductively impaired that s killing the population When he brought his findings to Syngenta Hayes said executives did not appear concerned and even questioned the veracity of his findings Eventually Hayes quit working for the corporation and then repeated the experiment multiple times and found similar results He published several peer reviewed research papers over the course of the following decade Syngenta representatives began attending Hayes academic talks and testimonies sometimes Hayes would get into arguments about his research with the attending representatives Other times they would insult one another on professional and personal levels Nature reported in 2010 Hayes continuously expressed concern that Syngenta was spying on him and trying to ruin his reputation In 2013 unsealed court documents related to the federal class action lawsuit against Syngenta revealed that the corporation had put forward a multi million dollar public relations

manager Sherry Ford who referred to Hayes by his initials wrote that the company could prevent citing of TH data by revealing him as noncredible In a perspective piece published in the journal Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry in 2020 biologist Jason Rohr of the University of Notre Dame offered a timeline of the most important events in the atrazine saga between Syngenta and Hayes Rohr argued The atrazine controversy must be used as an example of how manufacturing uncertainty and bending science can be exploited to delay undesired regulatory decisions and how greed and conflicts of interest situations where personal or organizational considerations have compromised or biased professional judgment and objectivity can affect environmental and public health and erode trust in the discipline of toxicology science in general and the honorable functioning of societies Syngenta s defense of atrazine Syngenta stands by atrazine as a safe and effective product and the corporation estimates that the herbicide along with simazine saves U S consumers between 4 3 billion to nearly 6 2 billion yearly On Syngenta s website it states Governments and international agencies continue to approve atrazine because there is no credible connection between the herbicide and any health problem in humans In a recent webinar moderated by Dr Tyrone Hayes U S Right to Know co founder Stacy Malkan presented her 2022 report Merchants of Poison which investigated and demonstrated the various strategies pesticide manufacturers have used to discredit scientists One of these ways is to make use of organizations like the American Council on Science and Health ACSH The agency refers to itself as a pro science consumer advocacy organization but is a front organization that solicits money in exchange for dispensing research and communications that champions and advocates for controversial products An example of this was in 2011 when the ACSH funded the publication of a book by Jon Entine about chemophobia or the unfounded fear of chemicals The book maintained that atrazine was safe Today Entine is the executive director of the Genetic Literacy Project a nonprofit group similar to ACSH

on claims that repeated exposure to the company s popular Roundup herbicide left him with terminal cancer San Francisco Superior Court Judge Suzanne Ramos Bolanos was assigned Monday to oversee the trial and jury selection is tentatively expected to begin Thursday June 21 with opening statements possible by June 27 The courtroom showdown could last three to four weeks lawyers involved estimate and will shine a spotlight on decades of scientific research and internal Monsanto documents that relate to the testing and marketing of Monsanto s flagship herbicide and the active ingredient a chemical called glyphosate Though Johnson is the lone plaintiff in the lawsuit his case is considered a bellwether for roughly 4 000 other plaintiffs also suing Monsanto over allegations that exposure to Roundup caused them or their loved ones to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL Another case is scheduled to go to trial in October in St Louis Missouri Johnson worked as a groundskeeper for the Benicia Unified School District for many years The lawsuits which have been piling up in court dockets around the U S not only challenge Monsanto s position that its widely used herbicides are proven safe but they also assert that the company has intentionally suppressed evidence of the risks of its weed killing products misleading both regulators and consumers in a dangerous deception The litigation proceeding both in federal and state courts began after the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC classified glyphosate the active ingredient in Roundup as a probable human carcinogen in March 2015 The IARC classification was based on years of published peer reviewed scientific studies analyzing glyphosate and glyphosate based herbicides Monsanto and allies in the agrochemical industry have blasted the litigation and the IARC classification as lacking in validity countering that decades of safety studies prove that glyphosate does not cause cancer when used as designed Monsanto has cited findings by the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA and other regulatory authorities as backing its defense The company can also point to an EPA draft risk assessment

is not expected to live much longer after being diagnosed in 2014 with a form of non Hodgkin lymphoma called mycosis fungoides A Death Sentence According to court records Johnson worked as a groundskeeper for the Benicia Unified School District for many years and applied multiple treatments of Monsanto s herbicides to the San Francisco area school properties from 2012 until at least late 2015 including after he was diagnosed with cancer in August 2014 His job entailed mixing and spraying hundreds of gallons of glyphosate based herbicides around school properties He used various Roundup products but mostly Roundup PRO a highly concentrated version of the weed killer After developing a skin rash in the summer of 2014 he reported to doctors that it seemed to worsen after he sprayed the herbicide In August of that year he was diagnosed with a type of lymphoma but continued his work until 2015 when he underwent several rounds of chemotherapy only to learn in September 2015 that he likely had but 18 months to live In a deposition taken in January Johnson s treating physician testified that more than 80 percent of his body was covered by lesions and his diagnosis

study by university academics then pressured them to omit photos that implicated a defective insecticide treated seed product as a threat to bees according to communications obtained by U S Right to Know Several seed and insecticide companies including Bayer paid Ohio State University researchers to determine how much their insecticide coated seed products affected bees during corn planting season in 2014 and 2015 After the researchers presented their preliminary results to stakeholders which included funders a Bayer official asked that their final report exclude photos of insecticide coated corn seeds in which the product appeared defective He also urged the researchers to qualify statements in the final report that discussed threats to bee health in ways that benefited Bayer s corporate interests Although the photos and all the researchers conclusions ultimately made it to the final publication internal emails show the seed and chemical industry funders intensely scrutinizing the researchers findings during pre publication presentations The study s funding contract allowed funders to review and comment on findings prior to publication and required pre approval for any press releases or sharing of results This situation serves as an example of how agrichemical companies attempted to influence scientific research at a public university Emails show how an industry funder tried to control and spin researchers results Internal communications and research contracts are elements of sponsored research that are typically hidden from the public but in this case they provide insight into corporate sponsors involvement in the research process Concerns about bee deaths The main funders of this research were chemical companies that manufacture neonicotinoids the world s most widely used insecticide Neonicotinoids or neonics for short are often delivered to crops via a colorful coating on the seed Neonics are systemic which means the seed grows into a plant containing the insecticide throughout so it kills any bug that bites it Since they are insecticides neonics are also toxic to bees and other beneficial pollinator insects The companies manufacturing neonics have been trying to shape the narrative about bees and insecticides for more than a decade as concerns have grown about harm to bees In 2008 there was a major honey bee die off in Germany that researchers traced back to the planting of neonic coated seeds The coatings were flaking off the seeds as tractors drove around in the fields towing corn planters which are mechanical devices that plant corn seeds one at a time into the ground The mechanical planting process churned up clouds of neonic imbued dust that killed bees Bayer said it was a bad batch of seed

from corn planters as a route of neonic exposure for bees Canada was able to link bee deaths to corn and soybean planting events in 2012 and 2013 The next year the nonprofit Pollinator Partnership formed the Crop Dust Research Consortium CDRC which funded research to determine the best practices for minimizing honey bee exposure to seed dust Its funders included companies such as Bayer Syngenta and BASF all of which manufacture insecticidal seed coatings trade groups with direct financial interests in neonic coated seeds and beekeeping and agricultural interest groups The CDRC said that its goal across all research objectives was to produce peer reviewed published papers to advance the understanding of the issue through open and transparent oversight Its material explicitly said the research was not intended as an endorsement of seed treatment neonics or any other specific practice One of its objectives was to test a new lubricant Bayer developed that was intended to contain the coatings better than existing lubricants In 2014 the CDRC granted 157 224 to Dr Reed Johnson and agronomist Harold Watters of Ohio State University The researchers were to characterize bee visits to flowers around cornfields during spring planting to figure out how to reduce pesticide exposure during those visits and to test how well various seed lubricants reduced dust In 2015 CDRC granted the lab an additional 145 000 to continue the research In addition the researchers were to investigate the long term health consequences of bee colonies exposed to insecticide contaminated dust from corn planters and the efficacy of the CDRC s recommendations in preventing bee exposure to planter dust Researchers in Iowa Nebraska Montana and Ontario also received funding Johnson and Watters determined there was very little difference in the amount of neonic dust generated by different kinds of corn planters and that Bayer s new lubricant didn t outperform the other lubricants This conclusion was published in the CDRC final report in 2017 Johnson and Watters also documented higher neonic levels in bee collected pollen and an uptick in bee deaths during corn planting season However they didn t

leading up to publication show that although the researchers ultimately published all their findings they first had to respond to funders who had a financial interest in the results as they reviewed and suggested changes to their report The flaky seed coating ordeal During corn planting Johnson and Watters noticed the insecticidal coating on their seeds was visibly flaking off so they sampled the seeds after they d been rattling around in the planting hopper for 15 minutes to an hour They later photographed a few seeds from every sample The photos showed the seeds were losing a lot of their insecticidal coating before they went into the ground Johnson and Watters included these photos in a November 2015 presentation to the Entomological Society of America and a contractually required December 2015 presentation to CDRC stakeholders By January the CDRC s industry affiliated stakeholders began to take intense interest In emails from January through November of 2016 they asked Watters and Johnson for minute details about their research conditions remarked that the seeds looked unusually bad and suggested conducting more studies to replicate the phenomenon I can t explain the photos taken by OSU wrote David Fischer the director of pollinator science for Bayer prior to a July 2016 presentation of the Ohio State team s preliminary results I d like to know more about the seed treatment quality So much of the seed treatment has been eroded from these seeds I don t see how any pest control efficacy could be achieved In past studies the amount of active ingredient removed from the seed is usually less than 2 The seeds from the OSU study look to be 30 or more While Fischer insisted the findings were an outlier in an interview with U S Right to Know Watters defended his research and said the coating problems he observed were likely typical in the field One important distinction is that most of the prior experiments Fischer referenced were conducted on small plots

perhaps 320 acres in size My work was done in these typically sized farm fields Furthermore Johnson and Watters research was conducted on working farmers fields using the coated seed the grower already planned to use for that field The seed came off the typical commercial lots sold to farmers Watters said So hybrid company of origin maturity etc would have been at random we made no prior plans on seed only what field we were in and with what grower Ultimately Watters said they observed degraded seed coatings at random throughout the study Our observations were totally random and as a conclusion I would expect similar seed coat breakage to happen everywhere he said At least one stakeholder on the conference calls told Watters and Johnson that getting seed treatments to stick to corn seeds is difficult as a rule Watters said This was apparently not unexpected for at least that one person I think there was an understanding that this is probably a component of the problem the quality of the coating maybe was not as good as the seed casing they were producing in their own facilities Johnson said referencing an American Seed Trade Association top lobbyist asking about how the seeds had been stored and under what circumstances they d been purchased But he said he believed the scrutiny was coming from industry affiliates interest in identifying what to fix I think they genuinely wanted to solve this problem he said The recollection I have is they couldn t believe that there were actually flakes of the seed coating coming off of the seed Watters said when asked about the emailed exchanges The seed coats did crack We collected material in the field we had sticky traps there were chunks of the seed coat that were coming off as the seed was being planted Although he

July 2016 Bayer s Fischer wrote to the group Bayer has very significant concerns about the inclusion in the CDRC report of the photographs of seeds with severely eroded seed coatings that are shown in Fig 10 of the report from Ohio State University especially the photo characterized as typical example of what seeds look like after passing through a planter Many BCS Bayer Crop Science personnel have seen these photos and consider them completely atypical of anything they ve seen in their experience Fischer went on to say that Bayer s internal studies yielded very different results where the coating stayed on nearly perfectly after passing through a planter Fischer then asked for further studies and interpretations on the matter The CDRC final report indicates which seed companies sold the seeds used in Johnson and Watters study Beck s Dekalb Monsanto Master s Choice and Stewart s but no information explicitly named which seed coating manufacturer s product was on those seeds Although three seed coating manufacturers were represented in the CDRC s stakeholder group Syngenta BASF and Bayer Bayer s David Fischer dominates the communications obtained by USRTK After the meeting Fischer sent Johnson several pages of comments in which he asked for Johnson to remove the photos and asked him to qualify several statements pertaining to bee health Despite this conclusions remained unchanged between the June 2016 draft Fischer commented on and the final report aside from one statement Johnson added to qualify the observed uptick in bee deaths The increase in adult mortality however would not be expected based on the concentrations of seed treatment insecticide measured in bulk pollen samples In other words it clarified that pesticide concentrations in the pollen were too low to adequately explain the bee deaths they observed The insecticide was probably not evenly distributed throughout the pollen Johnson explained referring to it as the toxic chocolate chip cookie hypothesis There were these little chunks of the seed treatments and if the bee got that chunk it was gonna die But overall the concentration if you averaged it all together was

interview with U S Right to Know Although Fisher s requests appeared to elicit little change in the report he asked for many changes With regards to the flaky seed coatings he called for a dedicated study to determine whether OSU s seeds met industry standards but noted that might be impossible for the specific batch of seeds that had been used in Johnson s study So the quality of the seed treatment of the seeds used in the OSU study is an uncertainty Given this uncertainty I would suggest that the photographs of abraded seeds be removed from the report or at least a clear statement made that indicates the quality of the treatment of these seeds is unknown Fischer wrote Figure 10 showing the photos of seeds with a large amount of the seed treatment eroded as a result of planter abrasion is problematic There are no data backing up the statement that the photo on the left represents a typical seed after passing through a planter Also the amount of a i active ingredient remaining on the seed hasn t been determined These photos have the potential to mislead the reader regarding the amount of a i lost due to dust abrasion These photos should be deleted from the report Fischer further suggested qualifiers and changes to the report such as removing the word elevated from neonic residues are reliably detected at elevated levels 8 ppb above background on average This suggestion was ignored Fischer also suggested that Johnson contextualize the neonicotinoid levels he found in pollen that bees had collected by discussing their risk to bee health He provided several paragraphs of analysis and a diagram to that extent The residue levels measured DO NOT indicate any appreciable risk to honey bees and DO NOT explain the acute mortality observed in the study The above analysis should be included in the report Without it the reader might mistakenly think that the residue measurements DO explain the mortality observed Emphasis Fischer s This appears to be the one area where Johnson et al added a sentence to emphasize the above fact although Fischer s diagram was not included in the final report Fischer also wrote to Johnson about the bee deaths documented

that he didn t know much about coated seeds and Fischer s concerns seemed valid if the seeds he d photographed had been a fluke He largely disregarded Fischer s suggested edits though besides adding the line about how the average insecticide levels were lower than lethal in the pollen samples I think we were happy with the conclusions we had come to I guess we disagreed with what David Fischer had suggested he said except on that one point Did Johnson think this exchange was an overstep on Fischer s part I think that was his role to play in this group and he did it Johnson said When asked

corporations have obscured their research contributions by providing them through a foundation or trade organization Such entities might have innocuous and nice sounding names Grundy said but are actually representing the pooled contributions of several commercial or corporate entities with an interest in shaping the direction of a research agenda It can be hard for an average reader to identify conflicts of interest in a system that relies on voluntary disclosures from researchers Grundy said Structural or policy interventions might be necessary to eliminate bias or funder influence It sounds like Johnson and Watters in fact did the right thing but could have benefited from more supports to ensure the independence and integrity of their work which has some pretty powerful

said Bigalk also noted they left certain critical details out of the CDRC s final report Wouldn t you think he said if the study sought to address beekeeper complaints about toxic corn dust that you would have some evidence of things that now have been corrected Or evidence that it does kill bees Wouldn t you think Although Bigalk saw the project through from start to finish another beekeeping interest group representative grew so disheartened with the CDRC that he dropped out of the partnership Randy Verhoek attended a couple meetings on behalf of the American Honey Producers Association but dropped out after hearing the group arrive at conclusions he didn t agree with American Honey Producers Association president Chris Hiatt confirmed It was really a strange experience And for more ways than one Bigalk said In one of the very first stakeholder meetings Bigalk said he suggested the seed coating dust could be remediated with a different polymer that would stick better to corn seed That comment was made and there was no response and they went on to something else he said That surprised him he said since a small chemical vendor had readily mentioned the coating problem to Bigalk previously Johnson s team stands their ground Several days after Johnson responded to Fischer s feedback Pollinator Partnership personnel scheduled a phone conversation with Johnson then convened another conference call in November specifically to talk about the seed coating issue During that call minutes obtained by U S Right to Know show that Fischer said that chunks coming off seeds do not affect the bees as much as the pollen sized seed coating that comes off to which then Pollinator Partnership Executive Director Laurie Davies Adams responded that big chunks of insecticidal coating could still affect the water quality on the site Meeting minutes show that one seed company representative Beck s Hybrids manager Jim Herr suggested throwing out the worst looking photo In trying to

seed treatment degradation varying in severity the report reads The photo caption says that seeds varied in the perceived integrity of the coating but most showed signs of particle generation In an extreme case we found one seed that had almost no coating left on it B2 though this was the only example we noticed of such extensive degradation In an early November email exchange Watters and Johnson expressed their exhaustion on the topic to one another However I get the sense there may be some appetite for funding additional research Hard to say Johnson wrote Ultimately Johnson said that he didn t conduct any of the further studies that had been suggested I would really have loved to follow up he said He described a study he wanted to do where he d use a dust meter to measure the amount of coating flaking off of the seeds but it was actually quite difficult to access the necessary equipment the CDRC didn t offer any further funding opportunities and eventually Johnson moved on I m a honey bee researcher and I finally made the decision that this is really getting too far afield he said Other issues with the final CDRC report Starting in January 2017 the Pollinator Partnership circulated a draft of their final report which was meant to summarize the study results and make final recommendations for mitigating planter dust contamination Members of Johnson s lab internally expressed disdain for the long list of recommendations to farmers beekeepers pesticide and equipment manufacturers seed dealers regulators and educators They were particularly irked that the report made recommendations to beekeepers whose practices were not the focus of the study I m genuinely offended that the farmers and beekeepers are the first groups to be addressed as though they bear the primary responsibility for this issue a lab member whose name was redacted told Johnson when he asked them what they thought of the conclusions When submitting comments on the report s final draft in April Johnson wrote I don t recall anyone doing research on supplemental feeding or providing water or placement of hives around a field I realize this leaves you with no bolded

that farmers remove flowering vegetation within fields through tillage mowing or use of herbicides where appropriate prior to planting despite Johnson s chapter recommending against that Johnson said he believes some of the above discrepancies came from the fact that although the 2017 report only contained the final year of each university team s research data the report s overall conclusions attempted to synthesize three years of sometimes conflicting conclusions made by the different university research groups Johnson believes that Pollinator Partnership staff drafted the overall conclusions Pollinator Partnership did not respond to a request to confirm this The aftermath My conclusion is that at the end of this project our major conclusion was that it was really a quality control issue and the seed treatment wasn t adhering well to the seed Johnson said He said he believes that the seed coating formulation changed in the years since his study I don t get any calls about bees dying during corn planting anymore he said compared to many calls in 2012 and 2013 and he detects lower insecticide concentrations in pollen during planting season nowadays It seems that this problem has been solved one way or another he said I think the research reached an audience who needed to see it I still don t like these insecticidal seed treatments for a whole variety of reasons Johnson said The bee issues are just one of them The fact that they re not really very effective at pest control is another major issue here But they do seem to have solved it causing mass bee kills from dust off like it did in these years The CDRC research did not signify the end of neonic contamination issues however Bigalk said They made the steps to research the corn dust situation But in many ways it just stopped short of showing the full toxic effect of neonics on what we call beneficial insects he said or on aquatic organisms Bigalk said he believes the participating chemical

from the abuse of chemicals persist But with the things affecting honey bees today during the summer months and into the winter we don t have outright kills we ve got this invisible negative influence that are coming into the hive and are just disrupting many many things And it s a subtle thing Bigalk said which might manifest in a colony s queen dying or never returning to the hive after going out to mate My word there s such a dramatic change in colony health today compared to what it was 30 years ago 40 years ago he said Although parasitic Varroa and tracheal mites hurt colony health Bigalk said they re not the only bee stressor at play There are beekeepers out there without any elevated number of Varroa mites that are suffering greatly It s invisible Invisible negative influences from abuse of chemicals he said Just last year Nebraska regulators closed down the AltEn LLC ethanol plant after the neonic coatings on the seeds the plant processed caused widespread environmental contamination Bigalk is a farmer as well as a beekeeper He said he s aware that neonicotinoids are applied to far more acres than actually need treatment It s abusive use he said However he still allows them to be applied on his own land in part to make things less complicated for his neighbors since their fields are planted with the same equipment I would surely prefer not having it on but it

full credit A research contract gave multinational pesticide manufacturers ample influence over pesticide research conducted at a state university Experts in research ethics found fault with the

manufacturers contributed to the project despite the contract granting them influence over the study methods University researchers say this is because the pesticide manufacturers involvement was less than what was outlined in the contract In 2017 Bayer and Syngenta two companies that manufacture neonicotinoid insecticides gave 301 671 to Iowa State University ISU researchers for a project titled Estimating the exposure to neonicotinoid residues in pollinator attractive habitat adjacent to corn and soybean fields Neonicotinoids or neonics are one of the most commonly used insecticides in the world and are toxic to bees and other pollinators They are systemic insecticides which means a plant can absorb and distribute them throughout all its parts When the ISU researchers proposed this research they cited existing evidence that neonics from crop fields wind up in nearby flowers whether they are weeds or intentionally planted pollinator refuges The research contract sought to answer whether the neonic levels in pollinator plantings or prairie strips next to crop fields were high enough to hurt pollinators One impetus for the study was to determine whether those plantings could harm bees and butterflies by luring them to pesticide contaminated food Another was to assess whether it was necessary to maintain a 125 foot pesticide free buffer around monarch butterfly breeding habitat according to the contract The contract was prepared after the funders and ISU faculty discussed their shared study interests during the 2016 International Congress of Entomology ISU News Service Director Angie Hunt said Hunt said she was speaking on behalf of Matthew O Neal Joel Coats and Steve Bradbury all ISU faculty listed as study personnel funded by the contract Those conversations led to Iowa State s development of a research proposal to measure exposure in prairie strips as the strips provided a location where neonics and bees would likely be found Hunt said

Draws Fire An array of GMO and pesticide critics spoke out at Monsanto Co s annual meeting of shareholders on Friday Jan 29 in the company s hometown of Creve Coeur Missouri calling on the company to address concerns about the company s genetically engineered crop products and the glyphosate based Roundup herbicide used on those crops Shareholder representatives as well as others from outside organizations told Monsanto Chairman and CEO Hugh Grant that the company should take several steps including reporting on any plans to mitigate risks to human health and the environment tied to Roundup and its main ingredient glyphosate In March 2015 the World Health Organization s cancer experts classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans And Monsanto is facing numerous lawsuits filed by farmworkers and others who say Roundup caused their cancers Given that about half of Monsanto s revenue comes from Roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides the labeling of the company s core product as probably carcinogenic is not a healthy boost for the company s prospects John Harrington CEO of Harrington Investments said in a statement Harrington Investments provide investment advisory services with a focus on environmental and social objectives and has an active shareholder advocacy program Along with Harrington Investments representatives from the Organic Consumers Association Moms Across America SumofUs Women s International League for Peace and Freedom and GMO Free Midwest attended the meeting to protest the company s promotion of Roundup which the protesters say is tied to a range of diseases The group told Monsanto s Grant that there are an increasing number of independent studies associating glyphosate with cancer birth defects kidney disease and hormone disruption Grant deflected the criticisms and said that both glyphosate and GMOs are proven safe This is the 20 th year of planting GMOs said Grant Four billion acres have been planted on the planet without a single health issue These are the most widely tested products that the food industry has ever seen Monsanto brings in roughly 5 billion a year in revenues from sales of Roundup

residue in food grows regulatory protections questioned This article was originally published in Environmental Health News By Carey Gillam Weed killers in wheat crackers and cereals insecticides in apple juice and a mix of multiple pesticides in spinach string beans and other veggies all are part of the daily diets of many Americans For decades federal officials have declared tiny traces of these contaminants to be safe But a new wave of scientific scrutiny is challenging those assertions Though many consumers might not be aware of it every year government scientists document how hundreds of chemicals used by farmers on their fields and crops leave residues in widely consumed foods More than 75 percent of fruits and more than 50 percent of vegetables sampled carried pesticides residues in the latest sampling reported by the Food and Drug Administration Even residues of the tightly restricted bug killing chemical DDT are found in food along with a range of other pesticides known by scientists to be linked to a range of illnesses and disease The pesticide endosulfan banned worldwide because of evidence that it can cause neurological and reproductive problems was also found in food samples the FDA report said U S regulators and the companies that sell the chemicals to farmers insist that the pesticide residues pose no threat to human health Most residue levels found in food fall within legal tolerance levels set by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA regulators say Americans depend on the FDA to ensure the safety of their families and the foods they eat FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a press release accompanying the agency s Oct 1 release of its residue report Like other recent reports the results show that overall levels of pesticide chemical residues are below the Environmental Protection Agency s tolerances and therefore don t pose a risk to consumers The EPA is so confident that traces of pesticides in food are safe that the agency has granted multiple chemical company requests for increases in the allowed tolerances effectively providing a legal basis for higher levels of pesticide residues to be allowed in American food But recent scientific studies have prompted many scientists to warn that years of promises of safety may be wrong While no one is expected to drop dead from eating a bowl of cereal containing pesticide residues repeated low level exposures to trace amounts of pesticides in the diet could be contributing to a range of health problems particularly for children scientists say There are

of the U S population has pesticide residues in their urine and blood The primary route of exposure to these pesticides is through the food people eat the Harvard research team said Several additional Harvard affiliated scientists published a study earlier this year of women who were trying to get pregnant The findings suggested that dietary pesticide exposure within a typical range was associated both with problems women had getting pregnant and delivering live babies the scientists said Clearly the current tolerance levels protect us from acute toxicity The problem is that it is not clear to what extent long term low level exposure to pesticide residues through food may or may not be health hazards said Dr Jorge Chavarro associate professor of the Departments of Nutrition and Epidemiology at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health and one of the study authors Exposure to pesticide residues through diet is associated with some reproductive outcomes including semen quality and greater risk of pregnancy loss among women undergoing infertility treatments There are probably many other health effects we just haven t studied them sufficiently to make an adequate risk assessment Chavarro said Toxicologist Linda Birnbaum who directs the U S National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS has also raised concerns about pesticide dangers through exposures once assumed to be safe Last year she called for an overall reduction in the use of agricultural pesticides due to multiple concerns for human health stating that existing US regulations have not kept pace with scientific advances showing that widely used chemicals cause serious health problems at levels previously assumed to be safe In an interview Birnbaum said that pesticide residues in food and water are among the types of exposures that need greater regulatory scrutiny Do I think that levels that are currently set are safe Probably not said Birnbaum We have people of different susceptibility whether because of their own genetics or their age whatever may make them more susceptible to these things she said While we look at chemicals one at a time there is a lot of evidence for things acting in a

And in a paper published Oct 22 in JAMA Internal Medicine French researchers said that when looking at pesticide residue links to cancer in a study of the diets of more than 68 000 people they found indications that consumption of organic foods which are less likely to carry synthetic pesticide residues than foods made with conventionally grown crops was associated with a reduced risk of cancer A 2009 paper published by a Harvard researcher and two FDA scientists found 19 out of 100 food samples that children commonly consumed contained at least one insecticide known to be a neurotoxin The foods the researchers looked at were fresh vegetables fruits and juices Since then evidence has grown about the harmful human health impacts of insecticides in particular Unacceptable levels A number of current legal standards for pesticides in food and water do not fully protect public health and do not reflect the latest science said Olga Naidenko senior science advisor to the non profit Environmental Working Group which has issued several reports looking at potential dangers of pesticides in food and water Legal does not necessarily reflect safe she said One example of how regulatory assurances of safety have been found lacking when it comes to pesticide residues is the case of an insecticide known as chlorpyrifos Marketed by Dow Chemical which became the DowDuPont company in 2017 chlorpyrifos is applied to more than 30 percent of apples asparagus walnuts onions grapes broccoli cherries and cauliflower grown in the U S and is commonly found on foods consumed by children The EPA has said for years that exposures below the legal tolerances it set were nothing to worry about Yet scientific research in recent years has demonstrated an association between chlorpyrifos exposure and cognitive deficits in children The evidence of harm to young developing brains is so strong that the EPA in 2015 said that it cannot find that any current tolerances are safe The EPA said that

wide use on American farms The FDA s recent report found it the 11 th most prevalent pesticides in U S foods out of hundreds included in the testing A federal court in August said that the Trump Administration was endangering public health by keeping chlorpyrifos in use for agricultural food production The court cited scientific evidence that its residue on food causes neurodevelopmental damage to children and ordered the EPA to revoke all tolerances and ban the chemical from the market The EPA has yet to act on that order and is seeking a rehearing before the full 9 th Circuit Court of Appeals When asked how to explain its changing positions on chlorpyrifos an agency spokesman said that the EPA plans to continue to review the science addressing neurodevelopmental effects of the chemical The fact that it is still in wide use frustrates and angers physicians who specialize in child health and leaves them wondering what other pesticide exposures in food might be doing to people The bottom line is that the biggest public health concerns for chlorpyrifos are from its presence in foods said Dr Bradley Peterson director of the Institute for the Developing Mind at the Children s Hospital of Los Angeles Even small exposures can potentially have harmful effects The EPA decision to continue to allow chlorpyrifos into American diets is emblematic of a broader dismissal of scientific evidence that challenges human health as well as scientific integrity according to Dr Leonardo Trasande who directs the Division of Environmental Pediatrics within the Department of Pediatrics at New York University s Langone Health Epidemiologist Philip Landrigan director of Boston College s Global Public Health initiative and a former scientist with the U S Centers for Disease

than a plum for instance The tolerances also vary from country to country so what the U S sets as a legal tolerance for residues of a pesticide on a particular food can and often is much different than limits set in other countries As part of the setting of those tolerances regulators examine data showing how much residue persists after a pesticide is used as intended on a crop and they undertake the dietary risk assessments to confirm that the levels of pesticide residues don t pose human health concerns The agency says that it accounts for the fact that the diets of infants and children may be quite different from those of adults and that they consume more food for their size than adults The EPA also says it combines information about routes of pesticide exposure food drinking water residential uses with information about the toxicity of each pesticide to determine the potential risks posed by the pesticide residues The agency says if the risks are unacceptable it will not approve the tolerances The EPA also says that when it makes tolerance decisions it seeks to harmonize U S tolerances with international standards whenever possible consistent with U S food safety standards and agricultural practices Monsanto which became of unit of Bayer AG earlier this year has successfully asked the EPA to expand the levels of glyphosate residues allowed in several foods including in wheat and oats In 1993 for example the EPA had a tolerance for glyphosate in oats at 0 1 parts per million ppm but in 1996 Monsanto asked EPA to raise the tolerance to 20 ppm and the EPA did as asked In 2008 at Monsanto s suggestion the EPA again looked to raise the tolerance for glyphosate in oats this time to 30 ppm At that time it also said it would raise the tolerance for glyphosate in barley from 20 ppm to 30 ppm raise the tolerance in field corn from 1 to 5 ppm and raise the tolerance of glyphosate residue in wheat from 5 ppm to 30 ppm a 500 percent increase The 30

of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver British Columbia Lanphear said that while regulators assume toxic effects increase with dose scientific evidence shows that some chemicals are most toxic at the lowest levels of exposure Protecting public health will require rethinking basic assumptions about how agencies regulate chemicals he argued in a paper published last year In recent years both Monsanto and Dow have received new tolerance levels for the pesticides dicamba and 2 4 D on food as well Raising tolerances allows farmers to use pesticides in various ways that may leave more residues but that doesn t threaten human health according to Monsanto In a blog posted last year Monsanto scientist Dan Goldstein asserted the safety of pesticide residues in food generally and of glyphosate in particular Even when they exceed the regulatory legal limits pesticide residues are so minuscule they pose no danger according to Goldstein who posted the blog before he retired from Monsanto this year About half of foods sampled contained traces of pesticides Amid the scientific concerns the most recent FDA data on pesticide residues in food found that roughly half of the foods the agency sampled contained traces of insecticides herbicides fungicides and other toxic chemicals used by farmers in growing hundreds of different foods More than 90 percent of apple juices sampled were found to contain pesticides The FDA also reported that more than 60 percent of cantaloupe carried residues Overall 79 percent of American fruits and 52 percent of vegetables contained

S Department of Agriculture should start regularly testing foods for glyphosate The FDA did only limited tests looking for glyphosate residues however sampling corn and soy and milk and eggs for the weed killer the agency said No residues of glyphosate were found in milk or eggs but residues were found in 63 1 percent of the corn samples and 67 percent of the soybean samples according to FDA data

analysis of 7 413 samples of food examined as part of the FDA s pesticide monitoring program Most of the samples were of food to be eaten by people but 467 samples were of animal food The agency said that pesticide residues were found in 47 1 percent of the samples of food for people produced domestically and 49 3 percent of food imported from other countries destined for consumer meals Animal food products were similar with pesticide residues found in 57 percent of the domestic samples and 45 3 percent of imported foods for animals Many imported food samples showed residues of pesticides

with industry studies Scientific research shows that chlorpyrifos a widely used insecticide is strongly linked to brain damage in children These and other health concerns led several countries and some U S states to ban chlorpyrifos years ago but the chemical was still allowed for use by farmers in the U S after successful lobbying by its manufacturer In August 2021 the Biden Administration acknowledged the danger to children and announced it would ban chlorpyrifos from agricultural use The U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA revoked all tolerances for the chemical which effectively stopped its use on all food and animal feed That decision came a few months after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals directed the EPA to ban farm use unless safety for the chemical could be proven However in November 2023 the U S Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit overturned the EPA s ban and directed the agency to evaluate whether chlorpyrifos can be safely used on some foods The EPA is

EPA Efforts to Slow Herbicide Review Came in Coordination with Monsanto Newly released government email communications show a persistent effort by multiple officials within the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to slow a separate federal agency s safety review of Monsanto s top selling herbicide Notably the records demonstrate that the EPA efforts came at the behest of Monsanto and that EPA officials were helpful enough to keep the chemical giant updated on their progress The communications most of which were obtained through Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests show that it was early 2015 when the EPA and Monsanto began working in concert to stall a toxicology review that a unit tied to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC was conducting on glyphosate the key ingredient in Monsanto s branded Roundup herbicide products The details revealed in the documents come as Monsanto is defending itself against lawsuits alleging that it has tried to cover up evidence of harm with its herbicides The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ATSDR a federal public health agency that along with the CDC is part of the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS is charged with evaluating the potential adverse human health effects from exposures to hazardous substances in the environment So it made sense for the ATSDR to take a look at glyphosate which is widely used on U S farms residential lawns and gardens school playgrounds and golf courses Glyphosate is widely used in food production and glyphosate residues have been found in testing of human urine The ATSDR announced in February 2015 that it planned to publish a toxicological profile of glyphosate by October of that year But by October that review was on hold and to this date no such review has yet been published The documents reveal this was no accident no bureaucratic delay but rather was the result of a collaborative effort between Monsanto and a group of high ranking EPA officials For Monsanto the timing of the ATSDR review was worrisome In March 2015 the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC had declared glyphosate to be aprobable human carcinogen and Monsanto feared ATSDR might have similar concerns about the chemical Previous reports have described how one EPA official Jess Rowland communicated to Monsanto in April

time vice president of government affairs wrote directly to the EPA s Jim Jones the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety Pollution Prevention Jones had oversight of the EPA s Office of Pesticide Programs OPP and was a presidential appointee who carried significant clout The afternoon was waning when the email came in at 3 28 p m Dykes reminded Jones that they had recently discussed the HHS ATSDR glyphosate review at a meeting You were not aware of their review Did you learn anything more about their efforts Dykes asked Jones did not waste time Roughly an hour later he forwarded the message to OPP Director Jack Housenger writing Monsanto thinks atsdr is doing a glyphosate Assessment Could you guys run that down Housenger responds quickly Yes Jess checked with them It has been difficult to get information Within an hour Jones instructed a member of his staff to get him contact information for the head person responsible for ATSDR She replied the next morning that Dr Patrick Breysse was the point person Breysse joined the CDC in 2014 as director of its National Center for Environmental Health overseeing the NCEH s ATSDR May 20 2015 It was only a little after 8 30 a m but Jones told the staff member to instruct Housenger to get in touch with Breysse and within two hours Housenger had penned an email to Breysse explaining that an EPA s own re evaluation risk assessment of glyphosate was nearing completion and asking Breysse if you would still feel the need to do your assessment Housenger told Breysse that he already had reached the individual assigned to the ATSDR assessment and she had indicated she would coordinate with EPA but that was not sufficient Housenger did not mention Monsanto s outreach to EPA on the issue but

Housenger thanked him for his quick response Breysse then reached out to an ATSDR division director named James Stephens to arrange a discussion about the EPA request May 21 2015 James Stephens wrote back to Patrick Breysse that the ATSDR team thought the EPA work overlaps but isn t totally duplicative and stated that the ASTDR team has not been able to see draft copies of the EPA s work I think we would all welcome further discussion with EPA but would hope to use it to help us find out more about what they are doing he told Breysse After hearing from Stephens Breysse wrote back to Housenger saying ATSDR staff would be in touch to discuss Housenger replied with his reiteration that the ATSDR review would be a duplicative government effort and that the EPA draft would be out in July of 2015 As of this writing that EPA preliminary risk assessment still has not been released though in 2016 the EPA did release a cancer assessment report that declared glyphosate was not likely to cause

to ask him to help repudiate the IARC classification and to recognize that a review of glyphosate was not the primary role for his agency Dr Wolfe said he would follow up on what was going on with ATSDR and he was encouraged to have discussions with EPA staff as well a Monsanto memo detailing the meeting states June 9 2015 Henry Abadin an ATSDR supervisory scientist reported to Stephens that he

He had heard from Housenger that the EPA official had been successful in garnering a promise from ATSDR to put its report on hold The review was not dead however he wrote ATSDR argues that their process is distinguishable and not duplicative They look at different endpoints and told EPA they don t make a call on cancer but I think we should continue to be cautious On June 24 2015 Monsanto s chief scientist William Heydens responded Distinguishable and not duplicative Seriously And I will believe the not making a call on cancer part when I see it Anyway at least they know they are being watched and hopefully that keeps them from doing anything too stupid Jenkins wrote back acknowledging that Monsanto had much more to fear from ATSDR than EPA as the two agencies had arrived at different conclusions on other issues He reported he had been told ATSDR was VERY conservative and IARC like By October 23 2015 EPA and Monsanto had the ATSDR review fully on hold EPA s Housenger

timelines for the assessment but now says its intends to release a draft risk assessment sometime this year That will be followed by a 60 day public comment period After the public comment period the EPA will determine whether any risk management is needed In the meantime Monsanto has cited the EPA s backing of glyphosate safety as repudiation of the IARC finding both in court and with regulators in Europe who are also looking at glyphosate safety issues The EPA did not respond to a request for comment about its efforts to delay the ATSDR report or communications with Monsanto regarding that effort But Brent Wisner a lawyer representing many of the cancer victims who are suing Monsanto said the documents offer damning evidence of improperly close ties between the EPA and the chemical company I think it s very clear that EPA officials and Monsanto employees worked together to accomplish a goal of stopping that analysis at ATSDR That is collusion I don t know what else you d call that said Wisner For its part the ATSDR said this week that the review it started in 2015 is not complete but that it anticipates a draft glyphosate toxicological profile to be issued for public comment by the end of this year A spokesperson for the agency declined to discuss the circumstances surrounding the delay in the review And Jones whose EPA job ended when the Trump administration took

Carey Gillam It s been a little more than a year since the World Health Organization s WHO cancer research experts upended the agrichemical industry s favorite child The group the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC declared the globe s most widely used herbicide glyphosate to be a probable human carcinogen Since then Monsanto Co which draws roughly a third of its 15 billion in annual revenues from its Roundup branded glyphosate based herbicide products and much of the rest from glyphosate tolerant crop technology has been on a mission to invalidate the IARC finding Through an army of foot soldiers that include industry executives public relation professionals and public university scientists the company has called for a rebuke of IARC s work on glyphosate How successful those efforts will or will not be is still an open question But some answers are expected following a meeting being held this week in Geneva Switzerland An international expert scientific group known as JMPR is reviewing IARC s work on glyphosate and the results are expected to offer regulators around the world a guide for how to view glyphosate The group officially known as the Joint FAO WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues JMPR is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO and WHO JMPR meets regularly to review residues and analytical aspects of pesticides to estimate maximum residue levels and to review toxicological data and estimate acceptable daily intakes ADIs for humans After this week s meeting set to run from May 9 13 JMPR is expected to issue a series of recommendations that will then go to the FAO WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission The Codex Alimentarius was established by FAO and the World Health Organization develops harmonized international food standards as a means to protect consumer health and promote fair practices in food trade The meeting comes as both European and U S regulators are wrestling with their own assessments and how to react to the IARC classification It also comes as Monsanto looks for backing for its claims of glyphosate safety Glyphosate is not just a lynchpin for sales of the company s herbicides but also for its genetically modified seeds designed to tolerate being sprayed with glyphosate The company also is currently defending itself against several lawsuits in which farmworkers and others allege they contracted cancer linked to glyphosate and that Monsanto knew of but hid the risks And a rebuke of IARC s glyphosate classification could help the company in its lawsuit against the state of California which aims to stop the state from following the IARC classification with a similar designation Depending on the result of the JMPR the Codex will decide on any actions

companies includes those and many more global food and chemical concerns Internal ILSI documents obtained by a state public records request suggest that ILSI has been generously funded by the

Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment OEHHA have until early April to work out guidelines for glyphosate product warnings before requirements for such warnings take effect in July 2018 At

chemical now off patent is also active in hundreds of other herbicide products We will continue to aggressively challenge this improper decision Monsanto This is not the final step in the process We will continue to aggressively challenge this improper decision Monsanto said in a statement California s move to list glyphosate as a known carcinogen was triggered by the March 2015 decision by the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC to classify glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen Under a state law known as Proposition 65 California is required to add a chemical to a list of known cancer causing substances if it garners such a classification by IARC The law then requires businesses to notify Californians about significant amounts of listed chemicals in products or released into the environment A particularly contentious part of the ongoing battle now surrounds what level of exposure California might allow without any warnings The state has proposed what some see as an overly generous safe harbor or No Significant Risk Level NSRL for glyphosate at 1100 micrograms a day meaning exposure levels and discharges into drinking water sources below that benchmark would be exempt from warning requirements That level is significantly higher than amounts that have been shown to have cancer causing effects in several animal studies however Critics point to studies that have shown tumor developments in animals at doses of glyphosate lower than 850 mg kg day and even lower than 250 mg kg day That NSRL would not be sufficiently health protective We strongly urge OEHHA to uphold its statutory purpose to protect humans from the harmful impacts of glyphosate and lower the NSRL a group of scientists and environmental and food safety advocates told OEHHA in a

research OEHHA relied on showed an uncharacteristic dose response to glyphosate and if OEHHA would take other studies into account it would result in a dramatic lowering of the NSRL The implications are enormous and it s incredibly important that they get this right he said Adding intrigue to the debate lawyers for scores of cancer victims currently suing Monsanto over Roundup have turned up documents showing that before California regulators set the NSRL they met privately with Monsanto Documents obtained from OEHHA include notes from one October 7 2015 meeting between OEHHA staff and Monsanto officials and indicate the parties discussed the company s ideas about an calculating an NSRL and what studies should be looked at for development of that NSRL Among the attendees listed on an OEHHA memo were the agency s Chief Deputy Director Allan Hirsch Deputy Director for Scientific Affairs Melanie Marty and Chief Counsel Carol Monahan Cummings The handwritten notes indicate that there was some discussion of what has long been a Monsanto talking point on glyphosate that if glyphosate isn t used other more toxic herbicides might be used instead California attorney Pedram Esfandiary whose firm is representing multiple cancer victims suing Monsanto also believes California regulators have not incorporated adequate study data into their calculation of the NSRL He said evidence developed through the litigation pending in federal court against Monsanto shows the company has withheld important information regarding glyphosate carcinogenicity Some documents obtained through the litigation have already prompted an investigation by the inspector general for the U S Environmental Protection Agency into whether or not an EPA official engaged in collusion with Monsanto regarding the safety assessment of glyphosate And there are many more relevant documents the lawyers are working to unseal now Additional documents pertinent to the Safe Harbor NSRL and Roundup glyphosate carcinogenicity are presently still under seal and it is strongly recommended that OEHHA obtain access to such documents before OEHHA takes the potentially precarious step of issuing an NSRL of 1100 micrograms Esfandiary and three other attorneys involved in the case said in a letter to OEHHA The known dangers of glyphosate warrant extensive investigation before

on the best scientific information available to us Neither Monsanto nor any other group or individual influenced the proposed NSRL beyond submitting comments or information for our consideration He noted that Monsanto opposes the proposed NSRL Indeed at a recent public hearing Monsanto representatives said the only acceptable NSRL for glyphosate would be infinity Several of the state s Prop 65 listings have drawn controversy and litigation but none have created the uproar that glyphosate has according to Delson The decision to list glyphosate as a cancer cause has drawn by far the largest number of written comments ever received he said More than 10 600 comments were submitted to OEHHA regarding the glyphosate listing and the NSRL issue The deadline for adoption of the NSRL is early April Delson said The goal is to have the NSRL finalized before the warning requirement takes effect in July 2018 so that companies will be able to determine whether they need to provide warnings and or reformulate products in ways that allow them to avoid the need for warnings Food products containing glyphosate residues that cause an exposure exceeding the final NSRL would be included in the warning requirement Delson said As recently as June 20 Monsanto was continuing to press OEHHA to drop or delay the glyphosate listing arguing that the IARC classification was invalid OEHHA denied the request clearing the way for the July 7 listing The company also continues to press the issue in the courts it s lawsuit against OEHHA was dismissed by a Fresno County Superior Court judge in March

hearing about IARC Given the fact that cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States it seems obvious that our lawmakers should be supporting cancer science rather than trying to

inaccurate news stories planted by Monsanto and chemical industry allies and cited the serious nature of these concerns related to expenditures of taxpayer dollars It s worth noting that the plan to put the International Agency for Research on Cancer on the hot seat was put into motion roughly three years ago when Monsanto predicted the international cancer scientists would find its weed killer to have carcinogenic potential The company said as much in internal communications brought to light through recent litigation The documents also show that it was February 2015 a month before the IARC classification when Monsanto executives laid out a strategic plan to discredit the cancer scientists The plan was designed to orchestrate outcry with IARC decision The efforts to manipulate public perception about IARC ramped up last summer when Monsanto allies spoon fed a false narrative to a Reuters reporter who produced a news story that shot around the globe and has been a key talking point for the chemical industry attack against IARC The story relied on the deposition of an IARC scientist named Aaron Blair and reported that Blair withheld critical information that would have altered the IARC glyphosate classification Reuters never provided a link to the deposition which at that point was not filed in any court and was not publicly available Chairman Smith ran with the story stating that Blair admitted to knowing that this research could have prevented the classification of glyphosate as a probable carcinogen Anyone taking time to actually read the deposition which is now public would see that Blair never said any such thing and in fact protested multiple times that the data in question was not fully analyzed and not published and thus was not suitable to be considered

dicamba herbicide says regulator understated the risks UPDATES with statement from BASF In a stunning rebuke of the Environmental Protection Agency a federal court on Wednesday overturned the agency s approval of popular dicamba based herbicides made by chemical giants Bayer BASF and Corteva Agrisciences The ruling effectively makes it illegal for farmers to continue to use the product The ruling by the U S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that the EPA substantially understated the risks of the dicamba herbicides and failed entirely to acknowledge other risks The EPA made multiple errors in granting the conditional registrations the court ruling states Monsanto and the EPA had asked the court if it did agree with the plaintiffs not to immediately overturn the approvals of the weed killing products The court said simply We decline to do so The lawsuit was brought by the National Family Farm Coalition Center for Food Safety Center for Biological Diversity and Pesticide Action Network North America The plaintiffs accused the EPA of breaking the law in evaluating the impacts of a system designed by Monsanto which was bought by Bayer in 2018 that has triggered widespread crop damage over the last few summers and continues to threaten farms across the country Today s decision is a massive win for farmers and the environment said George Kimbrell of the Center for Food Safety lead counsel in the case It is good to be reminded that corporations like Monsanto and the Trump Administration cannot escape the rule of law particularly at a time of crisis like this Their day of reckoning has arrived The court found that among other problems the EPA refused to estimate the amount of dicamba damage characterizing such damage as potential and alleged when record evidence showed that dicamba had caused substantial and undisputed damage The court also found that the EPA failed to acknowledge that restrictions it placed on the use of the dicamba herbicides would not be followed and it determined that the EPA entirely failed to acknowledge the substantial risk that the registrations would have anticompetitive economic effects in the soybean and cotton industries Finally the court said the EPA entirely failed to acknowledge the risk that the new use of dicamba herbicides set up by Monsanto BASF and Corteva would tear the social fabric of farming

Agency had violated the law in approving dicamba herbicides make by Bayer BASF and Corteva Agrisciences and overturned the agency s approval of the popular dicamba based herbicides made by the three chemical giants The ruling made it illegal for farmers to continue to use the product But the EPA flouted the court ruling issuing a notice on June 8 that said growers could continue to use the companies dicamba herbicides until July 31 despite the fact that the court specifically said in its order that it wanted no delay in vacating those approvals The court cited damage done by dicamba use in past summers to millions of acres of crops orchards and vegetable plots across U S farm country On June 11 2020 the petitioners in the case filed an emergency motion seeking to enforce the court order and to hold the EPA in contempt Several farm associations have joined with Corteva Bayer and BASF in asking the court not to immediately enforce the ban Documents are found below Background

dicamba even during warm growing months without harming their crops Monsanto announced a collaboration with BASF in 2011 The companies said their new dicamba herbicides would be less volatile and less

calls Engenia Both XtendiMax and Engenia were first sold in the United States in 2017 Monsanto started selling its dicamba tolerant seeds in 2016 and a key claim by the plaintiffs is that selling the seeds before regulatory approval of the new dicamba herbicides encouraged farmers to spray fields with old highly volatile dicamba formulations The Bader lawsuit claims The cause of such destruction to Plaintiff Bader Farms crops is Defendant Monsanto s willful and negligent release of a defective crop system namely its genetically modified Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans and Bollgard II Xtend

drift would damage the fields of farmers who did not buy the genetically engineered dicamba tolerant seeds The farmers allege this was part of a scheme to expand sales of the genetically engineered

might have been a tough week for Monsanto Co The Environmental Protection Agency was slated to hold four days of public meetings focused on essentially one question Is glyphosate the world s most widely used herbicide and the lynchpin to Monsanto s fortunes as safe as Monsanto has spent 40 years telling us it is But oddly the EPA Scientific Advisory Panel SAP meetings called to look at potential glyphosate ties to cancer were postponed just four days before they were to begin Oct 18 after intense lobbying by the agrichemical industry The industry first fought to keep the meetings from being held at all and argued that if they were held several leading international experts should be excluded from participating including any person who has publicly expressed an opinion regarding the carcinogenicity of glyphosate As the meetings drew near CropLife America which represents the interests of Monsanto and other agribusinesses specifically took issue with at least two scientists chosen for the panel alleging the experts might be unfavorably biased against industry interests On Oct 12 the group sent a letter to the EPA calling for Dr Kenneth Portier of the American Cancer Society to be more deeply scrutinized for any pre formed conclusions about glyphosate More notably CropLife called for leading epidemiologist Dr Peter Infante to be completely disqualified from panel participation EPA should replace Dr Infante with an epidemiologist without such patent bias CropLife told EPA The chemical industry group said Infante was unlikely to give industry sponsored research studies the credibility the industry believes they deserve CropLife said Infante has testified in the past for plaintiffs in chemical exposure cases against Monsanto Croplife also argued that because Infante was the only epidemiologist on the glyphosate SAP he would have enhanced influence in the evaluation of epidemiological data about glyphosate and cancer The CropLife letter was dated last Wednesday and by Friday the EPA announced it was looking for additional epidemiology expertise to ensure robust representation from that discipline EPA also said one panelist had voluntarily departed though the agency refused to say who that panelist was Challenging Infante s role is a gutsy move After all Infante spent 24 years working for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration helping determine cancer risks to workers during the development of standards toxic substances including asbestos arsenic and formaldehyde His resume includes a stint at the National

years of sales of genetically engineered glyphosate tolerant crops developed by Monsanto The future sales of both the chemical and the crops are being jeopardized by the mounting concerns that glyphosate can cause cancer and other illnesses or disease Scientists around the world have been raising red flags for years over worrisome research findings and last year the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC said glyphosate was a probable human carcinogen More than three dozen lawsuits have been filed against Monsanto by people claiming Roundup gave them non Hodgkin lymphoma and both European and U S regulators are evaluating the chemical for continued use Since the IARC classification Monsanto has asked the EPA to back industry assurances that glyphosate is safe and so far the EPA has done exactly that issuing a series of reports and memos that dovetail with Monsanto s position Monsanto also has sought to bolster arguments for glyphosate s safety by pointing to

new formulations of dicamba over the top of these genetically engineered crops during warm weather growing months Monsanto s move to create the dicamba tolerant crops came after its glyphosate tolerant crops and widespread spraying of glyphosate created an epidemic of weed resistance across U S farmland Farmers agricultural scientists and other experts warned Monsanto and the EPA that introducing a dicamba tolerant system would not only create more herbicide resistance but would lead to devastating damage to crops that are not genetically engineered to tolerate dicamba The companies claimed their new versions of dicamba would not volatize and drift as older versions of dicamba weed killing products were known to do But those assurances were proven false amid widespread complaints of dicamba drift damage in recent years More than one million acres of dicamba crop damage was reported last year in 18 states the court noted In February a unanimous jury awarded a Missouri peach farmer 15 million in compensatory damages and 250 million in punitive damages to be paid by Bayer and BASF for dicamba damage to his property In a statement issued after the EPA

residues after the agency was criticized by the U S Government Accountability Office for failing to include glyphosate in annual testing programs that look for many less used pesticides in foods But the agency scuttled the testing after only a few months amid disagreement and difficulties with establishing a standard methodology to use across the agency s multiple U S laboratories according to FDA sources Many observers suspected the suspension might be politically motivated because it came after one FDA chemist found glyphosate in several samples of U S honey and oatmeal products including baby food As well private organizations have detected glyphosate residues in an array of food products In April the Canadian Food Inspection Agency reported that it found glyphosate residues mostly in small amounts in roughly 30 percent of foods it tested The U S Department of Agriculture had intended to start testing some food samples for glyphosate in April of this year agency documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests show But the agency decided to abandon that plan Sources inside the FDA said agency glyphosate testing resumed in early June and FDA spokeswoman Megan McSeveney confirmed the news this week Alongside the testing for glyphosate the FDA laboratories have also said they were analyzing foods for 2 4 D and other acid herbicides Chemical company players

Environmental Protection Agency s EPA Office of Inspector General is initiating a probe into possible collusion between Monsanto and a former top EPA official who provided favorable assessments of the safety of glyphosate while at the EPA That official Jesudoss Rowland was deputy division director within the health effects division of the Office of Pesticide Programs Rowland managed the work of scientists who assessed human health effects of exposures to pesticides and he chaired the EPA s Cancer Assessment Review Committee CARC that contradicted the IARC finding and determined glyphosate was not likely to be carcinogenic to humans Rowland left the EPA in 2016 shortly after a copy of the CARC report was leaked and cited by Monsanto as evidence that the IARC classification was flawed Rowland had a long history of taking a favorable position on Monsanto s glyphosate In 1998 Rowland and the hazard identification assessment review committee where he served as executive secretary at the time recommended that the EPA drop the extra safety margin designed to protect children in the agency s re evaluation of what constituted a safe dose of glyphosate Rowland and another EPA scientist authored the report making the recommendation The decision to drop the extra safety margin called for in the Food Quality Protection Act was important in helping Monsanto gain approval for expanded tolerance levels for glyphosate residues in food Pesticide residues are legal in food if they fall under the so called maximum residue levels or MRLs set by the EPA As the FDA tests for glyphosate residues in food the agency specifically will be looking to see if residues they do find fall within those MRLs Over the years the legal limits for glyphosate in food have risen multiple

McSeveney said glyphosate residues were only being analyzed in soy corn milk and eggs and the popcorn samples while the other foods are being tested for residues of other herbicides Earlier this year one of the agency s senior chemists also analyzed glyphosate residues in honey and oatmeal and reported his results to the agency Some honey samples contained residue levels well over the limit allowed in the European Union The United States has no legal tolerance for glyphosate in honey though the Environmental Protection Agency EPA said recently it may set one because of the FDA findings The results for honey and oatmeal are not considered to be part of the official assignment however according to McSeveney With the testing on hold it is not clear when the agency might have final results on the glyphosate residue analysis McSeveney said preliminary results showed no violations of legal tolerance levels allowed for glyphosate in the foods tested She did not provide details on what if any levels of residue were found Tolerance levels are set by the EPA for a variety of pesticides expected to be found in foods When residue levels are detected above the tolerance levels enforcement action can be taken against the food producer Monsanto said earlier this year that no data has ever indicated residue levels of more than a fraction of allowable levels and it is confident

several types of infant oat cereal including banana strawberry and banana flavored varieties Glyphosate was also detected in cinnamon spice instant oatmeal maple brown sugar instant oatmeal and peach

after the World Health Organization in 2015 said a team of international cancer experts determined glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen Other scientists have raised concerns about how heavy use of glyphosate is impacting human health and the environment The EPA maintains that the chemical is not likely to cause cancer and has established tolerance levels for glyphosate residues in oats and many other foods The levels found by the FDA in oats fall within those allowed tolerances which for oats is set by the EPA at 30 ppm The United States typically allows far more glyphosate residue in food than other countries allow In the European Union the tolerance for glyphosate in oats is 20 ppm Monsanto which derives close to a third of its 15 billion in annual revenues from glyphosate based products has helped guide the EPA in setting tolerance levels for glyphosate in food and in 2013 requested and received higher tolerances for many foods The company has developed genetically

many independent researchers started conducting their own testing and found glyphosate in an array of food products including flour cereal and oatmeal Monsanto and U S regulators have said glyphosate levels in food are too low to translate to any health problems in humans But critics say such assurances are meaningless unless the government actually routinely measures those levels as it does with other pesticides And some do not believe any level of glyphosate is safe in food Earlier this year Taiwan recalled more than 130 000 pounds of oat supplies after detecting glyphosate residues And San

glyphosate and the glyphosate based Roundup product can alter the composition of the gut microbiome in ways that may be linked to adverse health outcomes The paper published Wednesday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives is authored by 13 researchers including study lead Dr Michael Antoniou head of the Gene Expression and Therapy Group within the Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics at King s College in London and Dr Robin Mesnage a research associate in computational toxicology within the same group Scientists from the Ramazzini Institute in Bologna Italy participated in the study as did scientists from France and the Netherlands The effects of glyphosate on the gut microbiome were found to be caused by the same mechanism of action by which glyphosate acts to kill weeds and other plants the researchers said The microbes in the human gut include a variety of bacteria and fungi that impact immune functions and other important processes and a disruption of that system can contribute to a range of diseases the researchers said Both the glyphosate and the Roundup did have an effect on gut bacterial population composition Antoniou said in an interview We know that our gut is inhabited by thousands of different types of bacteria and a balance in their composition and more important in their function is crucial for our health So anything that disturbs negatively disturbs the gut microbiome has the potential of causing ill health because we go from balanced functioning that is conducive to health to imbalanced functioning that may lead to a whole spectrum of different diseases See Carey Gillam s interview Dr Michael Antonoiu and Dr Robin Mesnage about their new study looking at glyphosate impact on the gut microbiome The authors of the new paper said they determined that contrary to some assertions by critics of glyphosate use glyphosate did not act as an antibiotic killing off necessary bacteria in the gut Instead they found for the first time they said that the pesticide interfered in a potentially worrisome way with the shikimate biochemical pathway of the gut bacteria of the animals used in the experiment That interference was highlighted by changes in specific substances in the gut Analysis of gut and blood biochemistry revealed evidence that the animals were under oxidative stress a condition associated with DNA damage and cancer The researchers said it was not clear if the disturbance within the gut microbiome influenced the metabolic stress The indication of oxidative stress was more pronounced in experiments

microbiome and blood but the early findings could be used in the development of bio markers for epidemiological studies and to understand if glyphosate herbicides can have biological effects in people In the study female rats were given glyphosate and the Roundup product The doses were delivered through the drinking water provided to the animals and were given at levels representing the acceptable daily intakes considered safe by European and U S regulators Antoniou said the study results build on other research that makes it clear regulators are relying on outdated methods when determining

if glyphosate and glyphosate based herbicides including Roundup can be harmful to humans even at levels of exposure regulators assert are safe Several such studies have found an array of concerns including one published in November by researchers from the University of Turku in Finland who said that they were able to determine in a conservative estimate that approximately 54 percent of species in the core of the human gut microbiome are potentially sensitive to glyphosate As researchers increasingly look to understand the human microbiome and the role it plays in our health questions about

brought more bad news to light regarding the widely used herbicide glyphosate better known as Roundup in a new research paper published this month Researchers from the University of Turku in Finland revealed in a paper published in the journal Science of The Total Environment that manure from poultry used as fertilizer can decrease crop yields when the manure contains residues of glyphosate based herbicides such as Roundup Fertilizers are meant to increase crop production so the evidence that glyphosate residues can have the opposite effect is significant Poultry litter as the manure is called is often used as a fertilizer including in organic agriculture because it is considered rich in essential nutrients Use of the poultry litter as fertilizer has been growing both in farming and in horticulture and home gardens While use is growing the possible risks associated with the accumulation of agrochemicals in poultry manure are still largely ignored the Finland researchers warned Organic farmers have been growing increasingly worried about traces of glyphosate in manure fertilizer that is allowed in organic production but many in the industry are reluctant to publicize the issue Farmers spray glyphosate directly onto a number of crops grown around the world including soybeans corn cotton canola and other crops genetically engineered to withstand glyphosate treatments They also often directly spray such crops as wheat and oats which are not genetically engineered shortly before harvest to dry the crops out Given the amount of glyphosate based herbicides used to treat crops that are used in animal feed as well as the amount of manure used as fertilizer we should definitely be aware that this kind of a risk exists said one of the authors of study Anne Muola Nobody seems very eager to talk too loudly about it Muola noted The heavy use of glyphosate herbicides directly onto food crops has been promoted by Monsanto now a unit of Bayer AG since the 1990s and glyphosate use is so ubiquitous that residues are commonly found in food water and even air samples Because there are glyphosate residues in human and animal food detectable glyphosate levels are commonly found in human urine and animal manure These glyphosate residues in fertilizer are a problem for growers for many reasons according to the Finland researchers We found that poultry manure can accumulate high residues of glyphosate based herbicides decrease plant growth and reproduction and thus inhibit the growth promoting effects of manure when applied as fertilizer the paper states These

research does exist has shown that those residues can have a negative effect on crops if poultry manure was used as a fertilizer Glyphosate residues in fertilizers have been shown to have negative effects on plants soil microbiomes and microbes associated with plants and animals including humans through the food chain When this contamination is unintentionally spread through fertilizer it places a severe strain on biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services Worldwide 9 4 million tons of glyphosate have been sprayed on fields enough to spray nearly half a pound of Roundup on every cultivated acre of land in the world In 2015 theWorld Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans after reviewing years of published and peer reviewed scientific studies The team of international scientists found there was a particular association between glyphosate and non Hodgkin lymphoma Tens of thousands of people in the United States suffering from non Hodgkin lymphoma have sued Monsanto and in three trials held to date juries have found that the company s glyphosate herbicides were to blame for causing the cancers Additionally an assortment of animal studies released this summer indicate that glyphosate exposures impact reproductive organs and could threaten fertility adding fresh evidence that the

glyphosate revolution Consumers around the world are waking up to the fact that they re living in a world awash in the weed killing pesticide known as glyphosate And they don t like it one bit Over the last several years some scientists have been warning that the long touted environmental and health safety promises associated with glyphosate the chief ingredient in Monsanto s branded Roundup may not be as iron clad as asserted Last year s finding by the World Health Organization s cancer research experts that glyphosate probably is a human carcinogen sparked a firestorm that only grows more heated by the day Consumers in the United States Europe and elsewhere are now demanding that regulators step up and restrict or ban glyphosate herbicides the most widely used in the world to protect both human health and the environment Glyphosate s current license for use in the EU expires in June and the European Union recently delayed making a decision on extending the registration due to the controversy The U S Environmental Protection Agency is similarly stymied Last month a petition signed by thousands of Americans was presented to EPA demanding glyphosate be revoked in the United States A group of U S scientists and activists has a meeting scheduled with the EPA on June 14 to try to convince the regulatory agency it needs to restrict or ban glyphosate The agency is trying to finish a long overdue new risk assessment for the chemical More fuel was added to the fire this week when a coalition of scientists and activists working through what they call The Detox Project announced that testing at a University of California San Francisco laboratory revealed glyphosate in the urine of 93 percent of a sample group of 131 people The group said it used a method known as liquid chromatography mass spectrometry or LC MS MS to analyze urine and water samples The group said it found no glyphosate residues in tap water Further data from this public bio monitoring study

more testing is needed With increasing evidence from laboratory studies showing that glyphosate based herbicides can result in a wide range of chronic illnesses through multiple mechanisms it has become imperative to ascertain the levels of glyphosate in food and in as large a section of the human population as possible he said in a statement The Detox Project is billing itself as a platform for consumers to submit their personal bodily fluids for testing The urine testing was commissioned by the Organic Consumers Association and one of the objectives is to gather research to determine if eating an organic diet has any effect on the level of synthetic chemicals in people s bodies Earlier in May test results for urine samples from members of the European Parliament also showed glyphosate in their systems Monsanto and leading agrichemical scientists say glyphosate is among the safest of pesticides on the market and essential to robust food production They point to decades of safety studies and regulatory approvals around the world They say even if glyphosate residues are in food water and bodily fluids they aren t harmful Support for that argument came last week from a United Nations panel of scientists who proclaimed that a thorough review of the scientific literature made it clear that glyphosate was probably not carcinogenic to humans But the finding was quickly pilloried as tainted because the chairman of the panel Alan Boobis also helps run the International Life Science Institute ILSI which has received more than 500 000 from Monsanto and other large

As the active ingredient in Monsanto s branded Roundup weed killer along with hundreds of other weed killing products the chemical called glyphosate spells billions of dollars in sales for Monsanto and other companies each year as farmers around the world use it in their fields and orchards Ubiquitous in food production glyphosate is used not just with row crops like corn soybeans and wheat but also a range of fruits nuts and veggies Even spinach growers use glyphosate Though considered for years as among the safest of agrichemicals concerns about glyphosate have been growing after the World Health Organization s cancer experts last year classified it as a probable human carcinogen based on a series of scientific studies There are other concerns as well mounting weed resistance to glyphosate negative impacts on soil health and a demise in the monarch butterfly population tied to glyphosate use on forage that young monarchs feed on TheEPA is currently finishing a risk assessment for glyphosate that examines the range of issues The EPA is still trying to determine just how worrisome glyphosate is or isn t In the meantime it s worth a look at how widespread the use of glyphosate is in our food supply A document released by EPA on April 29 gives us a peek What did EPA find In a memorandum dated Oct 22 2015 EPA analysts reported an updated Screening Level Usage Analysis for glyphosate use on food items That memo updates estimates of glyphosate use on crops in top agricultural states and provides annual average use estimates for the decade 2004 2013 Seventy crops are on the EPA list ranging alphabetically from alfalfa and almonds to watermelons and wheat And when compared to a prior analysis that ran through 2011 it shows that glyphosate use has been growing in production of most of the key food crops on the list Here s a snapshot Glyphosate used on U S soybean fields on an average annual basis was pegged at 101 2 million pounds with corn related use at 63 5 million pounds Both estimates are up from a prior analysis that ran through 2011 which pegged average annual soybean use at 86 4 million pounds and corn at 54 6 million pounds Both those crops are genetically engineered so they can be sprayed directly with glyphosate as farmers treat fields for weeds Use with sugar beets also genetically engineered as glyphosate tolerant was estimated at 1 3 million pounds compared to 1 million pounds Notably glyphosate use is also seen with a variety of crops not engineered to be sprayed directly Looking at the period ending in 2013 compared to

levels regulators deem safe They ve been doing such testing for years for residues of other agrichemicals The Food and Drug Administration said in February it would start doing that type of testing for glyphosate residues this year on a limited basis In the meantime the EPA which sets the tolerance levels that deem what is safe regarding pesticide residue announced May 3 that it wasfinalizing a new rule thatwill expand the numbers of crops that can have tolerances established The EPA said this will allow minor use growers a wider choice of pest control tools including lower risk pesticides

By Carey Gillam Sometimes the truth about our food is not very appetizing As many gather this holiday season for shared family meals it is likely that they ll be serving up small doses of pesticides with each plate passed including a prevalent type shown to be harmful to children and reproductive health New data released recently by the Food and Drug Administration FDA shows a rise in the occurrence of pesticide residues detected in thousands of samples of commonly consumed foods Documents obtained from the agency through Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests also show the government is bracing for more with the use of at least one controversial weed killing chemical the herbicide known as 2 4 D expected to triple in the next year And buried deep within the FDA s latest annual pesticide residue report is data showing that a controversial insecticide called chlorpyrifos which is marketed by Dow Chemical and is banned from household use due to known dangers was the fourth most prevalent pesticide found in foods out of 207 pesticides detected Overall about 50 percent of domestic food and 43 percent of imported foods sampled showed pesticide residues in the FDA s testing for fiscal year 2015 which is the period covered in the new report That is up from about 37 percent of domestic and 28 percent of imported foods found with residues in 2010 and up from 38 5 percent and 39 percent respectively found by FDA a decade earlier in 2005 FDA sampling has been shrinking over the years dropping about 25 percent from a decade ago from more than 7 900 samples to 5 989 samples tested in its latest report The U S Department of Agriculture also does annual pesticide residue testing but looks at more than 10 000 samples The latest USDA residue report which also was for the 2015 time period found about 85 percent of samples contained pesticide residues Notably samples of fruits and vegetables considered healthy food choices showed the highest frequency of pesticide residues in the new FDA report Roughly 82 percent of domestic American fruits and 62 percent of domestic vegetables carried residues of weed killers insecticides and other pesticides

of domestic vegetables The FDA said some specific commodities brought into the country may warrant special attention due to illegally high levels of pesticides including cabbage mushrooms oranges and orange juice and rice Outdated safe levels The Environmental Protection Agency sets legal limits referred to as maximum residue limits MRLs for pesticide residues on foods The FDA and USDA routinely assure consumers that if residues are below the established MRLs they are both legal and safe But many scientists and medical professionals disagree saying regulatory methods are outdated and too dependent on input from the chemical industry players selling the pesticides Risk assessment practices at federal agencies have not been updated for modern scientific principles including accounting for the fact that people are exposed to multiple chemicals and that certain groups such as genetically susceptible the very young and old can be at greater risk of exposure said Tracey Woodruff a former EPA senior scientist who directs the Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine The controversy around chlorpyrifos underscores those concerns Farmers have been using chlorpyrifos since 1965 and the government has long maintained that as long as residues are below established MRLs they are safe But in recent years that regulatory view has shifted as studies show that this pesticide which is used on corn and fruits and vegetables such as cranberries Brussels sprouts and broccoli can have harmful neurodevelopmental effects on fetuses whose mothers are exposed and on young children Research ties the chemical to attention deficit problems tremors and autism On December 15 California s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment listed chlorpyrifos as known to cause reproductive toxicity And the EPA has said that it can no longer vouch for the safety of the residues found in food The EPA had planned to outlaw chlorpyrifos use in agriculture But the Trump administration reversed that plan earlier this year after heavy lobbying from Dow and other agrochemical industry representatives

Johnson sued Monsanto alleging that he developed a deadly form of non Hodgkin lymphoma after being drenched with the company s herbicides which he sprayed as part of his job as school groundskeeper In Aug 2018 a jury in San Francisco unanimously found that Monsanto had failed to warn of the carcinogenic dangers of its popular Roundup herbicide and related products which Johnson sprayed regularly

its products and plans to discredit an international agency that declared the main ingredient in Roundup a chemical called glyphosate to be a probable human carcinogen Monsanto now a unit of Bayer AG maintains that its products do not cause cancer On Nov 20 the company further appealed seeking to overturn even Johnson s reduced award and the trial court judge s refusal to grant Monsanto s request

spraying I did not like using the chemicals but I loved that job I would have been making 80 000 a year now if I was still there That day of the accident the day the sprayer broke and I got drenched in the juice I didn t think that much about it I washed up in the sink as best I could and changed my clothes Later I went home and took a good long shower but I didn t think Oh my god I m going to die from this stuff Then I got a little rash Then it got worse and worse and worse At one point I had lesions on my face on my lips all over my arms and legs When I first saw a doctor he was totally confused and didn t know what was happening on my skin He sent me to see a dermatologist who did a biopsy of a lesion on my knee They sent me to UCSF University of California San Francisco and then to Stanford A bunch of doctors came and checked me out Then one day I got a call They told me it was urgent I had to come in to discuss my test results When the doctor said I had cancer my wife was sitting there with me She started crying I didn t take it in right away I don t think I have still taken it in People want to say it s Johnson v Monsanto They want me to talk about the company I don t

November 2014 reporting his concerns that his cancer was triggered by being soaked to the skin in a Monsanto herbicide during a work accident He s looking for answers a Monsanto product support

Assault Don t mess with Monsanto Co That is the message being delivered right now by the agrichemical industry as it makes a full fledged assault on the team of international cancer scientists who dared to declare cancerous connections to the widely used herbicide called glyphosate the chief ingredient in Monsanto s Roundup brand Industry swagger is on full display in Washington where Monsanto and its friends at CropLife America are driving efforts to cut off U S funding for the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC after IARC scientists declared glyphosate a probable human carcinogen in March 2015 The industry is also demanding that the Environmental Protection Agency fully repudiate the IARC classification and green light continued use of glyphosate herbicides which spell billions of dollars in sales annually to Monsanto and the agrichemical brethren The EPA has been evaluating glyphosate as part of a re registration review process for more than five years and was initially expected to complete that review last year The EPA then said it would complete the review by the end of 2016 and now says it will be 2017 before it offers a final report The work has been drawn out as the EPA wrestles with the IARC classification which has both legal and economic implications for the agrichemical industry The EPA had planned to hold four days of public meetings over industry objections to examine scientific research on glyphosate But the industry which deemed the meetings unnecessary and inappropriate successfully derailed those Oct 18 21 public meetings by challenging certain scientists appointed by EPA to an advisory panel The EPA has postponed the meetings and has yet to reschedule Now industry ally U S Rep Lamar Smith is taking EPA officials to task for engaging with IARC on glyphosate concerns demanding that EPA instead rely on the sound science that the industry promotes Smith Chairman of the House Committee on Science Space and Technology accuses IARC of playing an activist role and EPA officials of aiding that effort In an Oct 25 letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy Smith complained of constant delays by EPA in completing the re registration of glyphosate and demanded that EPA officials appear before his committee to explain themselves Monsanto which is fending off lawsuits by people who claim Roundup gave them cancer has also been demanding IARC members turn over documents related to their work The company has labeled the IARC findings as junk science and claims the IARC members are part

some also felt intimidated by the industry actions We were not expecting this strong reaction and what happened said Francesco Forastiere head of occupational epidemiology at the Lazio Regional Health Service in Italy who participated in glyphosate working group for IARC We were doing our job We understood there were other issues economic consequences But none of us had a political agenda We simply acted as scientists evaluating the body of evidence according to the IARC criteria Another working group member Australian epidemiologist Lin Fritschi who has been part of other IARC classifications

with reviewing research already conducted trying to determine how the various findings added up The members analyzed older research as well as more recent studies weighed the methods used the consistency of results and the levels of adherence to research standards There were numerous animal studies to pore over but fewer looking at glyphosate connections to health problems in humans The evidence with respect to cancer in humans came from studies of exposures mostly in agricultural settings The group determined that the best research showed a distinct association between non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL and glyphosate The team also noted that there were ties linking glyphosate to multiple myeloma but the evidence for that disease was not as strong as the evidence tying glyphosate to NHL the group determined The team also evaluated several studies that showed animals developed rare kidney tumors and other health problems after exposure Those studies combined to provide sufficient evidence of glyphosate s carcinogenicity in laboratory animals the IARC team found On top of that the IARC team concluded that there was strong evidence of genotoxicity and oxidative stress from glyphosate including findings of DNA damage in the peripheral blood of exposed humans The team also said it was noteworthy that in one study people showed chromosomal damage after glyphosate formulations were sprayed nearby Overall IARC concluded that there was limited evidence that glyphosate can cause non Hodgkin lymphoma and convincing evidence that glyphosate can cause cancer in laboratory animals The conclusion would have been for sufficient evidence of cancer problems for humans but for one large U S study run by the federal government that did not show connections between cancer and glyphosate Forastiere said The team ultimately decided the weight of the evidence was not strong enough to say glyphosate was definitively carcinogenic but there was more than enough evidence for the caveat probably carcinogenic Blair Forastiere and the others said after the fact that they felt quite comfortable with the work of the IARC team and proud of the thoroughness of what was a complicated undertaking We should all minimize our use as much as possible said Fritschi The people most at risk are people who use glyphosate a lot such as farmers and gardeners and they are

extraordinary efforts to undermine the scientists and push EPA to ignore cancer concerns One letter in particular submitted by CropLife America to EPA this month shows the depths of the industry s efforts to rein in EPA s probe of glyphosate CropLife told the EPA it was out of line for proclaiming a need for independent research on formulated glyphosate products such as Roundup The agency said in September it has been collaborating with the National Toxicology Program of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to develop a research plan to evaluate the role of glyphosate in product formulations and the differences in formulation toxicity But apparently it neglected to get industry permission We also question why EPA would collaborate and develop a research program with the National Toxicology Program without input from the registrant CropLife wrote Should data be required to address specific questions relevant to the registration or reregistration of a product the registrant would be the appropriate source of those data The industry message to EPA is loud and clear Independent research and international scientific findings should not take precedence over

age of 46 DeWayne Johnson is not ready to die But with cancer spread through most of his body doctors say he probably has just months to live Now Johnson a husband and father of three in California hopes to survive long enough to make Monsanto take the blame for his fate On 18 June Johnson will become the first person to take the global seed and chemical company to trial on allegations that it has spent decades hiding the cancer causing dangers of its popular Roundup herbicide products and his case has just received a major boost Last week Judge Curtis Karnow issued an order clearing the way for jurors to consider not just scientific evidence related to what caused Johnson s cancer but allegations that Monsanto suppressed evidence of the risks of its weed killing products Karnow ruled that the trial will proceed and a jury would be allowed to consider possible punitive damages The internal correspondence noted by Johnson could support a jury finding that Monsanto has long been aware of the risk that its glyphosate based herbicides are carcinogenic but has continuously sought to influence the scientific literature to prevent its internal concerns from reaching the public sphere and to bolster its defenses in products liability actions Karnow wrote Thus there are triable issues of material fact Johnson s case filed in San Francisco county superior court in California is at the forefront of a legal fight against Monsanto Some 4 000 plaintiffs have sued Monsanto alleging exposure to Roundup caused them or their loved ones to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL Another case is scheduled for trial in October in Monsanto s home town of St Louis Missouri The lawsuits challenge Monsanto s position that its herbicides are proven safe and assert that the company has known about the dangers and hidden them from regulators and the public The litigants cite an assortment of research studies indicating that the active ingredient in Monsanto s herbicides a chemical called glyphosate can lead to NHL and other ailments They also cite research showing glyphosate formulations in its commercial end products are more toxic than glyphosate alone The International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen in 2015 Monsanto championed falsified data and attacked legitimate studies that revealed dangers of its herbicides and led

lift pressure on the firm According to the court record Johnson had a job as a groundskeeper for the Benicia unified school district where he applied numerous treatments of Monsanto s herbicides to school properties from 2012 until at least late 2015 He was healthy and active before he got the cancer diagnosis in August 2014 In a January deposition Johnson s treating physician testified that more than 80 of his body was covered by lesions and that he probably had but a few months to live Johnson has improved since starting a new drug treatment in November but remains too weak sometimes to even speak or get out of bed his attorneys and doctors state in court filings Monsanto s lawyers plan to introduce evidence that other factors caused Johnson s cancer to challenge the validity of the science Johnson s claims rely on and to present their own experts and research supporting safety The company has an EPA draft risk assessment of glyphosate on its side which concludes that glyphosate

Days after Maryland state legislators introduced a bill aimed at protecting pollinators by restricting the use of neonicotinoid insecticides in residential areas a group of representatives of Bayer Syngenta CropLife America Maryland Farm Bureau and the Maryland Department of Agriculture planned and executed a counter offensive Emails obtained by U S Right to Know show the strategies they used over the next two and a half years The emails are a rare window into the pesticide industry s playbook for trying to keep a group of controversial pesticides on the American market The industry group touted pesticide industry efforts to protect pollinators collaborated closely with the Maryland Department of Agriculture and tried to recruit a bee expert to testify on their behalf among other efforts to defeat the bills Neonicotinoids or neonics are the most widely used insecticides in the world They are toxic to bees and other pollinators The European Union has banned several neonics for outdoor use out of concern for pollinators Over the winter of 2014 to 2015 when Maryland delegates drafted the first bill banning neonics the state s beekeepers lost 45 percent of their honey bee colonies Globally wild and domestic pollinator species are in decline There is a growing body of evidence linking neonics to pollinator declines Although the Maryland Department of Agriculture has never attributed a bee kill to neonics neonics have caused mass bee deaths in other places Studies have demonstrated that neonics at levels found in the environment can impair bee brain cells which makes them worse at navigating foraging and flying Effort to kill pollinator protection bill The Maryland Pollinator Protection Act was signed into law in May 2016 after a stronger bill died in committee in 2015 A 2014 version limited neonic purchases to certified pesticide applicators but was withdrawn by its sponsor Although the 2015 and 2016 bills required labeling all neonic treated seeds or plants sold in the state and limited the sale of neonic insecticides to certified applicators with exceptions for farmers and veterinarians the 2016 bill passed only after legislators removed the labeling requirement exempted pet treatments lice and bedbug treatments and indoor pest control products and exempted people working under the supervision of certified pesticide applicators and farmers The law effectively banned neonic insecticide use except for certified pesticide applicators farmers and veterinarians effective January 1 2018 It imposed a 250 fine for first time violations

tactics are reflected in an internal 2017 CropLife America memo published in The Intercept s 2020 article The Pesticide Industry s Playbook for Poisoning the Earth These strategies include building strong relationships with regulatory agencies positioning the pesticide industry as a defender of bee health and emphasizing non pesticide factors like disease and varroa mites as the most significant causes of pollinator decline In the next two years the industry group s mailing list swelled to include 32 representatives from pest and landscaping companies nurseries and farms plus chemical giants

Although a Bayer representative told the group Dively was willing and available to help out later that day Dively never testified he confirmed to U S Right to Know As I recall the opportunity to

crops but that was not the main focus of this act Industry s talking points On February 24 2015 Dodd circulated some revised talking points for the upcoming house hearing These points discussed the costs the state and its nursery industry would incur from labeling individual plants determining whether plants from out of state were treated with neonics testing plant material for neonics to

ideas for the industry group to present The label language is completely false according to peer reviewed science Neonicotinoids are safe when used according to the labeled directions These labels are

key points during the house hearing For example Mark Schlosberg of the Maryland Association of Green Industries MAGI was assigned to deliver this Neonicotinoids are selective insecticides that do not target beneficial insects such as bees and earth worms Bayer scientists Iain Kelly and Becky Langer Curry meanwhile were assigned to say that many neonicotinoid products actually help to enhance the health of bees by protecting their habitat and forage and speak on the general chemistry of neonicotinoids their life cycle and persistence Why we started using neonics compared to other classes

think it carries more weight he said when a state department testifies compared to an advocacy organization We actually as a legislature prefer that departments weigh in on bills because at the end of the day they re the ones implementing it he said However the MDA testified during a time when it was unusual for state departments to do so and their strong opposition could have led some legislators to believe that the MDA was providing good information Lam said but it was very clearly slanted and skewed Most legislators don t have a background in science They rely on other information to make decisions Lam said That can come from other legislators state department representatives or outside lobbying organizations like the Farm Bureau The challenge for a lot of my colleagues is that they may not fully recognize or grasp the more reliable sources of information he said It is not hard to mislead whether intentionally or unintentionally fellow legislators with information that may be

said due to the inherent conflicts of interest and the confusion it creates about a department s role In this instance they were very clearly a cheerleader for the farming industry and much less in

eight more were pending at that time according to a table included in a joint letter that nine state Attorneys General sent to EPA in response to EPA s neonic registration reviews Environmental

work together with a state department of agriculture he said What these big companies are really good at doing are working behind the scenes Cowen said One thing that keeps Cowen motivated is that the

looking at exposure to the herbicide known as glyphosate the key ingredient in Monsanto s Roundup branded herbicides said they tested and tracked 69 expectant mothers and found that the presence of glyphosate levels in their bodily fluids correlated with unfavorable birth outcomes The research is still in preliminary stages and the sample size is small but t he team is scheduled to present their findings on Thursday at a conference put on by the Children s Environmental Health Network CEHN in Washington D C This is a huge issue said Paul Winchester medical director of the neonatal intensive

glyphosate is present in pregnant women Everyone should be concerned about this Glyphosate is a popular agricultural pesticide used widely in farming operations around the world It s commonly sprayed directly on many food crops and those used for livestock feed But it has become the subject of hot debate over the last few years because of research that links the herbicide to types of cancer and other health ailments Monsanto is being sued by hundreds of people who claim they or their loved ones developed non Hodgkin lymphoma because of exposure to glyphosate based Roundup Monsanto the EPA and other regulatory bodies say evidence of carcinogenicity is lacking and the chemical is among the safest of all pesticides used in food production But documents discovered in the course of the litigation indicate the company may have manipulated scientific research to hide evidence of harm The team that presented their report Wednesday included scientists who have long been skeptical of Monsanto s products as well as medical researchers who have come to have concerns about glyphosate and other pesticides through their study of pediatric health problems Winchester who led the urine sampling study said his look at glyphosate and pregnant women is in very early stages and he and co researchers are hoping to launch a much larger project later this year The preliminary work detected glyphosate in the urine of 63 of 69 91 pregnant women receiving prenatal care through an Indiana obstetric practice Researchers collected the data over two years from 2015 2016 and found that higher

women receiving prenatal care through an Indiana obstetric practice Researchers collected the data over two years from 2015 2016 and found that higher glyphosate levels in women correlated with significantly shorter pregnancies and with lower adjusted birth weights Correlation does not prove causation Still the findings are worrisome because low birth weights and shortened gestation are seen as risk factors for many health and or neurodevelopmental problems over the course of an individual s life Low birth weight babies are more likely to have diabetes heart disease high blood pressure and to be obese research shows People can be exposed to glyphosate through food and through association with farming operations that spray glyphosate on corn and soybean production fields Both soy and corn along with several other crops have been genetically engineered to tolerate direct application of glyphosate Farmers often also use glyphosate directly on wheat oats and other non genetically

Co and officials within the Environmental Protection Agency are fighting legal efforts aimed at exploring Monsanto s influence over regulatory assessments of the key chemical in the company s Roundup herbicide new federal court filings show The revelations are contained in a series of filings made within the last few days in the U S District Court for the Northern District of California as part of litigation brought by more than 50 people suing Monsanto The plaintiffs claim they or their loved ones developed non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL after exposure to Roundup herbicide and that Monsanto has spent decades covering up cancer risks linked to the chemical Lawyers for the plaintiffs want the court to lift a seal on documents that detail Monsanto s interactions with former top EPA brass Jess Rowland regarding the EPA s safety assessment of glyphosate which is the key ingredient in Roundup Monsanto turned the documents over in discovery but marked them confidential a designation plaintiffs attorneys say is improper They also want to depose Rowland But Monsanto and the EPA object to the requests court documents show The EPA has spent the last few years assessing the health and environmental safety aspects of glyphosate as global controversy over the chemical has mounted The World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC declared in March 2015 that glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen with a positive association found between glyphosate and NHL Monsanto has been fighting to refute that classification Rowland has been key in Monsanto s efforts to rebut the IARC finding because until last year he was a deputy division director within the health effects division of the EPA s Office of Pesticide Programs managing the work of scientists who assessed human health effects of exposures to pesticides like glyphosate And importantly he chaired the EPA s Cancer Assessment Review Committee CARC that issued an internal report in October 2015 contracting IARC s findings That 87 page report signed by Rowland determined that glyphosate was not likely to be carcinogenic to humans The EPA finding has been highly valued by Monsanto helping bolster the company s defense against the Roundup liability lawsuits and helping shore up market support for a product that brings in billions of dollars in revenues to the company annually The EPA s stamp of approval for the safety of glyphosate over the last few decades has also been key to the success of Monsanto s genetically engineered glyphosate tolerant crops which have been popular with

touted the report as a public affirmation of its safety claims for glyphosate The company also brought a copy of the report to a May court hearing in the Roundup litigation as a counter point to the IARC cancer classification Shortly after the CARC report was removed from the EPA website Rowland left his 26 year career at the EPA Plaintiffs attorneys have asked to depose Rowland to learn about that situation and other dealings with Monsanto But along with Monsanto s objection to releasing the documents that relate to its conversations with Rowland the EPA has specifically refused the deposition request saying it would not clearly be in the interests of EPA to allow attorneys to question Rowland about the cancer review and interactions with Monsanto Monsanto has so far turned over six million pages of documents through the court ordered discovery process but has designated roughly 85 percent of the information as confidential meaning plaintiffs attorneys must black out information from those documents in any court filings that could be accessed by reporters or other members of the public That designation is improper for many of the documents especially ones dealing with the company s interactions with and influence attempts over EPA officials plaintiffs lawyers argue The lawyers say that the documents obtained through discovery show that Monsanto has been confident all along that EPA would continue to support glyphosate whatever happened and no matter who held otherwise According to the court filings by plaintiffs attorneys the documents show it is clear that Monsanto enjoyed considerable influence within the EPA s OPP and was close with Mr Rowland The documentary evidence strongly suggests that Mr Rowland s primary goal was to serve the interests of Monsanto The EPA is a taxpayer funded public agency and its dealings with Monsanto should be subject to public scrutiny particularly given the widespread use of glyphosate herbicide

This week s events will mark the first time that the science used to justify certain pesticides will be analyzed under oath for all to see This article was first published in The Guardian By Carey Gillam On Monday a federal court hearing in San Francisco will turn a public spotlight on to the science surrounding the safety of one of the world s most widely used pesticides a weedkilling chemical called glyphosate that has been linked to cancer and is commonly found in our food and water even in our own bodily fluids Given the broad health and environmental implications tied to the use of this pesticide we would be well served to pay attention As the active ingredient in Monsanto s branded Roundup and hundreds of other herbicides glyphosate represents billions of dollars in annual revenues for Monsanto and other companies and is prominently used by farmers as an aid in food production It s also favored by cities for keeping public parks and playgrounds weed free and by homeowners who want a tidy lawn But the chemical was deemed a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization s cancer experts in 2015 in a finding that has since triggered waves of liability lawsuits against Monsanto Heated debates over the safety or lack thereof of this popular pesticide have spanned the globe and sparked propaganda warfare with each side claiming the other has misrepresented the scientific record Cancer victims allege Monsanto has ghost written research reviews unduly influenced regulators and created front groups to falsely claim glyphosate safety Monsanto meanwhile asserts multiple studies by international scientists are flawed and politically motivated and says industry studies demonstrate the product is safe when used as intended This week s events will mark the first

company and chemical industry allies have been working to discredit cancer scientists and others who have been warning of danger That effort was highlighted when members of the House committee on science space and technology held a hearing in Washington on 6 February to air Monsanto s complaints about the International Agency for Research on Cancer s IARC classification of glyphosate as a probable carcinogen and to threaten to strip funding from the scientific body The committee effort effectively turning a war on cancer into a war on cancer science was applauded by the chemical industry Monsanto along with lobbyist CropLife America and other agricultural organizations has also sued California to stop environmental regulators from requiring cancer warnings on glyphosate products and on 26 February they won an injunction blocking such a warning The debate over glyphosate is but the latest example of how industry efforts often focus not on scrutinizing scientific evidence of harm but on discrediting the offending science Last year for instance Dow Chemical successfully lobbied the Environmental Protection Agency leadership to ignore warnings from its own

orchestrated and highly coordinated media coup Monsanto Co and friends this week dropped a bombshell on opponents who are seeking to prove that the company s beloved Roundup herbicide causes cancer A widely circulated story published June 14 in the global news outlet Reuters for which I formerly worked laid out what appeared to be a scandalous story of hidden information and a secretive scientist exclusive revelations that the story said could have altered a critical 2015 classification that associated Monsanto s Roundup to cancer and triggered waves of lawsuits against Monsanto It was a blockbuster of a story and was repeated by news organizations around the globe pushed by press releases from Monsanto backed organizations and trumpeted by industry allies like the American Chemistry Council It was also flawed and misleading in a number of critical respects Authored by Reuters reporter Kate Kelland who has a history of cozy relations with a group partly funded by agrichemical company interests the piece accused a top epidemiologist from the U S National Cancer Institute of failing to share important scientific data with other scientists as they all worked together assessing the herbicide glyphosate for the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC That group reviewed a wide body of research on glyphosate and determined in March of 2015 that the pesticide should be classified as a probable human carcinogen Had the group known of this missing data it s conclusion could have been different according to Reuters The story was particularly timely given glyphosate and Roundup are at the center of mass litigation in the United States and under scrutiny by U S and European regulators After the IARC classification Monsanto was sued by more than 1 000 people in the United States who claim they or their loved ones got non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL from exposure to Monsanto s glyphosate based Roundup and the company and the cases could start going to trial next year Roundup is the most widely used herbicide in the world and brings in billions of dollars a year for Monsanto The company insists the IARC classification is meritless and the chemical is proven safe by decades of research So yes it was a big story that scored big points for Monsanto in the debate over glyphosate safety But drilling deeply into the sourcing and selective nature of the Reuters piece makes it clear the story is not only seriously flawed but that it is part of an ongoing and carefully crafted effort by Monsanto and the pesticide industry to discredit IARC s work

publicly available for reporters or members of the public to access Kelland does not share links to the documents she references but makes it clear her information is largely based on a deposition from Aaron Blair the National Cancer Institute epidemiologist who chaired the IARC working group on glyphosate as well as related emails and other records All were obtained by Monsanto as part of the

other studies that do show evidence of links between glyphosate and cancer I m providing the deposition here and disclosing that I requested and obtained it from attorneys involved in the Roundup litigation after Kelland s story was published Second the story relies in part on an anti IARC view of a scientist named Bob Tarone and refers to him as an independent expert someone independent of Monsanto Kelland quotes Tarone as saying that IARC s evaluation of glyphosate is flawed and incomplete Except according to information provided by IARC Tarone is far from independent of Monsanto Tarone in fact has acknowledged that he is a paid consultant to Monsanto and a piece cited by Reuters and authored by Tarone last year in a European scientific journal is being recorrected to reflect Tarone s conflict of interest according to IARC which said it has been in communication with that journal But much more noteworthy than the errors is how selective the story is in pulling from the Blair deposition The story ignored Blair s many affirmations of research showing glyphosate connections to cancer and focused instead on Blair s knowledge of one unpublished research study that was

massive ongoing project by U S government researchers called the Agricultural Health Study includes hundreds of studies and years of data analyzing pesticide impacts on farmers Blair who retired from the National Cancer Institute in 2007 was not leading that research but was part of a team of scientists who in 2013 were analyzing data about pesticide use and the risk of non Hodgkin lymphoma The data specific to glyphosate did not show a connection to NHL but in working to publish a paper about all the data the group had gathered they decided to narrow the focus to insecticides and in 2014 did publish a paper on that work The data on glyphosate and NHL has yet to be published and some scientists who are familiar with the work say it has not tracked people long enough yet to be definitive given NHL generally takes 20 or more years to develop A prior compilation of data by AHS researchers that also showed no connection between glyphosate and NHL was published in 2005 and was considered by IARC But because the newer data was not published it was not considered by IARC Blair said the decision to limit the published work to insecticides was to make the data more manageable and was made well before IARC announced it would be looking at glyphosate in 2015 The rule is you only look at things that are published Blair told me this week after the Reuters story was published What would it be like if everyone on the working group whispered things they knew but weren t published and made decisions on that IARC confirmed it does not consider unpublished research In his deposition Blair states that nothing has changed his opinion about glyphosate and NHL Epidemiologist and University of Toronto scientist John McLaughlin who sat on the glyphosate working group for IARC with Blair said to me in a note this week that the information about the unpublished work written about by Reuters did not alter his view of the validity of IARC conclusion on glyphosate either

Reuters did not alter his view of the validity of IARC conclusion on glyphosate either Also left out of the Reuters story the deposition and a draft copy of the study in question shows that there were concerns about the AHS results due to relatively small subgroups of exposed cases And notably the Reuters report leaves out Blair s discussion of the North American Pooled Project in which he participated which also contains data related to glyphosate and NHL but is not favorable to Monsanto A synopsis of that project presented to the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology in 2015 showed that people who used glyphosate for more than five years had significantly increased odds of having NHL and the risk was also significantly higher for people who handled glyphosate for more than two days per year That information like the new AHS data was not given to IARC because it wasn t yet published When Dr Blair s deposition transcript is read in total it shows that nothing was wrongfully withheld from IARC said Plaintiffs attorney Aimee Wagstaff She said Monsanto was using pieces of the deposition to further its agenda in the media To epidemiologist Peter Infante who spent more than 20 years leading a cancer identification unit at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and analyzed a body of epidemiology research on glyphosate in testimony to an Environmental Protection Agency EPA Scientific Advisory Committee in December the attention drawn to unpublished data that supports Monsanto s position is much ado about nothing You still have other studies that show dose response he told me This Agricultural Health Study is not the gold standard For glyphosate and NHL they haven t been following people long enough Even if the data had been published and had been considered by IARC it would be in the context of all the other study results And finally in an odd exclusion the story fails to disclose that Kelland herself has at least

Monsanto Glyphosate Cancer Case Key Documents and Analysis and US Right to Know Sues EPA for Release of Glyphosate Documents By Carey Gillam The puzzle pieces are starting to fall into place but so far it s not a pretty picture A series of internal Monsanto Co documents revealed this week via a court order show that the company s long standing claims about the safety of its top selling Roundup herbicide do not necessarily rely on sound science as the company asserts but on efforts to manipulate the science Congressman Ted Lieu of California has called for an investigation by Congress and the Department of Justice to look into the matter and he is advising consumers to immediately stop using Roundup We need to find out if Monsanto or the Environmental Protection Agency misled the public Lieu said in a statement Hundreds of pages of emails and other records became part of a public court file this week over Monsanto objections after a federal judge in San Francisco ordered they would no longer be kept sealed despite potential embarrassment to Monsanto U S District Judge Vince Chhabria is overseeing more than 55 lawsuits brought by individuals filed by people from around the United States who allege that exposure to Monsanto s Roundup herbicide caused them or their loved ones to develop non Hodgkin lymphoma In addition to those cases which are moving forward jointly in what is known as multdistrict litigation MDL hundreds of other cases making similar claims are pending in state courts Questions about the key ingredient in Roundup a chemical called glyphosate have been circulating for years amid mounting research showing links to cancer or other diseases The International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2015 classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen and many international scientists have reported research that shows the chemical can have a range of harmful impacts on people The plaintiffs in the lawsuit allege that the combination of glyphosate with certain surfactants used in Monsanto branded Roundup products is even more toxic than glyphosate alone and Monsanto has sought to cover up that information Monsanto has denied that there are cancer connections to glyphosate or Roundup and says 40 years of research and scrutiny by regulatory agencies around the world confirm its safety On Wednesday a European Chemicals Agency s committee said its review found glyphosate is not a carcinogen Documents seem to show a company lessinterested in exploring mounting concerns about its products than in protecting the billions of dollars in

not fully agree with that determination Some of the panel members who reviewed the research said studies on glyphosate suggest a potential for glyphosate to affect cancer incidence The group said the EPA was improperly discounting the findings of some studies and many of the arguments put forth by the EPA as supporting glyphosate safety are not persuasive Real answers about the real impacts of Roundup on human health are long overdue considering the fact that glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the world and is commonly found in food and water and human urine samples The

bizarre response By Stacy Malkan The campaign for organic food is a deceitful expensive scam according to a Jan 19 Newsweek article authored by Dr Henry I Miller of the Hoover Institution If that name sounds familiar Henry I Miller it may be because the New York Times recently revealed a scandal involving Miller that he had been caught publishing an article ghostwritten by Monsanto under his own name in Forbes Thearticle which largely mirrored a draft provided to him by Monsanto attacked the scientists of the World Health Organization s cancer panel IARC for their decision to list Monsanto s top selling chemical glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen Reporting on an email exchange released in litigation with Monsanto over cancer concerns the Times Danny Hakim wrote Monsanto asked Mr Miller if he would be interested in writing an article on the topic and he said I would be if I could start from a high quality draft The article appeared under Mr Miller s name and with the assertion that opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own The magazine did not mention any involvement by Monsanto in preparing the article Forbes removed the story from its website on Wednesday and said that it ended its relationship with Mr Miller amid the revelations The opinion wire Project Syndicate followed suit after first adding a disclaimer to Miller s commentaries noting that they would have been rejected if his collaboration with Monsanto had been known Desperate to Disparage Organic The ghostwriting scandal has hardly slowed Miller down he has continued to spin promotional content for the agrichemical industry from outlets such as Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal without disclosing to readers his relationship with Monsanto Yet Miller s Newsweek hit on organic food has Monsanto s fingerprints in plain sight all over it For starters Miller uses pesticide industry sources to make unsubstantiated and ludicrous claims about organic agriculture for example that organic farming is actually more harmful to the environment than conventional agriculture or that organic allies spent 2 5 billion in a year campaigning against genetically engineered foods in North America The source on the latter inaccurate claim is Jay Byrne a former director of corporate communications for Monsanto not identified as such in the Newsweek article who now directs a PR firm called v Fluence Interactive Email exchanges reveal how Monsanto works with people like Jay Byrne and with Byrne specifically to push exactly this type of attack against Monsanto s foes while keeping

Residues in Foods Testing for residues of an herbicide developed by Monsanto Co that has been linked to cancer has turned up high levels in honey from the key farm state of Iowa adding to concerns about herbicide contamination that have triggered at least two lawsuits against honey industry players and prompted scrutiny by regulators The Food and Drug Administration began glyphosate residue testing in a small number of foods earlier this year after the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen in March 2015 The special assignment as the FDA refers to the testing project is the first time the FDA has ever looked for glyphosate residues in food though it annually tests foods for numerous other pesticides Research by FDA chemist Narong Chamkasem and John Vargo a chemist at the University of Iowa shows that residues of glyphosate the chief ingredient in Monsanto s branded Roundup herbicide have been detected at 653 parts per billion more than 10 times the limit of 50 ppb allowed in the European Union Other samples tested detected glyphosate residues in honey samples at levels from the low 20s ppb to over 123 parts per billion ppb Some samples had none or only trace amounts below levels of quantification Previous reports had disclosed glyphosate residues in honey detected as high as 107 ppb The collaborative work was part of an effort within FDA to establish and validate testing methodology for glyphosate residues According to recent reports there has been a dramatic increase in the usage of these herbicides which are of risk to both human health and the environment Chamkasem and Vargo stated in their laboratory bulletin Because there is no legal tolerance level for glyphosate in honey in the United States any amount could technically be considered a violation according to statements made in FDA internal emails obtained through Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests The Environmental Protection Agency may soon move to set a tolerance however The agency has set tolerance levels for glyphosate residues in many foods the EPA expects might contain residues of the weed killer When residue levels are detected above the tolerance levels enforcement action can be taken against the food producer EPA is evaluating the necessity of establishing tolerances for inadvertent residues of pesticides in

firm with the U S Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation there are currently at least 14 lawsuits filed by eight different law firms in six different federal courts across the country The lawsuits are all filed on behalf of plaintiffs who have been diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disorder and they allege exposure to Syngenta s weed killers made with a chemical called paraquat for the disease Several other cases making the same allegations are pending in state courts The cases are excellent candidates for coordinated pretrial proceedings because they arise from the same poisonous toxin causing the same crippling disease resulting from the wrongful conduct of the same three defendants the Fears Nachawati brief in support of its motion states Movant expects that the number of similar cases filed in state and federal courts across the country will expand rapidly The motion seeks transfer specifically to Judge Edward Chen in the U S District Court for the Northern District of California Majed Nachawati a partner with the Fears Nachawati firm said the firm was still investigating the size and scope of the overall litigation but believes the paraquat litigation against Syngenta will be significant and material in nature Very soon there is going to be litigation in dozens of federal courts across the country Nachawati said The plaintiffs lawyers will be seeking internal corporate documents as well as depositions of corporate officials related to the testing design labeling marketing and safety of paraquat herbicides along with corporate research and evaluations of the toxicity and safety of its paraquat products The Miller Firm of Virginia which helped lead the Roundup cancer litigation against Monsanto that resulted in an 11 billion settlement with Monsanto owner Bayer AG is among the law firms joining in the paraquat litigation The Miller firm supports the effort to consolidate the federal actions in California where thousands of Roundup cases were also consolidated for pretrial proceedings according to the firm s lead attorney Mike Miller We are confident that science strongly supports the causal connection between paraquat and the devastation of Parkinson s disease Miller said of the motion The Northern District of California is well equipped to handle these cases The cases against Syngenta also name Chevron Phillips Chemical Co as a defendant Chevron distributed and sold Gramoxone paraquat products in the United States starting with an agreement with a Syngenta predecessor called Imperial Chemical Industries ICI",

brain leading in advanced cases to severe physical debilitation and often dementia Many Parkinson s experts say the disease can be caused by a range of factors including exposure to pesticides such as paraquat as well as other chemicals Several scientific studies have linked paraquat to Parkinson s including a large study of U S farmers jointly overseen by multiple U S government agencies That 2011 research reported that people who used paraquat were twice as likely to develop Parkinson s disease as people who did not use it Numerous epidemiological and animal studies have linked paraquat to Parkinson s disease said Ray Dorsey a professor of neurology and director of the Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics at University of Rochester in New York Dorsey is also the author of a book about prevention and treatment of Parkinson s Disease The evidence linking paraquat to Parkinson s disease is probably the strongest of any pesticide commonly used he said Some studies have not found any clear links between paraquat and Parkinson s and Syngenta asserts that the most recent and authoritative research does not show a connection Indeed a study published in 2020 found connections between some other pesticides and Parkinson s but no strong evidence showing paraquat causes the disease Upcoming trial One case filed in a state court is scheduled to go to trial next month Hoffman V Syngenta is slated for trial May 10 in St Clair County Circuit Court in Illinois A status conference is scheduled for the end of this month Missouri lawyer Steve Tillery who is representing the

the United States are expected to be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes according to the National Cancer Institute For this year alone the American Cancer Society has estimated there will be more than 1 68 million people newly diagnosed with cancer and more than 600 000 deaths from cancer Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States One of the sinister twists to this creeping killer is that while we know the myriad types of cancers are caused by mutations to the DNA within cells pinpointing exactly what agent or actions triggered the deadly DNA changes that led to a specific cancer in a specific individual is not easy Researchers say there are an array of causes for cancer including an unhealthy diet obesity and alcohol intake Researchers also point to what they call environmental pollutants substances such asbestos arsenic benzene chromium and notably the pesticides that have become pervasive in our lives in recent decades and are used by farmers in food production Data from our Food and Drug Administration FDA and U S Department of Agriculture USDA show that foods we eat on a regular basis contain residues of hundreds of different pesticides tiny invisible traces of insecticides and weed killers in thousands of commonly consumed foods including fruits and vegetables We are also exposed to pesticides in our drinking water and through applications made to our parks and playgrounds lawns and gardens and schoolyards Pesticides are also often sprayed from the air across fields and forestry Research suggests a possible connection between pesticides and cancers such as non Hodgkin lymphoma multiple myeloma and prostate liver pancreatic lung and non melanoma skin cancers The American Academy of Pediatrics is so concerned that it is on record voicing its concerns about pesticides and ties to childhood cancers and has called for greater protections from exposures The Pesticide Action Network North America a consumer and environmental advocacy group says that evidence is growing ever stronger that pesticide exposure is a key contributor to what the organization calls a cancer epidemic Worldwide there are

reduce deaths from cancer we have to put more emphasis on preventing it in the first place and a big part of that primary prevention has to do with addressing environmental causes according to a 2016 report by the HHS National Toxicology Program NTP An important step in primary prevention the NTP states is to identify the carcinogens It is not a good sign that some members of Congress are now working to discredit and defund the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC an arm of the World Health Organization specifically charged with identifying and classifying potential carcinogens The actions by Republicans within the U S House of Representatives Committee on Science Space and Technology come after IARC angered Monsanto Co when it declared the pesticide glyphosate a key ingredient in Monsanto s weed killing products a probable carcinogen It is also not encouraging that President Trump nominated a pesticide safety advocate to oversee the Environmental Protection Agency s chemical safety division The nominee Michael Dourson has spent many years helping companies fight restrictions on potentially toxic chemicals It is heartening however that strong opposition and outrage over Dourson s nomination forced him to withdraw from consideration for the post on Wednesday Certainly we all know someone with cancer or someone who has had it But we cannot afford to become complacent to accept this as normal to allow politics to take precedence over public health We need to work harder to support the science that identifies carcinogens to encourage and fund research into alternatives to a toxic landscape and to hold our regulators and lawmakers accountable for enforcing protective measures that limit our exposures to environmental pollutants I lost a

the pesticide industry By Saheli Khastagir and Stacy Malkan In 2016 the American honey industry faced a crisis The U S Food and Drug Administration had found high levels of glyphosate an herbicide linked to cancer in honey samples from Iowa The FDA detected the weed killing chemical at up to 653 parts per billion ppb in honey more than 13 times the limit allowed in the European Union Consumer groups filed at least two lawsuits against the honey industry Internal emails shed light on what happened next The National Honey Board NHB a honey industry funded agency of the U S Department of Agriculture did what many businesses under fire have done They hired a crisis management public relations firm in this case to downplay the risks of glyphosate in honey The PR firm Porter Novelli later worked with the NHB to deflect concerns about honey containing neonicotinoids The insect killing chemicals are tied to the collapse of bee colonies At the same time Porter Novelli was working for Bayer a leading manufacturer of glyphosate and neonicotinoids The PR firm s work for Bayer included promoting the use of neonicotinoids and opposing regulations that would safeguard honey bees Porter Novelli s clientele has also included Dow Chemical a pesticide industry trade group and Growing Matters a coalition supported by Bayer Syngenta and BASF that defends neonics A conflict of interest The conflict of interest seems clear By allowing a pesticide industry PR firm to manage its public communications about pesticides in honey the NHB is using its brand to legitimize the continued use of bee harming pesticides and working against the three pillars it claims to promote namely that of bees honey and the environment When asked about this conflict the NHB said via email that the board exists to increase the consumption and promote the benefits of honey in the U S and that it does so in partnership with agencies who align with our mission and values NHB said it requires its partners to undergo a thorough process to ensure such alignment Porter Novelli the email implies fit the bill Crisis management playbook In the wake of the glyphosate in honey scandal the National Honey Board asked eight PR agencies for proposals for crisis response services according to minutes from a board meeting obtained by U S Right to Know via public records requests Honey board

extensive body of scientific evidence showing that neonics can harm and kill bees the insecticides are acutely toxic to bees can interfere with their ability to find food and also hurt their ability to reproduce Studies suggest the insecticides are threatening the entire food web The European Union banned some neonics in 2018 due to science showing a confirmed risk to bees Downplaying human health concerns The NHB statement also downplays growing concerns about the human health impacts of neonics Studies show the insecticides are toxic to the brain and nervous system They are commonly found in drinking water and in people About half the U S population is exposed to at least one neonic on a regular basis according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Children ages 3 5 years old had the highest levels Recent studies have found multiple neonicotinoids in the spinal fluid blood and urine of children The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that infants up to 1 year old are exposed through food and water to roughly 70 80 of the maximum acceptable limit for each of two neonics explains Jennifer Sass senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council She writes Had EPA evaluated the cumulative toxic impacts of all neonics together which it should have then exposure to infants would exceed EPA s acceptable limit Long history of defending pesticides

See regulatory docs on AltEn neonicotinoid problems Updated June 10 with state regulatory announcement about seed company clean up efforts An environmental catastrophe unfolding in Nebraska is drawing scrutiny from around the United States and sparking questions about why regulators were unwilling or unable to rein in years of questionable activities by the company known as AltEn LLC AltEn has been operating an ethanol plant in Mead Nebraska and advertising the plant site as a disposal facility for seeds coated in an array of pesticides known to be dangerous to humans and wildlife It has become a common practice by large seed companies such as Monsanto owner Bayer AG Syngenta Corteva and others to sell seeds for growing corn soy wheat and other crops that are coated with neonicotinoids and other chemicals designed to help the plants fight off insects and disease Disposing of unwanted supplies of these treated seeds can be costly and complicated so AltEn s eagerness to take in the coated seed was welcomed by the seed companies The companies say they believed AltEn would properly use and or dispose of the seeds and they were not aware of a contamination threat But the concentration of pesticide coated seeds being taken in at the AltEn site left the plant s wastewater and byproducts such as distillers grains contaminated with an pesticides at levels much higher than what is considered safe Now the area s water and soil is showing evidence of contamination Carol Blood a Nebraska state senator calls the situation an environmental catastrophe Fish die offs have been reported miles downstream from the plant and university researchers have reported the decimation of dozens of honeybee colonies while state officials have received reports of sick and dying geese and other birds See this May 29 2021 story in the Guardian As reported in the Guardian the contamination has been ongoing for years There have been accidental spills and leaks of the plant s pesticide laden waste which has been stored in poorly maintained lagoons and piled into hills of a putrid lime green mash called wet cake The company had also distributed the waste to area farmers for spreading across fields as soil conditioner It was only earlier this year after the Guardian exposed the problems that state officials ordered the plant to close and began clean up efforts In February roughly a month after the revelations about the dangers of the AltEn plant s practice of using pesticide treated seeds Nebraska state regulators ordered the plant closed The Nebraska Attorney General s office

flawed See Carey Gillam s article in The Guardian Corporate studies asserting herbicide safety show many flaws new analysis finds July 2 2021 In this post we provide links to the 53 once secret studies and related materials Questions about the safety of glyphosate based herbicides GBHs have persisted for years as scientific research has split over whether or not the widely used weed killing chemical introduced by Monsanto in the 1970s causes cancer or other human health problems A number of independent studies show links between glyphosate herbicides and cancer and other health problems leading the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2015 to classify glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen But Monsanto purchased by Bayer AG in 2018 has maintained glyphosate is not carcinogenic nor does it cause other health problems when used as directed Other large chemical companies that sell glyphosate or related products echo Monsanto s safety assurances Regulators in Europe and the United States Canada and elsewhere have affirmed the corporate assertions of glyphosate safety They point to decades of tests conducted by or for the companies that have not been published but which regulators have reviewed as well as published studies in the scientific literature The corporate studies have long been kept secret even by regulators But in Europe litigation by a group of European Parliament lawmakers led to the release of dozens of such studies A consumer advocacy group SumOfUs provided more than 50 studies to two independent scientists for review Armen Nersesyan and Siegfried Knasmueller both from the Institute of Cancer Research Department of Medicine at the Medical University of Vienna Knasmueller the lead author is an expert in genetic toxicology and along with his work at the cancer institute is editor in chief of two prominent scientific journals including Mutation Research Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis The goal of the evaluation was to determine if the industry studies examined comply with current international guidelines for chemical testing The studies are those concerning the genotoxic properties of glyphosate The resulting analysis was released July 2 2021 and concluded that the bulk of the industry studies were outdated and did not meet current guidelines An array of shortcomings and flaws were found in the studies rendering most of them unreliable according to the analysis In fact of the 53 studies submitted to regulators by the companies only two were acceptable under current internationally recognized scientific standards said Knasmueller Knasmueller said there are more reliable methods for detecting carcinogens but those were not used in the industry tests Read the evaluation here

reauthorization in Europe and trying to fight against calls for restrictions and bans on glyphosate across the globe In June 2021 the European Union s EU Assessment Group on Glyphosate AGG issued an 11 000 page draft report concluding that glyphosate is safe when used as directed and does not cause cancer The finding is based in part on a dossier of roughly 1 500 studies submitted to European regulators by the Glyphosate Renewal Group GRG a collection of companies that includes Bayer Bayer confirmed that the older studies were included in the new dossier given to European regulators but said the GRG was required to submit all genotoxicity studies that have been conducted including those submitted in past registration review cycles The company said the dossier also includes new genotoxicity studies conducted since the previous re approval of glyphosate and a vast review of thousands of published scientific publications regarding glyphosate The companies are seeking the renewal of the EU authorization of glyphosate Current authorization in Europe expires in December 2022 The companies say they also gave regulators a literature review of around 12 000 published

both criticism and support from a mix of scientists who reviewed the work Here are two comments Paul Demers director of the Occupational Cancer Research Centre Ontario Health in Canada The classification of the carcinogenicity of glyphosate has been particularly contentious with international bodies disagreeing not only on areas of interpretation but even on which studies to consider The critical evaluation using the latest OECD criteria of 53 studies submitted to Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung and European Food Safety Authority is a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate on the carcinogenicity of glyphosate The observation by the authors that few of these studies met the OECD criteria should be considered by regulatory authorities tasked with protecting workers and the public Personally I agree with the approaches for evaluation taken by the International Agency for Research on Cancer which were used for glyphosate That said I also believe that there needs to room for scientific debate and disagreements on issues of interpretation criteria for evaluation and even what studies to include However there should not be a debate on transparency when it comes to

of the U S Environmental Mutagen Society An analysis of the experimental data supporting the safety of any chemical should be conducted using systematic review methodology which takes into account not only the completeness of the information but also categorizes the risk of bias whether positive or negative Clearly this was not conducted by EFSA or by Dr Knasmueller In general it is not appropriate to disregard all studies that do not meet current standards but rather to consider the results in terms of their limitations Overall It seems to me that Knasmueller is selective i e exhibits bias in what he presents and does not present At the same time I would fault EFSA for not doing due diligence in what they considered Also I agree that there is a suggestion that glyphosate is linked to the induction of oxidative stress which can result in DNA damage i e oxidative stress is one of the key characteristics of carcinogens but would be expected to have a threshold below which damage is not

Researcher says the EPA has disregarded substantial evidence that the popular herbicide is linked to cancer This article was originally published in Environmental Health News By Carey Gillam A little more than a month ahead of a first ever federal trial over the issue of whether or not Monsanto s popular weed killers can cause cancer a new analysis raises troubling questions about the U S Environmental Protection Agency s EPA handling of pertinent science on glyphosate safety According to the report which examines the opposing positions taken by the EPA and an international cancer research agency on glyphosate based herbicides the EPA has disregarded substantial scientific evidence of genotoxicity associated with weed killing products such as Roundup and other Monsanto brands Genotoxicity refers to a substance s destructive effect on a cell s genetic material Genotoxins can cause mutations in cells that can lead to cancer The EPA classifies glyphosate as not likely to be carcinogenic while the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC which is part of the World Health Organization classifies it as probably carcinogenic The paper was authored by Charles Benbrook a former research professor who served at one time as executive director of the National Academy of Sciences board on agriculture and was published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe on Monday It is based on Benbrook s review of EPA and IARC records regarding the types and numbers of glyphosate studies each organization evaluated Clearly compared to EPA s genotoxicity review the IARC review is grounded on more recent more sensitive and more sophisticated genotoxic studies and more accurately reflects real world exposures Benbrook told EHN Benbrook testified as an expert witness in the first lawsuit to go to trial against Monsanto over claims its glyphosate herbicides cause cancer The plaintiff in that case Dewayne Lee Johnson won a unanimous jury award of 289 million last year that the judge in the case cut to 78 million Thousands of additional cancer victims have sued Monsanto and the second trial begins Feb 25 in federal court in San Francisco Benbrook is also expected to testify for the plaintiff in that case Monsanto is seeking to exclude Benbrook s testimony at trial saying he has no expertise in any physical science or field of medicine and no training or degree in toxicology and has never worked at the EPA or other regulatory body The EPA did not respond to a request for comment The agency has maintained however that its review of glyphosate has been robust and thorough Glyphosate has low toxicity for humans and glyphosate products can be safely used by following directions on labeled products according to the EPA In the new analysis Benbrook is critical of

following directions on labeled products according to the EPA In the new analysis Benbrook is critical of the EPA s scrutiny of glyphosate herbicides noting that little weight was given to research regarding the actual formulations sold into the marketplace and used by millions of people around the world Instead the EPA and other regulators have mostly pointed to dozens of studies paid for by Monsanto and other companies selling glyphosate herbicides that found no cancer concerns The EPA has given little attention to several independent research projects that have indicated the formulations can be more toxic than glyphosate alone according to Benbrook Indeed the EPA only started working in 2016 some 42 years after the first glyphosate herbicides came to market with the U S National Toxicology Program to evaluate the comparative toxicity of the formulations Early results disclosed in 2018 supported concerns about enhanced toxicity in formulations Several scientists including from within the EPA s Office of Research and Development ORD and from a panel of scientific experts convened by the EPA have cited deficiencies and problems with the EPA s decision to classify glyphosate as not likely to be carcinogenic to humans But Benbrook s analysis is the first to look deeply at how and why the EPA and IARC drew such divergent conclusions Benbrook looked at the citations for genotoxicity tests discussed in the EPA and IARC reports both those that were published in peer reviewed journals and the unpublished ones that were presented to the EPA by Monsanto and other companies Some studies looked at glyphosate alone and or glyphosate based herbicide formulations and some included findings about a substance called aminomethylphosphonic acid AMPA which is glyphosate s primary metabolite Benbrook s analysis found that within the body of available evidence the EPA relied on 151 studies 115 of which showed negative results meaning no evidence of genotoxicity and only 36 that had positive results IARC cited 191 studies only 45 of which showed negative results and 146 of which showed evidence of genotoxicity IARC said within these studies it found strong evidence that exposure to glyphosate or glyphosate based formulations is genotoxic Benbrook s analysis reports that over the last three years at least 27 additional studies have been published addressing possible mechanisms of genotoxic action for glyphosate and or formulated glyphosate based herbicides and all but one of the 27 studies reported one or more positive result There

on chemical impact to human health Newly published scientific papers illustrate the ubiquitous nature of the weed killing chemical glyphosate and a need to better understand the impact exposure to the popular pesticide may be having on human health including the health of the gut microbiome In one of the new papers researchers from the University of Turku in Finland said that they were able to determine in a conservative estimate that approximately 54 percent of species in the core of the human gut microbiome are potentially sensitive to glyphosate The researchers said they used a new bioinformatics method to make the finding With a large proportion of bacteria in the gut microbiome susceptible to glyphosate the intake of glyphosate may severely affect the composition of the human gut microbiome the authors said in their paper which was published this month in the Journal of Hazardous Materials The microbes in the human gut include a variety of bacteria and fungi and are believed to impact immune functions and other important processes Unhealthy gut microbiomes are believed by some scientists to contribute to a range of diseases Although data on glyphosate residues in human gut systems are still lacking our results suggest that glyphosate residues decrease bacterial diversity and modulate bacterial species composition in the gut the authors said We may assume that long term exposure to glyphosate residues leads to the dominance of resistant strains in the bacterial community The concerns about glyphosate s impact on the human gut microbiome stem from the fact that glyphosate works by targeting an enzyme known as 5 enolpyruvylshikimate 3 phosphate synthase EPSPS This enzyme is critical to the synthesizing of essential amino acids To determine the actual impact of glyphosate on the human gut microbiota and other organisms further empirical studies are needed to reveal glyphosate residues in food to determine the effects of pure glyphosate and commercial formulations on microbiomes and to assess the extent to which our EPSPS amino acid markers predict bacterial susceptibility to glyphosate in in vitro and real world scenarios the authors of the new paper concluded In addition to the six researchers from Finland one of the authors of the paper is affiliated with the department of biochemistry and biotechnology at Rovira i Virgili University Tarragona Catalonia in Spain The consequences for human health are not determined in our study However based on previous studies we know that alterations in the human gut microbiome may be

Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Roundup herbicides and hundreds of other weed killing products sold around the world It was introduced as a weed killer by Monsanto in 1974 and grew to become the most widely used herbicide after Monsanto s introduction in the 1990s of crops genetically engineered to tolerate the chemical Residues of glyphosate are commonly found on food and in water Consequently residues are also often detected in the urine of people exposed to glyphosate through either diet and or application U S regulators and Monsanto owner Bayer AG maintain there are no human health concerns with glyphosate exposure when the products are used as intended including from residues in the diet The body of research contradicting those claims is growing however The research on the potential impacts of glyphosate on the gut microbiome is not nearly as robust as the literature associating glyphosate to cancer but is an area many scientists are probing In a somewhat related paper published this month a team of researchers from Washington State University and Duke University said that they had found a correlation between the levels of bacteria and fungi in the gastrointestinal tracts of children and the chemicals found in their homes The researchers did not look at glyphosate specifically but were alarmed to find that children with higher levels of common household chemicals in their bloodstream showed a reduction in the amount and diversity of important bacteria in their gut Glyphosate in urine An additional scientific paper published this month underscored a need for better and more data when it comes to glyphosate exposure and children The paper published in the journal Environmental Health by researchers from the Institute for Translational Epidemiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York is the outcome of a literature review of multiple studies reporting actual values of glyphosate in people The authors said they analyzed five studies published in the last two years reporting glyphosate levels measured in people including one study in which urinary glyphosate levels were measured in children living in rural Mexico Of 192 children living in the Agua Caliente area 72 91 percent had detectable levels of glyphosate in their urine and all of the 89 children living in Ahuacapán Mexico had detectable levels of the pesticide in their urine Even when including additional studies overall there is sparse data regarding glyphosate levels in people Studies", "chunk_id":

people including one study in which urinary glyphosate levels were measured in children living in rural Mexico Of 192 children living in the Agua Caliente area 72 91 percent had detectable levels of glyphosate in their urine and all of the 89 children living in Ahuacapán Mexico had detectable levels of the pesticide in their urine Even when including additional studies overall there is sparse data regarding glyphosate levels in people Studies globally total only 4 299 people including 520 children the researchers said The authors concluded that it is not currently possible to understand the potential relationship between glyphosate exposure and disease especially in children because data collection on exposure levels in people is limited and not standardized They noted that despite the lack of solid data about the impacts of glyphosate on children the amount of glyphosate residues legally allowed by U S regulators on food has increased dramatically over the years There are gaps in the literature on glyphosate and these gaps should be filled with some urgency given the large use of this product and its ubiquitous presence said author Emanuela Taioli Children are especially vulnerable to environmental carcinogens and tracking exposure to products such as glyphosate in children is a pressing public health priority according to the authors of the paper As with any chemical there are multiple steps involved in evaluating risk which include gathering information about human exposures so that the levels that produce harm in one population or animal species can be compared to typical exposure levels the authors wrote However we have previously shown that data on human exposure in workers and the general population are very limited Several other gaps in knowledge exist around this product for example results on its genotoxicity in humans are limited The continued debate regarding the effects of glyphosate exposure makes establishing exposure levels in the general public a pressing public health issue especially for the most vulnerable The authors said monitoring of urinary glyphosate levels should be conducted in the general population We continue to suggest that inclusion of glyphosate as a measured exposure in nationally representative studies like the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey will allow for a better understanding of the risks that glyphosate may pose and allow for better monitoring of those who are most likely to be exposed and those who are more susceptible to the exposure they wrote", "chunk_id":

Scientific Mischief The other shoe just dropped Four months after the publication of a batch of internal Monsanto Co documents stirred international controversy a new trove of company records was released early Tuesday providing fresh fuel for a heated global debate over whether or not the agricultural chemical giant suppressed information about the potential dangers of its Roundup herbicide and relied on U S regulators for help More than 75 documents including intriguing text messages and discussions about payments to scientists were posted for public viewing early Tuesday morning by attorneys who are suing Monsanto on behalf of people alleging Roundup caused them or their family members to become ill with non Hodgkin lymphoma a type of blood cancer The attorneys posted the documents which total more than 700 pages on the website for the law firm Baum Hedlund Aristei Goldman one of many firms representing thousands of plaintiffs who are pursuing claims against Monsanto More than 100 of those lawsuits have been consolidated in multidistrict litigation in federal court in San Francisco while other similar lawsuits are pending in state courts in Missouri Delaware Arizona and elsewhere The documents which were obtained through court ordered discovery in the litigation are also available as part of a long list of Roundup court case documents compiled by the consumer group I work for U S Right to Know It was important to release the documents now because they not only pertain to the ongoing litigation but also to larger issues of public health and safety while shedding light on corporate influence over regulatory bodies according to Baum Hedlund attorneys Brent Wisner and Pedram Esfandiary This is a look behind the curtain said Wisner These show that Monsanto has deliberately been stopping studies that look bad for them ghostwriting literature and engaging in a whole host of corporate malfeasance They Monsanto have been telling everybody that these products are safe because regulators have said they are safe but it turns out that Monsanto has been in bed with U S regulators while misleading European regulators Esfandiary said public dissemination of the documents is important because regulatory agencies cannot properly protect public and environmental health without having accurate comprehensive and impartial scientific data and the documents show that has not been the case with Monsanto s Roundup herbicide and the active ingredient glyphosate Monsanto did not respond to a request for comment Several of the documents discuss

unseal several other discovery documents over Monsanto s objections and those documents prompted a wave of outrage for what they revealed questionable research practices by Monsanto cozy ties to a top official within the U S Environmental Protection Agency and indications that Monsanto may have engaged in ghostwriting of research studies that appeared to be independent of the company The revelations within those documents prompted an investigation by the EPA s Office of Inspector General into possible Monsanto EPA collusion and roiled Europe where regulators now are trying to decide whether or not to reauthorize glyphosate which is the most widely used herbicide in the world and is found in numerous products in addition to Roundup The lawyers said they are sending copies of the

attorneys against unfairly publicizing certain documents It is unclear how Judge Chhabria will react if at all to the law firm s release of these documents Baum Hedlund attorneys said they notified Monsanto on June 30 of their intent to unveil the 86 documents and gave Monsanto the legally required 30 day window to formally object That period expired Monday clearing the way for them to make the

research is adding worrisome evidence to concerns that the widely used weedkilling chemical glyphosate may have the potential to interfere with human hormones In a paper published in the journal Chemosphere titled Glyphosate and the key characteristics of an endocrine disruptor A review a trio of scientists concluded that glyphosate appears to have eight out of ten key characteristics associated with endocrine disrupting chemicals The authors cautioned however that prospective cohort studies are still needed to more clearly understand the impacts of glyphosate on the human endocrine system The authors Juan Munoz Tammy Bleak and Gloria Calaf each affiliated with the University of Tarapacá in Chile said their paper is the first review to consolidate the mechanistic evidence on glyphosate as an endocrine disrupting chemical EDC Some of the evidence suggests that Roundup Monsanto s well known glyphosate based herbicide can alter the biosynthesis of the sexual hormones according to the researchers EDCs may mimic or interfere with the body s hormones and are linked with developmental and reproductive problems as well as brain and immune system dysfunction The new paper follows publication earlier this year of an assortment of animal studies that indicated glyphosate exposures impact reproductive organs and threaten fertility Glyphosate is the world s most widely used herbicide sold in 140 countries Introduced commercially in 1974 by Monsanto Co the chemical is the active ingredient in popular products such as Roundup and hundreds of other weed killers used by consumers municipalities utilities farmers golf course operators and others around the world Dana Barr a professor at Emory University s Rollins School of Public Health said the evidence tends to overwhelmingly indicate that glyphosate has endocrine disrupting properties It s not necessarily unexpected since glyphosate has some structural similarities with many other endocrine disrupting pesticides however it is more concerning because glyphosate use far surpasses other pesticides said Barr who directs a program within a National Institutes of Health funded human exposure research center housed at Emory Glyphosate is used on so many crops and in so many residential applications such that aggregate and cumulative exposures can be considerable Phil Landrigan director of the Global Observatory on Pollution and Health and a professor of biology at Boston College said the review pulled together strong evidence that glyphosate is an endocrine disruptor The report is consistent with a larger body of literature indicating that glyphosate has a wide range of adverse health effects findings that overturn Monsanto s long standing portrayal of glyphosate as a benign chemical with no negative impacts on human health said Landrigan EDCs have been a subject of concern since the 1990s after a series of publications suggested that some chemicals commonly used

concern since the 1990s after a series of publications suggested that some chemicals commonly used in pesticides industrial solvents plastics detergents and other substances could have the capacity to disrupt connections between hormones and their receptors Scientists generally recognized ten functional properties of agents that alter hormone action referring to these as ten key characteristics of endocrine disruptors The ten characteristics are as follows EDC s can Alter hormone distribution of circulating levels of hormones Induce alterations in hormone metabolism or clearance Alter the fate of hormone producing or hormone responsive cells Alter hormone receptor expression Antagonize hormone receptors Interact with or activate hormone receptors Alter signal transduction in hormone responsive cells Induce epigenetic modifications in hormone producing or hormone responsive cells Alter hormone synthesis Alter hormone transport across cell membranes The authors of the new paper said a review of the mechanistic data showed that glyphosate met all of the key characteristics with the exception of two Regarding glyphosate there is no evidence associated with the antagonistic capacity of hormonal receptors they said As well there is no evidence of its impact on hormonal metabolism or clearance according to the authors Research over the last few decades has largely focused on links found between glyphosate and cancer particularly non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL In 2015 the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a

Environmental Health News Parks should be for playing not pesticides By Carey Gillam Two New York City council members introduced legislation today that would ban city agencies from spraying glyphosate based herbicides and other toxic pesticides in parks and other public spaces The move is the latest in a groundswell of concern over pesticide use particularly exposures to weed killing products developed by Monsanto which is now a unit of Bayer AG Cities school districts and suppliers across the U S are increasingly halting use of the pesticides It is also a further sign that a growing number of people consumers educators business leaders and others are rejecting assurances from Monsanto and Bayer that glyphosate herbicides such as Roundup are safe for widespread use Bayer has recently taken out large advertisements in the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times and has been running television and Internet ad campaigns to defend the safety of its weed killing

city parks without having to worry that they are being exposed to toxic pesticides that could give them and their families cancer The New York City measure would prohibit the application of synthetic pesticides within 75 feet of a natural body of water And it would encourage city agencies to move to the use of biological pesticides which are derived from naturally occurring substances rather than synthetic substances Glyphosate is commonly used in New York City sprayed hundreds of times a year onto public greenspaces to treat weeds and overgrowth Kallos told EHN he fears letting his young

they have the potential to become malignant and even in noncancerous stages they have the potential to be harmful to other organs Monsanto discounted the findings arguing that the tumors were unrelated to treatment and showing false positives and the company provided additional data to try to convince the EPA to discount the tumors But EPA toxicology experts were unconvinced EPA statistician and toxicology branch member Herbert Lacayo authored a February 1985 memo outlining disagreement with Monsanto s position A prudent person would reject the Monsanto assumption that Glyphosate dosing has no effect on kidney tumor production Lacayo wrote Glyphosate is suspect Monsanto s argument is unacceptable Eight members of the EPA s toxicology branch including Lacayo and Dykstra were worried enough by the kidney tumors in mice that they signed a consensus review of glyphosate in March 1985 stating they were classifying glyphosate as a Category C oncogen a substance possibly carcinogenic to humans Research rebuttal That finding did not sit well with Monsanto and the company worked to reverse the kidney tumor concerns On April 3 1985 George Levinskas Monsanto s manager for environmental assessment and toxicology noted in an internal memorandum to another company scientist that the company had arranged for Dr Marvin Kuschner a noted pathologist and founding dean of the medical school at the State University of New York at Stony Brook to review the kidney tissue slides Kushner had not yet even accessed the slides but Levinskas implied in his memo that a favorable outcome was assured Kuschner will review kidney sections and present his evaluation of them to EPA in an effort to persuade the agency that the observed tumors are not related to glyphosate Levinskas wrote Notably Levinskas who died in 2005 was also involved in efforts in the 1970s to downplay damaging findings from a study that found rats exposed to Monsanto s PCBs developed tumors

the mice those that had not received glyphosate No one had noted such a tumor in the original report The finding was highly significant because it provided a scientific basis for a conclusion that the tumors seen in the mice exposed to glyphosate were not noteworthy after all Additionally Monsanto provided the EPA with an October 1985 report from a pathology working group that also rebutted the finding of the connection between glyphosate and the kidney tumors seen in the 1983 study The pathology working group said spontaneous chronic renal disease was commonly seen in aged mice Monsanto provided the report to the EPA stamped as a trade secret to be kept from the prying eyes of the public The EPA s own scientists still did not agree however An EPA pathologist wrote in a December 1985 memo that additional examination of the tissue slides did not definitively reveal a tumor in the control group Still the reports by the outside pathologists brought into the debate by Monsanto helped push the EPA to launch a reexamination of the research And by February 1986 an EPA scientific advisory panel had dubbed the tumor findings equivocal saying that given the tumor identified in the control group by some pathologists the overall incidences of tumors in the animals given glyphosate were not statistically significant enough to warrant the cancer linkage The panel did say there may be reason for concern and noted that the tumor incidences seen in the mice given glyphosate were unusual The advisory panel told the EPA the studies should be repeated in hopes of more definitive findings and that glyphosate be classified into what the agency at that time called Group D not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity The EPA asked Monsanto for a repeat of the mouse oncogenicity study but Monsanto refused to do so The company argued there is no relevant scientific or regulatory justification for repeating the glyphosate mouse oncogenicity study Instead the company provided

resources and tie up valuable laboratory space Feds fold The discussions between Monsanto and the EPA dragged on until the two sides met in November 1988 to discuss the agency s request for a second mouse study and Monsanto s reluctance to do so Members of the EPA s toxicology branch continued to express doubts about the validity of Monsanto s data but by June of 1989 EPA officials conceded stating that they would drop the requirement for a r epeated mouse study By the time an EPA review committee met on June 26 1991 to again discuss and evaluate glyphosate research the mouse study was so discounted that the group decided that there was a lack of convincing carcinogenicity evidence in relevant animal studies The group concluded that the herbicide should be classified far more lightly than the initial 1985 classification or even the 1986 classification proposed by the advisory panel This time the EPA scientists dubbed the herbicide a Group E chemical a classification that meant evidence of non carcinogenicity for humans At least two members of the EPA committee refused to sign the report stating that they did not concur with the findings In a memo explaining the decision agency officials offered a caveat They wrote that the classification should not be interpreted as a definitive conclusion that the agent will not be a carcinogen under any circumstances Despite the EPA s ultimate conclusion the mouse study was among those cited by IARC for classifying glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen Indeed many other animal studies have similarly had questionable results including a 1981 rat study that showed an increase in incidences of tumors in the testes of male rats and possible thyroid carcinomas in female rats exposed to glyphosate and a

damning truth of glyphosate based herbicides link to cancer This article was originally published in The Guardian By Carey Gillam It was a verdict heard around the world In a stunning blow to one of the world s largest seed and chemical companies jurors in San Francisco have told Monsanto it must pay 289m in damages to a man dying of cancer which he claims was caused by exposure to its herbicides Monsanto which became a unit of Bayer AG in June has spent decades convincing consumers farmers politicians and regulators to ignore mounting evidence linking its glyphosate based herbicides to cancer and other health problems The company has employed a range of tactics some drawn from the same playbook used by the tobacco industry in defending the safety of cigarettes to suppress and manipulate scientific literature harass journalists and scientists who did not parrot the company s propaganda and arm twist and collude with regulators Indeed one of Monsanto s lead defense attorneys in the San Francisco case was George Lombardi whose resumé boasts of his work defending big tobacco Now in this one case through the suffering of one man Monsanto s secretive strategies have been laid bare for the world to see Monsanto was undone by the words of its own scientists the damning truth illuminated through the company s emails internal strategy reports and other communications The jury s verdict found not only that Monsanto s Roundup and related glyphosate based brands presented a substantial danger to people using them but that there was clear and convincing evidence that Monsanto s officials acted with malice or oppression in failing to adequately warn of the risks Testimony and evidence presented at trial showed that the warning signs seen in scientific research dated back to the early 1980s and have only increased over the decades But with each new study showing harm Monsanto worked not to warn users or redesign its products but to create its own science to show they were safe The company often pushed its version of science into the public realm through ghostwritten work that was designed to appear independent and thus more credible Evidence was also presented to jurors showing how closely the company had worked with Environmental Protection Agency officials to promote the safety message and suppress evidence of harm The jury paid attention throughout this long trial and clearly understood the science and also understood Monsanto s role in trying to hide the truth said Aimee Wagstaff one of several attorneys around the US who are representing other

more in future trials Monsanto maintains it has done nothing wrong and that the evidence has been misrepresented Its attorneys say they have the bulk of scientific research firmly on their side and

43 3 billion Fueled by consumer choice organic is the future of farming the OTA said in a statement touting the conference which runs May 23 May 27 Still the industry acknowledges that future is

country in a federal courtroom in California a group of consumer and environmental lawyers and nonprofit groups are raising a red flag in the face of the USDA push to grow the organic sector Corners

synthetic chemicals in compost in organic production The Center for Environmental Health the Center for Food Safety and Beyond Pesticides sued Vilsack and other USDA officials last year for issuing a guidance document in 2010 that radically changed organic requirements Under the new provision organic producers can use compost materials that have been treated with synthetic pesticides that otherwise are banned from organic use Under the changes introduced by USDA organic producers can use materials such as lawn trimmings that have been contaminated with synthetic pesticides as compost feedstocks for their crops Compost contaminated with an insecticide known as bifenthrin and other pesticides are now allowed the lawsuit alleges This flouts a key appeal of organics the idea that synthetic pesticides have little to no place in production the groups argue And the agency violated the law by failing to give public notice or allow for public comment as they created this loophole the groups allege Organic consumers are being misled and can no longer rely on the organic label to ensure the food they purchase is produced without synthetic pesticides in agricultural inputs the

up their bid for organic integrity or at least not to try to get in their way But on May 2 OTA asked to participate in the case not on the side of the consumer advocates but against them In its filing OTA along with California Certified Organic Farmers CCOF have joined with Western Growers Association WG which represents farmers responsible for roughly a third of fresh U S organic produce to oppose the consumer protection groups over the compost issue The OTA and other industry groups are arguing that if the USDA provision allowing for synthetic pesticides in compost is thrown out by the court organic practices would be severely unsettled The groups say in court filings that it would be analytically and economically impossible to demonstrate all compost is free of each synthetic chemical substance prohibited in organic crop production They say a sudden elimination of the compost provision could lead to costly civil litigation and many growers organic certifications would be directly at risk Unwinding the USDA s professional and responsible approach to a complex subject would be extremely disruptive the organic groups say The plaintiffs counter that such claims of disruptive consequences are a red herring An erosion of organic standards may help expand production and meet consumer demands but such a path could make for a slippery slope and an ultimate demise of the draw organics hold These environmental values and specifically not supporting pesticide dependent agriculture are a major driver to why consumers pay the premium to buy organic foods their filing states Thursday s hearing in San Francisco will take up pending cross motions for summary judgment in the case Meanwhile back in Washington the OTA will be marking advocacy day fanning out through Capitol

scientific studies have linked paraquat to Parkinson s including a large study of U S farmers jointly overseen by multiple U S government agencies Farmers use paraquat in the production of many crops including corn soy and cotton The Agricultural Health Study AHS said it found that exposure to agricultural pesticides may increase a person s risk of developing Parkinson s disease In 2011 AHS researchers reported that participants who used paraquat or rotenone were twice as likely to develop Parkinson s disease as people who didn t use these chemicals A more recent paper from AHS researchers stated that Extensive literature suggests an association between general pesticide use and Parkinson s disease PD However with few exceptions little is known about associations between specific pesticides and PD Parkinson s is an incurable progressive nervous system disorder that limits a person s ability to control movement causing tremors loss of balance and eventually often leaving victims bedridden and or bound to a wheelchair The disease is not necessarily fatal but typically becomes severely debilitating Dutch neurologist Bastiaan Bloem who recently authored a book about Parkinson s blames widespread exposure to herbicides such as paraquat along with other toxic chemicals used in agriculture and manufacturing for the spread of the disease Acutely toxic Along with fears about links between paraquat and Parkinson s paraquat is also known to be an extremely acutely toxic chemical that can quickly kill people who ingest very small amounts In Europe the sale of paraquat has been banned since 2007 but in the United States the pesticide is sold as a Restricted Use Pesticide due to acute toxicity As part of discovery in the Parkinson s litigation lawyers

review process and on August 2 2021 the agency said paraquat would remain on the market with new safety measures aimed at reducing farmworker exposures That followed the Oct 23 2020 release of a proposed interim decision PID for paraquat The interim decision proposed mitigation measures to reduce human health and ecological risks identified in the agency s 2019 draft human health and ecological risk assessments Several organizations in September 2021 petitioned the 9th U S Circuit Court of Appeals asking for the court to review and set aside the EPA s decision The petitioners

Action Network North America Center for Biological Diversity and Toxic Free North Carolina The groups claim the EPA is violating the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act The EPA had indicated it would likely ban most aerial spraying of paraquat but after industry lobbying efforts the agency said it would allow such use with restrictions around residential areas The EPA said that through collaboration with the National Toxicology Program at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences the agency completed a thorough review of the scientific information on paraquat and Parkinson s Disease and concluded that the weight of evidence was insufficient to link paraquat to Parkinson s disease The agency published this Systematic Review of the Literature to Evaluate the

year however state candidates received about 30 percent of contributions to candidates from PACs for employees of Bayer which is headquartered in Leverkusen Germany and Corteva which is based in

less than 25 000 to state and local candidates During the election cycles ending in 2020 2022 and 2024 those contributions totaled between 70 000 and 144 000 per cycle The Corteva employee PAC gave

scientific literature and regulatory conclusions regarding cancer links to glyphosate and glyphosate based herbicides show a mix of findings making the safety of the herbicide a hotly debated subject While Bayer has maintained that glyphosate is safe when used correctly scientific research has linked exposure to non Hodgkin lymphoma Also in 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans In comments for the company s 2023 annual report executives reported that the company s performance is suffering because of significant losses in legal judgments Bayer s provision for the glyphosate litigation totaled 6 3 billion as of Dec 31 2023 from lawsuits over Roundup Bayer s stock price is down 37 percent in the last year The Washington Post reported this year that Bayer has lobbied the U S Congress to pass the Agricultural Labeling Uniformity Act which would prohibit states and local governments from imposing labeling requirements on pesticides that differ from federal labeling requirements The Post reported that the federal legislation aims to prevent local governments and courts from being able to penalize or hold liable any entity for failing to comply with rules for pesticide warnings that differ substantially from what the federal government already mandates In Iowa one of these bills was initially presented by Bayer s representatives as an innocuous labeling bill but upon further examination turned out to be a measure that would provide complete immunity for any chemical companies in all

money to Republican candidates by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1 Over eight years employee PACs for Bayer Corteva Syngenta FMC and BASF have donated 62 percent of federal candidate contributions to Republican candidates and 38 percent to Democrats according to an analysis of FEC data through Oct 17 For federal candidates the PACs gave Democrats 2 3 million during that period and Republicans 3 7

the fight over the bill Faux said because Iowa has a number of farmers involved in lawsuits over paraquat the bill was amended so that Syngenta s liabilities would remain but that liabilities for other companies particularly Bayer would be limited Legislators changed the exemption from liability in the bill to exclude ChemChina Syngenta That was a very very telling move Faux said because it was clear that this legislation is for the benefit of the particular company By that particular company he meant Bayer Faux said he was disappointed to hear some of the names of the legislators who

particularly targeted by the employee PAC for Syngenta which makes paraquat a pesticide that has produced nearly 6 000 lawsuits nationwide Also Syngenta s U S headquarters is in Greensboro N C As for the recipients of contributions Wimberley said that a lot of those names are the big names We have a decent number of legislators in North Carolina who are also farmers she said and they are involved in Big Ag Here are the North Carolina legislators who have received contributions from a pesticide company employee PAC Texas Texas politicians received 25 000 contributions from BASF and other pesticide company employee PACs in the last session A bill search of legislation introduced in the last session failed to turn up any pesticide related legislation Rob Faux communications director of the Pesticide Action Network said that limitations on use of the ester formulations found in herbicides may come up in the state Here is the list of donations in Texas", "chunk_id":

book is available from Island Press Whitewash The Story of a Weed Killer Cancer and the Corruption of Science Whitewash received the 2018 Rachel Carson Environmental Book Award from the Society of Environmental Journalists and a 2018 Gold Medal Award from the Independent Publishers Based on 20 years of research and scores of internal industry documents Whitewash is a hard hitting investigation into the most widely used agrichemical in history For decades glyphosate has been lauded as the chemical that s safe enough to drink but a growing body of scientific research ties glyphosate to cancers and a host of other health and environmental threats Whitewash is a must read says Booklist Kirkus Reviews calls Whitewash a hard hitting eye opening narrative and a forceful argument for an agricultural regulatory environment that puts public interest above corporate profits The Society for Environmental Journalists book review describes Whitewash as a gutsy compelling read from beginning to end especially for readers who enjoy the kind of hard nosed shoe leather reporting that used to be the hallmark of great journalism Q Carey you ve been reporting on pesticides and Monsanto for nearly 20 years As a journalist why was it important to write a book about the topic Why now A Health experts around the world recognize that pesticides are a big contributor to a range of health problems suffered by people of all ages but a handful of very powerful and influential corporations have convinced policy makers that the risks to human and environmental health are well worth the rewards that these chemicals bring in terms of fighting weeds bugs or plant diseases These corporations are consolidating and becoming ever more powerful and are using their influence to push higher and higher levels of many dangerous pesticides into our lives including into our food system We have lost a much needed sense of caution surrounding these chemicals and Monsanto s efforts to promote increased uses of glyphosate is one of the best examples of how this corporate pursuit of profits has taken priority over protection of the public Q People may not be familiar with the term glyphosate or even Roundup What is it Why should people care A Roundup herbicide is Monsanto s claim to fame Well before it brought genetically engineered crops to market Monsanto was making and selling Roundup weed killer Glyphosate is the active ingredient the stuff that actually kills the weeds in Roundup Glyphosate is also now used in hundreds of other products that are routinely applied to farm fields lawns and gardens golf courses parks and playgrounds The trouble is that it s not nearly as safe as Monsanto has maintained and decades of scientific research link it to a range of

while promoting more and more use Monsanto s genetically engineered crops are all built to encourage glyphosate use The key genetic trait Monsanto has inserted into its GMO soybeans corn canola sugar beets and other crops is a trait that allows those crops to survive being sprayed directly with glyphosate After Monsanto introduced these glyphosate tolerant crops in the mid 1990s glyphosate use skyrocketed Like other pesticides used in food production glyphosate residues are commonly found in food including cereals snacks honey bread and other products Q You write that Whitewash shows we ve forgotten the lessons of Rachel Carson and Silent Spring What do you mean by that A Carson laid out the harms associated with indiscriminate use of synthetic pesticides and she predicted the devastation they could and would bring to our ecosystems She also accused the chemical industry of intentionally spreading disinformation about their products Her book was a wake up call that spurred an environmental movement and led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency But over the decades since the general population and certainly our politicians and regulators have clearly forgotten the need for caution and scrutiny in dealing with these pesticides and the companies that profit from them You see a push by our political leaders for fewer regulations for more unchecked use of glyphosate and other pesticides in our food production while research about how these pesticides cause cancer how they harm children s brain development and how they alter reproductive health all get pushed aside Q You obtained industry communications and regulatory documents that reveal evidence of corporate influence in regulatory agencies like the EPA Does the evidence you uncovered take on new significance in light of the current political climate in the US How can people keep regulatory agencies accountable for working in the public s best interest A Yes it s quite clear that Monsanto and other corporate giants like Dow Chemical enjoy significant sway with regulators the very people who are supposed to be protecting the public The companies use their money and political

Times as well as scientists academics and others who delve too deeply into the secrets they want to keep hidden I see it as a badge of honor that Monsanto and others in the chemical industry feel threatened enough by our work to attack us It s certainly not easy for journalists in particular to challenge the corporate propaganda machine Reporters that go along with the game repeat the talking points and publish stories that support corporate interests are rewarded with coveted access to top executives and handed exclusive stories about new products or new strategies all of which score them bonus points with editors In contrast reporters who go against the grain who report on unflattering research or who point out failures or risks of certain products often find they lose access to key corporate executives The competition gets credit for interviews with top corporate chieftains while reporters who don t play the game see their journalistic skills attacked and insulted and become the subject of persistent complaints by the corporate interests to their editors What can be done Editors and reporters alike need to check their backbones realize that the job of a journalist is to find

particular conversation or story that stands out to you A I ve interviewed thousands of people over my career from very big name political types to celebrities to every day men and women and I find it s always those who are most unassuming those regular folk who grab my heart In researching this book the individual story that most resonated with me is that of Teri McCall whose husband Jack suffered horribly before dying of cancer the day after Christmas in 2015 The McCall family lived a quiet and rather simple life raising avocadoes and assorted citrus fruits on their Cambria California farm using no pesticides other than Roundup in their orchards Jacks death from non Hodgkin lymphoma a type of cancer linked to glyphosate fully devastated Teri and her children and grandchildren She has shown so much grace and strength and she gave me so much of her time and her tears in telling me Jack s story She is a woman I truly admire Of course there are so many others I have learned from who I feel for including the scientists who have struggled to publish research who have been censored or worse for their findings of harm associated with glyphosate and other pesticides And farmers I have so much regard for farmers generally including each and every one interviewed for this book The work they do to raise our food is incredibly challenging and they are on the front lines of the

Whitewash A A writer at the New York Times told me after reading Whitewash that she feared eating anything in her refrigerator because of the information the book provides about the range of pesticide residues found in so many food products That definitely is not my goal to frustrate or frighten people But I do hope that readers will be moved to care more about how our food is produced how we make use of dangerous synthetic pesticides not just on farms but also on schoolyards and in parks where our children play And I hope they will want to be engaged in the larger discussion and debate about how we build a future that adequately balances the risks and rewards associated with these pesticides As Whitewash shows the current system is designed to pump up corporate profits much more than it is to promote long term environmental and food production sustainability There are many powerful forces at work to keep the status quo to continue to push dangerous pesticides almost literally down our throats It s up to the rest of us to push back Carey Gillam is a veteran journalist researcher and writer with more than 25 years of experience covering corporate America A former senior

interesting A new court filing made on behalf of dozens of people claiming Monsanto Co s Roundup herbicide gave them cancer includes information about alleged efforts within the Environmental Protection Agency to protect Monsanto s interests and unfairly aid the agrichemical industry The filing made late Friday by plaintiff s attorneys includes what the attorneys represent to be correspondence from a 30 year career EPA scientist accusing top ranking EPA official Jess Rowland of playing your political conniving games with the science to favor pesticide manufacturers such as Monsanto Rowland oversaw the EPA s cancer assessment for glyphosate the key ingredient in Monsanto s weed killing products and was a key author of a report finding glyphosate was not likely to be carcinogenic But in the correspondence longtime EPA toxicologist Marion Copley cites evidence from animal studies and writes It is essentially certain that glyphosate causes cancer Attorneys for the plaintiffs declined to say how they obtained the correspondence which is dated March 4 2013 The date of the letter comes after Copley left the EPA in 2012 and shortly before she died from breast cancer at the age of 66 in January 2014 She accuses Rowland of having intimidated staff to change reports to favor industry and writes that research on glyphosate the key ingredient in Monsanto s Roundup shows the pesticide should be categorized as a probable human carcinogen The International Agency for Research on Cancer an arm of the World Health Organization declared as much that glyphosate was a probable human carcinogen in March 2015 after reviewing multiple scientific studies Monsanto has rejected that classification and has mounted a campaign to discredit IARC scientists The communication if authentic could be an explosive development in the snowballing multi district litigation that now comprises more than 60 plaintiffs from around the United States accusing Monsanto of covering up evidence that Roundup herbicide could cause cancer The plaintiffs all of whom are suffering from non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL or lost a loved one to NHL have asserted in recent court filings that Monsanto wielded significant influence within the EPA s Office of Pesticide Programs OPP and had close ties specifically to Rowland who until last year was deputy division director within the health effects division of the OPP Rowland managed the work of scientists who assessed human health effects of exposures to pesticides like glyphosate and he chaired the EPA s Cancer Assessment

that the IARC classification of glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen is not relevant to the question of whether or not Roundup caused the plaintiffs cancers IARC s approach is less rigorous than EPA s in evaluating scientific evidence and IARC s conclusions are scientifically unreliable according to the brief Monsanto told the court that neither the views of IARC or EPA are necessarily relevant to the general causation issue of the litigation because plaintiffs will need to present admissible expert testimony showing the company s products in fact caused their cancers As the

Efforts To Slow Herbicide Review Came In Coordination With Monsanto Newly released government email communications show a persistent effort by multiple officials within the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to slow a separate federal agency s safety review of Monsanto s top selling herbicide Notably the records demonstrate that the EPA efforts came at the behest of Monsanto and that EPA officials were helpful enough to keep the chemical giant updated on their progress The communications most of which were obtained through Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests show that it was early 2015 when the EPA and Monsanto began working in concert to stall a toxicology review that a unit tied to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC was conducting on glyphosate the key ingredient in Monsanto s branded Roundup herbicide products The details revealed in the documents come as Monsanto is defending itself against lawsuits alleging that it has tried to cover up evidence of harm with its herbicides The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ATSDR a federal public health agency that along with the CDC is part of the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS is charged with evaluating the potential adverse human health effects from exposures to hazardous substances in the environment So it made sense for the ATSDR to take a look at glyphosate which is widely used on U S farms residential lawns and gardens school playgrounds and golf courses Glyphosate is widely used in food production and glyphosate residues have been found in testing of human urine The ATSDR announced in February 2015 that it planned to publish a toxicological profile of glyphosate by October of that year But by October that review was on hold and to this date no such review has yet been published Update the draft review was finally published in April 2019 The documents reveal this was no accident no bureaucratic delay but rather was the result of a collaborative effort between Monsanto and a group of high ranking EPA officials For Monsanto the timing of the ATSDR review was worrisome In March 2015 the World Health Organization s International Agency for

came in at 3 28 p m Dykes reminded Jones that they had recently discussed the HHS ATSDR glyphosate review at a meeting You were not aware of their review Did you learn anything more about their efforts Dykes asked Jones did not waste time Roughly an hour later he forwarded the message to OPP Director Jack Housenger writing Monsanto thinks atsdr is doing a glyphosate Assessment Could you guys run that down Housenger responds quickly Yes Jess checked with them It has been difficult to get information Within an hour Jones instructed a member of his staff to get him contact information for

Monsanto s outreach to EPA on the issue but instead questioned whether this is a good use of government resources for ATSDR to continue with its review Breysse responded that he would look into this and Housenger thanked him for his quick response Breysse then reached out to an ATSDR division director named James Stephens to arrange a discussion about the EPA request May 21 2015 James Stephens wrote back to Patrick Breysse that the ATSDR team thought the EPA work overlaps but isn t totally duplicative and stated that the ASTDR team has not been able to see draft copies of the EPA s work I think we would all welcome further discussion with EPA but would hope to use it to help us find out more about what they are doing he told Breysse After hearing from Stephens Breysse wrote back to Housenger saying ATSDR staff would be in touch to discuss Housenger replied with his reiteration that the ATSDR review would be a duplicative government effort and that the EPA draft would be out in July of 2015 As of this writing that EPA preliminary risk assessment still has not been released though in 2016 the EPA did release a cancer assessment report that declared glyphosate was not likely to cause cancer June 4 2015 Pressing the issue EPA s Housenger wrote again to Breysee to say he had not heard from anyone yet The ATSDR s Stephens wrote back promising to make sure someone gives you a ring Internal Monsanto emails show that at the same time Monsanto was also pushing the duplicative narrative with HHS meeting on June 4 with HHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Health Mitchel Wolfe to ask him to help repudiate the IARC classification and to recognize that a review of glyphosate was not the primary role for his agency Dr Wolfe said he would follow up on what was going on with ATSDR and he was encouraged to have discussions with EPA staff as well a Monsanto memo detailing the meeting states June 9 2015 Henry Abadin an ATSDR supervisory scientist reported to Stephens

not believe it was duplicating efforts Nevertheless he said he told EPA we did not have a problem with putting the glyphosate profile on hold pending the OPP final report June 19 2015 To further ensure the ATSDR review didn t move forward Monsanto s Dykes talked again with HHS s Wolfe asking for an update on ATSDR I explained our question was about the purpose and scope of such a duplicative review by ATSDR I also told him that we were concerned that ATSDR may come out any day with a report I again stressed that we were concerned that they were even reviewing glyphosate as were the people we talked with at EPA Dykes wrote to colleagues June 21 2015 It was a Sunday but Monsanto s Dykes was still concerned enough about the ATSDR review to copy multiple colleagues on a late night email to report that he had continued to press the duplicative point with ATSDR but was concerned about a glyphosate review coming any day In a text message sent that same day Monsanto scientist Eric Sachs reached out to a former EPA toxicologist named Mary Manibusan asking for contacts at ATSDR We re trying to do everything we can to keep from having a domestic IARC occur w this group may need your help Sachs wrote The text messages were among certain internal Monsanto records obtained by cancer victims who are suing Monsanto alleging Roundup caused their diseases June 23 2015 By Tuesday Monsanto s Jenkins had good news He had heard from Housenger that the EPA official had been successful in garnering a promise from ATSDR to put its report on hold The review was not dead however he wrote ATSDR argues that their process is distinguishable and not duplicative They look at different endpoints and told EPA they don t make a call on cancer but I think we should continue to be cautious On June 24 2015 Monsanto s chief scientist William Heydens responded Distinguishable and not duplicative Seriously And I will believe the not making a call on cancer part when I see it Anyway

other issues He reported he had been told ATSDR was VERY conservative and IARC like By October 23 2015 EPA and Monsanto had the ATSDR review fully on hold EPA s Housenger wrote to update Monsanto s Jenkins They are waiting for our glyphosate RA And they agreed to share what they do That same month the EPA s Cancer Assessment Review Committee CARC which was chaired by Rowland issued an internal report stating that contrary to IARC the EPA s review of glyphosate found it not likely to be carcinogenic to humans The EPA still has yet to issue the overall new risk assessment it said would be out in 2015 The agency has offered ever changing timelines for the assessment but now says its intends to release a draft risk assessment sometime this year That will be followed by a 60 day public comment period After the public comment period the EPA will determine whether any risk management is needed In the meantime Monsanto has cited the EPA s backing of glyphosate safety as repudiation of the IARC finding both in court and with regulators in Europe who are also looking at glyphosate safety issues The EPA did not respond to a request for comment about its efforts to delay the ATSDR report or communications with Monsanto regarding that effort But Brent Wisner a lawyer representing many of the cancer victims who are suing Monsanto said the documents offer damning evidence of improperly close ties between the EPA and the chemical company I think it s very clear that EPA officials and Monsanto employees worked together to accomplish a goal of stopping that analysis at ATSDR That is collusion I don t know what else you d call that said Wisner For its part the ATSDR said this week that the review it started in 2015 is not complete but that it anticipates a draft glyphosate toxicological profile to be issued for public comment by the end of this year A spokesperson for the agency declined to discuss the circumstances surrounding the delay in the review And Jones whose

in court show that Monsanto provided Kate Kelland with the documents for her June 2017 story about Aaron Blair and gave her a slide deck of talking points the company wanted covered For more details see Carey Gillam s Roundup Trial Tracker post The following analysis was prepared by Carey Gillam and posted June 28 2017 A June 14 2017 Reuters article authored by Kate Kelland headlined The WHO s cancer agency left in the dark over glyphosate evidence wrongly accused a cancer scientist of withholding important data in the safety assessment of glyphosate conducted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC Kelland s story contains factual errors and states conclusions that are contradicted by a full reading of the documents she cited as primary sources It is notable that Kelland provided no link to the documents she cited making it impossible for readers to see for themselves how far she veered from accuracy in interpreting them The primary source document clearly contradicts the premise of Kelland s story Additional documents her story referenced but also did not link to can be found at the end of this post Background The Reuters story was one in a series of critical pieces the news agency has published about IARC that Kelland wrote after IARC classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen in March 2015 Glyphosate is a highly profitable chemical herbicide used as the main ingredient in Monsanto s Roundup weed killing products as well as hundreds of other products sold around the world The IARC classification triggered mass litigation in the United States brought by people alleging their cancers were caused by Roundup and prompted the European Union and U S regulators to deepen their evaluation of the chemical In response to the IARC classification and as a means of defending itself against the litigation and shoring up regulatory support Monsanto has lodged multiple complaints against IARC seeking to undermine IARC s credibility The June 14 Kelland story which quoted a top Monsanto strategy executive furthered those strategic efforts and has been touted by Monsanto and others in the chemical industry as proof that the IARC classification was flawed Consider A deposition of scientist Aaron Blair a draft abstract and email communication Kelland references in her story as court documents were not in fact court documents but were documents created and obtained as part of discovery in the multidistrict litigation brought by the cancer victims who are suing Monsanto The documents were held in the possession of Monsanto

obtained through the court as Kelland s story implies it seems apparent Monsanto or surrogates planted the storyline and provided Kelland with the documents or at least selected parts of the documents along with its assessment of them Kelland s article provides commentary and an interpretation of the deposition from Bob Tarone whom Kelland describes as independent of Monsanto Yet information provided by IARC establishes that Tarone has acted as a paid consultant to Monsanto on its efforts to discredit IARC Reuters teased the story with this statement The scientist leading that review knew of fresh data showing no cancer link but he never mentioned it and the agency did not take it into account Kelland implied that Dr Blair was intentionally hiding critical information Yet the deposition shows that Blair testified that the data in question was not ready to submit to a journal for publication and would not be allowed for consideration by IARC because it had not been finished and published Much of the data was gathered as part of a broad U S Agricultural Health Study and would have been added onto several years of previously published information from the AHS that showed no association between glyphosate and non Hodgkin lymphoma A Monsanto lawyer questioned Blair about why the data wasn t published in time to be considered by IARC saying You decided for whatever reason that that data was not going to be published at that time and therefore was not considered by IARC correct Blair replied No Again you foul up the process What we decided was the work that we were doing on these different studies were not yet were not yet ready to submit to journals Even after you decide to submit them to journals for review you don t decide when it gets published Blair

data from the unfinished unpublished AHS was not statistically significant page 173 of deposition Blair also testified in that deposition about data showing strong connections between glyphosate and
