Yet in order to give meaningful suggestions to further support this, we first need to speak candidly about the old paradigm. It appears that there are factions within the [world's power elite](https://www.WantToKnow.info/051115secretsocietiesbilderberg) which still desire to exert as much control as possible over the world. **Their primary means for establishing control are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life.** When these factions gain greater power and control, our freedoms and liberties are [increasingly taken away](https://www.WantToKnow.info/resources#unconstitutional), sometimes without our even realizing it. Fear is used as a powerful tool of control by these factions of the global elite. \"The terrorists want to kill us all. Your job, home, and retirement are no longer secure. You are either for us or against us. We might be attacked at any time.\" All of these messages [push us towards fear](https://www.WantToKnow.info/powerofnightmares). And by encouraging us to focus blame on others such as terrorists and \"evil\" leaders, the global power brokers push us away from feeling in control of our lives and towards the role of powerless victims, so that we look to them for protection. The more we slip into fear and being victims, the easier it is for us to be manipulated. Secrecy leads to control through preventing the exposure of hidden agendas, and through breeding distrust, suspicion, and paranoia in the world. In the name of \"national security,\" we have been told ever more frequently that we should [not know what is happening](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secrecygraham) behind closed doors in government. Yet we are encouraged to keep vigilant watch over our neighbors, over those who question the government, and over those who look or act different from us, as they could secretly be terrorists in sheep's clothing. **Rampant suspicion and secrecy cause us to lose touch with the common humanity we share with all around us.** Polarization leads to \"us vs. them\" ways of thinking. Divide and conquer is a tactic that has been used successfully by the power elite of the world for centuries. As long as people focus on blaming and attacking \"the enemy,\" they are not likely to look for the deeper causes of their problems. Controlling factions of the power elite work to keep public and [media attention](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediacorruption) focused on issues which divide us into two polarized camps, so that their greatest concerns of [power and control](https://www.WantToKnow.info/divinewisdomunderstanding) go unnoticed. The power brokers then control both sides of the divided public by assuring that corporate ownership of the media and key candidates from all political parties support their deeper power and polarization agendas, which often involve [war profiteering](https://www.WantToKnow.info/warcoverup).

A final subtle, yet powerful method of gaining control is to distract people from their purpose in life. Consider that television, radio, and movies have been filled with ever more greed, violence, and empty sex. Our educational system has increasingly prioritized passing tests over developing intelligence and creativity. Excessive corporate control of the media has [limited what news we receive](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediainformation#censored), and often shaped our decisions and the way we think. **Our attention has been subtly diverted from our deeper purpose in life to the more superficial attractions of sex, consumerism, and money.** When we succumb to fear, secrecy, and polarization, and when we lose touch with our sense of purpose in life, elements of the global elite are able to exert ever more control over our lives and world. **The New Paradigm** What can we do about all this? Ultimately, it is the collective fear, secrecy, polarization, and loss of purpose within all of us that has allowed leaders to take power who would subvert democracy, and who would take away our freedoms and liberties. **By each one of us making a commitment to work on these issues both inside of ourselves and out in the world - and to inspire others to do the same - we are changing our collective direction and building a solid foundation for a new paradigm.** Several actions can help us to take firm steps in that direction. **Develop purpose and intentions for your life.** To live full, rich lives in today's complex world, it's vitally important to give your life clear direction by exploring what is deepest and most meaningful to you, and by [developing life purpose](https://www.WantToKnow.info/lifepurposeintentions) and intentions based on this. Then choose to live your intentions and follow your purpose to the best of your ability every day. By choosing to live with clear direction and focus, life becomes deeper and more meaningful. This then weakens the seduction of consumerism and media hype which distract us from our purpose, and allows us to more effectively focus on creating a new paradigm. **Choose to transform fear into acceptance and love.** When we notice ourselves feeling fear, we can trace the roots of that fear, so that we are able to [identify our core challenges](https://www.WantToKnow.info/coreissue) and deal more consciously with them. We can open to guidance from friends, teachers, and spiritual sources in helping us to move from fear to [acceptance and understanding](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife2#acceptance).

We can open to guidance from friends, teachers, and spiritual sources in helping us to move from fear to [acceptance and understanding](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife2#acceptance). We can also transform our fears through welcoming the ever-present love of our divine creator, and the love that lies always deep within our own hearts, and in the hearts of those around us. In doing this, we begin to recognize fear as an invitation to growth. Become aware of when you are playing the role of victim, and choose instead to **take personal responsibility for creating a new paradigm**. In blaming others for our problems, we often avoid taking responsibility for how much we are involved in creating these problems through the choices we make. Whenever we catch ourselves playing the role of victim by blaming others (including the power elite) for everything that's wrong in our lives, we can choose to take a [look inside ourselves](https://www.WantToKnow.info/g/victim_or_creator_vs), and to explore and take responsibility for our role in what's happening. By focusing less on blaming others, and more on improving ourselves, every one of us can make a difference both in our lives and in our world. **Avoid secrecy and encourage openness and transparency.** An important way we can do this is to work together to [inform friends and colleagues](https://www.WantToKnow.info/spreadtheword) about the major cover-ups being hidden from the public. Then in our personal lives, when we notice ourselves keeping information from others, we can examine our motives for this secrecy. Are we withholding information out of our own self-interest, or because this is really [what's best](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife2) for all involved? And on a deeper level, where are we avoiding being honest with ourselves? **Move beyond polarization and the focus on \"good vs. evil\" and \"us vs. them.\"** Consider the possibility that all of us are doing what we believe to be right based upon our beliefs, circumstances, and upbringing. Each of us has [a place in our heart](https://www.momentoflove.org/) that wants only to love and be loved. As we focus less on blaming and judging \"them\" and more on [supporting the highest motive](https://www.WantToKnow.info/transformation#nurturance) in all people - including members of the power elite - we increasingly come to see that we are all one human family, and that we can choose to transform our world by working together for the good of all. **And finally, come together in groups and communities **to support each other in making these positive changes.

Let us do all that we can to [stop destructive behaviors](https://www.WantToKnow.info/youcanhelp) of the global power elite. Yet let us not overly focus on changing the outside world without first having a solid internal foundation, lest we fall into blaming others, and into the polarizing \"us vs. them\" ways which only further divide us. By reminding ourselves that the most powerful change starts inside each one of us, we can develop more balance and strength to then work towards positive change out in the world. **As we change ourselves from the inside out, we send ripples of inspiration and healing out into the world.

After much consideration, I've decided to install LOVE. Can you guide me through the process? Tech Support: Yes, I can help you. Are you ready to proceed? Customer: Well, I'm not very technical, but I think I'm ready to install it now. What do I do? Tech Support: The first step is to open your HEART. Have you located your HEART? Customer: Yes, I have, but there are several other programs running right now. Is it okay to install while they are running? Tech Support: What programs are running? Customer: Let's see... I have PAST-HURT.EXE, LOW-ESTEEM.EXE, GRUDGE.EXE, and RESENTMENT.EXE running now. Tech Support: No problem. LOVE will gradually erase PAST-HURT.EXE from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs. LOVE will eventually overwrite LOW-ESTEEM.EXE with a module of its own called HIGH-ESTEEM.EXE. However, you have to completely turn off GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.EXE. Those programs prevent LOVE from being properly installed. Can you turn those off? Customer: I don't know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how? Tech Support: My pleasure. Go to your Start menu and invoke FORGIVENESS.EXE. Do this as many times as necessary until it's erased the programs you don't want. Customer: Okay, now LOVE has started installing itself automatically. Is that normal? Tech Support: Yes. You should receive a message that says it will stay installed for the life of your HEART. Do you see that message? Customer: Yes, I do. Is it completely installed? Tech Support: Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need to begin connecting to other HEARTs in order to get the upgrades. Customer: Oops. I have an error message already. What should I do? Tech Support: What does the message say? Customer: It says, \"ERROR 412-PROGRAM NOT RUN ON INTERNAL COMPONENTS.\" What does that mean? Tech Support: Don't worry, that's a common problem. It means that the LOVE program is set up to run on external HEARTs but has not yet been run on your HEART. It is one of those complicated programming things, but in non-technical terms it means you have to \"LOVE\" your own machine before it can \"LOVE\" others. Customer: So what should I do? Tech Support: Can you pull down the directory called \"SELF-ACCEPTANCE\"? Customer: Yes, I have it. Tech Support: Excellent. You're getting good at this. Now, click on the following files and then copy them to the \"MYHEART\" directory: FORGIVE-SELF.DOC, REALIZE-WORTH.TXT, and ACKNOWLEDGE-LIMITATIONS.DOC.

A [CBS News report](https://www.WantToKnow.info/corruptiongovernmentmilitary) quotes former U.S. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, \"According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.\" That's $8,000 for every man, woman and child in America.

We were made for these times. I have heard from so many recently who are deeply and properly bewildered. They are concerned about the state of affairs in our world now. Ours is a time of almost daily astonishment and often righteous rage over the latest degradations of what matters most to civilized, visionary people. ** You are right in your assessments. The lustre and hubris some have aspired to while endorsing acts so heinous against children, elders, everyday people, the poor, the unguarded, the helpless, is breathtaking. Yet, I urge you, ask you, gentle you, to please not spend your spirit dry by bewailing these difficult times. Especially do not lose hope. Most particularly because, the fact is that we were made for these times. Yes. For years, we have been learning, practicing, been in training for and just waiting to meet on this exact plain of engagement. I grew up on the Great Lakes and recognize a seaworthy vessel when I see one. Regarding awakened souls, there have never been more able vessels in the waters than there are right now across the world. And they are fully provisioned and able to signal one another as never before in the history of humankind. Look out over the prow; there are millions of boats of righteous souls on the waters with you. Even though your veneers may shiver from every wave in this stormy roil, I assure you that the long timbers composing your prow and rudder come from a greater forest. That long-grained lumber is known to withstand storms, to hold together, to hold its own, and to advance, regardless. In any dark time, there is a tendency to veer toward fainting over how much is wrong or unmended", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070825soullightshinebright.txt:0:b2a72182e5de", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7827, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070825soullightshinebright.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070825soullightshinebright", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "are millions of boats of righteous souls on the waters with you.

That long-grained lumber is known to withstand storms, to hold together, to hold its own, and to advance, regardless. In any dark time, there is a tendency to veer toward fainting over how much is wrong or unmended in the world. Do not focus on that. There is a tendency, too, to fall into being weakened by dwelling on what is outside your reach, by what cannot yet be. Do not focus there. That is spending the wind without raising the sails. We are needed, that is all we can know. And though we meet resistance, we more so will meet great souls who will hail us, love us and guide us, and we will know them when they appear. Didn't you say you were a believer? Didn't you say you pledged to listen to a voice greater? Didn't you ask for grace? Don't you remember that to be in grace means to submit to the voice greater? **Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good. What is needed for dramatic change is an accumulation of acts, adding, adding to, adding more, continuing. We know that it does not take everyone on Earth to bring justice and peace, but only a small, determined group who will not give up during the first, second, or hundredth gale. One of the most calming and powerful actions you can do to intervene in a stormy world is to stand up and show your soul. Soul on deck shines like gold in dark times. The light of the soul throws sparks, can send up flares, builds signal fires, causes proper matters to catch fire. To display the lantern of soul in shadowy times like these-to be fierce and to show mercy toward others; both are acts of immense bravery and greatest necessity. Struggling souls catch light from other souls who are fully lit and willing to show it. If you would help to calm the tumult, this is one of the strongest things you can do. ** There will always be times when you feel discouraged. I too have felt despair many times in my life, but I do not keep a chair for it. I will not entertain it.

I too have felt despair many times in my life, but I do not keep a chair for it. I will not entertain it. It is not allowed to eat from my plate. The reason is this: In my uttermost bones I know something, as do you. It is that there can be no despair when you remember why you came to Earth, who you serve, and who sent you here. The good words we say and the good deeds we do are not ours. They are the words and deeds of the One who brought us here. In that spirit, I hope you will write this on your wall: When a great ship is in harbor and moored, it is safe, there can be no doubt. But that is not what great ships are built for.

Now it's time to find your father.\" When I participated in a retreat with my Mom in 1991, those were the last words the facilitator spoke to me. Find my father? What did he mean by that? Somehow I knew healing my relationship with Dad was vital, but how to go about it was another story. At the time the gulf between us seemed insurmountable, and I did not take the facilitator's words to heart. **My feelings of being criticized and rejected by Dad were my deepest wound.** Before he was 30, my father fought in World War II, became a doctor, and married my mother. Their first two children were girls, and then I, the final one, plopped out. I can imagine my father's excitement about having a son, someone to guide from boyhood to manhood, to continue the family name, someone to be proud of, perhaps even someone to follow in his footsteps. In my early years I was the apple of his eye, and he was my knight in shining armor. We played sports and games, and often went fishing together. As adolescence approached, however, it became abundantly clear that my feet were hell bent on following another path - any path but his! In school I was having behavioral problems. I was feeling all kinds of difficult feelings about myself and my life, feelings that I needed help sorting out and understanding. I expressed my inner angst by becoming a class clown and rebel, defying any and all rules. To my credit, I was very creative and original in my acting out. I also displayed signs of brilliance", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070924findinghealingwithfather.txt:0:c55b14debaf9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7832, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070924findinghealingwithfather.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070924findinghealingwithfather", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "that my feet were hell bent on following another path - any path but his!

I expressed my inner angst by becoming a class clown and rebel, defying any and all rules. To my credit, I was very creative and original in my acting out. I also displayed signs of brilliance in the subjects I was interested in. But when report card time rolled around, I was filled with dread. Having my parents read those things was a very traumatic experience for me. Sometimes I was punished. I got more upset each time my parents' disapproving magnifying glass was focused on my poor grades and attention getting schemes. I responded by doing more things that would bring me disapproval and punishment. **Eventually, I learned that I would be treated less harshly if I punished myself, so my inner critic was born.** My parents saw me being hard on myself, and so eased up on me. Self-reproach is a great protection plan, and being skilled in guilt and self-criticism was a large part of the shadow side of our family tradition. **My dad had no idea how to deal with me. He grew silent and distant, erecting a wall and pretending that he didn't care. That was even more painful to me than my mother's voiced disapproval. I hated him for that, and expressed my anger just as covertly, by also pretending that I didn't want anything to do with him. We lived under the same roof, but we were a thousand miles away from each other. ** I continued to have trouble with school until the time I chose to drop out and pursue my interests in music and metaphysics. I became totally focused on my spiritual growth, the quest for enlightenment, and God - a fact that sent shivers through my father's mind. My father, somewhat of an atheist, had given birth to a son who was thumbing his nose at intellectual, practical concerns, and doing the \"God\" thing. While I don't believe my spiritual searching was simply an expression of my war with my father, he sure took it that way. There were many hard feelings between us, feelings that hardened into cement as time went by. For much of my twenties, I went about my life without much of a relationship with my dad. We had stopped trying to change each other, but the walls remained, thick and cold between us. We had both written off the relationship as incapable of improvement. Things all began changing four years after that facilitator told me it was time to deal with Dad.** Finally taking the facilitator's advice, I wrote my father the below letter, and he wrote one back.** Two", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:070924findinghealingwithfather.txt:1:a8a78816ccaf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7833, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "070924findinghealingwithfather.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "070924findinghealingwithfather", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "of my twenties, I went about my life without much of a relationship with my dad.

Dear Dad, I have been thinking a lot about you these days, and I want you to know my thoughts. It seems to me that **in my pain, confusion and my struggle to define myself as someone separate from you, I rejected you entirely, along with everything you stood for. Lately I've been seeing that in my rebellion, I have set aside a part of myself that has not been allowed to develop and that can make me a more whole person inside.** I have come to regret that rebellious side of my personality and I am setting out to make changes. You tried to teach me, by your example, how to be a disciplined, reliable provider for oneself and for a family. You showed me how to live safely in the world, with a sense of security and structure. You modeled success in ways that I did my best not to emulate. And I am feeling very sorry about that. It was as if I turned away from your most powerful way of showing me that you loved me - the way you lived your life. Dad, I can sense that my work in the world, my relationships with women and my sense of self-esteem are all affected by this stance. I am working diligently in my life to develop within myself the qualities you tried to pass one to me. Ouch! It's hard for a thirty-two year old with Peter Pan Syndrome to become an adult. But my life does depend on it. Dad, you are a part of me, and it's time I stopped resisting that and started accepting and working with the gifts you have given me. You have passed on to me a legacy of character traits that are my missing link in my development as a person. **I love you, Dad. I don't want to wait until you are on your deathbed, or until you are gone, to feel and to express that. **You have given me so much. I want you to know, as late as it may be, that I am beginning to receive and to learn from you and your life. Growing up is a scary thing, but I'm getting there!

Your son, Scott Sending the letter felt like a huge, but necessary risk. How would he respond to such a baring of my soul? I waited for his reply, nervously opening up the mail each day. Each time the phone rang, I imagined it was him. What would he say to me? What would I say to him? Would my letter make a difference, or would I end up regretting that I ever reached out? Ten days after I sent my letter, I got his response. I opened it up and started crying after the first sentence, right there in the Postal Annex. Dear Scott, Your letter has touched me deeper than I can ever convey to you in words. I cried like a baby during and after reading it. You have come a long way, farther than you realize! Scott, don't berate yourself for rejecting me and my values and my world. It was I who rejected you when you didn't conform to what I wanted for you. Rejection is something you learned from me! I blame myself. Don't forget, I was supposedly the adult, and you were the child. I should have handled things wiser and more maturely. Scott, listen to me very carefully. Let's not dwell on the past, except if it can help us understand the present and prevent us from making the same mistakes over again. As I said before, you have come a long way, and I have reacted to your changes very positively. **You say growing up is scary and difficult. Please remember, I am still trying to grow up! Let's help each other.** Scott, I love you very much. I always have! I hope any scars are temporary and reversible. Always, Dadio I read the letter again and again. Who was this wise, tender, approachable man? Was this my father? I called him up. \"Dad, I got your letter.\" \"And I, yours, Scott.\" We both fumbled for words, but couldn't find any. Finally, my father said, \"Scott, I'm all choked up right now. I can't seem to talk.\" \"I feel the same, Dad.\" Another clumsy, but heart-filled silence. We both managed to say, \"I love you\", and then had to get off the phone. The feelings were too rich for words, but a new beginning was acknowledged. I visited my family soon after that.

I found myself genuinely interested in him, his past, his dreams, his regrets. I asked him questions as if I we were just starting out. We had some significant catching up to do. We speak on the phone often these days. It's not always easy to talk to him. I question at times how much to reveal, and what to talk about. Sometimes it flows, and sometimes it feels awkward.

Its dominance inside the body is now clearly demonstrated. Thinking clearly with your brain is useful. But feeling positively from your heart provides an amazing boost to health and creativity. Briefly re-experiencing a cherished memory creates synchronization in your heart rhythm in mere seconds. This increases the release of healthy, energizing hormones, while at the same time decreasing levels of damaging stress hormones, at the same time your immune system is strengthened, blood pressure decreases ... and health and focus increase. **Using a simple prescription that consists of a number of exercises that anyone can do anywhere in a few minutes-the details are coming shortly-HeartMath is successfully battling the greatest threat to health, happiness and peace in this world: stress.** Stress is the plague of our time, an epidemic that is spreading rapidly. The World Health Organization (WHO) raised the alarm 20 years ago, but things have only gotten worse. Every day some one million Americans fail to come to work due to stress. The European Union estimated in 2000 that the annual price tag of stress, in the form of healthcare costs and lost productivity, amounts to some three to four percent of the EU's gross domestic product. Stress is one of the most important causes of high blood pressure, which afflicts one in three adults in Europe and North America and is the cause of many serious illnesses such as heart disease and stroke. Stress also lies at the basis of depression and burnout. \"**The good news is that the negative effects of stress can be effectively countered more easily than people might imagine.** This leads to better performance in every aspect of life. It is therefore a smart strategy for every organization to tackle this source of excessive costs and human strain,\" according to HeartMath's president and CEO Bruce Cryer. That insight has now permeated many companies and institutions. Managers are sent to stress seminars. Yoga lessons are offered at company headquarters. And there are even companies that encourage their employees to take vacations. But these measures aren't very effective as long as stress continues to permeate the corporate culture. The sense of relief from a yoga lesson or a weekend at the beach is often lost during the first chat with a frustrated colleague at the coffee machine.

But these measures aren't very effective as long as stress continues to permeate the corporate culture. The sense of relief from a yoga lesson or a weekend at the beach is often lost during the first chat with a frustrated colleague at the coffee machine. A successful anti-stress strategy provides results precisely at the moment the stress is experienced. This is what HeartMath does, which is why its client list now includes such leading companies as Hewlett Packard, Shell, Unilever, Cisco Systems, and Boeing. HeartMath was established in 1991 by Doc Lew Childre. Childre had made a name for himself as a researcher and advisor to companies and scientific institutions. With the founding of HeartMath, he embarked on his mission to demonstrate that the heart was central to human health, success and fulfillment. **While HeartMath's techniques emphasize the importance of emotional self-management, HeartMath is no new age phenomenon. It is a research institute that has published a large body of scientific research in established and respected publications such as the Harvard Business Review and the American Journal of Cardiology.** Those publications support HeartMath's central aim of presenting revolutionary scientific discoveries in a solid, \"bullet proof\" way. It has demonstrated significant cost savings for healthcare organizations struggling with staff turnover, and has shown significant health benefits in an array of studies covering congestive heart failure, diabetes, asthma, and hypertension. As Cryer says, \"HeartMath is not based simply on belief. There are proven physiological reactions in how emotion, heart and brain interact.\" In other words: HeartMath's work is kept scrupulously free of the obvious potential for opportunism. Which is admirable given that financing and survival issues have presented tricky challenges for the organization through the years. HeartMath's location reflects this cautious strategy. The institute is located in a group of buildings on a lovely retreat-like setting in Boulder Creek, a town that is nearly impossible to find among the tall trees of the ancient Californian forests. Stress and Boulder Creek have little to do with one another, I realize, following a drive through the pouring rain. And yet the decision to locate HeartMath here was not so odd. Forty-five minutes down the road is a well-known hotbed of this \"modern plague:\" Silicon Valley. Research director Rollin McCraty is in his office-a simple study with a huge window looking out over a wooded slope-working on one of HeartMath's latest initiatives: a computer-driven experiment that shows how the heart reacts more quickly to external stimuli than the brain.** HeartMath programs utilize an innovative biofeedback system-developed by founder Doc Childre-whereby your finger or ear is hooked up to a sensor that shows the heart's activity on a computer screen.** The feedback is not a precondition for the result of the HeartMath exercises,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:071106heartmathchanges.txt:2:80b04e55425c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7839, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "071106heartmathchanges.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "071106heartmathchanges", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "his office-a simple study with a huge window looking out over a wooded slope-working on one of HeartMath's latest initiatives: a computer-driven experiment that shows how the heart reacts more quickly to external stimuli than the brain.** HeartMath programs utilize an innovative biofeedback system-developed by founder Doc Childre-whereby your finger or ear is hooked up to a sensor that shows the heart's activity on a computer screen.** The feedback is not a precondition for the result of the HeartMath exercises, but seeing your heart rhythms live on a computer screen makes it easier to convince critics of the favourable effect of positive feelings. Measuring internal feelings using modern instruments is not new in itself. For example, with the help of the electroencephalogram (EEG), it has been proven that meditating yogis produce completely different brain waves than-say-stock traders on Wall Street. But HeartMath's heart-driven method extends much further than relaxation through meditation. McCraty notes, \"Meditation is mainly geared towards consciously separating yourself from the reality around you. That has totally different physical consequences than our approach, which is geared towards actively adding positive energy to a particular situation.\" To measure the heart's reaction to particular events, HeartMath uses a relatively new concept-one that is currently a hot item in mainstream medicine-as an indicator of a healthily functioning body: heart rate variability (HRV). Research conducted 10 years ago by Dr Andrew Armour of Dalhouse University in Halifax, Canada showed that the heart has its own neural network-in essence, a little brain. HRV-the rhythm of the time period between two heartbeats-plays a key role in that network. It has now been demonstrated that the heart sends signals to the brain and the hormonal system via nerves which carry the heart rhythm patterns. It doesn't matter so much how many times a heart beats per minute; it's the rhythm of the heartbeat that counts. Childre, McCraty and HeartMath's research team have discovered that certain patterns in the heart rhythm correspond to a particular emotional state. McCraty explains, \"With every heartbeat, information is supplied that affects our emotions, our physical health and the quality of our lives.\" This means that **feelings of compassion, love, care and appreciation produce a smoothly rolling-HeartMath calls it \"coherent\"-heart rhythm, while feelings of anger, frustration, fear and danger emit a jagged and capricious-\"incoherent\"- image.** But this is more than a statistical difference. HeartMath's research shows that a different heart rhythm leads to other chemical and electrical-even neurological-reactions in the body. **Simply put: when people experience love, they not only feel happy and joyful, but they also produce, for example, more DHEA, the hormone that prevents aging, and gives us feelings of youthful vitality.** Not surprisingly, a synthetic form of the hormone is currently sold in pill form at drugstores and health food stores. At the same time, the production of damaging stress hormones like cortisol is reduced. High levels of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:071106heartmathchanges.txt:3:c1a1a0e269e5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7840, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "071106heartmathchanges.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "071106heartmathchanges", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "leads to other chemical and electrical-even neurological-reactions in the body. **Simply put: when people experience love, they not only feel happy and joyful, but they also produce, for example, more DHEA, the hormone that prevents aging, and gives us feelings of youthful vitality.** Not surprisingly, a synthetic form of the hormone is currently sold in pill form at drugstores and health food stores. At the same time, the production of damaging stress hormones like cortisol is reduced. High levels of cortisol have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, depression and fatigue. By contrast, a \"loving body\" absorbs less cholesterol, thereby preventing arteries from clogging while boosting production of immunoglobulin A, an important biochemical that boosts immune function. In addition, blood pressure stabilizes. McCraty links this effect to problems many organizations face: \"There is a clear connection between healthcare costs and blood pressure levels. When your blood pressure falls, so do visits to the doctor...\" And so HeartMath concludes that love is both an emotional and a physical state: positive feelings-like love-generate health. The reverse is also true. Someone who is angry produces less DHEA and more cortisol. And so on. **HeartMath's slogan-a change of heart changes everything-pretty much sums it up. ** But how do you \"change your heart?\" According to HeartMath research, it is much simpler than it looks. McCraty says, \"If you consciously shift your attention to a positive emotion, like appreciation or care, or if you allow your thoughts to return to the feeling of a cherished memory, your heart rhythm changes immediately.\" This phenomenon continues to astonish the some 25,000 people who attend HeartMath courses each year. Initially, HeartMath utilized expensive medical equipment to measure and display the heart rhythm. But since 2000 HeartMath has offered a \"do-it-yourself\" equivalent: the Freeze-Framer, an award-winning computer program with an innovative sensor that anyone can install in their computer at home or at work. So far, HeartMath has sold more than 30,000 of these systems. The first time I start up the Freeze-Framer at home and attach the sensor to my finger, a freakish pattern appears on my computer screen. My heart rhythm is all wild peaks and valleys or-in HeartMath jargon-an \"incoherent pattern.\" I then perform my prescribed exercise. I shift my thoughts to the area around my heart, I visualize that I'm breathing in through my heart and out through my solar plexus (the energy point under the breastbone, above the belly button). I remember a sweet memory with my daughter. I feel the warmth of our contact at that moment ... and I see the graph on the computer screen change. The exercise, which I've only been doing for a couple of minutes, is quick and effective. The volatile peaks change into rolling hills on my screen. My incoherent heart rhythm has synchronized into a coherent rhythm. And what I can't see on the line of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:071106heartmathchanges.txt:4:772a8064c828", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7841, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "071106heartmathchanges.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "071106heartmathchanges", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "the breastbone, above the belly button). I remember a sweet memory with my daughter. I feel the warmth of our contact at that moment ... and I see the graph on the computer screen change. The exercise, which I've only been doing for a couple of minutes, is quick and effective. The volatile peaks change into rolling hills on my screen. My incoherent heart rhythm has synchronized into a coherent rhythm. And what I can't see on the line of the graph, but know-from HeartMath research-is that my body is now functioning in a more healthy and wholesome way. The research is convincing. A group of managers from Motorola attended a HeartMath workshop and were tested six months later on the results of their daily exercises. One-quarter of the managers had high blood pressure at the start of the project. After six months, they all had normal blood pressure levels. **In another study with Hewlett-Packard managers, the average blood pressure fell from 138/86 to 128/80. This large an improvement is comparable to the effect of losing nearly 20 kilos (44 pounds).** A recent study of employees at the food and household products multinational Unilever shows that the production of the favourable hormone DHEA increased by an average of 50 percent after six months of HeartMath exercises and rose to 90 percent after nine months. The exercises also work for people with chronic diseases. For example, diabetes patients who performed a total of one hour of HeartMath exercises every week for six months scored significantly better on a number of health aspects crucial to them. Another HeartMath study indicates that the savings on health care costs and absenteeism can run up to $700 U.S. (540 euros) per employee a year. For a company with 1,000 employees, that would mean a savings of $700,000 U.S. (540,000 euros) a year. The fact the exercises are so easy may well be the most promising aspect of the HeartMath system. Bruce Cryer notes, \"Time pressure is continually increasing. No matter how good a program might be for them, many people simply don't take the time to invest in their emotional and physical health every day. People want exercises to take virtually no time, but to yield results. That's the strength of our approach. **You can learn the techniques in five minutes and get positive results if you do them a few times a day for 30 seconds.** When you're on your way to your next meeting, for example. Or when you start up your computer. Or sitting at a stoplight. Or waiting to make a phone call. Or before starting to check your e-mails. By making the techniques simple and quick, you can integrate them into your daily schedule without having to drastically change your life.\" Regularly using the Freeze-Framer is particularly helpful in recognizing stress patterns. You gain insight into your own behaviour and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:071106heartmathchanges.txt:5:dce715d73abe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7842, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "071106heartmathchanges.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "071106heartmathchanges", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "30 seconds.** When you're on your way to your next meeting, for example. Or when you start up your computer. Or sitting at a stoplight. Or waiting to make a phone call. Or before starting to check your e-mails. By making the techniques simple and quick, you can integrate them into your daily schedule without having to drastically change your life.\" Regularly using the Freeze-Framer is particularly helpful in recognizing stress patterns. You gain insight into your own behaviour and the effect of that behaviour on your health. In that respect, the Freeze-Framer works like a thermometer: you get to the point where you don't need to take your temperature any more to know you have a fever. As a result, it becomes ever easier to quickly correct the experience of stress. Cryer says, **\"HeartMath's aim is to eliminate stress. Of course we can't eliminate stressful events from our lives, but we can change our physiological and emotional response to them. The goal is to teach you to recognize which circumstances create stress so you can change your reaction to those situations.** For example, practising a HeartMath technique helps you not to curse if someone cuts you off on the highway, but to react differently. And the most important result is that no damaging stress hormones are released in your body and no damaging comments come out of your mouth that could make the situation much worse.\" Is HeartMath the only effective answer to stress? Clearly not. Every walk on the beach is beneficial. The same goes for an enjoyable concert. And for experiences of friendship and love. There are also other promising initiatives with a comparable focus. Ode previously reported on the work of the Italian Amedeo Maffei (see Ode, June 2002) as well as the computer game Wild Divine (see Ode, April 2004). And there are other projects geared towards synchronising the heart and brain rhythms to stimulate favourable biochemical and electrical processes in our bodies. **But the strength of HeartMath lies in the convincing evidence of the effectiveness of the exercises and their simplicity.** And its approach takes into account the sense of time pressure continually experienced by the stressed target group. Less stress and more health is, of course, enough of a recommendation for following HeartMath's system. But there's more: studies show that the electromagnetic field of the heart (which is created by the heart's electrical system, or electrocardiogram) can be measured from between two and three metres from the body. **HeartMath has discovered that if someone has a coherent heart rhythm, it has a demonstrably positive effect on other people in close proximity to him or her** (and the reverse is also true). Just think about how you feel in the presence of someone who is appreciative or caring, compared to being close to someone angry or frustrated. That is: if your own heart rhythm", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:071106heartmathchanges.txt:6:10455ba9d9c4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7843, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "071106heartmathchanges.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "071106heartmathchanges", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "system, or electrocardiogram) can be measured from between two and three metres from the body. **HeartMath has discovered that if someone has a coherent heart rhythm, it has a demonstrably positive effect on other people in close proximity to him or her** (and the reverse is also true). Just think about how you feel in the presence of someone who is appreciative or caring, compared to being close to someone angry or frustrated. That is: if your own heart rhythm is coherent, there is a greater chance that your environment will also behave coherently. That is: the health of your environment starts with your own health. That is: changing the world starts with you. Cryer notes how, \"A lot of people feel powerless. Climate change. Poverty. War. Terrorism. There are so many things we could fear in the world. So where do you start as an individual, when the size of the problems seem so daunting? It is important to know that you can have a demonstrably positive effect on the world. **We can change the world, starting with ourselves.\" ** That enthusiasm is behind all the solid research done by HeartMath. This vision also explains why the Institute never opted for quick fixes, but instead preferred building steady proof of concept. Cryer concludes, **\"It is our mission to help the world change, by helping people change. The root of most of our world's problems is a lack of emotional management, a lack of understanding, care, respect and compassion. Most organizations and governments are fairly dysfunctional, because their leaders lack skills to manage themselves emotionally, let alone be an example for others to follow. That dysfunction damages the planet every day. We offer tools that are needed to eradicate major challenges and problems and to prevent wrongs.\"** Those tools help the heart to make love. All you need is love, John Lennon sang.

Our new website for the Transformation Team at [www.transformationteam.net](https://www.transformationteam.net)[https://www.transformationteam.net](https://www.transformationteam.net) launched in September and is really taking off. **We've received emails from dozens of people reporting significant and even major transformation in their lives as a result of the course available on this website.** If you feel like one of the main reasons you are here now is to help transform our planet, we invite you to take a look at this empowering new website. The number of subscribers to the PEERS email lists is approaching 6,000, up over 50% from a year ago, with 90 countries from around the globe now represented. WantToKnow.info continues to draw plenty of attention. Though the number of visitors to the website hasn't changed much over last year, we've still received just shy of one million visits in the last year. That's over 2,500 visits per day. A number of influential people have contacted us through the website expressing gratitude for the quality of information provided. We feel incredibly fortunate to have such a wonderful network of supporters who send us all kinds of excellent information and inspiration. Financially, this year we've entered new territory. **Last April, for the first time we hired both a full-time employee, Tod Fletcher, and a contractor, Andrey, who works up to 20 hours a week with us.** Both of them have been doing excellent work. Tod is the one who is largely responsible for bringing highly revealing news summaries to you. Web wizard Andrey is a genius in website development and has been the major force in developing the amazing new community networking portal for our Transformation Team website. You can take a peak at the portal by [clicking here](https://www.transformationteam.net/ttcommunityportal). Though I continue to work full-time on all of our websites, our budget does not yet allow me to be paid for any of the work I've done. I continue to live largely from my dwindling savings. Salary and payments to Andrey and Tod will run about US$35,000 for this year. Other costs have run around $5,000 for total yearly expenses of approximately $40,000. We are extremely grateful to have received over $18,000 in contributions so far this year, almost two times what we received in 2006. Yet as this is far from enough to cover expenses, I have had to donate $20,000 this year in order to keep us in the black.

While **media, including a lead editorial in the New York Times October 19, have given false comfort that we, as American citizens, will not be the victims of the draconian measures legalized by this Act-such as military roundups and life-long detention with no rights or constitutional protections**-Robert Parry points to text in the MCA that allows for the institution of a military alternative to the constitutional justice system for \"any person\" regardless of American citizenship. The MCA effectively does away with habeas corpus rights for \"any person\" arbitrarily deemed to be an \"enemy of the state.\" The judgment on who is deemed an \"enemy combatant\" is solely at the discretion of President Bush. While it is true that some parts of the MCA target non-citizens, other sections clearly apply to US citizens as well, putting citizens inside the same tribunal system with non-citizen residents and foreigners. Besides allowing \"any person\" to be swallowed up by Bush's system, the law prohibits detainees once inside from appealing to the traditional American courts until after prosecution and sentencing, which could translate into an indefinite imprisonment since there", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080117mediacensorship.txt:0:913f5379c189", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7849, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080117mediacensorship.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080117mediacensorship", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "combatant\" is solely at the discretion of President Bush.

As the only US criminal statute that outlaws military operations directed against the American people, it has been our best protection against tyranny enforced by martial law**-the harsh system of rules that takes effect when the military takes control of the normal administration of justice. Historically martial law has been imposed by various governments during times of war or occupation to intensify control of populations in spite of heightened unrest. In modern times it is most commonly used by authoritarian governments to enforce unpopular rule. Author Frank Morales notes that despite the unprecedented and shocking nature of this act, there has been no outcry in the American media, and little reaction from our elected officials in Congress. **Source:** \"Bush Moves Toward Martial Law\", Frank Morales, TowardFreedom.com, October 25, 2006.

The most significant and growing challenge to US dominance in Africa is China.** The political implication of an economically emerging Africa in close alliance with China is resulting in a new cold war in which AFRICOM will be tasked with achieving full-spectrum military dominance over Africa. AFRICOM will replace US military command posts in Africa, which were formerly under control of US European Command (EUCOM) and US Central Command (CENTCOM), with a more centralized and intensified US military presence. A context for the pending strategic role of AFRICOM can be gained from observing CENTCOM in the Middle East. CENTCOM grew out of the Carter Doctrine of 1980 which described the oil flow from the Persian Gulf as a \"vital interest\" of the US, and affirmed that the US would employ \"any means necessary, including military force\" to overcome an attempt by hostile interests to block that flow. It is in Western and Sub-Saharan Africa that the US military force is most rapidly increasing, as this area is projected to become as important a source of energy as the Middle East within the next decade. In this region, challenge to US domination and exploitation is coming from the people of Africa-most specifically in Nigeria, where seventy percent of Africa's oil is contained. **Source:** \"Understanding AFRICOM\", Bryan Hunt, MoonOfAlabama.org, February 21, 2007.

These agreements are requiring enormous irreversible concessions from developing countries, while offering almost nothing in return. The US and EU are demanding unprecedented tariff reductions, sometimes to nothing, as the US and EU dump subsidized agricultural goods on undeveloped countries, plunging local farmers into desperate poverty. Meanwhile the US and EU provide themselves with high tariffs and stringent import quotas to protect their own producers. **Unprecedented loss of livelihood, displacement, slave labor, along with spiraling degradation of human rights and environments are resulting as economic governance is forced from governments of developing countries, and taken over by unaccountable multinational firms.** During 2006, more than one hundred developing countries were involved in FTA or Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) negotiations. \"An average of two treaties are signed every week,\" the report says. \"Virtually no country, however poor, has been left out.\" Much of the recent debate and controversy over trade negotiations has revolved around the increasingly", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080117mediacensorship.txt:2:3965035c5b25", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7851, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080117mediacensorship.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080117mediacensorship", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "spiraling degradation of human rights and environments are resulting as economic governance is forced from governments of developing countries, and taken over by unaccountable multinational firms.** During 2006, more than one hundred developing countries were involved in FTA or Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) negotiations. \"An average of two treaties are signed every week,\" the report says. \"Virtually no country, however poor, has been left out.\" Much of the recent debate and controversy over trade negotiations has revolved around the increasingly devastating trade-distorting practices of rich countries versus the developing countries' needs for food security and industrial development.

The $592 million, 104-acre fortress [is] equal in size to Vatican City. With a highly secretive contract awarded by the US State Department, First Kuwaiti Trading & Contracting [FKTC] has joined the ranks of Halliburton/KBR in Iraq by using bait-and-switch recruiting practices. **Thousands of citizens from countries that have banned travel [to] or work in Iraq are being tricked, smuggled into brutal and inhumane labor camps, and subjected to months of forced servitude - all in the middle of the US-controlled Green Zone, \"right under the nose of the US State Department.\"** Though [Associated Press reports](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12319798/) that, \"The 5,500 Americans and Iraqis working at the embassy are far more numerous than at any other US mission worldwide,\" there is no mention in corporate media of the 3,000 South Asian laborers working for contractors in dangerous and abysmal living and working conditions. FKTC has procured several billion dollars in US construction contracts since the war began in March 2003. Much of its work is performed by cheap labor hired from South Asia. The company currently employs an estimated 7,500 foreign laborers in theaters of war. American FKTC employees report having witnessed the issuance of false boarding passes to Dubai, and passport seizure from planeloads of South Asian workers, who were instead routed to war-torn Baghdad.

In an unprecedented move, more than 30,000 \"fugitives\" were arrested in the largest dragnets in the nation's history. The operations directly involved over 960 agencies (state, local, and federal) and were the brainchild of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and US Marshal's Director Ben Reyna. The DoJ supplied television networks [with] action videotape of Marshals and local cops raiding homes and breaking down doors, \"targeting the worst of the worst criminals on the run,\" emphasizing suspected sex offenders. Yet less than ten percent of the total 30,150 were suspected sex offenders and less than two percent owned firearms. The press has not asked, \"Who were the others?\" And to date, the US Marshal's office has issued no public statement as to whether the people arrested in Operation Falcon have been processed or released. **Author Mike Whitney cautions that Attorney General Gonzales has little interest in the petty offenders who were netted in this extraordinary crackdown. This action is instead, he warns, a practice roundup in the move toward martial law. **Altogether, there were three FALCON Operations, each netting roughly 10,000 criminal suspects. Between April 4-10, 2005, FALCON I swept up 10,340 fugitives in the largest nationwide mass arrest (to that date) in American history. Operation FALCON II, carried out the week of April 17-23, 2006, arrested another 9,037 individuals from twenty-seven states mostly west of the Mississippi River. Operation FALCON III, conducted during the week of October 22-28, 2006, netted another 10,733 fugitives in twenty-four states east of the Mississippi River. **Source:** \"Operation Falcon\", Brenda J.

As many as 28,000 Indian farmers have committed suicide over the last decade as a result of debt incurred from failed GM crops and competition with subsidized US crops. When India's Prime Minister Singh met with President Bush in March 2006, [they] signed **the Indo-US Knowledge Initiative on Agriculture (KIA). The KIA allows for the grab of India's seed sector by Monsanto, of its trade sector by giant agribusiness ADM and Cargill, and its retail sector by Wal-Mart.** Though the contours of KIA have been kept so secret that neither senior Indian politicians nor the scientific community know its details, it is clear that Prime Minister Singh has agreed to sacrifice India's agriculture sector to pay for US concessions in the nuclear field.

When advising state officials on the future of this vital public asset, these investment firms fail to mention that their sole purpose is to pick up infrastructure at the lowest price possible in order to maximize returns for their investors. Investors, most often foreign companies, are charging tolls and insisting on \"noncompete\" clauses that limit governments from expanding or improving nearby roads. In 1956, President Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act, which called for the federal and state governments to build 41,000 miles of high-quality roads across the nation ... in what would later be called the \"greatest public works project in human history.\" Eisenhower considered the interstate highway system so vital to the public interest that he authorized the federal government to assume 90 percent of the massive cost. Fifty years later, states are selling off our nation's enormous, and aging, infrastructure to private investors. Opponents are lambasting these plans as a major turn toward handing the nation's valuable common asset over to private firms whose fidelity is to stockholders - not to the public transportation system or the people who use it. **Source:** \"The Highwaymen\", Daniel Schulman with James Ridgeway, Mother Jones magazine, February 2007.

Vulture funds are financial organizations that buy up debts that are near default or bankruptcy. The vulture fund will pay the original investor pennies on the dollar for the debt and then approach the debtor to arrange a better repayment on the loan, or will go after the debtor in court. In the private financial world, these funds, like the birds they are named for, provide a useful function for investors who are unable to follow up on defaulted debts and are themselves facing financial ruin if the debtor reneges entirely. Under normal circumstances, distressed-debt investing-like day trading-is risky business. It is a gamble and the company knows that going in. The vulture fund may get nothing for its investment if the debtor continues to default and has no assets to attach. However, if there is still meat on the bones (the debtor has considerable assets to liquidate) the vulture fund can make millions. A problem has arisen in recent years, however, as vulture funds have begun inserting themselves into an increasingly globalized \"free market\"-where no distinction is made between an irresponsible and defaulted company and a destitute and impoverished nation. In the case of nations, **the actions of vulture funds are corrupting the process begun in 1996 to provide debt relief for Third World nations struggling to emerge from the heavy debt laid upon them by previous corrupt rulers and colonial masters.** **Source:** \"Vulture Fund Threat to Third World\", Greg Palast with Meirion Jones, BBC Newsnight, February 14, 2007.

Many different peoples inhabited this planet teeming with abundant lifeforms. They had come to learn the many difficult, yet rewarding lessons of exploring in physical bodies what it is like to feel separate and disconnected from their own divine essence and from all around them. The collective consciousness of all people on Earth greatly affected everything that happened on this revolving planet. Yet because of their explorations into separateness, the vast majority of these people - or humans as they called themselves - were unaware of how their collective will formed their world. In order to learn the deep wisdom of this Earth school or Univers-city, these humans had chosen to forget how in their deepest essence they were all interconnected and how every individual played an essential role in what happened on their planet and to their people as a whole. Over the ages and through thousands upon thousands of revolutions of this jewel of a planet around its shining golden sun, the people of Earth explored, developed, and expanded their awareness through many rich, beautiful, and sometimes even painful experiences. Through the rich drama and challenging lessons of many ages and lifetimes, they several times grew close to the point of feeling again their deep interconnectedness with all beings. Yet each time they came close, that awareness then contracted and was eventually shut down by their collective fear of losing individuality and uniqueness. After several cycles of this expansion and contraction, at one point in a new expansion phase, the collective mind grew so intelligent as to permit humankind for the first time to soar beyond the gravitational confines of Earth in shiny, metallic spaceships. The collective knowledge of the physical world in which they lived grew so deep that certain individuals began to see visions of a major transformation leading to physical paradise on Earth. At the same time, many others greatly feared that these new mental abilities and sophisticated technologies would be used by the militaries and greedy elite to destroy the very life and world in which they lived. As their collective hopes and fears grew like never before, many humans dedicated to global transformation joined together in a deep prayer about their lives and world. So for the first time in the planet's history, a powerful collective call was sent out to the universe requesting help and guidance for the struggling planet and its people to move beyond separation, selfishness, and greed towards loving, empowering transformation and integration.

For the first time, humanity as a whole opened to connection and help from the great universe beyond the physical confines of their world. Their prayer was heard. In the vast and varied collection of civilizations and species spread throughout the infinite universe, the call for help from this small, beautiful planet was heard. Unbeknownst to the people of Earth, there existed in the universe a special team made up of millions of caring souls from various planets, galaxies, and even dimensions. This loving team had dedicated themselves specifically to serve and support the inhabitants of developing planets who requested help in times of crisis and transition. The vibrant souls of this intergalactic transformation team were committed to work together with the local transformation team of any planet that called for help in creating more nurturing, life-enhancing ways of living and growing. This loving team was activated by the collective call from Earth. Feeling the call for help almost like a fireman on Earth responding to an alarm, the excited souls of the transformation team came together to focus their attention on this beautiful world in crisis. They opened their hearts and souls to the people there. They learned of the ways of humankind and became familiar with the challenges the people of Earth found themselves facing. While some agreed to observe and provide guidance from a distance, millions of these souls agreed to be born in human bodies and - like other humans - to forget where they came from, so that they might fully experience being human and more effectively provide help and guidance to humankind. Being born into human bodies and human families without memory of their origin, almost all of these transformation team members felt the many pains and joys of growing up while often feeling separate and isolated from those around them. Some even chose to go through serious traumas with their human families in order to develop deeper compassion. Others simply felt alone and bewildered, unable to comprehend why those around them couldn't see that love interconnects us all. At times, all of them felt they didn't belong and sensed an inner calling to some greater purpose. As these dedicated transformation team members grew spiritually and the crisis facing the planet intensified, magical things began to happen. Key writings, dreams, mystical experiences, and even inspiring fables began to awaken members of the transformation team to their deeper purpose.

Key writings, dreams, mystical experiences, and even inspiring fables began to awaken members of the transformation team to their deeper purpose. For some the awakening was gradual, while for others a powerful, unexpected single event lifted the veil. Collectively, members of the transformation team began to remember why they came to Earth. They found themselves spontaneously connecting with other wise humans who were part of the transformation team and who further helped to awaken and inspire them. Their fears and feeling of separation gradually faded as they became increasingly excited to remember their deeper purpose, and to find themselves now playing an integral role in this empowering planetary transition. Eventually, all members of the transformation team awoke. Upon awakening, a new, bright sparkle danced from their eyes. It was a sparkle of knowingness. Knowing that all of us are already interconnected in a divine cosmic dance. Knowing that the joy of love is always there inside when any soul truly opens to it. Knowing that the team's purpose is not to save anyone, but rather to simply be a loving invitation and inspiration to all around them. Knowing that uniqueness and individuality are welcome even in the interconnectedness of all beings. Knowing that when the people of a planet send out a collective call for help, the transformation team always answers. Knowing that the team never fails to give powerful, inspiring guidance to help make it through even the most daunting crisis. Once upon a time, the transformation team came to Earth to remind humankind - and even to remind themselves - that we are not alone, that we are all equally important actors intimately interconnected in the divine unfolding of the universe. The team came to remind us that fear is but an invitation to growth, and that in the end, there is no end. There is only this sacred moment in which to open to all the richness that we are ready to receive. There is only the eternal here and now. And so to bring this transformation fable to a close (or is it an opening?), the transformation team found and continues to find ever more joyful, meaningful ways to love, explore, play, and grow together with all people of Earth, as they live happily ever after in the ever present here and now. **To join in the fun and deeply meaningful work of the global transformation team, [enter here](https://www.transformationteam.net/membershipprocess).** **Kindly support this work: [Donate here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/donationswtk.php).** Explore the mind and heart expanding websites managed by the nonprofit PEERS network: [www.peerservice.org](https://www.peerservice.org) - PEERS websites: Spreading inspiration, education, & empowerment [www.momentoflove.org](https://www.momentoflove.org) - Every person in the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080131globaltransformationteamfable.txt:2:e4fa3d8fffea", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7863, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080131globaltransformationteamfable.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080131globaltransformationteamfable", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "ever more joyful, meaningful ways to love, explore, play, and grow together with all people of Earth, as they live happily ever after in the ever present here and now. **To join in the fun and deeply meaningful work of the global transformation team, [enter here](https://www.transformationteam.net/membershipprocess).** **Kindly support this work: [Donate here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/donationswtk.php).** Explore the mind and heart expanding websites managed by the nonprofit PEERS network: [www.peerservice.org](https://www.peerservice.org) - PEERS websites: Spreading inspiration, education, & empowerment [www.momentoflove.org](https://www.momentoflove.org) - Every person in the world has a heart [www.personalgrowthcourses.net](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net) - Dynamic online courses powerfully expand your horizons [www.WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info) - Reliable, verifiable information on major cover-ups [www.weboflove.org](https://www.weboflove.org) - Strengthening the Web of Love that interconnects us all [Subscribe/Unsubscribe/Change email address](https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe): The WantToKnow.info email list (two messages a week) Global Transformation Team: A Fable of Global Transformation", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080131globaltransformationteamfable.txt:3:bc0703632f04", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7864, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080607ft.911_truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080607ft.911_truth", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "9/11 Truth ***Financial Times* on 9/11 Truth The Truth is Out There** By Peter Barber Published: June 7 2008 01:22 [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8d66e778-3128-11dd-ab22-000077b07658.html](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8d66e778-3128-11dd-ab22-000077b07658.html) When Cynthia McKinney speaks the words of Martin Luther King Jr, they resound through the church with some of King's cadence. \"A time comes,\" declares the former US congresswoman from Georgia, \"when silence is betrayal.\" The congregation answers with whoops and calls of \"That's right!\" King was talking about America's war in Vietnam. More than 40 years later, before the packed pews of the Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles, McKinney is speaking of the American government's war on its own people. **The shock and awe phase of this conflict, we had been told earlier, began on September 11 2001, when the Bush administration launched attacks on New York and Washington, or at least waved them through.** According to a show of hands that February afternoon, several hundred people in the immaculate church believe this to be true. Some came in T-shirts bearing the words \"9/11 was an inside job\". One wore a badge demanding that you \"Examine your assumptions\". Quite a few bought the DVDs on sale in the foyer, most of which bore photographs of the Twin Towers spewing smoke. **They had all come to hear the message of [Architects, Engineers & Scientists for 9/11 Truth](http://www.ae911truth.org/), one of the dozens of groups across the US which campaign to persuade us that everything we think we know about 9/11 is wrong.** [Marion Cotillard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Cotillard), [Emmy-award winning] actress \"There was a tower in Spain which burnt for 24 hours. It never collapsed\" Last winter, \"Investigate 9/11\" banners seemed to be popping up all over the place. Bill Clinton was heckled by \"truthers\" in Denver while campaigning for his wife. Truthers picketed the Academy Awards in LA - despite this year's winner of the best actress Oscar, Marion Cotillard, reportedly being one of them. But then, she's French. Literature lovers in that country pushed Thierry Meyssan's *L'Effroyable imposture *(The Appalling Fraud) - which asserts that 9/11 was a government plot to justify invading Iraq and Afghanistan and increase military spending - to the top of the bestseller list in 2002. **Country music star Willie Nelson [see Fox News article [available here](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,328726,00.html)] is assuredly not French, but a week or so before the Oscars he described as naive the notion that the \"implosion\" of the Twin Towers was caused by crashing jets.

A busy season for the \"9/11 Truth\" movement.** The events of 9/11 were recorded in many thousands of images, from crisp agency photographs to amateur camcorder footage. Every recorded trail of smoke, every spray of sparks is pored over by an army of sceptics, collectively described as the 9/11 Truth movement. They believe that the key to the mystery is hidden somewhere within the pictures, just as some people think that clues are contained in the Zapruder film which captured the moment of John F. Kennedy's assassination. Allied against them is a smaller group of rival bloggers who have taken it upon themselves to debunk what they claim are dangerous conspiracy theories. [Gore Vidal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gore_Vidal), writer \"If there ever was great cause for impeachment, it would be over 9/11\" **There is some evidence that the truthers are swaying the rest of us. A New York Times/CBS News poll in 2006 revealed that only 16 per cent of Americans polled believed the Bush administration was telling the truth about 9/11. More than half thought it was \"hiding something\".** This is not the same as believing the government actually launched the attacks, but a Scripps Howard/Ohio University poll the same year found that more than a third of those questioned suspected that federal officials assisted in the attacks or took no action to stop them so that the US could go to war. The truthers certainly believe that they are on a roll. The crowd in the Immanuel Presbyterian Church seemed electrified. As the donated sound system pumped out angry rap, a giant video screen showed images of protesters demanding a new investigation into 9/11. The symbols and the language were borrowed from the civil rights struggle, but the truthers are an eclectic group, including anti-Bush, anti-war liberals and anti-government libertarians. A young man in a \"Vote Ron Paul\" T-shirt scuttled through the hall, filming us as we took our seats on wooden pews. First up was Richard Gage, a San Francisco architect who founded Architects, Engineers & Scientists for 9/11 Truth, which now claims to have 379 professional members. Gage told us that the collapse of the Twin Towers could not have been due merely to gravity, the impact of the airliners and the resulting jet fuel fires - which would not have been hot enough to weaken the steel sufficiently. Behind him on the video screen was the south tower of the World Trade Center. Smoke poured from its upper floors. A respectful silence fell over the audience, followed by gasps as the building appeared to dissolve before our eyes.

The destruction of the Twin Towers, along with the collapse of the nearby 47-storey World Trade Center 7 building, had all the hallmarks of controlled demolition, according to Gage. They all came straight down, almost at the speed of a free-falling object, right into their own footprints. Steel-framed buildings had never collapsed because of fires before. On this day three did, one of which, \"Building 7\", was not even hit by an aircraft. Gage, who had worked himself into a fever, exhorted the audience to stand up and be counted: \"A country is at stake.\" Then he welcomed on to the stage the star of the evening, [Steven Jones](https://www.WantToKnow.info/stevenjonesnewsarticles). A softly spoken physicist, Jones is the movement's designated martyr and seems to promise what the truthers so desperately need: scientific credibility. **Jones entered into truther lore in 2006 when he was put into early retirement by Brigham Young University in Utah after giving public lectures on his paper \"Why indeed did the WTC buildings collapse?\", which he published on the website of the university's physics department.** Jones contended that the towers were demolished by cutter charges which had been placed throughout the buildings, probably involving an incendiary called thermite. BYU's College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences and the structural engineering faculty, followed by the university administration, disowned him. Still, Jones is no fool. He has published more than 50 scholarly papers, including pieces on cold nuclear fusion in journals such as Scientific American and Nature. He invented a cooker which uses solar power and has donated models to poor families in the developing world. Jones tells us he believes laboratory testing of dust from Ground Zero will reveal residue from a thermite reaction. As soon as the seminar is over, Jones is mobbed by people asking him to pose for photos and offering their own views on the 9/11 plot, as well as others such as the presence above our heads of chemtrails (deadly toxins sprayed by unidentified aircraft, which some believe are part of a secret global depopulation programme). This is the world Jones now inhabits - it seems a long way from a Utah physics department. I ask him later by phone if he has any regrets about publishing that fateful paper: \"No regrets.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080607ft.911_truth.txt:2:2f1855196c4a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7867, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080607ft.911_truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080607ft.911_truth", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "him to pose for photos and offering their own views on the 9/11 plot, as well as others such as the presence above our heads of chemtrails (deadly toxins sprayed by unidentified aircraft, which some believe are part of a secret global depopulation programme).

As his dogs scratch excitedly on the sliding door, Griffin explains that America's primary faith is not Christianity, but nationalism. \"Other countries do really terrible things. Our leaders never would. And that [belief] has been the biggest impediment to getting people to look at the evidence, because they just know a priori that that is ridiculous.\" Michael Meacher, UK politician \"It is clear the US authorities did little or nothing to pre-empt the events of 9/11\" Griffin now thinks the evidence to the contrary is incontrovertible. Until 2002, he had busied himself far from the rancour of public controversy writing rather obscure philosophical books and teaching philosophy of religion at the Claremont School of Theology. But the course of his research changed abruptly when he heard a visiting British theologian question the official account of 9/11. **Two years later, Griffin's *[The New Pearl Harbor](http://www.amazon.com/New-Pearl-Harbor-Disturbing-Administration/dp/1566565529/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?tag=wanttinfo-20&ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1213905117&sr=1-1)*, with a foreword by British MP Michael Meacher, became a touchstone in the 9/11 Truth movement.** He has since written others, including one detailing the \"omissions and distortions\" of the 9/11 Commission, the report of which fits the definition of \"conspiracy theory\" neatly, he says. \"They started with the conclusion that al-Qaeda did it and didn't even consider the alternative that it was an inside job.\" Griffin was a script consultant on *Loose Change Final Cut*, part of the internet phenomenon that set off the current explosion of low-budget 9/11 DVDs. The previous version was viewed more than 10 million times on Google Video, according to Vanity Fair. In 2002, armed only with a laptop and off-the-shelf video production software, Dylan Avery, an 18-year-old resident of Oneonta, New York, set about making a fictional film about discovering, with his friends, that 9/11 was orchestrated by the US government. At some point in his research, Avery had a \"Dude, this shit is real!\" moment and *[Loose Change](https://www.WantToKnow.info/060407bestdocumentary9-11)* entered the realm of agit-prop documentary. *Final Cut* makes a bold new allegation: the Twin Towers were packed with deadly", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080607ft.911_truth.txt:3:69d8ce946aea", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7868, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080607ft.911_truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080607ft.911_truth", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "Vanity Fair.

This seems to expand the circle of conspirators somewhat. Griffin ventures another possible explanation: the psychological impact. \"You had these massive explosions, which rather looked like a nuclear blast,\" he says. \"That's always been the deep fear of America. In the run-up to the Iraq war, that's what they were talking about - we cannot wait until we have a nuclear cloud.\" Griffin offers one further speculation, this time on a question which is controversial even among 9/11 sceptics: what hit the Pentagon? Thierry Meyssan was the first to claim that it was not Flight 77 - an American Airlines 757 carrying 64 passengers - but a cruise missile that hit the west wall of the Pentagon at 9.37am on September 11. Websites have followed suit, pointing to the apparent lack of plane debris on the Pentagon lawn and the fact that the hole left in the outer ring of the building looks too small to accommodate the wingspan of a 757. **Retired US Air Force captain [Russ Wittenberg](https://www.WantToKnow.info/officialsquestion911commissionreport#Wittenberg) from [Pilots for 9/11 Truth](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pilotsfor911truth.org%2F&ei=NrJaSIveOqichALD7ZC7Dg&usg=AFQjCNG0nMY2pWQrnMkgeH6RR3tU_Y7DXQ&sig2=ZkrSZrcNNKsFGSxzfxSojw) asserted that no inexperienced pilot could have performed the manoeuvre the 9/11 Commission concluded that al-Qaeda conspirator Hani Hanjour pulled off that morning: a 330 turn, 2,200ft descent, a full-throttle dive and then a 530 miles per hour plunge at ground level into the Pentagon.** Call it \"the magic plane theory\": doubters believe that, just as the bullet that killed Kennedy appeared to defy the laws of physics, so the plane that struck the Pentagon was like no other in existence. And just as Nasa was forced to counter claims the moon landings were faked, these and other claims have forced the US State Department into the debunking business. Its Identifying Misinformation website states that debris from Flight 77 was indeed recovered, as were the remains of passengers and crew. Many witnesses saw the plane come in, and a number of passengers made phone calls to their loved ones telling them their flight had been hijacked. There is also another obvious problem: if a missile hit the Pentagon, what happened to Flight 77? \"There was a rumour that an airliner", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080607ft.911_truth.txt:4:225fc085b531", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7869, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080607ft.911_truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080607ft.911_truth", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "forced the US State Department into the debunking business.

There is also another obvious problem: if a missile hit the Pentagon, what happened to Flight 77? \"There was a rumour that an airliner had gone down on the Ohio/Kentucky border and that was taken very seriously early on by the Federal Aviation Authority,\" says Griffin. It later rejected the story. But Griffin claims the only evidence that Flight 77 was aloft after that was an alleged phone call from Barbara Olsen to Ted Olsen, the solicitor-general of the United States. So how does he explain that phone call? Ted Olsen is a Bush administration insider, he says. Another possible answer, though, is \"voice-morphing technology\". This would also explain the flurry of phone calls from United Airlines Flight 93, which, as the official story has it, crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers revolted against their hijackers. Glossary of doubt **No-planers** People who claim that it wasn't an aircraft, but a missile, that hit the Pentagon on September 11 2001. Some have taken it a step further and argued that no aircraft hit the twin towers, either. What the world saw that day, these sceptics argue, was either video trickery or cruise missiles disguised through image technology as aircraft. **Mihops** Truthers who believe the US government \"Made it happen on purpose\", \"it\" being the destruction of September 11. **Lihops** A more moderate strain of truther who believe the government \"Let it happen on purpose\". [**Scholars for 9/11 Truth**](http://911scholars.org/) Started by James Fetzer, the group advocates looking at all possible explanations of what happened on September 11, no matter how improbable. **[Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice](http://stj911.org/)** The more moderate splinter group of Scholars for 9/11 Truth, led by Steven Jones. Endorses an \"evidence-based approach\" to questioning the 9/11 story. It's not just supporters of the official story who roll their eyes at these claims. They put Griffin in the camp of the \"no-planers\", at least as far as the attack on the Pentagon is concerned. The no-planers enrage the rest of the truthers, who accuse them of sabotaging the credibility of the movement. The claim that no plane hit the Pentagon is a Trojan horse, they say - disinformation that serves the conspirators. Some - such as former MI5 whistleblower David Shayler - have even asserted that no planes, but missiles disguised by \"cloaking technology\", hit the Twin Towers. Shayler, incidentally, proclaimed himself the Messiah last year. If the 9/11 truth movement is fighting a kind of asymmetric war against official sources of knowledge, it is also battling itself.

As the movement morphs into an international activist group, it recognises that if it is to convince middle Americans, it must distance itself from its exotic fringe. Once, it was the Mihops versus the Lihops. These factions, who sound like warring species from an H.G. Wells story, are those who believe the government Made It Happen On Purpose and those who think it Let It Happen On Purpose. The Mihops are in the ascendancy. The genesis of all this can be traced back to a schism that followed the first real attempt to bring scholarly credibility to the 9/11 sceptics. **In 2005, Steven Jones was invited to form a group called Scholars for 9/11 Truth by [James Fetzer](https://www.WantToKnow.info/070618professorsquestion911#Fetzer), a professor in the philosophy department at the University of Minnesota and the author of some 20 books on the philosophy of science and artificial intelligence.** Fetzer teaches critical thinking, and is nothing if not critical. He has been campaigning for more than a decade to prove that the Zapruder film is a hoax perpetuated by the same government intelligence agencies that orchestrated JFK's assassination. But within a year, Jones had written to all members of Scholars announcing that he and others no longer wanted to be associated with Fetzer, who was, in the rebels' opinion, holding them up to ridicule. Fetzer had backed a theory by Judy Wood, a former assistant professor in mechanical engineering at Clemson University, proposing that the Twin Towers were brought down by a \"directed energy\" weapon developed as part of the US government's Star Wars programme. It prompted a stampede to a new group, Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice, headed by Jones. Confusing the two groups would be like mistaking Monty Python's Judean People's Front for the People's Front of Judea: this was a major doctrinal split. Fetzer's view is that any serious inquiry into what happened on 9/11 should look at all possibilities. Supporters of the directed energy hypothesis keep popping up at 9/11 Truth lectures to heckle what Python fans might call the \"splittist\" thermite theorists. **Among the advocates of the Star Wars theory is [Morgan Reynolds](https://www.WantToKnow.info/officialsquestion911commissionreport#Reynolds), perhaps the first prominent US government official to claim that 9/11 was an inside job. At the time of the attacks, Reynolds was chief economist at the US Department of Labor.** Some Star Wars supporters, in turn, accuse proponents of the thermite hypothesis of being government shills.

One, on CheckTheEvidence.com, alleges that Jones's public denunciation of Star Wars theories is actually a Trojan horse; he notes that Jones once worked at Los Alamos, where directed energy weapons are researched. This line of conjecture also entangles Norman Mineta, US transportation secretary on September 11 2001. Mineta was the man who grounded all civilian aircraft on that morning. But he was also once vice-president of Lockheed Martin, a founding member of the Directed Energy Professional Society ... In this outer reach of the blogosphere, no one is ever more than six degrees of separation from the heart of the conspiracy. Jones did, in fact, do post-doctoral research at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility for the University of Wyoming, but he says it was peaceful and non-weapons-related. He says the more out-there theories, including those of the no-planers, are harming the movement. \"First, they discourage others who are trying to do serious work, and they tend to be quite vocal about their heckling,\" he says. \"More serious is that when we're really trying to look at an evidence-based approach, we get lumped in with these people and then dismissed as a whole.\" Two days before Jones's lecture in LA, his erstwhile colleague was taking his own campaign on the road on the other side of the country. After addressing [Student Scholars for 9/11 Truth](http://www.sst911.org/) in New Hampshire, Fetzer was off to that seat of academic respectability, Yale University. To prepare for our meeting, I watched a DVD of a 9/11 symposium he held in his new hometown of Madison, Wisconsin last year. The star of this show was Alfred Lambremont Webre, a judge on former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad's alternative international War Crimes Tribunal in Kuala Lumpur and co-author of the *Space Preservation Treaty*. He delivers what might be the most momentous opening line in the history of town hall seminars. \"Fellow Citizens... 9/11 was a false flag operation by an international war crimes racketeering organisation to provide a pretext to engage in a genocidal and ecocidal depleted uranium bombing of central Asia, Afghanistan and Iraq in order to secure vast oil and uranium reserves; to roll out a terror-based national security state system worldwide and ... to implement the final stages of a world depopulation policy.\" There are two more \"[false flag](https://www.WantToKnow.info/falseflag)\" operations in the pipeline, he says. The first is the war against asteroids, the second the \"war against the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080607ft.911_truth.txt:7:3bf335b96438", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7872, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080607ft.911_truth.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080607ft.911_truth", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "war crimes racketeering organisation to provide a pretext to engage in a genocidal and ecocidal depleted uranium bombing of central Asia, Afghanistan and Iraq in order to secure vast oil and uranium reserves; to roll out a terror-based national security state system worldwide and ... to implement the final stages of a world depopulation policy.\" There are two more \"[false flag](https://www.WantToKnow.info/falseflag)\" operations in the pipeline, he says. The first is the war against asteroids, the second the \"war against the evil aliens\". Hearing this, you either experience the thrill of revelation or the sinking feeling that the person you are listening to is having some kind of breakdown. Within 30 minutes, Webre has folded into the 9/11 plot the Skull & Bones society at Yale University - or the \"Brotherhood of Death\", as he calls it - neocon think-thank the Council on Foreign Relations, the Rothschilds, the Queen and the City of London. I wondered how all these conspiracies could be maintained without the whole conceit unravelling. The answer, of course, is that there is only one conspiracy. Pearl Harbour, the moon landing, JFK, 9/11, the Illuminati, the Black Helicopters, Skull & Bones, chemtrails: all faces of the same demon. The plot goes all the way to the top, and all the way back in time. You could come to believe that it involves everyone except yourself - at which point it's all over for you. And as I listened, I just waited for him to say the Word. And, inevitably, Webre brought it all back to the \"international neo-Zionist organisation\". I asked Fetzer about this as we sat in a cafe across from Yale, home of the Brotherhood of Death: how did he keep his scholars on message? \"It's obvious to me that you have to consider all the possible alternatives,\" he says. \"You can't exclude any, lest, as you proceed in your investigation and eliminate hypotheses, you eliminate the true hypothesis because you've never allowed it to be considered.\" Fetzer's talk later that night does not go well. A Yale student had promoted the lecture on Facebook Events, but fellow students had apparently been unwilling to add their names, which anyone can see, perhaps for fear of ridicule. Only six show up. When it becomes clear that Fetzer is implicating some kind of Star Wars weapon, the two next to me begin scrolling distractedly through their mobile phone messages. Within 10 minutes, they have left. Lewis Lapham, journalist \"Americans are very good at dreaming up these scenarios\" The conclusion of the 9/11 Commission - the official story - is that the 2001 attacks got through because those charged with protecting America had not truly conceived of the threat: in its author's evocative phrase, they had suffered a \"failure of imagination\".

After trawling the internet in search of 9/11 Truth, it seems to me the American imagination is strong. \"Americans are very good at dreaming up these scenarios,\" says Lewis Lapham, the former Harper's magazine editor and a prominent critic of the Bush administration post-September 11. \"We are open to all kinds of magical theories,\" he says, citing the continuing fascination with the assassination of JFK. \"We are also good at creating religions.\" Lapham thinks the theory that 9/11 was an inside job follows in this long tradition, but also reflects cynicism among Americans towards their government. He does not accept that the Bush administration planned 9/11 or even allowed it to happen. Nonetheless, he thinks a new investigation is warranted.** In 2004, Harper's ran a trenchant piece describing the 9/11 Commission as a \"whitewash\" and a \"cheat and a fraud\" for downplaying evidence that warnings of the al-Qaeda threat were ignored. **Such flaws allowed space for alternative theories to develop, Lapham says. In this, there are shades of the Warren Commission into the assassination of President Kennedy, which served merely to deepen popular distrust. But if we have seen the likes of the 9/11 Truth movement before, it also represents something new. \"With the Kennedy assassination, pretty soon after the events themselves there were fairly significant questions being raised by people of all types and stripes about what actually happened,\" says Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor and author of *Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture*. \"But whereas then it was a generalised, amorphous kind of response, the amount of organisation - politically and through alternative media - is far more striking now than it was back then.\" Fenster thinks that the 9/11 Truth movement is in some ways a typical American response to a surprising and traumatic event. But it also represents a step change in its use of telecommunications technology. \"One of the interesting things, particularly in the beginning of this movement, was the extent to which there were a lot of local groups in different cities organising protests ... and they could co-ordinate and create a national and international movement,\" he says. \"Whether that translates into more people actually believing in the conspiracy theory is a completely different question.\" Fenster believes the few published polls on the subject, rather than showing any real depth of suspicion about 9/11, demonstrate declining trust in the Bush administration generally.

The author of one of the most rigorous of the websites that aim to debunk the conspiracy theories, [Debunking911.com](http://www.Debunking911.com), notes that the most recent Zogby poll on attitudes towards 9/11 found only 4.6 per cent of Americans believe the Bush administration blew up the Twin Towers. \"If you follow the website hits, you'll find that since Debunking911 came into existence, conspiracy sites have been losing readership,\" he says via e-mail. \"I think all they needed was someone to fill in the parts conspiracy theorists left out of the conspiracy story and their numbers begin to shrink.\" Perhaps the 9/11 Truth movement is what one would expect in the dying days of an unpopular administration, and with no end in sight to a costly war. Whether it can maintain momentum when that government leaves office next year is anyone's guess. In the meantime, some on the left accuse it of letting the leaders they so vehemently distrust off the hook. \"They make a mockery of [civil rights] causes by associating their nonsense with genuinely important issues, and by diverting a large number of people who should know better into a unicorn hunt,\" says British writer and activist George Monbiot. Monbiot is regularly heckled by 9/11 truthers at public events after accusing them in The Guardian of undermining genuine political opposition. His first column on the truthers prompted a near-record number of postings on the paper's Comment Is Free website - 777 - many accusing him of being part of the conspiracy. \"It's very interesting to see,\" he says, \"particularly in the United States, how the anti-war movement has been largely co-opted in many places by the 9/11 Truth movement. And we desperately need an active anti-war movement, because there is a lot of reckoning to be done.\" *Peter Barber is the FT's deputy comment editor* [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8d66e778-3128-11dd-ab22-000077b07658.htm](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8d66e778-3128-11dd-ab22-000077b07658.html) Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2008 ** Important Note:** This article mentions that David Ray Griffin writes \"rather obscure philosophical books,\" when he is actually one of the [foremost theologians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ray_Griffin) in the U.S. It also mentions Michael Meacher as an MP (Member of Parliament), when he was the U.K.'s Minister of Environment from 1997 to 2003, one of the longest serving ministers in the Labour government.

Except for the place where they died, Bill Feehan and Mohamed Atta would seem to have had absolutely nothing in common. Feehan rescued people; Atta killed them. As a lifelong firefighter who rose to become first deputy commissioner of the New York City Fire Department, Feehan was directly or indirectly responsible for saving thousands of lives. As a suicidal terrorist who flew American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, Atta murdered thousands, including Bill Feehan, who was helping a woman at the base of the North Tower when the building collapsed on him. Any suggestion of moral equivalence between the two men is repugnant. And yet, it must be said, both believed in the rightness of their causes with absolute certainty. It might be more comforting to think that Atta was stark raving mad, but true madmen, who are usually dysfunctional, don't work with Atta's calm purpose. No one wants to think that even a seminormal human being-indeed, nearly a score of them-could do what the terrorists did on September 11. **In a world of moral relativism, we prefer psychological explanations; no one wishes to stare directly into the face of evil.** Virginia DiChiara did have a premonition that something wicked was on the way. DiChiara, whose office was on the 101st floor of the North Tower, had worried that the terrorists might come back to finish off the World Trade Center. She had been a block away, working at Bankers Trust at 130 Liberty Street, when terrorists bombed the WTC in 1993. But in 2000, when she got a big job as director of audit for Cantor Fitzgerald, a bond-trading firm at the top of the North Tower, she tried to put her fears out of her mind. Her corner office looked out on the Statue of Liberty far below, at the brilliant sunsets and, in the distance, to the Jersey shore, where she liked to go boating in the summer. Once a carefree sun worshiper, DiChiara will never soak up the rays in the same way again; on September 11 she sustained third-degree burns on much of her body. She had gone to hell and then, slowly, painfully, come back. **Denial is an ordinary and understandable response to calculated mass murder.

Foundation and government reports warned that it was only a matter of time before the terrorists struck America in a way that could claim thousands of lives. Yet at the White House, homeland defense was not the first job Vice President Dick Cheney got when the new administration took office last January. Cheney spent several months running a task force to solve an energy crisis that, it turns out, was probably exaggerated. His staff was just formally turning to the subject of homeland defense on September 11, when the terrorists hit. To be sure, few could have guessed at the brazenness and resourcefulness of Atta or Al Qaeda, the terrorist network that backed him and the 18 other suicide attackers. The September 11 plots had been methodically thought out and meticulously planned over at least two years. And yet a reconstruction of Atta's movements in the months leading up to the attacks shows that the terror ringleader, for all his careful planning, made numerous small blunders. His trip-ups could have been tipoffs-if only Americans had been watching. The fog of war, a term now much in vogue, was thick around the first battle in the new terror war. As FDNY First Deputy Commissioner Bill Feehan mustered his troops to combat the blazes at the Twin Towers,** there appears, in perfect hindsight, to have been an almost willful blindness toward the risk that the towers might collapse*. *Likewise, in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC), the bunker buried far below the White House where Vice President Cheney commanded the initial U.S. response*,* misinformation overwhelmed the facts.** At one point, NEWSWEEK has learned, Cheney gave an order to shoot down a hijacked civilian airliner that didn't exist-a phantom created by panic and garbled communications. That is not to say that Feehan and Cheney were anything but cool and steady in crisis. Indeed, they showed true sangfroid at some very frightening moments. We celebrate many such tales of courage on September 11-perhaps the most moving of which is the passenger revolt on the hijacked United Flight 93 that may have saved the U.S. Capitol or the White House from destruction (NEWSWEEK, Dec. 3).

It is a story of good and evil, despair and shock, determination and courage.** It begins with the strange obsession of a young Egyptian engineer more than a decade ago. ** I. A Killer's Resentments** Mohamed Atta's otherwise austere apartment in Hamburg, Germany, had a curious decoration. On his wall hung a poster of the black-and-white photograph taken by Lewis Hine in 1930 of construction workers perched on a beam of the Empire State Building high above New York. The city far below looks dwarfed and inconsequential. According to his teachers and former classmates, Atta believed that high-rise buildings had desecrated his homeland. In the ancient cities of the Middle East, the time-honored mode of construction was to build one- and two-story houses with private courtyards. The construction of towering, impersonal and usually ugly apartment blocks in the 1960s and '70s, Atta believed, had ruined the old neighborhoods, robbing their inhabitants of privacy and dignity. It may have been particularly galling to Atta that his own family had moved into an 11th-floor apartment in just such a hulking monstrosity in 1990, as he was graduating with an engineering degree from Cairo University. To Atta, the boxy building was a shabby symbol of Egypt's haphazard attempts to modernize and its shameless embrace of the West. Atta burned with desire to restore the old glories of Islam-though peaceably, at least at first. It was after the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981 that Atta, then 13, started a daily regimen of prayer. While in engineering school, Atta came under the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood, a movement aimed at creating an Islamic state and curbing Western influence. The Muslim Brotherhood officially condemns violence, though militants often emerge from its ranks. In Egypt in the late '80s, engineering schools, full of disillusioned students, were prime recruiting grounds for the Muslim Brotherhood; in the country's stagnant state-run economy, young engineering grads could look forward to low-paying, dead-end jobs in a bloated bureaucracy. Atta's parents were more ambitious for their children.

Atta's parents were more ambitious for their children. His overbearing father, the elder Mohamed Al-Amir Atta, who grandly but preposterously described himself to NEWSWEEK as \"one of the most important lawyers in Cairo,\" wanted his only son to study abroad. Only by learning German-\"the language of engineers\"-could young Atta catch up to his accomplished sisters, both of whom had doctorates. His son should go to Germany, the father decided. At first, Atta resisted; he did not want to be separated from his mother. Even in his 20s, the short, slight Atta would sometimes sit in his mother's lap. \"I used to tell her that she was raising him as a girl,\" the father scoffed, \"but she never stopped pampering him.\" There was another problem, more than a little ironic in retrospect: **Atta hated flying.** \"My daughter, who is a doctor, used to get him medicine for every journey, to combat the cramps and the vomiting he feels every time he gets on a plane,\" said the father. Atta was precise in his work. Laboring part time as a draftsman for Plankontor, an urban-planning firm in Hamburg, while he studied for his master's, he was obsessive about his drawings-extremely detailed, color-coded diagrams in fine ink. He rarely showed his feelings, but on a trip back to Cairo he revealed his disgust with the Egyptian government to a colleague, Ralph Bodenstein. The government was interested only in promoting tourism and attracting rich Westerners, Atta complained. Meanwhile, they were tearing down houses and forcing mass relocations. Atta had hoped to use his education to help set Egypt on a new path, but he often complained that his only option was working for a government he despised. \"He had ideals. He wanted to improve urban life,\" says Bodenstein. Atta scorned the United States for its support of Israel and its callousness and \"hypocrisy\" toward the Muslim world. Although Atta seethed, he did not rant. \"He did not raise his voice when he talked about politics,\" says Bodenstein, but he was \"very clear. He would have an insisting tone in his voice.\" He was, in other words, like a lot of college-age Egyptians of his time. **Atta's progression from disgruntled student to Islamic militant to terrorist appears to have been gradual and subtle. No single event explains how a mama's boy became a mass murderer.** Atta did show some psychological tics, including an almost pathological disdain for women.

In writing his will in 1996, he barred females from his funeral and grave site. But he does not appear to have been so much mad as profoundly angry. Somehow, his bitterness hardened into fanaticism and then to something like pure evil. It seems clear that his resentments were sharpened by the casual racism he encountered in Germany, where the large immigrant Muslim population is widely treated as a lower caste. He found refuge in the mosques of Hamburg, where radical mullahs enjoyed more free-speech rights than they ever would in Egypt-and sometimes acted as recruiting agents for the terrorist underground. Atta's search for Islamic purity deepened on a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1995; possibly, he fell in with Al Qaeda operatives who fished for possible terrorists among the true believers. The most obvious turning point came in 1997, when Atta traveled to Afghanistan and enrolled in one of Osama bin Laden's training camps. There, in a cultlike atmosphere designed to break waverers and forge implacable hatreds, Atta was taught dark arts like bomb building and chemical weaponry. Egyptians were given special treatment in these camps. While not physically robust, Atta appears to have been picked out for a leadership role. His hard stare alone was enough to compel obedience. When he returned to Hamburg in 1998 it was to set up a terror cell: two of his roommates, Marwan Al-Shehhi and Ziad Samir Jarrah, would join him as suicide hijackers. The three men all came from solid middle-class families who were multilingual, computer literate and highly educated. Atta did not abandon his purely intellectual pursuits. While he plotted to bring down the World Trade Center, he diligently continued his urban-planning studies at Hamburg Technical University. His thesis was on the restoration of Aleppo, an ancient Syrian city, to its pure Islamic past-devoid of skyscrapers. It was awarded a B-plus. Atta was intelligent and certainly determined. But his drawn-out preparation to become a suicide-squad wing commander was dotted with red flags. It is painful, in hindsight, to realize that if the authorities had spotted any of them, the September 11 attacks might have been headed off. **At the outset, beginning in 1998, Atta's Hamburg apartment at Marienstrasse 54 was under surveillance by German federal investigators who knew that its occupants were in touch with a suspected bin Laden operative, Mamoun Darkazanli (Darkazanli says he is innocent of any wrongdoing).

They were saved only by the willingness of both officials and ordinary people to look the other way.** Atta antagonized his instructors, his landlords and just about everyone he came in contact with by staring coldly and behaving arrogantly. His efforts to be polite (he brought his landlady cookies) could not conceal his contempt for women. One day Atta was flying with a fellow student, a woman named Anne Greaves. As they sat in the cockpit of a plane, Atta reached in and grabbed her seat cushion. Surprised, Greaves tried to wrestle it from his grasp, but Al-Shehhi lunged forward, putting his arm between them. \"To protect him in a way,\" Greaves recalls. \"I remember thinking, 'What on earth could they be frightened of?' \" Rudy Dekkers, the owner of Huffman Aviation in Venice, Fla., was on the verge of kicking out Atta and Al-Shehhi in September 2000 when the two men abruptly switched to Jones Aviation Service in Sarasota. They quickly made themselves unwelcome with careless flying and rudeness, and returned to Huffman, where they finally won their instrument-grade pilot's licenses that December. **In one extraordinary incident, they rented a plane that stalled on the runway at Miami International Airport. Atta and Al-Shehhi simply got out and walked away, abandoning the plane on the runway of the nation's ninth busiest airport at the height of the Christmas season.** (The FAA later reviewed the plane's maintenance records, but no action was taken.) Atta's behavior was suspicious as well as obnoxious. In the spring of 2001 he flew to Tennessee to a small airport in the Appalachian mountains and began asking pointed questions of one of the airport regulars, Dan Whitener. \"Tell me about this chemical factory we flew over,\" Atta said, pointing to a plant that once manufactured sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid. Then he asked about a local water reservoir and whether it connected with a river flowing by two nearby nuclear power plants. When he had gone, Whitener turned to his friend John Rutkowsky and described the strange interaction. \"Danny, sounds like terrorists,\" Rutkowsky joked. Atta had two brushes with the authorities. His tourist visa had expired when he came back from a trip to Spain in January 2001, but he convinced Customs officials that he was waiting for a student visa. **He got pulled over by police in April while driving without a license north of Miami", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:5:8f6c22cfffdb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7882, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "two nearby nuclear power plants.

A warrant for his arrest was filed but forgotten.** As the terrorists' D-Day approached, Atta and his henchman made a nuisance of themselves on a last night out on the town. At Shuckums, a sports bar in Hollywood, Fla., Al-Shehhi knocked back five vodkas and began to complain that the food was bad and the cocktails were weak. He harangued the barmaid who was trying to collect the check. As late as the second to the last night, Atta and Al-Shehhi were dropping clues about their malignant design: checking out of their motel in Florida, they left behind flight manuals, an eight-inch stack of high-quality aeronautical maps covering every state on the East Coast, three martial-arts manuals and a box cutter. Atta spent the final 24 hours of his life with Abdulaziz Alomari, a Saudi Arabian who had slipped into the United States that summer to be one of the musclemen for the hijackers. Atta and Alomari rented a car and drove to Portland, Maine. They would spend the night there before flying to Boston to join the three other men who would hijack American Airlines Flight 11 bound for Los Angeles. (Apparently, Atta thought that five Middle Easterners checking in all at once might turn heads; Al Qaeda's detailed and precise terrorist-training manual suggests that hijackers enter airport security from a \"secondary station\" to deflect attention.) In Portland on the evening of Sept. 10, Atta and Alomari stopped at a Pizza Hut, visited two ATMs and spent 20 minutes at a local Wal-Mart. Captured on security cameras, the men appear relaxed, confident. Alomari is grinning. Atta and Alomari were so casual that they nearly blundered: arriving at security at 5:45 a.m., they had to rush to catch the 6 a.m. commuter flight to Boston, nearly missing their connection to Flight 11. It seems hard to imagine, but perhaps they overslept*.* * ***II. 'The Monsignor'** On Monday, Sept. 10, Bill Feehan, the first deputy commissioner of the New York City Fire Department, was contemplating retirement. An aide asked Feehan if he would be willing to stay on in the next city administration. \"Absolutely,\" answered the deputy commissioner, but he understood that a new mayor would almost certainly want his own team come January.

Feehan was 71 years old. Most firefighters retire before they reach 60. One of Feehan's aides had seen nascent signs that his boss was ready to call it quits. In the lobby of FDNY headquarters in downtown Brooklyn, there is a wall-size plaque for all the firefighters who have perished in the line of duty. The memorial had room for 780 names. Since 1865, when the FDNY was officially organized, the memorial had been nearly filled with 778 names. When Feehan returned from lunch with his friend and comrade Deputy Commissioner Tom Fitzpatrick a couple of weeks before September 11, the two noticed that workmen were touching up the addition of three names from a devastating Father's Day fire in Astoria, Queens. \"I want to be out of here before that plaque is full,\" said Feehan. Feehan's friends and family, however, were worried that he'd hate retirement. \"I don't want it to be just me and the squirrels in the backyard,\" he often told colleagues and family. In a real sense, Feehan was the New York City Fire Department. He had been in the department since 1959 and had held every job, from \"proby\" fireman to acting commissioner. Since his wife, Betty, had died in 1996, he had taken one vacation, arriving at work at 7 a.m., often leaving after 8 p.m. and on call all the time. His staff dubbed him \"Yoda\" because of his age and his institutional wisdom. Firefighting was a calling for Feehan's family. His father had been a fireman; a nephew, one of his sons and his son-in-law were all firemen. Although Feehan had risen through the bureaucracy, he saw himself as a firefighter whose proper place was at the fire ground. He preferred to be called \"Chief\" rather than the stuffier \"Commissioner.\" Feehan was fiercely protective of the close, almost clannish culture of the FDNY. In the early 1990s, when the then Mayor David Dinkins objected to the low number of women and minorities in the FDNY-which is still more than 90 percent white males-Feehan warned against ruining the FDNY's \"camaraderie\" and \"esprit de corps.\" \"Listen,\" he declared at a city hall hearing. \"Maybe we should recruit on the black radio stations... But don't talk about the Fire Department culture, because that is the culture that gets ordinary men to run into burning buildings and do extraordinary things.\" In Feehan's office hung a poster of Korean War soldiers patrolling a lonely road.** Feehan never talked about it, but he had won two Purple", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:7:c5d2d48b5708", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7884, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "white males-Feehan warned against ruining the FDNY's \"camaraderie\" and \"esprit de corps.\" \"Listen,\" he declared at a city hall hearing. \"Maybe we should recruit on the black radio stations...

It was important, he believed, for them not to know too much. Warriors and rescuers had to be willing to act on blind faith.** In Korea, Feehan told his buddy Tom Fitzpatrick, his commanders would tell his company to take a hill and hold it no matter what. \"I'd look on my side and see 1,000 troops, and I'd look across the other side and see 100,000, and I'd say, 'OK, we're going to hold this, but they outnumber us 100 to 1. How does this work?' \" Better, thought Feehan, not to ask. Feehan could be acerbic. \"That guy,\" he said about one recently appointed fire marshal, \"couldn't find a Jew in Jerusalem.\" And he had no use for whiners and malingerers who took advantage of the FDNY's liberal policy on medical leave. \"You misplaced the boots?\" he demanded of a firefighter who had trouble hanging on to his equipment. \"Where did you misplace the boots? Did you lose your feet?\" But he also had a sentimental side. He would sit for hours at the bedside of a wounded firefighter, and he always ended his banquet speeches with \"May God hold you in the palm of his hand.\" Fitzpatrick teasingly called Feehan \"The Monsignor.\" A creature of routines and habits, Feehan began September 11, as he did every morning, by rising before dawn, putting on a suit and tie and climbing into his department-issue black Grand Marquis sedan at a little before 6. He pulled into his usual parking space at the North Shore Diner in Queens, sat in his usual booth and ate two eggs over easy and bacon while he read the New York Daily News. (Feehan often ate fruit for lunch; \"I gotta lose some weight,\" he would say, though at 6 feet, 180 pounds, he was reasonably fit.) At about 6:45, he picked up the cup of coffee (light milk, no sugar) that was always waiting for him by the cash register. He went out the door into the first bright rays of sun and said, \"Looks like it's going to be a nice day.\" **III.

'Oh My God, Oh My God!'** If Atta had followed his own instructions that morning, carefully written out in a document entitled \"The Last Night,\" he had shaved excess hair from his body, dabbed on cologne and sharpened his knife. He was instructed to pray, continuously, in the cab, in the airport, on the flight to Boston and as he took his seat in the first-class cabin on Flight 11. \"Be happy,\" he had written himself, \"optimistic, calm, because you are heading for a deed God loves and will accept. It will be the day, God willing, you spend with the women of paradise.\" American Airlines Flight 11 took off from Boston's Logan airport at 7:59 a.m. with 81 passengers and 11 crew members. Breakfast was supposed to be served after they reached cruising altitude; the movie was \"Dr. Dolittle 2.\" **But at 8:13 the plane's pilot did not acknowledge a flight controller's instructions to climb to 35,000 feet. The controllers wondered: an electrical problem? Then on the radarscope, the plane's blip suddenly turned south. A few minutes later American Airlines supervisors on the ground received grim, frantic calls from two flight attendants in coach class: Middle Eastern men had attacked a passenger and two flight attendants in first class and slit their throats. They had stormed the cockpit and gained control of the plane.** On the ground, an American Airlines supervisor asked one of the flight attendants if she knew their location. The woman, Madeline Amy Sweeney, replied, \"I see water and buildings. Oh my God, oh my God!\" The water was the Hudson River. The buildings were New York City. Investigators believe that Atta was at the controls of Flight 11 as the airliner, filled with 20,000 gallons of jet fuel, roared at 500 miles an hour straight at the top floors of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. His instructions said: \"Either end your life while praying, seconds before the target, or make your last words: 'There is no God but God, Mohammad is His messenger'.\" One wonders what his face looked like. The chilling, dead stare, now so familiar from his photographs? Or was he, at last, smiling? **IV.

The elevator door opened and she pressed the button for 101. It was 8:46 a.m. As the elevator doors closed, Flight 11 plowed into the northern face of Tower 1 some 20 floors above. The elevator went black and \"bounced around like a ball,\" DiChiara recalls. \"I remember seeing two lines shooting around the top of the elevator\"-electrical cables that had come loose and were spitting current-and \"everybody started screaming.\" In front of her was a man named Roy Bell, who later said that the sound of impact was \"deafening,\" like someone banging a 2-by-2-foot sheet of aluminum with a hammer \"six inches from your head.\" The right wall of the elevator car crashed into Bell, breaking several of his fingers and flinging him to the left side. Miraculously, the elevator doors remained open about a foot. Within seconds, Bell \"just sprinted\" out of the elevator, he recalls. \"Inside was not where you wanted to be.\" DiChiara had crouched down behind Bell. She saw Bell go through, and thought, \"I don't hear any screaming, so I know he's not on fire... I'm outta here.\" She decided to go for it. But as she gathered herself, huge blue flames-translucent teardrops of fire, a foot in diameter-began falling in a steady curtain. DiChiara dropped her bag, covered her face with her palms and squeezed through the door, her elbows pushing the black rubber guards on the elevator doors. Left behind was her Cantor co-worker. DiChiara never saw her again; at times she feels guilty that she made it out and her co-worker did not. **DiChiara was aflame when she emerged from the elevator. \"I remember hearing my hair on fire,\" she says. (She later joked, \"I must have put on some extra hair spray.\") With her hands she tapped out the fire. \"I got it out, I got it,\" she said to herself. Then, feeling something else, she looked back and saw flames rising", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:10:501a2fa8e3d1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7887, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "DiChiara never saw her again; at times she feels guilty that she made it out and her co-worker did not. **DiChiara was aflame when she emerged from the elevator. \"I remember hearing my hair on fire,\" she says.

Then, feeling something else, she looked back and saw flames rising from her shoulder. In that instant, she remembered the old lesson from grade school: stop, drop and roll. She threw herself to the carpeted floor and rolled over and over, frantically patting out the flames. \"I remember getting up and just looking at myself,\" she says. \" 'OK, everything's out.'** And then sort of laughing, almost like a hysteria, like a little giggle, like, 'Oh my God, let me do it again just in case I missed it.' I was so scared, like there was an ember on my body that was still going to go up.\" DiChiara crawled some 20 feet down the hallway and sat with her back propped against a wall. She was wearing a sleeveless cotton shirt that day, and her arms and hands were seared with third-degree burns. In shock, she did not feel the pain-yet. Improbably prosaic thoughts crossed her mind. In the briefcase she'd left on the elevator were some airplane tickets recently purchased for a vacation jaunt to the Florida Keys, as well as a wad of cash. Should she go back and retrieve it? \"No,\" she thought to herself. \"Just stay right where you are.\" Then she spotted a co-worker, Ari Schonbrun, head of global accounts receivable at Cantor. \"Ari!\" she called out. He turned around and looked at her. \"Virginia! Oh my God!\" he said. \"Ari, I'm badly burned,\" Virginia told him. She was gradually realizing how grave her condition truly was, and beginning to feel it as well. \"I'm in so much pain,\" she said. Schonbrun was horrified. \"The skin was peeled off her arms,\" he says. \"You knew this woman was in trouble.\" DiChiara read his expression. \"I knew by the look on his face that I was bad,\" she says. Schonbrun told her, \"Virginia, take it easy. We're going to get help. Don't worry. You're going to be fine.\" She begged, \"Whatever you do, don't leave me.\" Schonbrun reassured her, \"I'm not going to leave you. I'll be with you.\" The hallways were smoky, suffused with the nauseating smell of burned jet fuel, littered with debris and completely dark save for some outdoor light filtering in from windows at the end of the hall. Schonbrun gently guided DiChiara toward a small security office behind the elevator banks where the lights still worked. About a dozen people were huddled there, including two security guards.

Schonbrun gently guided DiChiara toward a small security office behind the elevator banks where the lights still worked. About a dozen people were huddled there, including two security guards. DiChiara lay down on the floor, on the verge of passing out. A woman sitting nearby was crying. One of the security guards was furiously dialing for help on the office phone but couldn't get through. The other guard had a radio, but she was paralyzed, crying. Schonbrun told her, \"You've got to calm down. You've got to get on that radio and get us help.\" The guard tried, but the only sound coming over the radio was a cacophony of screams. Singed by his narrow escape through the elevator doors, Bell had also made it to the security office. His doctors would later tell him that the few seconds between his exit and DiChiara's made the difference between his second-degree and her third-degree burns. Suddenly, a man appeared saying that he was a fire warden. There was a stairwell in the middle of the tower that they could use, he announced. Schonbrun leaned over DiChiara and laid out the options: either they could wait for someone to rescue them, or they could start heading down by foot. For DiChiara, there was no choice. No way was she going to sit there and wait. Gritting her teeth, she got up and headed for the stairwell. ** V. A Floor A Minute** Hey, boss!\" yelled Peter Guidetti, Feehan's longtime driver and personal aide. \"I think you better see this!\" \"Bill!\" yelled Ray Goldbach, the fire commissioner's executive assistant. \"A plane went into the World Trade Center!\" Both men were looking out the window, which faced west from the FDNY headquarters in Brooklyn, across the East River toward downtown Manhattan. They could see smoke swirling from the top floors of the North Tower. Bill Feehan emerged from his office and looked out at the far-off conflagration. \"Oh my God!\" he said. He paused only a second before ordering, \"Let's go!\" Some of the secretaries began crying and sobbing. \"Oh, for God's sake, calm down,\" Feehan interrupted. \"What's the matter, you never saw an airplane hit a building before?\" An avid student of fires, Feehan had closely studied the last collision between an airplane and a skyscraper: the foggy morning in 1945 when a B-25 bomber had plowed into the Empire State Building between the 78th and 79th floors. Feehan had marveled at how one of the bomber's engines had penetrated an elevator shaft and plummeted to the basement like a bomb. Feehan's men-Guidetti, Goldbach and two", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:12:d9c216942d32", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7889, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "\"What's the matter, you never saw an airplane hit a building before?\" An avid student of fires, Feehan had closely studied the last collision between an airplane and a skyscraper: the foggy morning in 1945 when a B-25 bomber had plowed into the Empire State Building between the 78th and 79th floors. Feehan had marveled at how one of the bomber's engines had penetrated an elevator shaft and plummeted to the basement like a bomb. Feehan's men-Guidetti, Goldbach and two other deputy commissioners, Tom McDonald and Tom Fitzpatrick-began rushing to the elevator. \"Now, hold it, guys,\" said Feehan, wearing a wry smile, holding his arms to the side and waving his palms down, like a teacher calming rambunctious schoolchildren. \"Do we really want to run to this? Or should we walk to it?\" Feehan was following an old dictum: \"Firemen should never run.\" It was important to stay calm, to size up the job before rushing in. Yet in the car, racing across the Brooklyn Bridge, Feehan was visibly bothered when he was unable to raise the FDNY dispatcher on the radio. \"Car 2 to Manhattan,\" Feehan said. \"Car 2 en route to the World Trade Center incident.\" No response. At the wheel, driver Guidetti glanced over at his boss and saw something he had never seen before: Feehan looked apprehensive, even a little scared. The people in the car fell silent. No one discussed strategy. They could see the North Tower in the distance, billowing black smoke from its upper floors. Finally McDonald said, a little lamely, \"This is going to be a job and a half.\" The five men in the car knew that the chances of rescuing anyone on the floors above the fire were slim to none. In his head, Fitzpatrick did some simple math. As a rule of thumb, heavily laden firemen advance up the stairs of a burning building at the rate of a floor a minute. At that speed, it would take the men an hour and a half before they even reached the fire. Feehan's drollery reappeared. \"You think this'll put a damper on the primaries?\" he asked. New York's voters were scheduled to go to the polls that day to choose Democratic and Republican nominees for mayor. Guidetti parked the big Grand Marquis half on the sidewalk at the corner of Broadway and Dey streets, two blocks from the burning North Tower. He popped the trunk, and the men clambered out of the car to pull on their \"turnout\" coats (an old term for firemen who \"turn out\" for blazes). Each coat, made of a fire-resistant synthetic weave and emblazoned with fluorescent stripes and the owner's last name, weighs 20 pounds. \"Well, Tom,\" Feehan said, putting his hand on the shoulder of his old chum Fitzpatrick, \"this is going to be one for the history books.\" Both men were amateur history", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:13:ab06e351d8e3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7890, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "Tower.

(\"Some social life you guys have,\" their colleagues would tease. \"Going home every night to watch the History Channel.\") As Feehan and his team made their way to the burning building, thousands of stunned people streamed by. Some were crying; others looked dazed. Feehan's driver, Guidetti, called out, \"People, get out of here. This building's coming down.\" His gut instinct was telling him the building would not stand. Yet he was reassured by the memory of a conversation he had had almost 25 years earlier. Guidetti had been chatting with an architectural engineer who had stopped by the firehouse one day. **Guidetti had asked the man what would happen if a large commercial airliner filled with jet fuel hit the 80th story of one of the Twin Towers. Would it topple the 30 floors above? The architect thought not. The building, he said, had been designed and constructed in such a way to prevent that kind of disaster.** Guidetti did not bring up his concern with Feehan. None of the men even mentioned the possibility that the buildings might collapse altogether. They just walked, double-time now, toward the fire. **VI. 'It Was A Clear Day'** In his office in the west wing of the White House, Dick Cheney was staring at the TV image of smoke pouring from the hole high in the North Tower. The vice president was characteristically unexcitable. He almost never raised his voice. At meetings he rarely spoke unless he needed to, and then in a low, dry monotone that compelled others to lean forward to hear him. Cheney was decisive, but he did not jump to conclusions. As he watched the early news bulletins, the vice president was mostly puzzled. \"I was sitting there thinking about it,\" he recalls. \"It was a clear day, there was no weather problem-how in hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center?*\"* Around the White House, top officials were disturbed by the fragmentary reports, but not enough to alter their routines. Across a small driveway from the West Wing, in his ornate office in the Old Executive Office Building, I. Lewis (Scooter) Libby, the vice president's chief of staff and national-security adviser, was talking with his top deputy, Eric Edelman. It was only 9 in the morning, but the two White House aides were already running late, caught up in a discussion about the stalled peace process", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:14:2f5cffde2769", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7891, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "officials were disturbed by the fragmentary reports, but not enough to alter their routines.

It was only 9 in the morning, but the two White House aides were already running late, caught up in a discussion about the stalled peace process in the Middle East. Waiting in Libby's outer office was Adm. Steve Abbot, who was slated to run a new vice presidential task force on homeland defense against terrorism. Libby's assistant, Jenny Mayfield, popped her head into the office to tell them the TV networks were reporting that a plane had struck the World Trade Center. \"Do they think it's terrorism?\" Libby asked*. *Mayfield said no one was sure; it appeared that a small plane had hit the building. Libby turned on his television set, but turned it off again; he did not want to be distracted from the Middle East conversation*.* A few minutes later Mayfield walked back into the office and said, \"This is one of the most chilling things I've ever seen.\" She marched over and turned on the TV. \"That's very unlike her, so I knew it was serious,\" says Libby. The three of them watched, horrified, as the unmistakable silhouette of a commercial airliner sailed in from the right of the TV screen straight into the South Tower, which suddenly blossomed with an explosion. \"We looked at each other,\" Edelman recalls, \"and said, 'That's no accident'.\" Down in her West Wing corner office, the president's national-security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, heard about the crash into the North Tower as she was getting ready to go to a meeting of her top staffers before 9 a.m. \"I thought to myself, what an odd accident,\" Rice recalls. **She picked up the phone and called President Bush*, *who was in Sarasota, Fla., visiting an elementary school to push his education bill. The president asked her: what kind of plane?** She passed along the first press reports, that a twin-engine plane had struck the tower*. *\"That's all we know right now, Mr. President,\" she said. Bush went on to meet with the second graders. ***[Editorial Note: President Bush later [publicly claimed](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-facts#bushplane) to have watched the first plane go into the WTC, something which would have been quite impossible. How could he have mistaken this?]*** Rice went to her usual national-security staff meeting and started working around the table, asking for reports on various global hot spots. She was \"about three people in,\" she recalls, when her assistant handed her a note saying that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center. \"I thought, 'This is a terrorist attack'.\" She would replay the moment again and again in her mind;", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:15:106b00b31f28", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7892, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "WTC, something which would have been quite impossible.

Her aides recall that she stopped talking in midsentence. \"I have to go,\" she said. She got up abruptly and began walking, quickly, to the White House Situation Room*.* **VII. A Fiery Descent** Virginia Dichiara never heard united airlines Flight 175 slam into the South Tower. As she made her way to the stairway on the 78th floor of the burning North Tower at 9 a.m., all she could think about was trying to put one foot in front of the other. She did stop to take a last look in the direction of the elevator she had escaped from; it was no longer there. \"It was a black hole,\" she says. Once at the stairwell, \"I remember seeing '78',\" DiChiara recalls, \"and I said to Ari, 'How the hell am I going to do it?' 'Don't worry,' he replied. 'You're going to make it'.\" They set off down the stairs, with Bell in the lead, followed by Schonbrun and then DiChiara. \"Virginia,\" Schonbrun said to her, \"if you have to fall, fall forward. Fall on me.\" That Schonbrun, of all people, ended up helping her that day was an irony not lost on DiChiara. When she arrived at Cantor last year, she conducted her first audit on Schonbrun's unit at the time, the business-administration department. \"Needless to say, she was not my best friend,\" Schonbrun now says. \"He had the first case of full review, inside out,\" says DiChiara, a feisty woman with a penchant for sarcasm and a hoarse Brooklyn accent. \"I beat the crap out of him.\" Their relationship remained cold and strained. A year later, here he was offering her succor in the midst of disaster. At one point in their descent, DiChiara looked at Schonbrun and said, \"Ari, of all people, huh?\" Steadily, they worked their way down the stairwell, which was illuminated with fluorescent lights and was clear of smoke. They hadn't descended more than five floors when Schonbrun's cell phone rang-a miracle in a building in which you could rarely, if ever, get a signal in its upper reaches. It was Schonbrun's wife. \"Honey, I'm fine,\" he told her. \"I'm in the stairwell. We're on our way down... But I've really got to go. It's not a good time.\" They continued down the stairs, Schonbrun counting out the floors for DiChiara-50, 49, 48. \"You're", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:16:23491f115bbb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7893, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 17, "text": "and was clear of smoke.

It's not a good time.\" They continued down the stairs, Schonbrun counting out the floors for DiChiara-50, 49, 48. \"You're doing great,\" he would tell her. \"Just keep going.\" DiChiara fixated on one thought: \"One foot in front of the other.\" She held her arms out, Frankenstein style, careful not to let anyone or anything touch them. Her body was so charged with adrenaline that she doesn't recall feeling any pain at that point. A robust 5-foot-9 woman, she was fortunate that her legs were uninjured and muscular-and that she was wearing flats. Before long, they came upon other people. As the stairwell grew more crowded, Schonbrun kept people away from DiChiara's arms and began calling out, \"I've got a burn victim here. Please step to the right. Let us through.\" Everybody moved aside. **Some people were visibly shocked when they saw DiChiara, with her matted hair, singed eyebrows, beet-red face caked with soot and arms shedding skin. One woman screamed at the sight of her-which horrified DiChiara. \"God, Ari, what do I look like?\" she asked him. \"It's OK,\" he told her. \"You'll be fine.\"** Eventually they came across firefighters loaded with gear, trudging their way up the stairs. Everyone stepped aside to let them pass, watching them in awe. By the time DiChiara made it to the 23d floor she was exhausted. There the party came across a man named Michael Sadis, who had asked a firefighter to crack open a vending machine fully stocked with water and Snapple. One stroke of an ax was all it took. Sadis was handing out drinks on the landing, an area that was crowded with people descending and 15 or 20 firefighters who had set up a staging area. One of DiChiara's companions gave her water to guzzle and poured another bottle on her arms and hands. The water was a relief for DiChiara, who was parched from her burns. The scene was hectic. In the crush of people, \"one lady was freaking out, raising people's tension level,\" says Sadis. Some people screamed; others sought to calm nerves; others blessed the firefighters heading straight up into the inferno. \"You're looking in their eyes and you could see the courage,\" says Bell. \"It gave you inner peace. You felt you were guarded.\" After a brief rest, DiChiara and her party continued their trek down. By the time they got near the bottom of the stairwell, they were ankle deep in water from the sprinklers. \"Whatever you do, don't slip,\" DiChiara told herself.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:17:a4e640d8d3e3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7894, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 18, "text": "people screamed; others sought to calm nerves; others blessed the firefighters heading straight up into the inferno. \"You're looking in their eyes and you could see the courage,\" says Bell. \"It gave you inner peace.

By the time they got near the bottom of the stairwell, they were ankle deep in water from the sprinklers. \"Whatever you do, don't slip,\" DiChiara told herself. When she emerged from the stairwell, she recalls, dirty water was dripping on her raw flesh. \"It was horrendous,\" she says. By now, it was around 9:30 a.m. and she was with Schonbrun in the first floor of the mall adjacent to the lobby of the North Tower. Cops directed them to a triage center that had been set up outside the World Trade Center complex, across Church Street in front of the Millenium Hilton. They made it up an escalator and out into the street. It was mayhem-sirens wailing, people yelling, fire trucks and ambulances screaming past. Above, both towers were spewing black smoke. DiChiara seemed to see blood wherever she turned. \"If I saw too much red, my head would snap around the other way so fast,\" she recalls. \"I didn't want to see it. I just looked down at the ground.\" Schonbrun led her to an ambulance at the triage center. A paramedic directed her to sit on the curb next to a man who, she says, was \"head-to-toe blood.\" DiChiara couldn't bear it and walked away. She told the paramedic, \"I'm going to freak the guy out, because he's going to see by the look on my face how bad he is.\" So the paramedics sat her in the ambulance with two other victims, giving her water, clipping her shirt and bra off and draping her in a gown. \"I'm going to pass out,\" she told Schonbrun. Now seemingly safe outside the tower, DiChiara became more conscious of her pain. \"It was like someone was tearing the skin off of me,\" she says. \"It was excruciating.\" She rocked herself back and forth. She didn't pass out, and was alert enough to give Schonbrun the phone numbers of her mother in Brooklyn Heights and a friend in New Jersey. She looked up at her rescuer and new friend. \"Thank you, Ari,\" she said. **VIII. Marshaling The Troops** Feehan and his men had just reached the world Trade Center Plaza when United Flight 175 crashed into the second tower. They felt a sudden flash of heat and smelled jet fuel. Objects began raining down. A strut. A truss. A brake drum. An airplane wheel, minus its tire, landed 10 yards away from Feehan and his group as they ducked and dodged across the plaza. For a moment, Fitzpatrick was sorry he had not worn his helmet. Then he", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:18:84fd23de2895", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7895, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "Feehan and his men had just reached the world Trade Center Plaza when United Flight 175 crashed into the second tower.

An airplane wheel, minus its tire, landed 10 yards away from Feehan and his group as they ducked and dodged across the plaza. For a moment, Fitzpatrick was sorry he had not worn his helmet. Then he figured that the stuff falling from the sky could kill him regardless. A man emerging from the lobby of 2 WTC was cut in half by a falling sheet of glass. Fitzpatrick tried not to concentrate on the body parts strewn on the ground. He couldn't ignore the jumpers. They were flying out of the black gash in the side of the North Tower, from floors 94 through 99, where the plane had struck, as well as from the floors above. Danny Suhr, a fireman from Engine 216, became the first FDNY casualty as he rushed toward the North Tower and was flattened by a female jumper. Bodies were landing with audible rushes of air, muffled thuds and thick red splashes that looked like paint. Inside both towers, elevators like the one Virginia DiChiara had barely escaped became massive metal coffins. Some were sheared from their cables by the planes' impact. Filled with jet fuel, they dropped like bombs, just like the B-25 engine during the Empire State Building crash of 1945. Feehan and his men made it safely under the overhang of 5 World Trade Center. \"This is unbelievable, isn't it?\" said Feehan to Fitzpatrick. \"This is history. This is not a coincidence. This is an attack.\" Feehan and Fitzpatrick had whiled away hours discussing the battle strategies of Civil War generals. Now, Fitzpatrick thought, we are the generals. They needed to get organized, to marshal their troops. To lead. Feehan and Fitzpatrick and the others made for the lobby of the North Tower. Fitzpatrick was relieved to see that there was no real panic. Rivers of people flowed by, strikingly well ordered, he thought, and eerily quiet. No one was burned that he could see. They entered the grand, marbled command post of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the government agency that runs New York's airports, harbor, bridges and tunnels. Television screens covered the walls. **Someone had unrolled blueprints on a conference table.** **[Note: Blueprints were withheld from investigators after 9/11.

Why?] ** Port Authority officials hastily briefed the FDNY men. Typically, they said, about 50,000 workers occupied the Twin Towers at the height of the working day. Now, at almost 9:15 a.m., they estimated that half that many had arrived. Two fire companies, Engine 10 and Ladder 10, from the Liberty Street Station, had arrived on the scene within a few minutes. Scores of firemen were pouring in (all told, some 600 FDNY men would work the two towers in their last 100 minutes; 343 would die). The men were climbing stairs under staggering loads of state-of-the-art gear. The helmet ($216), turnout coat ($1,038), bunker pants ($776), leather boots ($250), compressed-air cylinders for breathing ($2,300), radios ($900) and assorted axes and hand tools weighed between 80 and 100 pounds per man. The last transmissions from FDNY radios would come from the 55th floor. The enormity of the job ahead was starting to sink in. \"We're going to need a recall,\" said Feehan. A \"recall\" meant calling in every FDNY firehouse and all of the 11,228 firefighters. No one had given an order like that since the blizzard of 1947. Staging it would require the use of Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium. In the meantime, Feehan had to bring some order to the units rushing to the scene. He began rattling off commands. He wanted Brooklyn units lined up on West Street, the major north-south thoroughfare through the financial district. As Feehan spoke and conferred with the others, a massive chunk of marble fell off the lobby wall. It was time, they agreed, to find a new headquarters. Feehan and his team made a run for it on a walkway across West Street linking the North Tower to the World Financial Center. Bodies and debris were still raining down. The fire engines lining up on West Street were streaked with blood and littered with body parts from jumpers on the North Tower's west face. The heavy rigs rolled over human limbs. An arm got stuck in a wheel well. (The first half-dozen rigs would be crushed by rubble when the buildings fell.) Feehan saw a civilian with a high-end digital video camera panning vertically, over and over, capturing the doomed jumpers. Many were using makeshift parachutes made from drapes or tablecloths. For a second or two the canopies billowed out and broke the fall-before being torn free by the rush of air. Feehan walked up to the photographer, enraged. \"Don't you have any human decency?\" he shouted. \"Shut that f---ing thing off!\" Startled, the man ran away. In the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, Feehan and the others set up a command post.

In the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, Feehan and the others set up a command post. For a few minutes, Feehan and a clutch of FDNY top brass stepped outside onto a driveway running parallel to West Street. The oblique angle made it difficult to see the top of the towers. It was hard to assess the damage. **Several of the officials wondered aloud if the fire was burning itself out.** **There was general agreement that the buildings were stronger than the planes that had hit them.** **They assumed that the airliners had been shredded into thousands of pieces by the steel facing on the buildings, four inches thick, and 47 top-to-bottom core columns thick as sofas.** They did not stop to consider the effect of the burning jet fuel on the steel. All firefighters are taught that steel softens at 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit. And any firefighter can tell you that the head of a match burns at 2,000 degrees. But no one seemed to contemplate the heat of burning aviation fuel, which reaches 3,000 degrees. The firemen were on their own. No engineers were present. Feehan turned his attention back to the logistics of rescue. He and Fitzpatrick noticed two medics carrying a stretcher stacked with oxygen and other supplies south down West Street. A few seconds later they observed another medic team carrying a stretcher laden with equipment heading north. \"We gotta get this organized,\" said Feehan. He ordered the ambulances to \"stage\"-line up-north of the fire trucks on West Street, pick up the wounded and shoot uptown or down through the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. From time to time he would mutter his refrain, \"This is one for the history books.\" **IX. The Highest Levels** At about 9:35 a.m., Vice President Cheney was standing by his desk, looking at the TV in the corner. A Secret Service agent said to him, in a tone that brooked no dissent, \"Sir, we have to leave now.*\" *The agent grabbed the vice president by the back of his belt and aimed him at the door. \"They practice this,\" says Cheney. \"You move. Whether you want to be moved or not, you're going. They don't exactly pick you up and carry you. It's more like they propel you forward.\" Cheney was unflappable about his hasty exit. As he was swept through the outer office, the vice president reached out and grabbed a magazine, a copy of that week's Economist, off the table. \"I'm always carrying something in case I get hung up someplace,\" Cheney explains. \"I've got to have something to read.\" Down the hallway, past the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:21:c9e9740e699d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7898, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "be moved or not, you're going.

As he was swept through the outer office, the vice president reached out and grabbed a magazine, a copy of that week's Economist, off the table. \"I'm always carrying something in case I get hung up someplace,\" Cheney explains. \"I've got to have something to read.\" Down the hallway, past the empty Oval Office, the vice president was rushed into a tunnel outside a bombproof bunker known as the PEOC, the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. About 30 miles away, at Dulles airport, air-traffic controllers were watching agape as a plane raced toward Washington at 500 miles an hour. A controller looking at a radar screen had noticed the blip, heading straight for the White House, about 12 miles out. As ABC's \"20/20\" later reconstructed the scene, another controller called the Secret Service: **\"We have unidentified, very fast-moving aircraft inbound toward your vicinity, eight miles west.\" In the Dulles radar room, the horrified air-traffic controllers counted down the miles. Five, four, three-then the plane began to turn away. The tension ebbed. One of the controllers suggested the blip must be an Air Force fighter, \"one of our guys.\" But the plane kept turning until it had made a full 360-degree circle. \"Oh my God,\" yelled a controller, \"he's coming back!\" The blip suddenly disappeared.** At Reagan National airport, just across the Potomac River from the capital, an air-traffic controller reported that the Pentagon had been hit. At Dulles, there were audible gasps in the control room. In the relative safety of a tunnel far below the White House, Cheney was told by the Secret Service that a plane had been tracked heading for the White House at high speed. The vice president reached for a phone on the wall and said, \"Get me the president.\" The chief executive was not easy to reach; he was at that moment being hustled on to Air Force One for a quick departure from Sarasota. The president had already been told by his chief of staff, Andrew Card, that \"America is under attack.\" Now, when Bush finally came on the line, Cheney told him that the White House had been \"targeted.\" As the president and vice president spoke on the secure line, Cheney's wife, Lynne, appeared in the tunnel with her Secret Service agent. She had been at her downtown office when the second tower was hit shortly after 9 a.m. She was moved \"rather briskly\" to a car, she recalls, and sped toward the vice president's mansion in northwest Washington. Abruptly, her car made a U-turn and headed back downtown toward the White House.

She arrived just as the complex was being evacuated*. *At first the guards would not let her in, but her determined agent drove up on the sidewalk around the barrier. Mrs. Cheney was rushed down to the PEOC to meet her husband. As she arrived, Vice President Cheney had just learned that the Pentagon had been hit.** The first reports indicated that a helicopter had crashed into it.** Over the phone, Bush was saying that he wanted to come back to Washington right away. Cheney urged him not to come back, as he later recalled, \"until we could find out what the hell was going on.\" The president and his No. 2 talked about protective measures. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had already ordered Air National Guard fighters to take to the skies to guard New York and Washington against further attack. Cheney knew that the pilots needed to be given \"rules of engagement\" that would allow them to know when to shoot. **What if a commercial airliner was not responding to radio calls or warnings from the fighter pilots to turn away? \"I recommended that we authorize them to shoot,\" Cheney recalls telling Bush. \"We talked about it briefly. And he said, 'OK, I'll sign up to that.' He made the decision.\" ** Shortly before 10 a.m., the Cheneys were led into the PEOC conference room, a wood-paneled chamber with a large table and a wall of TV screens. A plate of store-bought cookies was on the table. \"It was surreal,\" recalls Lynne Cheney. \"You know, it was sort of like the polite hostess-there you are in the middle of this amazing crisis, and somebody remembers to put out the cookies.\" No one reached for one. Instead, they looked up at the TV screens. It was 9:58 a.m. **X. Running For Their Lives** **Scanning the south tower from the driveway along West Street, Feehan and Fitzpatrick noticed a puff of lighter-colored smoke shooting out from around the 90th floor.** It was 9:59 a.m. The steel had heated past the critical 1,100-degree mark. Now, most likely, rivets that had connected concrete floors to the facade had begun popping, transferring weight to the 47 core support columns, which began buckling, one floor at a time. Looking up, Fitzpatrick wondered if his eyes were playing tricks. The building's crown seemed to be slowly twisting and shifting. Loud cracks heralded an enormous black billow of smoke and cascade of debris. It seemed \"like an atomic mushroom cloud,\" Fitzpatrick later recalled.

Loud cracks heralded an enormous black billow of smoke and cascade of debris. It seemed \"like an atomic mushroom cloud,\" Fitzpatrick later recalled. For a few seconds, Feehan and Fitzpatrick stood transfixed, unable to move. Then they ran for their lives, toward the World Financial Center's underground garage. The driveway was mobbed with people fleeing. Feehan stopped to help a woman who had been knocked down. Fitzpatrick lost sight of his old friend as he was swept down the ramp in the stampede. A gust of dust half blinded him. The air seemed heavy, like cotton. Fitzpatrick ran down a long, dark passageway. He imagined the 1,362-foot tower toppling like a tree, bowling over the building he was now beneath. He wondered: when am I going to get hit? He stumbled into an office-size locker room. He felt trapped. \"I'm not going to die in a locker room,\" he said aloud to himself, angrily. I'd die in a fire, he thought, but I'm not going to slowly suffocate in a locker room tapping on a pipe for three weeks. He decided to backtrack, feeling his way. Others were groping the walls with him. \"I found a door over here!\" a construction worker shouted. It opened onto a dust-covered stairway leading into a bagel shop that served the WFC's Winter Garden. Fitzpatrick ran up and outside, astonished to be alive. Feehan had survived as well. He emerged from the World Financial Center garage into the stygian darkness of dust and smoke. The first deputy commissioner immediately began digging out bodies trapped in the rubble. People around him had become hysterical. A young firefighter had begun to lose his composure. \"What, you never seen anything like this before?\" Feehan needled the younger man. \"Relax, relax, kid, we're going to handle this.\" He turned to his stunned fellow firefighters in the ash-covered turnout coats. Some of them wondered whether the second tower would also come down. \"You expect this is going to happen twice?\" asked Feehan. \"Get out of here. C'mon, let's go.\" He leaned over and began pulling bodies from the rubble. Paper was floating down through the murk. Near a decapitated woman, Feehan found another woman, alive but moaning for help. He was lifting concrete from her when, at 10:28 a.m., the North Tower began its collapse. Standing on the other side of the WFC, Fitzpatrick did not even bother to look up. He had heard the awful noise of a 110-story building imploding less than a half hour before.

He had heard the awful noise of a 110-story building imploding less than a half hour before. He just turned and ran for the river, toward the North Cove marina. For a moment the sound of an airplane terrified him. The third act in the atrocity is going to be the World Financial Center, he thought to himself, and he was standing in its shadow. There was no place left to run. Fitzpatrick was not much of a swimmer, but the Hudson River beckoned. Then somebody said, \"It's a fighter plane.\" An Air National Guard F-16 had arrived, far too late. **XI. 'Protect The House'** In the conference room of the PEOC, Cheney and Rice and their aides watched on television as the towers collapsed*.* A picture taken at the time by a White House photographer shows stricken expressions on several of the White House officials' faces as the images of devastation flicker on the screen. Told that a casualty estimate ranged well into the thousands, Cheney just nodded grimly. For the most part, the atmosphere in the PEOC was calm and businesslike. Cheney recalls that he was eager to get \"plugged in\" and \"work the problem.\" But problems were erupting all over-and coming straight at them. Shortly after the first tower fell, at about 10, the PEOC received an urgent alarm. A uniformed military officer working in the Communications Room informed the vice president that a radar blip showed an unidentified plane 80 miles from Washington and closing fast. \"We were all dividing 80 by 500 miles an hour to see what the windows were,\" says the vice president's chief of staff, Scooter Libby. The answer was, less than 10 minutes*.* **The vice president was asked if the Air National Guard fighters, who had finally arrived to patrol the skies above Washington, should \"engage\" the plane.** Cheney answered yes, \"in about the time it takes a batter to swing, maybe starting from the windup,\" recalls Libby. Cheney says he was merely executing the decision already made by the president during their earlier discussion as the vice president had stood in the tunnel outside the PEOC conference room talking to Air Force One. \"I did not go back to him on a plane-by-plane basis,\" says Cheney. \"You don't have time for that.\" At just about the time Cheney was ordering the fighters to engage, United Flight 93-the unidentified blip on the radar screen-was crashing into a field in rural Pennsylvania.

It's not absolutely clear whether Cheney's shoot-down order would have gotten through if the plane had kept on coming. The pilots flying the patrol, members of the North Dakota Air National Guard's 119th Fighter Wing, known as the Happy Hooligans, say their radio frequencies were cluttered with orders and chatter. At one point, one of the pilots thought he heard the Secret Service order \"protect the house\"-presumably the White House, but he wasn't sure. It wasn't until early afternoon that the PEOC learned-to its occupants' great relief-that the plane had not been shot down. Cheney instantly grasped that the passengers and crew had revolted against the hijackers. \"I think an act of heroism just took place,*\" *he told the others. Information, much of it wrong, was pouring into the vice president's command post that morning. Lynne Cheney, sitting in a corner, started writing down the reports as they flooded in. As she later read them to NEWSWEEK, the litany conveys the impression of a terrorist blitz on the nation's capital. A report of an explosion at the Lincoln Memorial. A car bombing at the State Department. A bomb at the Capitol. A military officer from the Communications Room announced that a threat had been received against Air Force One. \"How do we know?\" asked Edelman, Libby's top aide. The officer replied that the warning included the aircraft's code name, which is classified. The threat was almost surely bogus-though to this day White House officials say they do not know where it came from. \"I don't think we'll ever know,\" says Condi Rice. Suddenly there was a report from the FAA of another plane heading straight for the capital, only five to 10 miles-about 30 seconds-away. \"Take it out,\" the vice president ordered, according to his wife's notes. Scooter Libby recalls: \"We learn that a plane is five miles out and has dropped below 500 feet and can't be found; it's missing... You sort of look at your watch and think, hmmm, five miles out, 500 miles an hour. Tick, tick, tick... It's a little bit like the Scarlet Pimpernel. It drops below the radar screen and it's just continuously hovering in your imagination.\" The plane was a phantom of the fog of war; it never existed. The scene in the PEOC, says Lynne Cheney, \"was unbelievable. It was like a novel.\" She remembers recalling the plot of \"Fail-Safe,\" the 1962 novel about accidental nuclear war, in which the president has to order American", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:26:8a85d8245789", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7903, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "out, 500 miles an hour.

The scene in the PEOC, says Lynne Cheney, \"was unbelievable. It was like a novel.\" She remembers recalling the plot of \"Fail-Safe,\" the 1962 novel about accidental nuclear war, in which the president has to order American bombers to take out New York City in exchange for a mistaken attack on Moscow. The vice president was also thinking about nuclear war, though in a more prosaic and procedural way. He was focused on continuity: about making sure that someone high up in the constitutional order of presidential succession survived to run the country. **Cheney was a cold-war veteran. He had been White House chief of staff under Gerald Ford**, then a high-ranking congressman involved in intelligence matters, then secretary of Defense under the first President Bush. He had been through countless war games and exercises preparing for an all-out nuclear assault*.* Horrible as the events in New York and Washington were, Cheney understood, they were well short of a nuclear attack. Still, he wanted to be extra careful. The president, now flying on Air Force One, was headed to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. There, shortly after noon, he would make a statement to reassure citizens that the government of the United States was functioning-that it had not been, to use a nuclear-age term, \"decapitated.\" But after Barksdale, the president was agitating to come back to Washington. **Cheney strongly urged that Bush should go instead to Offutt Air Force Base, home of the Strategic Command in Omaha, Neb.** \"It's secure as hell, it's a military installation, it's got great communications,\" Cheney recalls arguing. ***[Note: A [special meeting](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-facts#offutt) of top executives strangely was being held that morning at Offutt Air Force Base. At least one of these executives would have died at her office in the WTC had she not been called away.] *** It would have been \"foolish in the extreme\" to bring Bush back, Cheney now says, \"until we really had a pretty good fix on the scope and scale of the attack.\" Reluctantly, Bush agreed with Cheney. The president was later criticized for not returning immediately to the embattled capital. \"That's crap,\" says Cheney. \"This is not about appeasing the press or being the macho guy who is going to face down danger. You don't think in those personal terms... This is about preserving and protecting the presidency. His importance lies in the office he holds.\" At one point amid the tumult of threatening but mostly erroneous reports, Cheney was told that counterterrorism experts on the National Security Council staff had suggested that he relocate to a safer place.

Cheney refused to go; the president was secure, and the PEOC offered good communications-\"connectivity,\" as he put it. Good communications, but bad information. With some 2,000 commercial and private planes in the air at the time of the attacks, the Federal Aviation Administration had done a yeoman's job of getting almost all of them quickly down on the ground right after the initial hijackings. But a number of flights were still unaccounted for, and fear remained high that some of them had been hijacked-and were headed for Washington*. * In the PEOC, officials tried to get a handle on the outstanding threats. On a yellow legal pad, Cheney wrote down the tail numbers of planes as Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta relayed reports from the FAA. But the tail numbers weren't matching up; confusion reigned. \"Norm was literally sitting there on the phone saying, you know, 'Flight 706 is heading for Memphis-no, check that, it's United 607', \" says one of the White House officials who was in the room. Condi Rice recalls that a plane which was supposed to be going to San Francisco from Madrid was suddenly coming back to Washington; then it was on the ground in Madrid. \"It was very frustrating,\" she says, though she blames \"the fog of war\" and not the FAA. Mrs. Cheney's notes show that the Coast Guard had picked up distress calls from three overseas flights flown by United, Air Canada and Continental Airlines. Not until noon were these flights accounted for. Then at 1 p.m. came the report of a low-flying, high-speed private plane aiming at the president's ranch in Crawford, Texas. Then a report of a KAL flight inbound from Anchorage squawking the special code signifying that it had been hijacked. As if the tide of misinformation weren't enough, a PEOC technician told Scooter Libby a monitor was showing that levels of cartbon dioxide in the room had climbed too high. Dimly remembering his high-school science, Libby recalled that too much CO2 can affect a person's judgment. This was the wrong time for foggy minds. Quietly, he arranged to have the less-than-essential personnel-various lower-level aides who tend to congregate at times of crisis-removed from the room. The tone in the command center, its occupants recall, was set by Cheney. He seemed unfazed by the contradictory and changing reports.

The tone in the command center, its occupants recall, was set by Cheney. He seemed unfazed by the contradictory and changing reports. An axiom of crisis, the vice president understood from long experience, is \"First reports are always wrong.\" **Cheney had been Ford's chief of staff during the fall of Saigon in 1975.** The president had publicly announced the evacuation of every American, only to return to the Oval Office and learn that 50 Marines remained inside the American Embassy. Then, as now, Cheney was able to remain detached, impersonal. He did at one point raise his head to Lynne and ask, \"How's the family?\" A glance from his partner told him that his daughters were fine, under Secret Service protection. Only once did he show any irritation, when he was unable to get audio from both the TV broadcast channels and the videoconferencing system at once. \"Get it fixed,\" he growled. \"He exerts a calming influence on people because you'd sort of be embarrassed to, in front of him, betray any sense of 'oh my God',\" says Eric Edelman. That is not to say powerful feelings were not racing through people's minds. At one point, as they watched the video replay of the collapse of one of the Twin Towers, Rice said to Edelman, \"You know, it really is like our worst nightmare.\" Rice, a former aide in the \"Bush 41\" White House and teacher at Stanford, had experienced and led many war games. \"You suddenly realize, it's not a game,\" Rice recalls, reflecting on the almost surreal quality of the day. \"There were times that day that it felt like an out-of-body experience... But you keep functioning, even though you don't really believe it's happening.\" Her emotions didn't fully kick in until 48 hours later, when she returned home late at night, exhausted, and flipped on CNN. The guardsmen's band at Buckingham Palace was playing the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\" Rice felt her throat catch. **By early afternoon on September 11, intelligence reports had placed the blame for the attacks on Al Qaeda, the terror network headed by Osama bin Laden** and protected by the extremist Islamic Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Cheney and his aides began discussing what an attack on Al Qaeda might mean.

Cheney and his aides began discussing what an attack on Al Qaeda might mean. How could the United States force the Taliban to cough up bin Laden? **Only two days before, Al Qaeda had assassinated the leader of the opposition to the Taliban*.*** Scooter Libby passed Cheney a note, suggesting a link: had the assassination paved the way for Qaeda attacks on the United States? Hitting back with a few cruise missiles was not going to be enough, Cheney and his advisers agreed. Much stronger measures, as well as some original thinking, were called for. At 3:30 in the afternoon, with Bush at Offutt Air Force Base, all the president's top cabinet and subcabinet advisers on the National Security Council convened by videoconference. Bush said he was going back to Washington. Cheney relented, although the Secret Service remained opposed. The president was firm and defiant. As one of the participants recalled, the president said, in essence, \"We will find these people. They will pay.\" By the time he went on national TV to address the nation from the Oval Office at 8:30 p.m., the chief executive was already outlining what would become known as the Bush Doctrine-that the United States will treat as its enemy not only terrorists but nations that harbor terrorists. Afterward, as he sat with his closest advisers around the conference table in the PEOC, Bush seemed to welcome the opportunity to forge an international coalition against terrorism. He was heartened that President Vladimir Putin of Russia, in the early moments of the crisis, had reached out to Rice to reassure the United States of his country's support. Libby thought to himself that it would be easy to imagine, under such shocking circumstances, a very different kind of private meeting between a president and his top advisers, one that was marked by hand-wringing and doubt. \"He didn't ask, 'What does this mean? Is this a war? What kind of war? Should we try to talk to them?' There was none of that,\" says Libby. Late that night, Dick and Lynne Cheney and the vice president's top aides boarded a helicopter on the South Lawn of the White House. They were headed to a secure \"undisclosed location\" where Cheney would be spending much of his time in the weeks and months ahead as a precaution against a second, \"decapitating\" strike*.* As he looked out the window at Washington ablaze with light, Cheney, a history buff, reflected back to the last time the White House had been attacked-by the British in 1814. But Cheney did not dwell on the thought. The president had set a bold course. There was much to be done. **XII.

Conspiracy Theories** Mohamed Atta's father, Mohamed Sr., opened the door of his Cairo apartment and ushered in a NEWSWEEK reporter. It was five days after his son had flown American Airlines Flight 11 into the World Trade Center. **\"I'm not benefiting from these interviews,\" said the elder Atta. \"My son is gone. He is now with God. The Mossad killed him.*\"*** He led the reporter into his slightly tattered, overstuffed apartment looking down on the smoggy outskirts of the Egyptian capital and offered a cup of tea. He said that he would talk, uninterrupted, for 20 minutes. More than an hour later, between drags on \"American blend\" cigarettes, he was still talking, portraying his son as a frail, cosseted boy prone to airsickness, a dedicated student who rarely mentioned politics and a victim of an intricate setup job by the Israeli intelligence agency. The heavyset, bespectacled lawyer laid out his case in a bombastic voice with a slight undercurrent of desperation. *\"*The Mossad kidnapped my son,\" he said. \"He is the easiest person to kidnap. Very surrendering, no physical power. He is not a capitalist and does not have money for bodyguards. **They used his name and identity. They forced him to make a phone call under threat after the attack to cause controversy,*\"* he said, referring to a call he claims to have received from his son the day after the attacks.** \"Then they killed him. This\"-the attack on the World Trade Center-\"was done by the Mossad, using American pilots.*\"* Atta Sr. launched into a lurid history of the Israeli spy agency, interspersed with testimonials to his own deductive powers as a lawyer. He grew angry at any interruption. \"My son,\" he began. \"It's impossible my son would participate in this attack. I never saw my son make a political comment except once, which was the bombing of our embassy in Islamabad by Osama bin Laden. He said, 'Let him wait. God will burn him'.*\"* Lawyer Atta offered \"evidence\" that the Mossad, not his son, had carried out the attack. \"One: 5,000 American Jews did not go to work. Two: American police caught five Israelis singing and dancing by the towers after the destruction. Three: Jewish American businessmen withdrew bonds because they were sure this would happen. Then they made $10 million by buying the bonds back after the attacks.\" Fantastic though it was, Atta Sr.'s tale was not much more farfetched than the stories appearing daily in Egypt's newspapers.

The government-controlled press routinely spews wild conspiracy theories*,* usually about Israeli plots. **Three months after the attack, no Egyptian publication has printed a detailed profile of Atta**, even though he has probably eclipsed President Hosni Mubarak as the country's most famous native son. It is as if Egyptians have become so insecure about how they are viewed by the West that they are willing to believe anything-except that one of their own could be responsible for the attack. Atta's father adamantly refused to believe that his son could do anything wrong. He was immersed in his studies, his father believed-even as the son was hopscotching across continents to plan the attacks*. *Atta canceled several visits home, claiming he needed to find an adviser to help with his doctorate. But he always told his father he was calling from Germany, and Atta Sr. had no reason to think otherwise. He proudly ticked off his son's academic accomplishments: \"He was sent to Turkey for four days because he was one of the cleverest students... The institute was very pleased with his study... They made a big conference to celebrate in Berlin...\" and so on. His only hesitation seemed to be on the subject of Atta and women. \"I started reminding him to get married... He was never touching women, so how could he live?... He never extended his hand to shake the hand of a woman. He would only shake if she extended it to him. By nature he avoided problems.\" For a moment, Atta Sr.'s reflections on his son's tortured relations with women seemed to subdue his stridency. When the NEWSWEEK reporter asked after his wife, Atta Sr. replied only, \"Pray for her.\" The \"interview\" tailed off. The reporter excused himself, to be replaced by a reporter from another Western publication. Atta Sr. started his rant all over again, as if by repeating it often enough he could make it true. **XIII. Learning To Live Again** In Brooklyn on the morning of September 11, Virginia DiChiara's father, Sal, had stood on the Brooklyn Heights embankment and watched with growing dread as the flames licked up at the window of his daughter's office on the 101st floor of the North Tower. Dejected, he had walked home and told his wife, Connie, \"It doesn't look good.\" Connie DiChiara was beset with a terrible thought: \"Is this happening again?\" Forty years before, Sal and Connie DiChiara had lost their only son in a fire.

Dejected, he had walked home and told his wife, Connie, \"It doesn't look good.\" Connie DiChiara was beset with a terrible thought: \"Is this happening again?\" Forty years before, Sal and Connie DiChiara had lost their only son in a fire. The boy had been playing with candles and matches behind the couch in the living room while his sister Virginia watched television and Connie prepared breakfast downstairs in the kitchen. Little Virginia, who was 5 years old, emerged unscathed. Her brother was charred over 85 percent of his body by the time his father was able to rescue him. He died 13 days later. \"You never think it's going to happen a second time,\" Connie DiChiara said. But as she sat by the phone on that bright September morning, she relived her nightmare. At 10:30 a.m. the phone rang. It was Ari Schonbrun, who had so faithfully stayed by Virginia's side on the escape from the North Tower. \"Your daughter is OK,\" Schonbrun said. \"She's alive. But she got burned. She's at Saint Vincents.\" DiChiara's mother broke down crying. In a real sense, Virginia DiChiara's ordeal was just beginning. For burn victims the first 72 hours, known as the \"fluid resuscitation\" period, are critical. DiChiara was massively swollen, as the water in her blood vessels leaked out. That leakage in turn threatened to drop her blood pressure to dangerous levels and send her into shock. At Saint Vincents, she was put on an IV to flood her system with fluids and ensure that her blood flow remained stable. Before long DiChiara would gain some 25 pounds from the swelling-not uncommon for a burn patient. In addition, she was highly susceptible to infection, since she had lost the protective coating that her skin provided. **DiChiara was burned over 30 percent of her body-a mix of second- and third-degree burns from shoulder to fingertips on both arms, second-degree burns on her back and left side and first-degree burns on her face. The skin will grow back from a first- or second-degree burn, but a third-degree burn requires a skin graft.** At DiChiara's bedside, Dr. Jane Haher, the chief of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Saint Vincents, immediately realized that the patient's condition was critical. Her fingers were swollen \"like Mickey Mouse hands,\" recalls Haher. \"She was losing sensation... Her skin was burned red, brown and black... the soot and acrid smell were all over her body... The stench was so awful.\" But Haher also saw that DiChiara was alert and feisty. While other burn victims were withdrawn, DiChiara told her story in vivid detail. She also made Haher laugh: \"All she complained about was her hair,\" which was matted and sooty and dripping", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:33:7f426d381e9f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7910, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "critical.

She also made Haher laugh: \"All she complained about was her hair,\" which was matted and sooty and dripping debris. \"She complained about that unmercifully.\" Despite her precarious condition and pain that was unfathomable, the first hours of DiChiara's hospitalization were a time of celebration. She was grateful to have survived, juiced up on morphine and seemingly oblivious to her condition. When Connie DiChiara arrived, she saw that her daughter \"looked like a pumpkin.\" Tears welled in Connie's eyes, but not from sorrow. \"I was so happy she was alive,\" says mother DiChiara. \"I would take her any which way she was.\" Over at DiChiara's home in Bloomfield, N.J., her close friends, who couldn't make it to the city because the tunnels were closed, gathered that evening to pop the cork on a bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne to toast DiChiara's survival. Reality began to set in the next day. Haher had to break the news that DiChiara faced some particularly gruesome surgery. The swollen muscles and dead skin from the burns were acting as a tourniquet on DiChiara's blood vessels. With the vessels choked, blood was not reaching her tissues. Haher explained that she would have to make a series of incisions, called fasciotomies, along DiChiara's arms and hands to relieve the pressure. \"I told her how awful it would look after,\" says Haher. But no surgery meant running the risk of losing hands and forearms. DiChiara's response: \"Do it. Don't even think twice. Don't talk to me about amputation, because that's out of the question.\" Clinging to the security of her family and her hospital room, DiChiara shut out the dreadful reality outside. Her boss, Cantor Fitzgerald general counsel Stephen Merkel, dropped in to visit. DiChiara asked about a friend at work. He shook his head. She asked about another. He shook his head again. \"Virginia, it's bad,\" he told her. (He didn't tell her how bad: 658 of 1,000 Cantor Fitzgerald employees at the World Trade Center were killed in the September 11 attack.) DiChiara switched topics, not permitting herself to dwell on the tragedy. Her room overlooked the spot where the Twin Towers had stood. Rather than stare at the smoke and emptiness, she told her mother, \"Ma, just close the curtain.\" On Sept. 14, DiChiara was transferred to the state-of-the-art burn unit of Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. It was past midnight when she was wheeled to room 7 in the intensive-care unit on the second floor.

It was past midnight when she was wheeled to room 7 in the intensive-care unit on the second floor. If DiChiara and her loved ones harbored any doubts about the gravity of her condition, those were immediately dispelled by the setting in the ICU. \"It was like being put in a prison,\" says DiChiara. \"I was in a room with the door closed. You couldn't even leave to go to the bathroom. People had to wear gowns and masks... You don't see anything but the whites of people's eyes.\" DiChiara's friends and family, who had boisterously jammed into her room at Saint Vincents, had a hard time adjusting. \"For the longest time all you could touch was her feet,\" says her closest friend, Maureen Butler. \"You don't realize how often you pet someone.\" The only chance they had to touch her face was when they rubbed ointment on a nasty scab on her nose. \"It was terrible,\" says Butler with a laugh. \"It was huge, and all she kept saying was, 'Scratch my nose.' And we were all like, 'I'm not touching that'.\" DiChiara was often in a heavily drugged state in the first few weeks of her stay at Saint Barnabas. She was being medicated with a pharmacy's worth of drugs: morphine and Percocet for pain, Ativan and Xanax for anxiety, Maalox for stomach ulcers and on and on. \"The goal is to keep the pain like a lake, as opposed to an ocean,\" says burn nurse Susan Gasiorowski, who worked at Saint Barnabas at the time. \"You don't ever want the pain to be out of control... That's the one thing you can control.\" So DiChiara would giggle, slur, deliver non sequiturs, nod off in the middle of a sentence and complete it five minutes later. **However high she might have been, though, DiChiara's mettle never weakened.** In the early days in the burn unit, the nurses made sure the TV wasn't turned to the news, says Gasiorowski, who grew close to DiChiara. But every now and then, a news flash on the terrorist strikes would intrude on the otherwise light fare-sometimes mentioning the loss of life at Cantor Fitzgerald. Once, Gasiorowski recalls, \"she looked up and said, 'They're saying that nobody made it, but I made it. I'm here'.\" From the beginning, says Dr. Hani Mansour, the head of the burn unit, \"she was motivated. **She was always positive. 'I want to get better'-that was her motto.\" Her resolve would be repeatedly tested. ** To be washed, burn patients at Saint", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:35:650e3c0f2de2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7912, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 36, "text": "the terrorist strikes would intrude on the otherwise light fare-sometimes mentioning the loss of life at Cantor Fitzgerald.

'I want to get better'-that was her motto.\" Her resolve would be repeatedly tested. ** To be washed, burn patients at Saint Barnabas are wheeled into the \"tank room,\" a place that some of them liken to a torture chamber. One half is the \"wet\" side, where hoses dangling from the ceiling are used to scrub and wash wounds; the other half is the \"clean\" or dry side, where patients are wrapped in gauze like mummies. (A photo from the night DiChiara arrived shows her lying on the shower table, her raised arms revealing thick, meaty gashes on her underarms from the fasciotomies. Where the burns are third degree, the skin is leathery, with a light pinkish hue. In other areas it's purple and splotched. There is a thin band of tan, healthy skin where her Rolex was once strapped. Her face is swollen and unrecognizable.) A self-confessed control freak, DiChiara sought to dictate her \"tanking\" schedule. She dreaded the room. \"You would hear blood-curdling screams\" coming from there, she recalls. \"It's like they're taking you to the gas chamber. And the babies,\" she adds with a shudder. At 6 a.m. on the days she was to be bathed, she would call the nurses. \"Give me my shot of morphine and let's get in there and get this over with,\" she would say. In the room, DiChiara would erupt with profanities from the pain. \"I didn't realize that was a noun and an adjective,\" nurse Gasiorowski would say, joking with her, stroking her head, trying to soothe her. \"It feels like they're going at you with a Brillo pad,\" says DiChiara, who would get additional doses of morphine. \"You don't feel it, but you feel it.\" One morning in the tank room is forever seared in her memory: the first time she saw one of her fasciotomies. They were uncovered only when she was in the tank room, but DiChiara was usually staring at the ceiling and high on morphine. This day, though, she lifted her head and peered down at her arm. The fasciotomy was raw, bloody and cavernous. \"Oh my God,\" she thought, dropping her head immediately. \"It looked like a shark had attacked my arm.\" For someone who used to pass out at the sight of needles, it was overwhelming. In the tank room, she never looked down again. She could not look away forever, though. She had undergone extensive surgery for skin grafts, and the doctors wanted the grafts to get some air.

At night DiChiara woke up and looked at her uncovered arm-the waxy, unnatural grafts, the still-gaping fasciotomies. \"It was horrifying,\" she says. \"It was like 'Night of the Living Dead.' You look and you're like, 'Oh my God. This is my body.' It just upset me so much.\" A few days later, the doctors undressed her left arm, which was far worse. But there was one comforting thought: DiChiara would soon be released from the hospital. Before that could happen, however, she had to wean herself off morphine and brave the tank room with a slim buffer of just two Percocets. One morning at around 6:30, a nurse was ready to inject her with morphine. \"Put it away,\" she told the nurse. \"Give me the two Percocets.\" \"Are you sure?\" the nurse asked. \"I'll deal with it,\" DiChiara replied. \"I need to get out of here.\" **XIV. Burying the Dead** Bill Feehan's son John, 32, is a firefighter with Squad 252 in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn. At 10:30 a.m. on September 11, he was four blocks away from Ground Zero, on his way to rescue trapped firefighters, when he felt the rumble and heard the roar of the North Tower collapsing. He had an ominous feeling about his father. \"I've got to find the command post,\" he told a squad mate. But nobody knew where it was. Radios didn't work; a kind of quiet, stunned chaos reigned. For the next four hours, John repeatedly asked everyone he saw at Ground Zero, \"Have you seen my father?\" He would later discover that some of them knew Bill Feehan was dead, but couldn't bear to tell his son. John spent some time \"on the pile,\" helping to dig out bodies. One was alive, a woman who said that she had been on the 82d floor of the North Tower. (\"God bless her, I'm not sure how she got out,\" says John. \"She rode the rubble down, I guess.\") At 3:45, a fire chief motioned John over. As soon as the men made eye contact, John Feehan knew. The fire chief led him to an ambulance. \"I don't know if you want to know this or see it, but your dad's in there,\" he said. \"I guess so,\" said John, dazed. He climbed into the back of the ambulance and sat there, sobbing. He couldn't bring himself to pull back the sheet.

He climbed into the back of the ambulance and sat there, sobbing. He couldn't bring himself to pull back the sheet. The Feehan family was offered St. Patrick's Cathedral for a funeral, but they preferred Feehan's old parish in Flushing, Queens. Police had to close the Long Island Expressway to make way for all the city dignitaries coming out to pay their respects. Before they buried the chief, John and Feehan's elder son, Bill Jr., 40, went to see their father's body at Bellevue Hospital. **Bill remembered his father's sayings-\"Water seeks its own level\" and \"The cream rises to the top,\" and one in particular: \"A coward dies a thousand deaths, a brave man only one.\"** Looking down at his father's body, he was relieved to see that his face, though bloodied and bruised, still looked like Bill Feehan. He noticed that his father's hands were badly cut up and scraped-from lifting chunks of concrete. ** XV. 'I Look Different'** On Oct. 3, Virginia Dichiara came home to a house scented with flowers. Outside her two-story brick and wood-paneled house in Bloomfield, neighbors had lined the walkway with flowerpots. A big sheet read, welcome home, virginia. When DiChiara stepped in, she saw bright bouquets and cards on every available counter space. Her golden retrievers went wild. Friends and family crowded around. The phone was ringing incessantly. DiChiara was overwhelmed. The one call she took without hesitation was from Roy Bell, the man who had bolted out of the elevator just ahead of her. Reliving September 11, the two survivors wept. The next day, DiChiara got a taste of the rocky road ahead. A neighbor came over with her young daughter. The girl looked at her, outfitted in her burn garments, and didn't want to come any nearer. DiChiara felt wounded. \"Kids are going to look at me,\" she told her friend Butler afterward. \"I look different.\" A few days later, though, another friend dropped in with her two kids. The boy and the girl marched up to her and hugged and kissed her. \"How cool that you were in the paper,\" they said excitedly. \"How cool that you got out of that building.\" After they left, DiChiara said, \"Maybe I'm really not strange to kids.\" It was the sort of extreme emotional swing that she would experience continuously in the following weeks and months. Virginia's mother describes her as a \"party girl.\" In the summer she shared a house in Toms River on the Jersey shore.

Virginia's mother describes her as a \"party girl.\" In the summer she shared a house in Toms River on the Jersey shore. It was a convivial house, with a tiki bar in the back. An ideal summer's day for her was cranking up the 20-foot outboard-motor boat she owns with her friend Phil Salemi and, radio blasting, bombing out to the ocean with an inner tube and a case of beer. The week before the terrorists struck and changed her life, she and her friends had a Labor Day weekend blowout, complete with five-gallon jugs of Cosmopolitans. One day, about three weeks after she got home, Salemi went to pick up his friend and co-boat-owner from physical therapy, which DiChiara attends five days a week. She had been struggling with the unacceptable prospect that life would never be normal again. Salemi wanted her to have an escape from the rules and routines of burn recovery. So on that blissfully, sunny fall morning, they drove off to the Jersey shore, where they had spent so many wild summer days. **Along the way, Salemi mischievously broke the doctor's rules: he let her drive his Acura for about 15 minutes. Few activities give DiChiara, a proud BMW owner, more pleasure than driving; it's one of the things she most misses. Behind the wheel DiChiara was transformed. \"She was out of her mind,\" says Salemi. \"It gave her a ray of sunshine. It gave her self-confidence. It made her whole day.\"** They ended up at Bahrs, a seafood place in the Atlantic Highlands, where they ate lobster and homemade biscuits. They had escaped. \"It was almost like playing hooky,\" says Salemi. But DiChiara was always being pulled back to reality. Now that she was progressing in her physical recovery, she was increasingly haunted by psychological issues. For the first several weeks after she returned home, she wouldn't turn on the TV in her room. There seemed to be nothing but news about the terrorist attacks and images of Ground Zero. Gradually, though, she began to confront the troubling mix of emotions triggered by the fact that she had escaped a fate nearly 700 of her colleagues at Cantor had not. She began to read and listen to reports on the firm. She pondered the numbers from a Wall Street Journal article on Cantor: 10 sets of brothers killed; 1,463 kids left with only one parent; three babies born on September 11 to wives of dead Cantor employees. She thought of the colleagues closest to her who had been lost and the families and children left behind", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt:39:eb0ea8480c80", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7916, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "080617_story_september_11_evan_thomas", "chunk_index": 40, "text": "she had escaped a fate nearly 700 of her colleagues at Cantor had not.

She pondered the numbers from a Wall Street Journal article on Cantor: 10 sets of brothers killed; 1,463 kids left with only one parent; three babies born on September 11 to wives of dead Cantor employees. She thought of the colleagues closest to her who had been lost and the families and children left behind to grieve and fend for themselves. \"What do you tell the kids?\" she thought time and time again. At times, she feels guilty to have survived. DiChiara was also beginning to grapple with a long-buried source of pain: her brother's death by fire 40 years ago. \"It's total deja vu,\" she says. \"Virginia escaping.\" When you're a child, she says, \"you always think it's your fault.\" She has always been paranoid about fires (she keeps an escape ladder in her attic). \"Little did I know,\" she says, \"what was going to happen.\" To achieve a measure of calm, she has begun to meditate, a source of kidding from her friends, who brought her a little Buddha as a gift. But the psychological pain does not go away. In early November, DiChiara received custom-fitted \"pressure garments\"-a tight, long-sleeved jacket and gloves, made of a thin synthetic material. \"The idea is that it mimics the skin in a way,\" says Dr. Mansour. As DiChiara's burns heal, he explains, her body creates an extra pool of blood in the region, one that overnourishes the skin. The garments reduce her circulation, depriving the scars of nutrition and preventing them from becoming thick and hard. But as DiChiara has discovered, the jacket can be terribly uncomfortable. \"They saved the best for last,\" she says sarcastically. \"No one warned me about this.\" When she was told that she had to wear them 23 hours a day for about a year and a half, she went home and cried. At dinner with her mother and her friend Maureen Butler several nights after receiving the garments, DiChiara was quiet. She winced as she picked at her stuffed artichoke. \"These clothes are a killer,\" she said, before excusing herself to lie down on a couch. \"I never expected this,\" said her mother as she left. \"Every step we go, we prepare ourselves because we know what's coming. But this really...\" Butler finished her sentence. \"This is a ditch.\" The day she received her pressure garments (but before putting them on), DiChiara ventured back to New York for the first time, to a dinner party thrown in her honor by a friend. On the way, she visited Ground Zero. Peering at the wreckage, she thought to herself, \"My God, that is what is left?\" She said nothing, but her mood turned somber.

She tried to snap out of it at the party, where she received a hero's welcome. Though the mood was festive, DiChiara felt uncomfortable being the center of attention-a role she rejects. \"People only want to talk about the World Trade Center to her,\" says Butler. On the way home DiChiara said, \"You know, I can talk about other things.\" DiChiara has faced her ordeal with astonishing bravery and an indomitable spirit. But she is a realist. \"Nothing in my life is, or will ever be, the same,\" she says. Her recovery has become her full-time occupation. She may need more surgery for the scars. She may never be able to spend her summers in the sun and the water the way she used to. \"Before, life was a party,\" she says. \"Literally, one big party. We all had a great time. I excelled at my job. They got their money's worth out of me. I wanted to do it. And now it's anything but a party. Everything has changed for me-my movements, my activity, the outlook I have on life, my thoughts, the way I am. My love of life has changed. I look out and I see the trees. How fitting that this happened during autumn, because in autumn you take a look at everything and you see how beautiful it is... You're watching the trees die, and they don't really die. They just go to sleep for a season. And hopefully that's the same for us. Hopefully we just go to sleep and we come back.\" **XVI. Never Forget** In the firehouses of New York, pride is mixed with a tinge of bitterness. The nation's new heroes, working without a contract, are mobbed by flower-bearing fans offering thanks and tears. They're also attending rounds of funerals each day and collecting their brothers' memorial booklets, stand-ins for bodies. Some firefighters are recalling the words of Tennyson's \"Charge of the Light Brigade.\" *Was there a man dismay'd? Not tho' the soldier knew Someone had blundered: Theirs not to make reply, Theirs not to reason why, Theirs but to do and die. ***There are fragmentary reports that some of the chiefs tried to call their men out of the North Tower before it collapsed, and that even Feehan had a premonition: in the final minutes he put his men to work digging in the rubble, not racing into the doomed building.

No one will ever know exactly what happened. Most firefighters just shrug and say, \"Heaven has some fire department now.\"** At his home in Queens, Bill Feehan's grandson Connor Davan, 8, plays a little game. He wedges himself between his bed and a wall and buries himself in books. \"Help! Help!\" he cries. His father, Brian, a fireman who is married to Bill Feehan's daughter Tara, cries, \"I got ya!\" and slowly grabs Connor's hand and pulls him out of the book-rubble. Brian gave his son a chunk of concrete from Ground Zero, marked WTC 9.11.01. \"Your grandfather was a hero, and he was killed by this,\" Brian told his son. \"You must never forget him.\" It's doubtful that Connor could. Both his grandfathers were firemen, his father is a fireman and five of his uncles are firemen. Connor tells almost anyone he sees that when he grows up, he is going to be a fireman, too. *This story was reported by T. Trent Gegax, Arian Campo-Flores, Alan Zarembo and Gretel C. Kovach.

Today, many of us believe that not only our emotions and rational thinking opposites-they are also *pitted* *against* one another. Many of us believe that emotion/feeling/passion is a threat to thought/logic/rationality, as the virtue of logical left-brain activity is increasingly sanctified in the Western and globalised world. But, if we see emotions from a more balanced perspective based on findings from our improving sciences, we see that emotion and thought are not against one another-they work in symbiosis and actually complement each other. There is a growing body of scientific publications in psychology, cognitive science, and affective science (especially with respect to appraisal theory) showing how feeling and reason are entwined in the brain. This growing research is revealing how our thoughts, beliefs, assumptions about the world, and the subconscious all directly affect our emotions. Often times, if not always, it is *because* of our belief system framework that we experience certain emotions in certain situations; studies have shown that if we change the way we think, to some extent we in turn change the way we feel. So when we say that a particular emotion is illogical, what we really mean is that the underlying belief systems that lead to that emotion are illogical. But what does logic mean exactly? Logic is the process of inference based on a certain body of knowledge. It is making the \"best\" or \"correct\" choice-the most statistically favored choice based on what is already known about some natural phenomena. For example, if you know from experience that all the people you have encountered are mortal, and you meet a new person, it is logical for you to presume that they are also mortal. It is logical for you to infer this because: they are a person, statistically speaking all people you have encountered are mortal, and the statistically favored choice (based on what you know) is the logical one. Since logic is based upon statistics, there are times when making the logical choice in a given situation can be improved upon. This is especially important to remember when trying to determine what is \"logical\" human behavior. Given the complex nature of consciousness and subconsciousness, it is very difficult determining what our conscious knowledge base actually is at a given point in time, and to what extent or how our subconsciousness is affecting that body of knowledge (e.g. - through subconscious cultural and/or childhood programming). What we can determine, however, is how we respond emotionally to events in our life at a given point in time (as long as we are not suppressing our feelings). Our emotional reactions, many of which are subconscious or automatic, are simply the physical", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:1__karnaze.m__connect_emotions.txt:0:7d8593293f92", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7924, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "1__karnaze.m__connect_emotions.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "1__karnaze.m__connect_emotions", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "determining what our conscious knowledge base actually is at a given point in time, and to what extent or how our subconsciousness is affecting that body of knowledge (e.g. - through subconscious cultural and/or childhood programming). What we can determine, however, is how we respond emotionally to events in our life at a given point in time (as long as we are not suppressing our feelings). Our emotional reactions, many of which are subconscious or automatic, are simply the physical body's way of communicating the importance/meaning/saliency of internal and/or external stimuli, and how it relates to our personal well-being. Therefore, while we may not be able to know what our knowledge base is at a given point in time, we can see what beliefs are being triggered by our emotional responses. Emotions are body-based experiences that have evolved over time to mobilize us to respond to our internal and/or external environment so that we may optimize our personal health and pursue our goals in life. However, because emotions are also affected by our cultural programming, they may at times *not* act in our best interest-if the cultural programming is not in our best interest. Thus emotions do not only serve as positive adaptations for survival; they are also susceptible to inaccurate, unbalanced, and unhealthy thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions about the world, and subconscious programs. **Consequences of Polarizing Emotion & Rational Thinking** The \"[Building a Brighter Future](http://www.wanttoknow.info/brighterfuture)\" article shows that the three main ways the [global elite](http://www.wanttoknow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) can control humanity for their own purposes is by: Promoting fear and secrecy so that we lose touch with our common humanity and therefore cannot work together as one people to counter the global elite's efforts. Polarizing us so that we focus on blaming others for our problems rather than finding real solutions in ourselves and being able to solve problems at a larger and more global scale. Distracting us from our deeper purpose in life so that we are consumed by superficial gains rather than in active pursuit of finding our meaning in life and how we can make the world a better place. Furthermore, when we have an unbalanced perspective on emotion-whereby we view emotion as the opposite of reason and therefore dangerous to us because it is \"illogical\"-the global elite can control humanity for their own purposes by: Promoting fear that our \"negative\" or socially unacceptable emotions are harmful, dangerous, and destructive, so that we: keep our emotions hidden or secret, for fear of negative consequences; invalidate our emotions, thus cutting off our link to our the subconscious beliefs which hold much power in our behaviors and constrain how we construct our life and well-being; and neglect our true needs by not fully expressing our feelings and being emotional present and thus available in our closest relationships. Polarizing our \"emotional\" self from our \"rational\" self so that we focus on the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:1__karnaze.m__connect_emotions.txt:1:1fc032857edb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7925, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "1__karnaze.m__connect_emotions.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "1__karnaze.m__connect_emotions", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "destructive, so that we: keep our emotions hidden or secret, for fear of negative consequences; invalidate our emotions, thus cutting off our link to our the subconscious beliefs which hold much power in our behaviors and constrain how we construct our life and well-being; and neglect our true needs by not fully expressing our feelings and being emotional present and thus available in our closest relationships. Polarizing our \"emotional\" self from our \"rational\" self so that we focus on the \"problem\" emotions rather than the problematic beliefs or situations that give them cause to exist in the first place. Distracting us from [our deeper purpose in life](http://www.wanttoknow.info/lifepurposeintentions) so that we feel compelled to consume superficial gains under the illusionary impression that they will bring us the deeper meaning we strive for in our lives. Superficial gains may include: buying a consumer product with hopes and even expectations that it will bring us greater happiness or satisfaction in our life and relationships, turning to outside forces for the love and acceptance we truly seek from within-from *ourselves*; and turning to addictive/compulsive behaviors to avoid how we are feeling and thus avoid processing and learning from our emotional pain and using our fears as an [invitation to growth](http://www.wanttoknow.info/coreissue). Each of these is detrimental to our personal well-being because each of these disconnects us from our emotional self, polarizing us from within. When we are polarized from within, we have no framework from which to determine our goals and values and life, let alone implement them through our actions. And when we do not know what we believe at a core level or what world we want to create-we allow others to make those decisions for us, others who may not have our best interests at heart. **Moving Toward a Brighter Future with a Balanced Perspective of Emotion** Our future shines brighter when we improve our relationship with ourself-with our emotional self, and with our ego. The ego is merely our subconscious defense system which protects us from past painful situations repeating themselves; it needs our acceptance and validation, and it needs for us to work with it to understand what dysfunctional programming we need to change. When we see that there is reason behind each of our emotional responses, we see that is in our best interests to explore that reason, how it came to be, and whether we believe it to be true. When we see that our emotions are part of who we are as physical and spiritual beings, then we see why it is so important for us to express them in safe and appropriate ways, rather than suppressing, censoring, ignoring, or invalidating them. When we see that emotions are simply biological signals for what is good/bad, pleasant/painful, desirable/undesirable, useful/detrimental to us, etc., it is clear that we must listen to these signals, assess how accurate they are, and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:1__karnaze.m__connect_emotions.txt:2:fecffc9e84b2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7926, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "1__karnaze.m__connect_emotions.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "1__karnaze.m__connect_emotions", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "be true.

Over One Million Iraqi Deaths Caused by US Occupation?** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/1-over-one-million-iraqi-deaths-caused-by-us-occupation/)) Nobody knows exactly how many lives the Iraq War has claimed. But even more astounding is that so few journalists have mentioned the issue or cited the top estimate: 1.2 million. During August and September 2007, a British polling group surveyed 2,414 adults in 15 of 18 Iraqi provinces and found that more than 20 percent had experienced at least one war-related death since March 2003. Using common statistical study methods, it determined that as many as 1.2 million people had been killed since the war began. Estimates range wildly and are based on a variety of sources. In October 2006, the British medical journal *Lancet* published a Johns Hopkins University study vetted by four independent sources that counted 655,000 dead. In January 2008, the World Health Organization and the Iraqi government did door-to-door surveys of nearly 10,000 households and put the number of dead at 151,000. The 1.2 million figure is out there, too, which is higher than the Rwandan genocide death toll and closing in on the 1.7 million who perished in Cambodia's killing fields. It raises questions about the real number of deaths from US aerial bombings and house raids, and challenges the common assumption that this is a war in which Iraqis are killing Iraqis.

The Brookings Institute has reported that **US troops have, over the past four years, conducted about 100 house raids a day. Brutality during these house searches has been documented (See #9 below). The aggressive \"element of surprise\" tactics employed by soldiers is likely resulting in several thousands of deaths a day that either go unreported or are categorized as insurgent casualties. ** **Sources:** \"Is the United States killing 10,000 Iraqis every month?

Security and Prosperity Partnership: Militarized NAFTA** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/2-security-and-prosperity-partnership-militarized-nafta/)) Coupling the perennial issue of security with Wall Street's measures of prosperity, the leaders of the three North American nations convened the Security and Prosperity Partnership. The White House-led initiative - launched at a March 23, 2005, meeting of President Bush, Mexico's then-president Vicente Fox, and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin - joins beefed-up commerce with coordinated military operations to promote what it calls \"borderless unity.\"** Critics call it \"NAFTA on steroids.\" However, unlike NAFTA, the SPP was formed in secret, without public input. \"The SPP is not a law, or a treaty, or even a signed agreement,\"** Laura Carlsen wrote in a report for the Center for International Policy. \"All these would require public debate and participation of Congress, both of which the SPP has scrupulously avoided.\" Instead the SPP has a special workgroup: the North American Competitiveness Council [NACC]. It's a coalition of private companies that are, according to the [SPP website](http://www.spp.gov/), \"adding [high-level business input](http://www.spp.gov/factsheet.asp) [that] will assist governments in enhancing North America's competitive position and engage the private sector as partners in finding solutions.\" The NACC includes the Chevron Corporation, Ford Motor Company, General Electric, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Merck, Procter & Gamble Co., and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. **A look at NAFTA's unpopularity among citizens in all three nations is evidence of why its expansion would need to be disguised.** \"It's a scheme to create a borderless North American Union under US control without barriers to trade and capital flows for corporate giants, mainly US ones,\" wrote Steven Lendman in *Global Research*. **Sources:** \"Deep Integration,\" Laura Carlsen, [Center for International Policy, May 30, 2007](http://americas.irc-online.org/am/4276); \"The Militarization and Annexation of", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:2008_press_censorship.txt:1:30914b952c69", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7929, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "2008_press_censorship.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "2008_press_censorship", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Merck, Procter & Gamble Co., and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. **A look at NAFTA's unpopularity among citizens in all three nations is evidence of why its expansion would need to be disguised.** \"It's a scheme to create a borderless North American Union under US control without barriers to trade and capital flows for corporate giants, mainly US ones,\" wrote Steven Lendman in *Global Research*. **Sources:** \"Deep Integration,\" Laura Carlsen, [Center for International Policy, May 30, 2007](http://americas.irc-online.org/am/4276); \"The Militarization and Annexation of North America,\" Stephen Lendman, [Global Research, July 19, 2007](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=6359); \"The North American Union,\" Constance Fogal, [Global Research, Aug. 2, 2007](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=6456). **3. InfraGard: The FBI Deputizes Business** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/3-infragard-the-fbi-deputizes-business/)) The FBI and Department of Homeland Security have effectively deputized 23,000 members of the business community, asking them to tip off the feds in exchange for preferential treatment in the event of a crisis. \"The members of this rapidly growing group, called InfraGard, receive secret warnings of terrorist threats before the public does - and, at least on one occasion, before elected officials,\" Matthew Rothschild wrote in the [March 2008 issue](http://www.progressive.org/mag_rothschild0308) of *The* *Progressive.* InfraGard was created in 1996. **Membership now includes 350 of the nation's Fortune 500 companies. The group's 86 chapters coordinate with 56 FBI field offices nationwide.** While FBI Director Robert Mueller has said he considers this segment of the private sector \"the first line of defense,\" the American Civil Liberties Union issued [a grave warning](http://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/surveillance_report.pdf) about the potential for abuse. \"There is evidence that InfraGard may be closer to a corporate TIPS program, turning private-sector corporations ... into surrogate eyes and ears for the FBI. The FBI should not be creating a privileged class of Americans who get special treatment,\" stated Jay Stanley, public education director of the ACLU's technology and liberty program. And they are privileged: a DHS spokesperson told Rothschild that** InfraGard members receive special training and readiness exercises. They're also privy to protected information that is usually shielded from disclosure** under the trade secrets provision of the Freedom of Information Act. The information they have may be of critical importance to the general public, but first it goes to the privileged membership **Source:** \"The FBI deputizes business,\" Matthew Rothschild, [*The Progressive*, Feb. 7, 2008](http://www.progressive.org/mag_rothschild0308). **4. ILEA: Is the US Restarting Dirty Wars in Latin America?** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/4-ilea-is-the-us-restarting-dirty-wars-in-latin-america/)) The [School of the Americas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Americas) [SOA] earned an unsavory reputation in Latin America after many graduates of the Fort Benning, Ga., facility turned into counterinsurgency death squad leaders. The International Law Enforcement Academy recently installed by the Unites States in El Salvador - which looks, acts, and smells like the SOA - is also drawing scorn. The school is funded with $3.6 million from the US Treasury and staffed with instructors from the DEA, ICE, and FBI. It's tasked with training 1,500 police officers, judges, prosecutors, and other law enforcement agents in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:2008_press_censorship.txt:2:d0e4195d269a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7930, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "2008_press_censorship.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "2008_press_censorship", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "America after many graduates of the Fort Benning, Ga., facility turned into counterinsurgency death squad leaders.

It's tasked with training 1,500 police officers, judges, prosecutors, and other law enforcement agents in counterterrorism techniques per year. **It's stated purpose is to make Latin America \"safe for foreign investment\" **by \"providing regional security and economic stability and combating crime.\" ILEAs aren't new, but past schools located in Hungary, Thailand, Botswana, and Roswell, N.M., haven't been terribly controversial. ** Salvadoran human rights organizers take issue with the fact that, in true SOA fashion, the ILEA releases neither information about its curriculum nor a list of students and graduates.** Additionally, the way the school slipped into existence without public oversight has raised ire. As Wes Enzinna noted in a North American Congress on Latin America report, \"Members of the US Congress were not briefed about the academy, nor was the main opposition party in El Salvador.\" Now, after more than three years in operation, critics point out that Salvadoran police, who account for 25 percent of the graduates, have become more violent. A May 2007 report by Tutela Legal implicated Salvadoran National Police (PNC) officers in eight death squad-style assassinations in 2006. **Sources:** \"Exporting US 'Criminal Justice' to Latin America,\" \"Community in Solidarity with the people of El Salvador,\"[Upside Down World, June 14, 2007](http://upsidedownworld.org/main/content/view/774/1/); \"Another SOA?\" Wes Enzinna, [NACLA Report on the Americas, March/April 2008](http://nacla.org/node/4364?editionnid=4362&issuename=Guns:%2520The%2520Small%2520Arms%2520Trade%2520in%2520the%2520Americas&issuenum=2&volume=041&issuemonth=March/April&issueyear=2008&lilimage=); \"ILEA funding approved by Salvadoran right wing legislators,\"[CISPES, March 15, 2007](http://www.cispes.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=178); \"Is George Bush restarting Latin America's 'dirty wars?'\" Benjamin Dangl, [AlterNet, Aug. 31, 200](http://www.alternet.org/audits/58605/)7. **5. Seizing War Protesters' Assets** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/5-seizing-war-protesters-assets/)) Protesting war could get you into big trouble, according to a critical read of two executive orders recently signed by President Bush. [The first](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/07/20070717-3.html), issued July 17, 2007, and titled, \"Blocking property of certain persons who threaten stabilization efforts in Iraq,\" allows the feds to seize assets from anyone who \"directly or indirectly\" poses a risk to the US war in Iraq. And, citing the modern technological ease of transferring funds and assets, the order states that no prior notice is necessary before the raid. On Aug. 1, Bush signed [another order](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080730-4.html), similar but directed toward anyone undermining the \"sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic processes and institutions.\" In this case, the Secretary of the Treasury can seize the assets of anyone perceived as posing a risk of violence, as well as the assets of their spouses and dependents, and bans them from receiving any humanitarian aid. Critics say the orders bypass the right to due process and the vague language makes manipulation and abuse", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:2008_press_censorship.txt:3:5176aaa9d6c3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7931, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "2008_press_censorship.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "2008_press_censorship", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "On Aug. 1, Bush signed [another order](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080730-4.html), similar but directed toward anyone undermining the \"sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic processes and institutions.\" In this case, the Secretary of the Treasury can seize the assets of anyone perceived as posing a risk of violence, as well as the assets of their spouses and dependents, and bans them from receiving any humanitarian aid. Critics say the orders bypass the right to due process and the vague language makes manipulation and abuse possible. **Protesting the war could be perceived as undermining or threatening US efforts in Iraq. \"This is so sweeping, it's staggering,\" said Bruce Fein, a former Reagan administration official in the Justice Department** who editorialized against it in the* Washington Times*. \"It expands beyond terrorism, beyond seeking to use violence or the threat of violence to cower or intimidate a population.\" **Sources:** \"Bush executive order: Criminalizing the antiwar movement,\" Michel Chossudovsky, [Global Research, July 2007](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=6377); \"Bush's executive order even worse than the one on Iraq,\" Matthew Rothschild, [*The Progressive*, August 2007](http://www.progressive.org/mag_wx080307). **6. The Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/6-the-homegrown-terrorism-prevention-act/)) On Oct. 23, 2007, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed - by a vote of 404-6 - the \"Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act,\" designed to root out the causes of radicalization in Americans. With an estimated four-year cost of $22 million, the act establishes a 10-member National Commission on the Prevention of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism. The bill's author, Rep. Jane Harman (D-Los Angeles) said, \"Free speech, espousing even very radical beliefs, is protected by our Constitution. But violent behavior is not.\" In a later press release Harman stated: \"the National Commission [will] propose to both Congress and [DHS Secretary Michael] Chertoff initiatives to intercede before radicalized individuals turn violent.\" Which could be when they're speaking, writing, and organizing in ways that are protected by the First Amendment. **This redefines civil disobedience as terrorism, say civil rights experts, and the wording is too vague.** \"What is an extremist belief system? Who defines this? These are broad definitions that encompass so much. It is criminalizing thought and ideology,\" said Alejandro Queral, executive director of the Northwest Constitutional Rights Center in Portland, Ore. **The story didn't make it onto the CNN ticker, but enough independent sources reported on it that the equivalent Senate Bill 1959 has since stalled.** After introducing the bill, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Me.), later joined forces with Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) on a report criticizing the Internet as a tool for violent Islamic extremism. **Sources:** \"Bringing the war on terrorism home,\" Jessica Lee, [Indypendent, Nov. 16, 200](http://www.indypendent.org/2007/11/19/homegrown-terrorism/)7; \"Examining the Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act,\" Lindsay Beyerstein, [*In These Times*, Nov. 2007](http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3388/examining_the_homegrown_terrorism_prevention_act/); \"The Violent Radicalization Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007,\" Matt Renner, [Truthout, Nov. 20, 2007](http://www.truthout.org/article/the-violent-radicalization-homegrown-terrorism-prevention-act-2007). **7.

Guest Workers Inc.: Fraud and Human Trafficking** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/7-guest-workers-inc-fraud-and-human-trafficking/)) Every year, about 121,000 people legally enter the United States to work with H-2 visas, a program legislators are touting as part of future immigration reform. **Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) called this guest worker program \"the closest thing I've ever seen to slavery.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center likened it to \"modern day indentured servitude.\"** They interviewed thousands of guest workers and reviewed legal cases for [a report](http://www.splcenter.org/pdf/static/SPLCguestworker.pdf) released in March 2007, which concluded \"Unlike US citizens, guest workers do not enjoy the most fundamental protection of a competitive labor market - the ability to change jobs if they are mistreated. If guest workers complain about abuses, they face deportation, blacklisting, or other retaliation.\" When visas expire, workers must leave the country, hardly making this the path to permanent citizenship legislators are looking for. Still, Mexicans are literally lining up for H-2B status, the stark details of which were reported by Felicia Mello in *The Nation*. Furthermore, thousands of illegal immigrants are employed throughout the country, providing cheap, unprotected labor and further undermining the scant provisions of the laws. Labor contractors who connect immigrants with employers are stuffing their pockets with cash, while the workers return home with very little money. The Southern Poverty Law Center outlined a list of comprehensive changes needed in the program, concluding, \"For too long, our country has benefited from the labor provided by guest workers but has failed to provide a fair system that respects their human rights and upholds the most basic values of our democracy. The time has come for Congress to overhaul our shamefully abusive guest worker system.\" **Sources:** \"Close to Slavery,\" Mary Bauer and Sarah Reynolds, [Southern Poverty Law Center, March 2007](http://www.splcenter.org/pdf/static/SPLCguestworker.pdf); \"Coming to America,\" Felicia Mello, [*The Nation*, June 25, 2007](http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070625/mello); \"Trafficking racket,\" Chidanand Rajghatta, [*Times of India*, March 10, 2008](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Trafficking_racket_Indian_workers_file_case_against_US_employer/articleshow/2852060.cms). **8. Executive Orders Can Be Changed Secretly** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/8-executive-orders-can-be-changed-secretly/)) The Bush administration's Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice has been issuing classified legal opinions about surveillance for years. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) had access to the DOJ opinions on presidential power and had three declassified to show how the judicial branch has, in a bizarre and chilling way, assisted President Bush in circumventing its own power. According to the [three memos](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/07/politics/main3591448.shtml): \"There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:2008_press_censorship.txt:5:862f679f521c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7933, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "2008_press_censorship.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "2008_press_censorship", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "has been issuing classified legal opinions about surveillance for years.

I get to determine what my own powers are. The Department of Justice doesn't tell me what the law is. I tell the Department of Justice what the law is.\"** The issue arose within the context of the Protect America Act, which expands government surveillance powers and gives telecom companies legal immunity for helping. Whitehouse, a former US Attorney, legal counsel to Rhode Island's governor, and Rhode Island Attorney General who took office in 2006, went on to point out that *Marbury vs. Madison*, written by Chief Justice John Marshall in 1803, established that it is \"emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\" **Sources:** \"In [FISA Speech](http://whitehouse.senate.gov/newsroom/speeches/speech/?id=f7196551-2160-44a9-81a5-e6340daf769e), Whitehouse sharply criticizes Bush Administration's assertion of executive power,\" [Sheldon Whitehouse, Dec. 7, 2007](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFWIHbf50EI); \"Down the Rabbit Hole,\" Marcy Wheeler, [*The Guardian*(UK), Dec. 26, 2007](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/dec/26/downtherabbithole). **9. Iraq and Afghanistan Vets Testify** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/9-iraq-and-afghanistan-vets-testify/)) Hearing soldiers recount their war experiences is the closest many people come to understanding the real horror, pain, and confusion of combat. One would think that might make compelling copy or powerful footage for a news outlet. But in March, **when more than 300 veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan convened for four days of public testimony on the war, they were largely ignored by the media. Winter Soldier was designed to give soldiers a public forum to air some of the atrocities they witnessed.** Winter Soldier was originally convened by Vietnam Vets Against the War in January 1971 when more than 100 Vietnam veterans described their war experiences, including rapes, torture, brutalities, and killing of non-combatants.

Though most major news outlets sent staff to cover New York's Fashion Week, few made it to the Winter Soldier hearings. Fortunately, KPFA and Pacifica Radio broadcast the testimonies live. They were \"deluged with phone calls, e-mails, and blog posts from service members, veterans, and military families thanking us for breaking a cultural norm of silence about the reality of war.\" Testimonies can be heard at [www.ivaw.org](http://www.ivaw.org). **Sources:** \"Winter Soldier: Iraq & Afghanistan eyewitness accounts of the occupation,\"[Iraq Veterans Against the War, March 13-16, 2008](http://ivaw.org/store); \"War comes home,\" Aaron Glantz, Aimee Allison, and Esther Manilla, [Pacifica Radio, March 14-16, 2008](http://warcomeshome.org/wintersoldier2008); \"US Soldiers testify about war crimes,\" Aaron Glantz, [One World, March 19, 2008](http://us.oneworld.net/node/158957); \"The Other War,\" Chris Hedges and Laila Al-Arian, [*The Nation*, July 30, 2007](http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070730/hedges). **10. American Psychological Association Complicit in CIA Torture** ([Full story here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/10-apa-complicit-in-cia-torture/)) **Psychologists have been assisting the CIA and US military with interrogation and torture of Guantánamo detainees - which the American Psychological Association [APA] has said is fine, despite objections from many of its 148,000 members.** A 10-member APA task force was convened on the divisive issue in July 2005 and found that assistance from psychologists was making the interrogations safe. **The task force was criticized by APA members for deliberating in secret, and later it was revealed that six of the 10 participants had ties to the armed services.** Not only that, but as Katherine Eban reported in *Vanity Fair*, \"Psychologists, working in secrecy, had actually designed the tactics and trained interrogators in them while on contract to the CIA.\" In particular, psychologists honed a classified military training program known as SERE [Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape] that teaches soldiers how to tough out torture if captured by enemies. Eban's story outlined how SERE tactics were spun as \"science\" despite a lack of data and the critique that building rapport works better than blows to the head. It's been misreported that CIA torture techniques got Al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah to talk, when it was actually FBI rapport-building. In spite of this, SERE techniques became standards in interrogation manuals that eventually made their way to US officers guarding Abu Ghraib. Ongoing uproar within the APA resulted in a petition to make an official policy limiting psychologists'", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:2008_press_censorship.txt:7:1662e5560772", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7935, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "2008_press_censorship.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "2008_press_censorship", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "spun as \"science\" despite a lack of data and the critique that building rapport works better than blows to the head.

Close range shooting of rubber bullets and tear gas was used against community members for protesting the rising cost, and diminishing access and quality, of local water under privatization. Fourteen were arrested and charged with terrorism, a charge that can hold a 60-year prison sentence under the new Anti-Terrorism Law. **12.

Yet the architect, President Bush's first senior education advisor Sandy Kress, has turned the program into a huge success in the realm of corporate profiteering. **13. Tracking Billions of Dollars Lost in Iraq** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/13-tracking-billions-of-dollars-lost-in-iraq/)) Starting one month after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and continuing for over a year, the United States Federal Reserve shipped a total of $12 billion in U.S. currency to Iraq.

At least $9 billion of that amount is unaccounted for due to a complete lack of oversight. **14. Mainstreaming Nuclear Waste** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/14-mainstreaming-nuclear-waste/)) Radioactive materials from nuclear weapons production sites are being dumped into regular public landfills and being used as recycled metals. The Nuclear Information and Resource Service has tracked the Department of Energy's (DOE) release of radioactive scrap to unaware and unprepared recipients such as landfills, businesses and recreation areas.

The 2007 edition of the survey, covering 138 countries, shows an alarming rise in the number of people killed as a result of their trade union activities, from 115 in 2005 to 144 in 2006. Many more trade unionists around the world were abducted or \"disappeared.\" **17.

CARE claims the way U.S. aid is structured causes rather than reduces hunger in the countries where it is received. **23. FDA Complicit in Pushing Pharmaceutical Drugs** (For full story, [click here](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/23-fda-complicit-in-pushing-pharmaceutical-drugs/)) While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) turns a blind eye, drug companies are making false, unsubstantiated and misleading claims in their advertising, often withholding mandated disclosure of dangerous side effects. Though companies are required to submit their advertisements to the FDA, the agency does not review them before they are released to the public.

The immunity announcement ... did not say who at the foundation was being immunized or why. The Gates Foundation has assets in excess of $75 billion and has given out $91 billion in grants this century, making it the richest and most generous American charity in history. Since 2003, Gates has given 502 grants to organizations in Kenya, totaling over $1.9 billion. Gates has donated $870 million to AGRA, a Nairobi-based group attempting to introduce genetically modified seeds, chemical fertilizers, and large-scale agriculture throughout Africa. In Kenya it is possible to see the results of his now-accelerating project, which comprises three distinct efforts: the introduction of a new vaccine against malaria, a far-reaching agricultural reform program, and a divisive campaign to vaccinate cattle.

There are 188 million teenagers and school-age children with obesity - one in 10 - Unicef said, affecting health and development and bringing a risk of life-threatening diseases. Catherine Russell, executive director of the UN agency for children, said: \"When we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children. \"Obesity is a growing concern. Ultra-processed food [UPF] is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children's growth, cognitive development and mental health.\" **While 9.2% of five to 19-year-olds worldwide are underweight, 9.4% are considered obese, the report found. In 2000, nearly 13% were underweight and just 3% were obese**. Obesity has overtaken being underweight as the more prevalent form of malnutrition in all regions of the world except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and is a problem even in countries with high numbers of children suffering from wasting or stunting due to a lack of food. One in five of those aged between five and 19 are overweight, with a growing proportion of those 291 million individuals falling into the obese category: 42% in 2022, up from 30% in 2000. Childhood obesity has been linked to higher risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers in later life. **Note:** [Read our latest Substack article](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/historic-senate-panel-exposes-how) on how the US government turns a blind eye to the corporate cartels fueling the chronic health crisis.

The research ... is the first to detect dozens of agricultural chemicals-including insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other substances-suspended in cloud water droplets. **That means pesticides not only linger in the environment but also move through the atmosphere and fall back to Earth in rain or snow, sometimes at levels exceeding European safe drinking water limits**. The study found that clouds can carry current-use pesticides, long-banned compounds, and \"[emerging contaminants](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/emerging-contaminants)\"-industrial chemicals that either build up in the environment or form when older pesticides break down. Some even transform into new compounds in the atmosphere itself, beyond what regulators have known to consider. Researchers estimate that French skies alone may contain anywhere from a few tons to more than 100 tons of pesticides at any given time-most carried in from distant sources. Out of 446 possible chemicals screened-including pesticides, biocides (compounds that kill harmful organisms), additives, and transformation products (breakdown products of pesticides)-researchers found 32 different compounds in cloud water. **Note:** Across the US, a powerful legislative push is underway to protect pesticide manufacturers from being held accountable for the harms caused by their products.

Some experts believe that exposing young children to certain types of beneficial bacteria can engage and shape the growing immune system in a way that reduces the risk of allergic diseases later in life. Farm dust contains a hodgepodge of bacteria shed from livestock and animal feed that isn't harmful enough to cause illness, but does effectively train the immune system to become less responsive to allergens later in life. **Note:** For more along these lines, read our concise summaries of [news articles on health](https://wanttoknow.info/healthmediaarticles) and [food system corruption](https://wanttoknow.info/food-corruptionmediaarticles). **Are GMOs safe?

His decades of rigorous [independent research](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/michael-antoniou) into the risks of GM foods and glyphosate-based herbicides have raised serious concerns about the safety of these technologies. In a [report he prepared](https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Informe-Toxicidad-Michael-Antoniou-Escrito-de-Replica-Mexico-ENG.pdf) for the Mexican government, as the country attempted to restrict GMO corn imports [for health reasons](https://usrtk.org/gmo/new-scientific-analyses-mexicos-restrictions-on-gm-corn-glyphosate-health-risks/), Professor Antoniou cited \"a large body of evidence from well-controlled laboratory animal toxicity studies that show evidence of harm to multiple physiological systems\" from toxic agents found in GM corn. **The health risks of GM corn and its associated pesticides arise from three main sources: Bt insecticidal proteins engineered into the plants, DNA damage caused by the genetic modification process itself, and pesticides used on the crops**. The GM transformation process - the process by which a GMO is generated in the laboratory - is highly mutagenic. You create unintended damage to the DNA of the crop.

Many have been linked to serious health problems from cancer to infertility to birth defects**. Those pesticides contaminate our air, our water, and our bodies. One cancer-linked pesticide, glyphosate, is now found in [80% of adults and 87% of children](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2022/07/cdc-finds-toxic-weedkiller-87-percent-children-tested). [The Commission] barely mentions organic farming, despite the fact that organic is the clearest pathway to transforming our food system into one that is healthy and nontoxic. The US Department of Agriculture organic seal prohibits more than 900 synthetic pesticides allowed in conventional agriculture. Just one week on an organic diet can [reduce pesticide levels](http://www.organicforall.org/) in our bodies up to 95%. Synthetic food dyes-a key issue for the MAHA movement-are all prohibited by the organic seal, along with hundreds of other food additives and drugs. The Commission's strategy ignores organic. Instead, it leans into promoting industry-friendly \"precision agriculture\"-the use of AI, machine learning, and digital tools on farms to optimize inputs-which primarily [benefits corporate giants](https://foe.org/resources/bayer-monsanto-merger-big-data-big-agriculture-big-problems/) like Bayer. **Note:** For more along these lines, read our concise summaries of [news articles on government corruption](https://wanttoknow.info/governmentcorruptionmediaarticles) and [toxic chemicals](https://wanttoknow.info/toxic-chemicalsmediaarticles). **Autism Research Is a Chance for RFK Jr. to Take Pesticides Seriously** **September 16, 2025, *The Atlantic*** [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/09/autism-pesticides-rfk-jr/684227/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/09/autism-pesticides-rfk-jr/684227/) Pesticides once appeared to be a clear target for Robert F.

From February to mid-May, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) leaders accepted meetings with representatives from at least 50 industry associations and companies, including agricultural and chemical giants such as Bayer, Corteva, BASF, Dow and the agrichemical lobbying group CropLife America, as well as the American Soybean Association, the National Cotton Council and others. Critics of the agrichemical industry said corporate influence in regulatory matters was underscored earlier this month when the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" (MAHA) Commission released its [long-anticipated report](https://www.thenewlede.org/2025/09/maha-report-draws-fire/) on how to address chronic disease and clean up the food supply. The final version was significantly more friendly to the agricultural industry than a [May MAHA report](https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAHA-report.pdf) that cited the health risks posed by the widely used farm chemicals glyphosate and atrazine.

Companies often claim that toxic chemicals' health and safety data, and even their names, are \"confidential business information\" (CBI) because making the data public could damage their bottom line. **The US Environmental Protection Agency frequently allows industry to use the tactic, which makes it virtually impossible for public health researchers to quickly learn about dangerous chemicals. It also bars most EPA staff and state regulators from accessing the information** and criminal charges could be brought against those who do. That leaves regulators attempting to protect the public without essential information for some chemicals and in effect creates a \"shadow regulatory government\" in the EPA, said Tim Whitehouse, a former EPA attorney who is now director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer), a plaintiff in [one of the suits](https://peer.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2_15_24-PEER-AND-CEH-v-EPA_Inhance-FOIA-complaint-Final-Draft-2-14.pdf). The ... suit alleges the EPA has narrowed Congress's definitions of what should be made public. The EPA is also withholding chemical safety test results that show health risks to the public or environment. Separately, Peer is suing the EPA for hiding health and safety data for chemicals made by Inhance Technologies, which produces plastic containers found to leach [dangerous levels of PFOA](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/30/pfas-ban-plastic-containers-court), a highly toxic compound, into the containers' contents. **Note:** For more along these lines, read our concise summaries of [news articles on government corruption](https://wanttoknow.info/governmentcorruptionmediaarticles) and [toxic chemicals](https://wanttoknow.info/toxic-chemicalsmediaarticles). **'Geoengineering Fails Again': Coalition Cheers End of Arctic Ice Project** **January 30, 2025, *Common Dreams*** [https://www.commondreams.org/news/geoengineering](https://www.commondreams.org/news/geoengineering) Environmental and Indigenous activists declared Thursday that \"geoengineering fails again,\" welcoming the shutdown of a project that aimed to use \"a reflective material to protect and restore Arctic sea ice.\" \"While our climate impact simulations have shown promising results ... recent ecotoxicological tests have revealed potential risks to the Arctic food chain,\" the [Arctic Ice Project] team said.

The initiative has the backing of Indigenous, peasant and environmental organisations, but faces opposition from agribusiness and sectors that support GM. In San Lorenzo, the rejection of GM seeds evolved into organised political opposition after people detected the use of such seeds in nearby crops in 2012. They then feared that GM seeds might cross-pollinate with their native varieties, altering their traits and threatening their ability to preserve them. **The alarm prompted them to act. They travelled from village to village, hosted workshops, collected 1,300 signatures and drafted a citizen-led proposal**.

Ms. Boyle is from Vermont, and while studying at Emerson College in Boston, she worked an office job connected to the local food movement. But she quickly realized she wanted to be outside with her hands in the earth. Mr. Wolcik graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he studied sustainable agriculture and community food systems. He, too, realized he wanted a life close to the soil. They met while working at a nonprofit farm outside Boston and soon discovered they shared a dream about buying their own acreage to grow food and flowers. **They weren't interested in a massive operation. Instead, their vision included no-till growing methods, hand tools, and a desire to build a \"human scale\" production system. They also wanted to make their living entirely from their farm - something increasingly difficult to do in New England**. Over the past 60 years, the region has lost 80% of its farmland. They joined a community actively building a new storyline around farming, food, and resilience in New England. Here, in this part of little Vermont, statewide population 648,000, a coalition of farmers, nonprofits, and residents is eschewing mainstream beliefs about what makes agriculture successful and what it means to create a prosperous economy.

But for more than five years, a former Wall Street trader used it as a sex \"dungeon,\" luring women in and leaving them maimed and bruised, federal prosecutors say. Howard Rubin, 70, a former Salomon Brothers bond trader ... was arrested Friday on sex trafficking charges. Prosecutors said he brought women to the penthouse blocks from Central Park, where a bedroom was painted red, soundproofed and fitted with devices to use on the women. Along with a personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, Mr. Rubin recruited and paid at least a half-dozen women to participate in bondage and sadomasochism, but the acts went far beyond what the women had signed up for. Prosecutors said Mr. Rubin took advantage of the women, many of whom were especially vulnerable because of their histories of addiction and abuse. **Though women were told they could use a \"safe word\" to stop any sexual encounter, prosecutors said they were often unable to utter it because they were gagged or Mr. Rubin simply ignored their pleas**.

In response to a question from Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Wynn-Williams admitted that Meta (which was then known as Facebook) had targeted 13- to 17-year-olds with ads when they were feeling down or depressed. \"It could identify when they were feeling worthless or helpless or like a failure, and [Meta] would take that information and share it with advertisers,\" Wynn-Williams told the senators on the [subcommittee for crime and terrorism](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/a-time-for-truth-oversight-of-metas-foreign-relations-and-representations-to-the-united-states-congress). \"Advertisers understand that when people don't feel good about themselves, it's often a good time to pitch a product - people are more likely to buy something.\" She said the company was letting advertisers know when the teens were depressed so they could be served an ad at the best time. **As an example, she suggested that if a teen girl deleted a selfie, advertisers might see that as a good time to sell her a beauty product as she may not be feeling great about her appearance**. They also targeted teens with ads for weight loss when young girls had concerns around body confidence. If Meta was willing to target teens based on their emotional states, it stands to reason they'd do the same to adults.

It's a pattern replicated using data going back as far as the 1970s in almost 150 countries. But around 2011, researchers noticed an astonishing reversal in this trend. \"This empirical regularity has been replaced by a monotonic decrease in illbeing by age,\" they reported in an [NBER working paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4794387). In plain English, younger people today are unhappier, both compared to previous generations and to their older peers. In the US, for example, reported rates of anxiety among young people have exploded. So too have emergency room visits for self-harm. Similar trends can be seen in places like other English-speaking countries and the Nordics. **\"Why did it happen all over the world?\" [New York University's Jonathan] Haidt asked before sharing the theory he also puts forward in his best-selling book: \"We have over-protected children in the real world and under-protected them online.\"** Today, rather than playing with their friends, kids stay at home on their devices. Instead of hearing chatter and laughter in the corridor of schools, we hear the gentle tapping of screens. In the UK, as part of the [Smartphone Free Childhood](https://smartphonefreechildhood.co.uk/global) grassroots movement, 85,000 parents have signed a pact committing to delay giving their child a smartphone.

With these challenges in mind, [the nonprofit] NNOMY produced a video called \"[Before You Enlist](http://beforeyouenlist.org/)!\" The 16-minute video seeks to lay out a case against military service that preempts the military's psychological recruitment tactics. With veteran stories and statistics, the video debunks perks, such as \"free education\" and job training, that the military uses to appeal to potential recruits. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive [inspiring news articles archive](https://www.wanttoknow.info/inspirationalnewsarticles) focused on solutions and bridging divides. **As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, we depend almost entirely on donations from people like you.

Franzi underwent a risky two-day brain surgery to remove the mass, which doctors warned could leave her paralyzed or prove fatal. The operation was successful, but more than 13 years later, she still suffers from side effects, including issues with her reflexes, teeth, hearing, and vision. Before discovering the tumor, Franzi used the birth control shot Depo-Provera for more than 15 years. The shot has been used by roughly [one in four](https://www.sokolovelaw.com/dangerous-drugs/depo-provera/statistics/) sexually active women in the United States, bringing in [hundreds of millions](https://www.drugpatentwatch.com/p/drug-sales/drugname/DEPO-PROVERA#:~:text=Sales%20Trends%20and%20Historical%20Data,2021%20(see%20Figure%201).&text=Pandemic%2Drelated%20disruptions%20in%202020,due%20to%20increased%20healthcare%20outreach.) in profits annually for the pharmaceutical behemoth Pfizer, which manufactures and distributes the drug. **But according to more than [1,200 lawsuits](https://www.lawsuit-information-center.com/depo-provera-lawsuit.html), Pfizer has failed to properly warn the public about long-established links between Depo-Provera and meningiomas.

Juliette's firsthand testimony ... unravels Epstein's deep ties to the shadowy intelligence community that controlled him. It explores how the two-time college dropout amassed a fortune of half a billion dollars while spending his days abusing young girls. Twenty-three years ago, on September 26, 2002, Jeffrey Epstein touched down in Cape Town with a high-profile entourage. That night, 20-year-old Juliette Bryant, a psychology student and aspiring model, was recruited and promised a future with the lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret. Instead, she found herself ensnared in a global network of abuse. Juliette was trafficked across continents and American states, taken to all of Epstein's luxury residences, and introduced to co-conspirators who enabled his operations to flourish in plain sight. The sexual abuse and psychological manipulation Juliette endured were pervasive as she made her final trip to Epstein's remote Zorro Ranch in New Mexico. **There, in June 2004, Juliette awoke paralyzed in a laboratory, while a female doctor operated on her-without her knowledge or consent. While other books have documented his trafficking network, Blue Butterfly explores his obsession with elite eugenics, artificial intelligence, transhumanism, cryogenics, and cloning.** **Note:** Read our [comprehensive Substack investigation](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/epstein-was-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg) covering the connection between Epstein's child sex trafficking ring and intelligence agency sexual blackmail operations.

Nearly two years passed before investigators interviewed the two key corrections officers on duty the night Epstein died. **And details pulled from 90 photos of the cell and other evidence collected in the hours after Epstein's death - but before FBI agents arrived to process the scene - appear to show a succession of basic oversights, ranging from an absence of evidence markers to items being moved, experts told CBS News**. \"The FBI literally has all of the best tools. I mean, spared no expense. They have every tool you can imagine. And they used none of it as far as we can tell,\" forensic analyst Nick Barreiro said after reviewing the photos. \"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" Epstein's co-defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, said this summer during her interview in August with the Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche. Epstein's body was discovered at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10, 2019. The first FBI agents arrived at the cell more than seven hours later. When they arrived, photos show they found a disorganized, rifled-through clutter. Epstein's lifeless body had already been removed from the cell, eliminating a critical source of information investigators would need to determine how and when he died. **Note:** Read our [comprehensive Substack investigation](https://peerservice.substack.com/p/epstein-was-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg) covering the connection between Epstein's child sex trafficking ring and intelligence agency sexual blackmail operations.

It's about a conversation Edwards had with Epstein's bodyguard of five years, Igor Zinoviev, who warned him to back off because of Epstein's shadowy connections to the U.S. government. \"[Zinoviev said] 'You don't know who you're messing with and you need to be really careful.

There, he says, he attended classes for a week as the only private citizen in the room. At the end, the director or assistant director - Zinoviev couldn't remember - handed him a book with a handwritten note inside. He was told not to read it and to deliver it directly to Epstein in jail. Edwards later wrote about this encounter in his own book, [Relentless Pursuit: My Fight for the Victims of Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.amazon.com/Relentless-Pursuit-Victims-Jeffrey-Epstein/dp/1982148136). **Epstein's usefulness to high-ranking officials might also explain why a [Freedom of Information Act request](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-calendar-cia-director-goldman-sachs-noam-chomsky-c9f6a3ff) of his calendar by *The Wall Street Journal* revealed multiple meetings with former CIA director Bill Burns when he was Deputy Secretary of State**. **Note:** This piece was published on [Tara Palmeri's Substack](https://www.tarapalmeri.com/).

It is set to include a shelter, complete with its own energy and food supplies, though the carpenters and electricians working on the site were banned from talking about it. Asked last year if he was creating a doomsday bunker, the Facebook founder gave a flat \"no\". The underground space spanning some 5,000 square feet is, he explained, \"just like a little shelter, it's like a basement\". Other tech leaders ... appear to have been busy buying up chunks of land with underground spaces, ripe for conversion into multi-million pound luxury bunkers. Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, has talked about \"apocalypse insurance\". **So, could they really be preparing for war, the effects of climate change, or some other catastrophic event the rest of us have yet to know about? The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has only added to that list of potential existential woes**. Ilya Sutskever, chief scientist and a co-founder of Open AI, is reported to be one of them. Mr Sutskever was becoming increasingly convinced that computer scientists were on the brink of developing artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Each has its own supply chain that transforms the raw materials into ingredients - cocoa into cocoa liquor, cane into sugar, petroleum into blue food dye. **The environmental impact of ultra-processed foods - like M&Ms - is less clear and is only now starting to come into focus. One reason they have been so difficult to assess is the very nature of UPFs: these industrially made foods include a huge number of ingredients and processes to put them together, making it nearly impossible to track**. Since 1850, agricultural expansion has driven [almost 90%](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/cop26-agricultural-expansion-drives-almost-90-percent-of-global-deforestation/en) of global deforestation, which has been [responsible for 30%](https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/forests-and-climate-change) of global greenhouse gas emissions. Getting an exact measure of the environmental toll of UPFs is nearly impossible, given that, definitionally, UPFs consist of many ingredients and a high volume of opaque processes. Ingredients aren't just mixed together like one would do to make a stew at home. Instead, these ingredients are chemically modified, some parts stripped away, and flavors, dyes or textures added in - and it's unclear what the cost of these processes are because so many suppliers and components are involved. Another reason is that all UPFs (again, definitionally) are the creations of food companies that have little incentive to disclose their environmental footprint. **Note:** For more along these lines, read our concise summaries of [news articles on food system corruption](https://wanttoknow.info/food-corruptionmediaarticles) and [climate change](https://wanttoknow.info/globalwarmingmediaarticles). **'Surveillance pricing': Why you might be paying more than your neighbour** **October 15, 2025, *Al Jazeera*** [https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/10/15/surveillance-pricing...](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/10/15/surveillance-pricing-why-you-might-be-paying-more-than-your-neighbour) In July, US group Delta Air Lines revealed that approximately 3 percent of its domestic fare pricing is determined using artificial intelligence (AI) - although it has not elaborated on how this happens.

The difference can mean life or death for patients. **A new [Harvard Medical School study](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/deaths-rose-emergency-rooms-after-hospitals-were-acquired-private-equity-firms) of more than one million Medicare ER visits found that patient death rates are 13 percent higher in private equity-owned ERs than their counterparts**, likely thanks to staffing and salary cuts. On average, private equity-owned hospitals reduce hospital staffing by more than 11 percent and pay ER staffers 18 percent less than non-private equity hospitals. Private equity-backed dental groups have been [found](https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/dentists-pressed-to-drill-teeth-for-profit-ex-employees-say) to perform medically unnecessary and painful procedures. One firm allegedly [extracted](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/dental-implants-investigation-failures-unnecessary-healthy-teeth/) healthy teeth from patients to charge them for expensive dental implants, while another performed root canals on the baby teeth of children as young as three. A [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10751598/) of more than 662,000 Medicare hospitalizations in private equity-owned facilities saw 25 percent more hospital-acquired complications, including falls and surgical site infections, compared to other hospitals. Medicare patients in private equity-backed nursing homes suffered an [11 percent higher](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28474) short-term mortality rate than those in non-private equity-backed facilities between 2004 and 2019, resulting in 22,500 additional deaths.

Kennedy Jr.'s making animal welfare a component of his Make America Healthy Again mission. **The health secretary has asked his agencies to refine high-tech methods of testing chemicals and drugs that don't involve killing animals. He thinks phasing out animal testing and using the new methods will help figure out what's causing chronic disease**. Last week, the National Institutes of Health announced it would spend $87 million on a new center researching alternatives to animal testing and permit agency-supported researchers to use grant funding to find homes for retired lab animals. Kennedy signed off because he thinks the new methods will enable scientists to more quickly and inexpensively draw conclusions about how chemicals and drugs work. He expects that'll confirm his belief that chemicals in the environment and in food are making Americans sick and also speed cures for chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease and diabetes. The new center will attempt to develop a standardized alternative to animal testing that relies on tiny, lab-grown 3D tissue models, enlisting help from across the NIH and the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates pharmaceuticals. Harnessing science and technology to protect animals isn't an obvious Trump agenda item.

But despite the appearance of a mountain-side extinction event, life was already regenerating. Just 10 days after the eruption, the geomorphologist Fredrick Swanson surveyed one of the lahars with colleagues and noticed something intriguing.

This August, the Californian artist launched his 14-foot kayak off Catalina Island and paddled for 12 hours across the 26.5-mile Catalina Channel to San Pedro. **The brownish-white boat itself [was] \"a boat made entirely from a single mushroom growing outside my studio,\" Shoemaker explains - the world's largest mushroom boat**. He built it from wild Ganoderma polypore collected near his LA studio, propagated in a hemp-and-sawdust substrate for about four weeks, molded into kayak form and dried until it became \"a strong, hydrophobic and inert, cork-like material.\" Mycelium, the interconnected root network of a fungus such as Ganoderma polypore, can grow to hundreds of acres. The boat was sealed with locally sourced beeswax, using no synthetic materials. Shoemaker's multiyear project wasn't commercial - he is simply interested in demonstrating mushrooms' potential. His invention is part of AquaFung, a term coined - and a movement inspired - by artist Phil Ross that hopes to one day replace Styrofoam and other materials that go into water with fungi, as part of the nonprofit Open Fung. In their quest, Shoemaker and Ross are members of a sprouting global community of artists, engineers, high-end designers and environmentalists, intent on producing sustainable inventions from mushrooms.

Laced throughout, weaving an intricate, microscopic web, are the mycorrhizal fungi she's after - fungi that have spent 400 million years learning to live in symbiosis with plants, including the trees throughout Bole Woods and at least 80 percent of all species on the planet. Bashian-Victoroff doesn't need much soil. A single spoonful can contain miles of fungal hyphae and filaments, engaged in an ancient evolutionary exchange with the trees to which they've bonded. The fungi gather up water and nutrients, and deliver them to the trees. In return, they receive carbohydrates developed through photosynthesis, which they fix into the soil as they grow. **It's a prosperous cycle, and Bashian-Victoroff is among a growing global community of researchers and conservationists taking advantage of this relationship to restore forests and other degraded ecosystems**. Their goal: Promote the health of the soil beneath our feet and the plants it supports, sequester carbon and make agriculture more sustainable. Mycorrhizal fungi can be an important part of a broader suite of climate solutions, says Anne Polyakov, a fungal conservation and restoration scientist with the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks, or SPUN, which recently [used machine learning](https://www.spun.earth/underground-atlas/explainer-article) to map the planet's mycorrhizal networks in an effort to promote conservation. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this in on [technology for good](https://wanttoknow.info/tech-for-goodmediaarticles) and [healing the Earth](https://wanttoknow.info/healing-our-earthmediaarticles). **Mushroom walls and waste-fuelled stoves: inside the self-sufficient home of tomorrow** **November 9, 2022, *The Guardian* (One of the UK's Leading Newspapers)** [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022...](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/10/mushroom-walls-and-waste-fuelled-stoves-inside-the-self-sufficient-home-of-tomorrow) Joost Bakker believes a house can be more than a place to live: it can be a self-sustaining weapon against the climate crisis.

Erected in one of the busiest areas of Melbourne, the off-grid, three-storey house and urban farm produced all of its own power and food. Even the cooking gas was generated from human and food waste. \"We can have it all,\" Bakker [says]. **\"We can have houses covered with biology, plants, ecosystems and waterfalls.

While Alphabet \"continued to develop and enforce its policies independently, Biden Administration officials continued to press [Alphabet] to remove non-violative user-generated content,\" a lawyer for Alphabet wrote in a September 23 letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan. Administration officials including Biden \"created a political atmosphere that sought to influence the actions\" of private tech platforms regarding the moderation of misinformation.

One of the site's founders, Larry Sanger ... has been a vocal critic of what the site he built has become. At present, Wikipedians offer their own well-managed, curated perspective on global opinion. But any opinion outside of that perspective is an unwelcome \"minority or fringe view\"-as global opinion usually is. They will be silenced, should they have the audacity to speak for themselves. To better record the chorus of worldwide voices, Wikipedia should permit multiple, competing articles per topic, written within [explicitly declared frameworks](https://larrysanger.org/2-enable-competing-articles/), each aiming at neutrality within its own framework. Wikipedia's editorial work is self-managed by a group of volunteers. But things are not as democratic as they seem. There are 62 accounts with the most authority, who have the ability to install and remove administrators or check the IP addresses of problem users. But only 14.5 percent of these accounts reveal a full, real name. The vast majority of Wikipedia's top editorial leadership is anonymous. These accounts are the people who are ultimately responsible for Wikipedia's content. There is no legitimate, well-established way to ratify significant reforms. There have been few, if any, significant changes since 2006.

Security forces of Nigeria, Washington's most significant ally in Sub-Saharan Africa, habitually operate with impunity and without due regard for human rights protection - a key condition for receiving U.S. security cooperation. For example, the report spotlighted the following human rights abuses as ongoing concerns: \"arbitrary and unlawful killings; disappearances; or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious abuses in a conflict.\" **It also claimed that \"military operations against ISIS-WA, Boko Haram, and criminal organization targets\" often resulted in civilian deaths. Other findings include the use of \"excessive force,\" \"sexual violence and other forms of abuse\" by the military**. Since the 1950s, the U.S. has been the world's leading arms-exporting nation accounting between 2019 and 2023 for 42 percent of all global arms exports.

We also know that in the South there's a greater number of prisons in that region compared to other parts of the US. **There's likely hundreds of millions of dollars that are being made by this agricultural system within prisons. And so you could do some ballpark math to realize essentially that you have incarcerated people paid basically nothing while companies and/or the state are profiting off of this labor**.

The Alabama Solution ... reports on the inhumane living conditions, forced labor and rampant officer violence against the state's incarcerated population. Despite federal calls for prison reform, Alabama's prisons currently operate at 200% capacity, the film notes, with only one-third of the required staff.

Each 240-square-foot home is part of a larger community designed to help residents regain stability and independence. Since its founding in 2018 when they welcomed their first residents in Kansas City, VCP has helped hundreds of vets transition out of homelessness. **VCP has set a new standard for how cities can address veteran homelessness, with its 85% success rate for vets who complete the program successfully and transition to sustainable permanent housing-all in an average of 335 days**. Army combat veteran Dave Myers ... had never heard of VCP when his life was spinning out of control three years ago, addicted to drugs after returning home from war. He now smiles [recalling a judge's words](https://vcp.org/this-place-saved-me-how-one-veteran-found-purpose-after-pain/) ordering him to become a volunteer after he got clean in prison: \"He told me, 'You're going to spend so much time with these guys that they're either going to love you or hate you ... I hope it's the former, and that they offer you a job after.'\" Dave is now a full-time operations employee at VCP and is fulfilling his dream to help Veterans. \"I was able to connect with our residents in some ways that not a lot of other people can.

The concept grew organically from the 'offline getaway' retreats [co-founder Ilya] Kneppelhout set up with pals Valentijn Klok and Jordy van Bennekom. The trio opened their first phone-free hangout in Amsterdam's Cafe Brecht in February this year, and to their astonishment drew 125,000 new Instagram followers in the space of a month. Customers alternate between time to themselves and time to connect. \"People don't just pay to get rid of their phones - they're also paying to meet others,\" says Kneppelhout. \"We live in quite an isolated world where we're ever more connected online, but in the physical world, it's hard to meet people.

The basic idea behind solar geoengineering, or what we now prefer to call sunlight reflection methods (SRM), is that humans might reduce climate change by making the Earth a bit more reflective, partially counteracting the warming caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Many people already distrust the idea of engineering the atmosphere-at whichever scale-to address climate change, fearing negative side effects, inequitable impacts on different parts of the world, or the prospect that a world expecting such solutions will feel less pressure to address the root causes of climate change. Notably, Stardust says [on its website](https://www.stardust-initiative.com/) that it has developed novel particles that can be injected into the atmosphere to reflect away more sunlight, asserting that they're \"chemically inert in the stratosphere, and safe for humans and ecosystems.\" **But it's nonsense for the company to claim they can make particles that are inert in the stratosphere. Even diamonds, which are extraordinarily nonreactive, would alter stratospheric chemistry**. Any particle may become coated by background sulfuric acid in the stratosphere.

In May, the Government's Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) announced £56.8m for [21 \"climate cooling\" projects](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/09/09/dimming-the-sun-could-disrupt-weather-patterns/), which include injecting aerosols into the sky to reflect sunlight away from Earth. However, the report found there were \"major uncertainties\" and argued the plan may have devastating knock-on effects, particularly if deployed by rogue groups. Prof Jim Haywood, of atmospheric science at the University of Exeter, said: \"What you do in one place can cause climate change in a different place. \"Stratospheric aerosol injection deployment in the northern hemisphere could impact the position of the tropical monsoon and lead to droughts in sub-Saharan Africa. \"Everyone there relies on subsistence farming, so it quickly devastates if there is a drought there. \"In the southern hemisphere, it could lead to an increase in North Atlantic hurricane frequency and intensity, it could lead to winter droughts over the Mediterranean and the Iberian Peninsula.\" A \"termination effect\" whereby sun dimming technology was suddenly stopped, could also lead to rapid warming of up to 2C in decades, and cause devastating effects for ecosystems. **Note:** Modifying the atmosphere to dim the sun [involves catastrophic risks](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-geoengineerings-risks-need-be-studied-more).

Dr. Brown confessed in a Free Press article that he had framed his research not just to reflect the truth, but to fit within what he described as the climate alarmist storyline preferred by prestigious journals in the United States. He did this, he says, by intentionally focusing only on climate as a factor in wildfires, and not on the myriad other causes that contribute to the blazes consuming ever more land across the country. **The formula for getting published, he wrote, \"is more about shaping your research in specific ways to support pre-approved narratives than it is about generating useful knowledge for society.\"** And when it comes to climate science, he alleged, that preapproved narrative is that \"climate change impacts are pervasive and catastrophic.\" [Climate scientist] Dr. Pielke argues that many of the widely cited cost estimates connecting weather disasters to climate change are mistaken. (Climate advocates regularly assert that climate change is costing the U.S. billions of dollars every year.) **His research, he says, shows that extreme weather appears costlier because properties are more valuable. In other words, wealth increase is the real story.** He regularly takes issue with media portrayals of extreme weather. The reality is more complex, he says.

But that claim is false. This does not mean that climate change isn't happening. It is. It simply means that it has not caused the sea level to rise. Top scientists know this fact and have deliberately misrepresented it for years, deceiving the public. In September, I reported on one of the [first global studies](https://www.public.news/p/no-evidence-climate-change-has-accelerated) of sea level rise that used tide-gauge data, which is the only real-world data that goes back long enough, to the mid-19th Century, that would allow one to detect whether sea level rise had accelerated, decelerated, or remained steady.

The only reliable long-term real-world data is tide gauge data, and they do not show acceleration. Since then, I exchanged over 50 emails with one of the world's leading sea level rise scientists, Robert Kopp from Rutgers University, and heard back from IPCC, NASA, and NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. What I learned shocked me. For years, the world's top scientists have known that they cannot prove there has been an acceleration of sea level rise, and yet they have told the public that they can. **We've [known since 2018](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcc.557) that 89% of the atoll islands that scientists and the media claimed would be destroyed by sea level rise had instead grown or stayed the same size**. Sea level rise is not \"observably accelerating\" over time horizons that would show a trend. The only scientific basis for claiming it is accelerating is through modeling.

At this point the military intervention has killed 27 people, including individuals who are likely not Venezuelan. President Trump's most recent explanation to reporters for this unprecedented Pentagon build-up off Venezuela's coast was surprisingly reminiscent of the failed \"war on drugs\" which hearkens all the way back to the days of Richard Nixon, when he famously declared it \"public enemy number one\". There was a time ... where the CIA itself was the biggest narco-trafficker in United States and perhaps the entire Western hemisphere. This was to fund regime change and covert operations in Latin America after a belated Congressional crackdown on taxpayer funding for black ops. In August 1996, the *San Jose Mercury News* [published a] series of articles linking the CIA's \"contra\" army to the crack cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles. During the 1980s the CIA helped finance its covert war against Nicaragua's leftist government through sales of cut-rate cocaine to South Central L.A. drug dealer, Ricky Ross. **The CIA's drug network, wrote [journalist Gary] Webb, \"opened the first pipeline between Colombia's cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles, a city now known as the 'crack' capital of the world.\" Black gangs used their profits to buy automatic weapons, sometimes from one of the CIA-linked drug dealers**. **Note:** Though President Richard Nixon launched the War on Drugs by declaring drugs \"public enemy No. 1,\" [secretly he admitted](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a-nixon-started-war-drugs-privately-he-said-pot-was-not-particularly-dangerous) in a 1973 Oval Office meeting that marijuana was \"not particularly dangerous.\" The War on Drugs is a [trillion dollar failure](https://www.wanttoknow.info/a--war-drugs-trilliondollar-failure) that has been made worse by every presidential administration since Nixon.

The Church Committee transcripts are among the highlights of the Digital National Security Archive collection, [CIA and the Behavioral Sciences: Mind Control, Drug Experiments and MKULTRA](https://proquest.libguides.com/dnsa/64). Gottlieb was a key bureaucratic player who signed off on hundreds of MKULTRA subprojects and who developed clandestine relationships with universities, prisons, hospitals, private laboratories, and private foundations that made it difficult to trace the programs back to the Agency. The Church Committee faced considerable obstacles in reconstructing the story, especially since Gottlieb and CIA director Richard Helms destroyed most of the original project records in 1973. **Note:** According to Gottlieb's testimony, the CIA covertly dosed an unwitting individual with a massive amount of LSD to deliberately induce psychosis, causing him to experience violent paranoia and leading an unsuspecting psychiatrist to declare him mentally ill. This was done explicitly to discredit the man in the eyes of his colleagues-a tactic deemed as operationally useful for destroying a person's credibility without ever touching them.

Ms. Larsson's garden, situated on a postage stamp of land beside the Karlbergs Canal, is one of more than 7,000 garden allotments, known as koloniträdgårdar, in Stockholm. The gardens, established as part of a social movement around the turn of the 20th century, offer city dwellers access to green space and a reprieve from crowded urban life. **Though most are modest in size - Ms. Larsson's garden is about 970 square feet - koloniträdgårdar are prized for providing a rare kind of urban sanctuary, a corner of the city where residents can trade pavement for soil, and the buzz of traffic for birdsong**. The garden programs were specifically designed to improve the mental and physical health of city dwellers. The idea was that a working-class family would be able to spend the summer there and work together but also have some leisure and fun. Cecilia Stenfors ... at Stockholm University, said her research shows that those who frequently visit green spaces, whether a forest or a koloniträdgård, \"have better health outcomes, in terms of fewer depressive symptoms, less anxiety, better sleep and fewer feelings of loneliness and social isolation.\" These positive effects can be particularly pronounced in older people and can help combat symptoms", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:25__11-profound-risks-of-geoengineering.txt:6:d2c97ef2e741", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7995, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "25__11-profound-risks-of-geoengineering.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "25__11-profound-risks-of-geoengineering", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "working-class family would be able to spend the summer there and work together but also have some leisure and fun.

By the numbers, the Millennium Seed Bank [holds](https://www.kew.org/about-us/press-media/millennium-seed-bank-25-anniversary) over 2 billion seeds from over 40,000 species, collected by scientists and volunteers from 279 organizations spanning over 100 countries**. It's likely the largest seed vault on Earth, with the other contender being located on the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. Located at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew facility in Wakehurst, seeds from all over the world are carefully cleaned, dried, and stored in walk-in freezers at -20°C, or about -4°F. For 25 years, the work has been carried out by experts who have developed the skills not only to store the seeds, but also to wake them up again, often using bespoke protocols for seed germination. \"Within species there is incredible genetic diversity, which protects against disease, climate change and other threats,\" Dale Sanders, biologist and former director of the John Innes Centre in Norwich, told AP. \"Maintaining that diversity is essential if we want to preserve the diversity of life itself.\" For all the archiving and record keeping and preservation, the MSB is hardly just a storehouse. To the contrary, it's always growing something: funds for ecosystem restoration or botanical research, young scientists looking to begin a career in plant conservation, or plans to restore existing ecosystems by leveraging the vault's vast reserves. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this on [healing the Earth](https://wanttoknow.info/healing-our-earthmediaarticles). **Denver's Food Forests Provide Free Fruit While Greening the Environment** **September 29, 2025, *Civil Eats*** [https://civileats.com/2025/09/29/denvers-food-forests-provide-free...](https://civileats.com/2025/09/29/denvers-food-forests-provide-free-fruit-while-greening-the-environment/) The urban tree canopy in Denver is one of the [sparsest in the country](https://denver.prelive.opencities.com/files/assets/public/v/3/parks-and-recreation/documents/forestry/final-ufsp-20240814-web_ada.pdf).

The problem with using data to make predictions is that the process can be used as a weapon against society, threatening democratic values. As the lines between private and public data are blurred in modern society, many won't realize that their private lives are becoming data points used to make decisions about them. What AI does is make this a surveillance ratchet, a device that only goes in one direction, which goes something like this: **To make the inferences I want to make to learn more", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:25__8-ai-powered-surveillance-capitalism.txt:0:2f51bb8d5de8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 7998, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "25__8-ai-powered-surveillance-capitalism.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "25__8-ai-powered-surveillance-capitalism", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "make predictions is that the process can be used as a weapon against society, threatening democratic values.

This war on dissent is the most visible sign of democratic backsliding in the U.S.** By using the National Guard to silence dissent in Los Angeles, the Trump administration is eroding a core pillar of democracy: the right to assemble in public to express opinions contrary to government action and to advocate for change. U.S. police forces developed [an] approach to public order policing called \"negotiated management\" in the 1980 and 1990s.

If the death resulted from police use of force, as Floyd's did, it is labeled \"use of force by a law enforcement or corrections officer.\" But, when an unredacted copy of four years of data was inadvertently posted on a government website late last year, Floyd's case was listed under a different category, \"homicide\" - which refers to deaths at the hands of another civilian, not law enforcement. The error shows how even one of the most notorious cases of police violence, one that led to a murder conviction for the officer, can be hidden in the official statistics. A Marshall Project review ... identified hundreds of people who died in custody but weren't listed, and entire states that failed to report almost any deaths in their prisons or in their jails. We found at least 681 deaths missing from the federal count - a number that would almost certainly rise if more complete data were available nationwide. **More than 5,000 people likely died in state and federal [prisons](https://uclaprisondata.org/) in 2021, over 1,000 in [local jails](https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/mortality-local-jails-2000-2019-statistical-tables) in 2019 and over 1,000 in arrest-related [interactions](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/ardprs1516pf_sum.pdf) with police in 2024.

Guards deploy it at close range in enclosed spaces, against policy, against humanity. They gas entire housing units to punish one person's \"noncompliance.\" What they don't tell you is how this chemical weapon-which is [banned in warfare](https://www.warresisters.org/about-tear-gas/) ... affects women's bodies differently than men's. Studies have found that women experience [more serious reactions](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10956352/) to tear gas exposure, particularly impacting reproductive health. In 2021, a study on the effects of tear gas on reproductive health found that nearly 900 people reported [abnormal menstrual changes](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-10859-w#Sec21) after exposure to tear gas. Other studies have linked tear gas exposure to [miscarriage and fetal harm](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/tear-gas-abortifacient-why-wont-anti-abortion-movement-oppose-it/). Criminal justice advocates have decried the growing use of tear gas and pepper spray in prisons, saying that they should only be used as a last resort when there's a serious threat to safety. **But I've seen guards deploy it for cursing, for walking too slowly, for asking too many questions.

In fact, today roughly 90 percent of detained immigrants are held in privately operated facilities, the highest share in history. The industry is instead preparing for explosive growth. On recent earnings calls, CoreCivic executives announced plans to triple the number of beds in their facilities within a few months. That would mean an additional $1.5 billion in revenue for the corporation, more than doubling its annual earnings. **Meanwhile, growing scrutiny of immigration detention practices has led to reports of abuse, medical neglect, and deaths in custody. Privatization, with the cost-cutting practices that define it, is the structural driver of human rights violations at these facilities**. Private prisons corporations are just one piece of the sprawling prison industry. The U.S. carceral system is comprised of a vast and deeply entrenched network of public-private partnerships that make billions from incarceration and detention. Commissary corporations mark-up basic hygiene items like toothpaste or tampons by 300 percent or more. Private healthcare providers routinely deny or delay treatment, contributing to suffering and preventable deaths behind bars. Private food vendors serve meals that are frequently expired or nutritionally inadequate, all in the name of cutting costs and maximizing returns. **Note:** For more along these lines, read our concise summaries of [news articles on immigration enforcement corruption](https://wanttoknow.info/immigration-enforcement-corruptionmediaarticles). **Private-equity backed prison health companies continue despite decade of alleged constitutional violations** **August 18, 2025, *The Guardian* (One of the UK's Leading Newspapers)** [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/us-private-prison...](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/us-private-prison-healthcare-industry) Staff at a Santa Barbara county jail heard screams coming from one of the cells.

Ramona, an operating room assistant at Waterbury Hospital cited in the report, explained how Prospect went to extreme lengths to avoid spending money. **She explained to Murphy that Prospect at one point stopped paying vendors, which resulted in supplies eventually growing \"so scarce patients were sometimes left on the operating table while staff scrambled\" to find the necessary equipment**. Staff members eventually started buying supplies themselves, with some even going so far as to buy food for their patients to ensure that they did not go hungry.

As Harold Puthoff, a physicist with the Stanford Research Institute, witnessed the output from his magnetometer changing, he was mind-blown. There was no physical explanation for the reading changing the way it did. And as soon as Puthoff asked Swann to stop thinking about the apparatus, the unexplained changes in the magnetic field abruptly stopped. **By the time Puthoff and his colleague Russel Targ, another physicist at the Stanford Research Institute (now known as SRI International), presented their results ... the CIA had already begun working with SRI to perform top-secret research on paranormal phenomena**-primarily \"remote viewing\" for intelligence collection. Remote viewing refers to a type of extra-sensorial perception that involves using the mind to \"see\" or manipulate distant objects, people, events, or other information. By the mid-1980s, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) took the program over, calling it \"Stargate.\" DIA had three main goals for its research: Determine how to apply remote viewing to intelligence gathering against foreign targets; Figure out how other countries could be doing the same thing and using it against the U.S.; and Perform laboratory experiments to find ways to improve remote viewing for use in the intelligence field. **Note:** Learn more about [remote viewing](https://www.wanttoknow.info/remoteviewing/remote-viewing).

The Soviets were constructing the world's largest nuclear submarine. With limited intelligence operations, the CIA recruited a 'psychic' spy to locate the top secret vessel, and he apparently did so [using only his mind](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14179243/cia-docs-reveal-life-mars-pyramids.html). The agency had been carrying out experiments in the 1970s and 80s with individuals who claimed to have extrasensory powers and were able to perceive information about distant objects, people or events. There are claims that this group of test subjects, known as 'remoter viewers', successfully tracked down hostages and drug lords for the covert program that lasted more than a decade. **One of the best remote viewers, a man named [Joe McMoneagle](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14456883/Former-CIA-agent-claims-life-Mars-evidence-prove-it.html), claimed to have used his ability to see inside a Soviet Union hangar and uncover a top-secret submarine being built**. Typically, remote viewers sit at a table with paper and something to sketch with. They're then given something simple, like a set of numbers, to focus their attention on. For psychic spies during the Cold War, these would have most often been coordinates - a set of numbers marking off a spot in the world where the US government wanted to investigate. From there, the remote viewer just sits there and relaxes, kind of like meditating. They clear their heads and let their minds wander toward whatever those numbers point to. McMoneagle's participation in the Army's psychic intelligence unit was eventually confirmed in declassified documents and interviews. **Note:** Learn more about [remote viewing](https://www.wanttoknow.info/remoteviewing/remote-viewing).

The experience of remote viewer Ingo Swann was first revealed in 1998 when he explained how his psychic episode took him to the dark side of the moon. That's where the remote reviewer made a shocking discovery: towers, buildings, and human-like aliens working at a secret complex on the moon's surface. **Disturbingly, Swann said government officials knew the aliens had a base there, and these humanoids could actually sense his presence as he viewed them with his mind from 238,000 miles away**.

He claimed that a race of aliens that 'looked exactly like us' erected several giant towers on the moon. One was the size of the United Nations building in New York. Swann, who died in 2013, made the shocking claims in his book '[Penetration: The Question of Extraterrestrial and Human Telepathy](https://www.ivantic.info/Slike%20i%20kratki%20filmovi/Izvestaj%20o%20Mesecu.pdf).'However, Swann was also told that he could not reveal anything he saw in that vision for 'at least 10 years.' One thing he did not expect to see was two of the aliens spotting his consciousness viewing the secret moon base. 'Two of them pointed in my direction,' Swann explained. 'How could they do that ... unless ... they have some kind of high psychic perceptions, too?'

A [declassified U.S. Army study](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/cia-rdp96-00788r001700210016-5.pdf), known as \"The Gateway Process,\" opens an extraordinary avenue into this idea, blending ancient spiritual concepts with rigorous scientific investigation. In the early 1980s, Lieutenant Colonel Wayne M. McDonnell embarked on a 29-page analysis of the Gateway Process, a program created by the Monroe Institute. This initiative sought to expand human awareness beyond the physical plane, exploring states of consciousness that defy conventional understanding. Key techniques included: Hypnosis: Inducing deep mental focus to access unconscious realms; Transcendental meditation: Harnessing mental clarity to transcend ordinary cognition; Remote viewing: Observing distant locations or events using only the mind. **McDonnell's findings posited that consciousness could interact with a dimension beyond time and space, which the Monroe Institute called the Absolute.

The evidence was turned over to the FBI in the weeks after 9/11, but ... it was never shared with the bureau's own field agents or top intelligence officials. The evidence came to light as part of a long-running lawsuit against the Saudi government by the families of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks, and it includes a chilling video of a Saudi national filming the U.S. Capitol. This video, recorded in the summer of 1999, was unsealed in federal court last year as part of the 9/11 families lawsuit accusing Saudi Arabia of providing crucial support to the hijackers.

Former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, among other intelligence officials, have lied to Congress and the American public about their reliance on the discredited Steele dossier - a report [paid for by the Clinton campaign](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/clinton-dnc-steele-dossier-fusion-gps) and the DNC - while simultaneously engineering different versions of critical intelligence assessments to cover their tracks. Activists tied to George Soros' Open Society Foundations, aided by operatives within the Obama FBI and intelligence community, sought to plant and [spread the bogus narrative](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/soros-alleged-ties-russiagate-exposed-declassified-annex-durham-report) about Trump colluding with Russia. **Hacked emails and foreign intelligence corroborated this extraordinary collusion between campaign operatives, federal law enforcement, and the media - a clear case of government being weaponized for partisan ends**. Leaders at the FBI - Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok - and at the CIA, and their superiors in the Obama White House, [knew precisely](https://www.judicialwatch.org/major-revelations-in-trump-russia-scandal/) what was unfolding. They were using the intelligence community's credibility to spread what they knew to be their own fiction as if it were truth. **Note:** The security firm CrowdStrike was hired to investigate the alleged Russian hack of DNC servers in 2016 and [found no proof](https://itwire.com/business-it-news/security/crowdstrike-chief-admits-no-proof-that-russia-exfiltrated-dnc-emails.html) that any emails from the system had been exfiltrated.

The report, conducted for the CIA by the independent American Institutes for Research, did much more than confirm the existence of the highly classified program ... code-named Star Gate. The CIA researchers had validated some Star Gate trials, finding that \"hits occur more often than chance\" and that \"something beyond odd statistical hiccups is taking place.\" But the report declared that ESP was next to worthless for military use because the tips provided are too \"vague and ambiguous\" to produce actionable intelligence. Brian Buzby was an Army lieutenant colonel when he briefly ran the Pentagon's ESP program in the 1980s. He's retired in Alabama now and has never spoken to the media before. \"I believed in it then, and I believe in it now,\" Buzby says. \"It was a real thing, and it worked.\" **Note:** Learn more about [remote viewing](https://www.wanttoknow.info/remoteviewing/remote-viewing).

Instead of holding on to our status as creators, we lapse into the subsidiary role of being a character in the story**. One major tradition, however, was free of stories, namely the Vedic tradition in India. They teach ... about consciousness. No story is attached, because consciousness is timeless. When this truth is lost, the mind fills in the space with stories. A story is whatever you live by that isn't fully conscious. Of course, the world's religions and spiritual traditions contain inspiring thoughts, some of them deeply imbued with pure consciousness. By the same token, physical/materialist eras are filled with impressive discoveries that bring subtle levels of Nature to light. But only consciousness knows consciousness.

In the last few years, scientists across all kinds of disciplines have been making remarkable breakthroughs in the study and exploration of consciousness**. William B. Miller, Ph.D., an evolutionary biologist and physician, is ... is among a small, but growing group of scientists who believe that your cells aren't \"passive robots that automatically follow a code of instructions, carrying out orders from our genome like mindless drones.\" Instead, these scientists think the roughly 37 trillion cells that make up your body are themselves conscious-and that life and consciousness began exactly at the same time. Scientists aren't just exploring consciousness in our bodies-they're also searching for it in even weirder, more complex places. In recent decades, some experts have developed a theory that says when your brain performs quantum operations, it generates consciousness. One scientist, Michael Pravica, Ph.D., for example, believes that your brain can access hidden dimensions during moments of heightened awareness. But these ideas don't have to be purely theoretical; to some degree, they can be put to the test. That was the case with a recent groundbreaking study that suggests [Your Consciousness Can Connect With the Whole Universe](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a62373322/quantum-theory-of-consciousness/).

He explored N'Kisi's psychic abilities using a double-blind test. He asked Morgana to look at photographs in one room while the parrot was in a cage in another. One camera videotaped Morgana looking at photographs, another camera about 55 feet away videotaped the parrot, who made comments that seemed to correspond to many of the photos Morgana was looking at. N'Kisi made 123 comments during the test sessions, and 32 of those were \"direct hits\" corresponding to the images Morgana was looking at. The chances of that occurring, Sheldrake says, are less than 1 in a billion. Telepathy is made possible, he says, by the emotional bonds between people and animals. \"In the case of N'Kisi, there's a very strong connection between her and Aimee.\" **Note:** For a nine-minute video of this fascinating experiment, [click here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UX4d2nb7yU).

The radar returns looked off-phantom blips moving with unfathomable speed and precision. The objects on one occasion finally came into view. **Graves reported seeing a dark gray or black cube inside a clear sphere, between five and 15 feet in diameter, coming within 50 feet of their jets. Over the next year, Graves's squadron recorded sightings of unidentified objects almost daily**. Sometimes the objects flew in loose formations. Other times they traveled alone. They had no exhaust, no visible propulsion, no wings. Some of these craft-now classified as UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena)-appeared to be capable of transmedium travel, meaning they are able to move from air to sea without slowing, splashing, or emitting heat. They challenged every assumption held by aerospace engineers and radar operators. Since at least the 1950s, military sources have reported strange objects plunging into the ocean-what they call USOs (unidentified submerged objects). Today Graves is one of the most vocal advocates for UAP transparency. He's the founder of Americans for Safe Aerospace, the largest UAP-focused pilot safety initiative in the world. He doesn't claim that these craft are alien, but he's certain that they aren't using known human tech. **Note:** Watch a new [video by Amber Yang](https://youtu.be/whqM1HPSCeo?si=T9ITmTHX6mgMDCjq) on recent exciting developments in UFO/UAP disclosure.

Suddenly, you die. A man you have never met and whose presence you did not know about has shot you with his rifle. His companions stab your lungs so that your body will sink to the bottom of the sea. Your family will likely never know what happened to you. That is what happened to a group of unnamed North Korean fishermen who accidentally stumbled upon a detachment of U.S. Navy SEALs in 2019. The commandos had set out to install a surveillance device to wiretap government communications in North Korea. **When they stumbled upon an unexpected group of divers on a boat, the SEALs killed everyone on board and retreated.

More than 3,600 synthetic chemicals from food contact materials, such as packaging and pesticides, are present within human bodies globally, the report revealed, 80 of which are feared to be especially dangerous. Chemicals known as Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) were found in almost everyone tested, with 14 per cent of European teenagers having blood levels high enough to pose serious health risks. **Among the shocking findings is the link between pesticide use and leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and bladder, colon and liver cancer - including suggestions that prenatal pesticide exposure increases the odds of childhood leukaemia and lymphoma by more than 50 per cent**.

Some advocates are calling for higher intake of animal fats and promoting so called ancestral or animal based keto diets, citing traditional wisdom and nutrient density. Diets like Keto often rely on meat and dairy from industrial production systems, where contamination with drugs and chemicals is routine. The promise of healing through meat and fat collapses when those foods carry residues of antibiotics, steroid hormones, synthetic preservatives, arsenicals, cocciodiostats, and pesticides. Many of these toxins accumulate precisely in the fats and organs being celebrated as nutrient rich. A decade ago, as policy director at the Center for Food Safety, I helped publish a report entitled \"[America's Secret Animal Drug Problem](https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/files/animal_drug_10_26_77838.pdf),\" identifying over 450 animal drugs and feed additives used in U.S. meat production. That number alarmed me then. **Today, the Food and Drug Administration has approved nearly 700 veterinary drugs for use in food-producing animals. This figure includes not only growth promoters and antibiotics but also synthetic hormones, beta agonists, coccidiostats, and antiparasitics**.

The playground, which receives funding from Berlin government authorities, also offers practical courses such as pottery, blacksmithery, archery and handicrafts, and has a space for music practice. Weekly meetings are held among the kids to discuss rules and problems, with a system of cards used for behavioral issues.

Lib Work, Ltd. completed their first 3D-printed earth home in Yamaga, Kumamoto on July 22, calling their creative process \"uncharted territory where tradition and convention offered no guide\". With an eye toward recycling, sustainability, and reduced carbon emissions, Lib Work focused on combining 3D-printing with natural materials enhanced for strength, constructibility, and design quality. **The walls of the completed [Lib Earth House Model B](https://libwork.co.jp/3dprinter_house/brand02en.html) use no cement (which produces industrial waste). Instead, they utilized only naturally derived materials with soil as the primary component to create sustainable earthen walls**. Compared to the previous model (Model A) that used some cement, the building's strength has improved approximately fivefold while significantly reducing CO2 emissions from the manufacturing process itself. The walls contain cutting-edge sensors as part of a wall condensation monitoring system that monitors in real-time the temperature and humidity inside the walls.

It was the 90s, and in Australia bollworms were devastating cotton farms. He experimented and eventually came up with a simple food spray, \"a mixture of food ingredients, yeast and sugar-based, diluted in water and applied to crops. It emits an odour which is picked up by beneficial predatory insects and attracts them to the fields where they kill pests.\" It was the beginning of an international grassroots campaign, in which Mensah has worked with various charities to teach people about this sustainable farming method. Ever since the dangerous side effects of pesticides became widely known, alternatives have been sought. This approach to farming, which reduces our reliance on pesticides, is called integrated pest management. In 2005, Mensah took food sprays to Benin, where the Pesticide Action Network (PAN UK) was helping farmers transition to organic farming. There, the misuse of chemical pesticides was seriously damaging people's health. **The food sprays - cheap, safe and effective - caught on with farmers in Benin where thousands now use the technique**. From there, Mensah took food sprays to southern Ethiopia, where they were also trialled successfully on vegetables ... and then to Vietnam where they were used successfully on maize. Another charity, Better Cotton, is now trialling food sprays in India ... where they've trained 214,000 farmers to use sprays. **Note:** Explore more positive stories like this on [technology for good](https://wanttoknow.info/tech-for-goodmediaarticles) and [healing the Earth](https://wanttoknow.info/healing-our-earthmediaarticles). **As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, we depend almost entirely on donations from people like you.

OFFERS PLAN TO SAVE GASOLINE** **Ickes Praises Proposal to Cut Driving and Starting Speed on a Voluntary Basis** **FUEL DROP IS PUT AT 20%** **Estimate Based on Bureau of Standard Tests-Method Would Obviate Curbs** Special to The New York Times Washington, June 10-Slower driving, slower starting and more efficient operation of automobiles were suggested today by the American Automobile Association as a means of saving as much as 20 per cent in gasoline consumption to avoid a threatened petroleum shortage on the Eastern seaboard and make unnecessary drastic regulation of petroleum uses. Secretary Ickes, Federal Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense, to whom the suggestions were sent, accepted the recommendations with praise, declaring: \"We have too fast driving for ordinary safety of life and limb anyway.\" Thomas P. Henry, president of the A.A.A., wrote Secretary Ickes that **tests conducted by the A.A.A. and Bureau of Standards showed that an automobile traveling at forty miles an hour averaged 17.2 miles per gallon** of gasoline, but that the same car going at sixty miles an hour would get only eleven miles to the gallon. \"Clearly, it is preferable to place gasoline consumption on a basis of voluntary cooperation rather than to attempt to bring it about by government regulation,\" Mr. Henry wrote. \"I am sure you will find that the motorists will give you full support in effecting any savings that may become necessary. **Two Ways of Saving Gasoline** \"There are two ways in which the car owners can cooperate in effecting savings in gasoline.

One is to reduce the number of trips. The other is to cut down average driving speed, to avoid hasty getaways in city traffic and to adjust the car for maximum fuel efficiency. \"It is not generally realized how many millions of gallons of gasoline are wasted through the tendency of many motorists to get off to leaping starts after stops at intersections, through excessive speeds on the open highway and through failure to make proper engine adjustments. \"In addition to cutting down average speeds, motorists can contribute to gasoline consumption by having carburetors adjusted to operate on the leanest efficient mixture, by having the engine in peak operating condition and by keeping the full amount of air pressure in tires at all times. **Consumers' Program Outlined** \"It is our belief that cooperation along these lines by motorists in areas threatened with shortage would result in savings of at least 20 per cent, or substantially more than the amount of probable shortage as shown in the American Petroleum Institute's report. I should like to suggest, therefore, that the program for gasoline consumption be along these broad general lines: \"First, an intensive program urging cooperation by motorists through reducing their driving speeds and adopting other fuel-saving practices. \"Second, if this fails to bring about the necessary reduction, seek voluntary cooperation in refraining from non-essential driving. \"Third, only if both these measures fail and the shortage reaches emergency proportions should restriction by regulation be resorted to.\" FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Seeing her shabby, unkempt appearance, the pastor guessed the reason and, taking her by the hand, took her inside and found a place for her in the Sunday school class. The child was so happy that they found room for her, that she went to bed that night thinking of the children who have no place to worship. Some two years later, this child lay dead in one of the poor tenement buildings and the parents called for the kindhearted pastor, who had befriended their daughter, to handle the final arrangements. As her poor little body was being moved, a worn and crumpled purse was found which seemed to have been rummaged from some trash dump. Inside was found 57 cents and a note scribbled in childish handwriting which read, \"This is to help build the little church bigger so more children can go to Sunday School.\" For two years she had saved for this offering of love. When the pastor tearfully read that note, he knew instantly what he would do. Carrying this note and the cracked, red pocketbook to the pulpit, he told the story of her unselfish love and devotion. He challenged his deacons to get busy and raise enough money for the larger building. But the story does not end there! A newspaper learned of the story and published it. It was read by a realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that the church could not pay so much, he offered it for 57 cents. Church members made large donations. Checks came from far and wide. Within five years the little girl's gift had increased to $250,000.00 a huge sum for that time (near the turn of the century). Her unselfish love had paid a large dividend. When you are in the city of Philadelphia, look up Temple Baptist Church, with a seating capacity of 3,300 and Temple University, where hundreds of students are trained. Have a look, too, at the Good Samaritan Hospital, and at a Sunday School building which houses hundreds of Sunday Schoolers, so that no child in the area will ever need to be left outside during Sunday school time. In one of the rooms of this building may be seen the picture of the sweet face of the little girl whose 57 cents, so sacrificially saved, made such remarkable history. Alongside of it is a portrait of her kind pastor, Dr. Russell H. Conwell, author of the book, \"Acres of Diamonds\".

An Air Force spokesman confirmed issuance of the directive after portions of it were made public by a private \"flying saucer\" group. The new regulations were issued by the Air Force inspector general Dec. 24. The regulations, revising similar ones issued in the past, outlined procedures and said that \"investigations and analysis of UFO's are directly related to the Air Force's responsibility for the defense of the United States.\" **Committee Reveals Document** Existence of the document was revealed by the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. The privately financed committee accused the Air Force of deception in publicly describing reports of unidentified flying objects as delusions and hoaxes while sending the private admonition to its commands. **Vice Admiral R. H. Hillenkoetter (Ret.), a committee board member and former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said in a statement that a copy of the inspector general's warning had been sent to the Senate Science and Astronautics Committee.** **\"It is time for the truth to be brought out in open Congressional hearings,\"** he said.\" The Air Force confirmed that the document had been issued. A spokesman said it was put out by Maj. Gen. Richard E. O'Keefe, acting inspector general at the time, to call attention to revised Air Force regulations concerning unidentified flying objects. The statement was included in an \"operations and training\" pamphlet circulated at intervals to bring commands up to date.

The Air Force has investigated 6,132 reports of flying objects since 1947, including 183 in the last six months of 1959. The latest Air Force statement, issued a month ago said, \"no physical or material evidence, not even a minute fragment of a so-called flying saucer, has ever been found.\" Admiral Hillenkoetter said that **\"behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFO's.\" \"But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense,\"** the retired admiral said. He charged that **\"to hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personnel\"** through the issuance of a regulation. ** Note:** if you click on [this link](http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50A12F9345D1A728DDDA10A94DA405B808AF1D3) to purchase this article from the *New York Times*, you will see that their database has misspelled the article title to read \"Air Forge\" rather than \"Air Force.\" The *New York Times* is generally meticulous about editing and correcting errors.

Delgado, the scientist, pressed a button on a small radio transmitter in his hand, and the bull braked to a halt.** **Then, he pressed another button on the transmitter and the bull obediently turned to the right and trotted away. **The bull was obeying commands from his brain that had been called forth by electrical stimulation-by the radio signals-of certain regions in which fine wire electrodes had been painlessly implanted the day before. The experiment, conducted last year in Cordova, Spain, by Dr. Delgado of Yale University's School of Medicine, was probably the most spectacular demonstration ever performed of the deliberate modification of animal behavior through external control of the brain. Dr. Delgado was trying to find out what makes brave bulls brave - just as other of his experiments have aimed at finding the biological basis for emotions, personality and behavior in man and other animals through electrical stimulation of their brains. He has been working in this field for more than 15 years. Techniques that he and other scientists have recently developed have been refined to the point where, he believes, \"a turning point has been reached in the study of the mind.\" \"I do believe,\" he said in a recent lecture, \"that an understanding of the biological bases of social and antisocial behavior and of mental activities, which for the first time", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:650517nytimes.txt:0:5cefc3d8c44d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8040, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "650517nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "650517nytimes", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "other animals through electrical stimulation of their brains.

Dr. Delgado said in an interview recently that he was particularly concerned with what he called the \"gap between our understanding of the atom and our understanding of the mind.\" \"We are in a precarious race,\" he said, \"between the acquisition of many megatons of destructive power and the development of intelligent human beings who will make intelligent use of the formidible forces at our disposal.\" **Based on His Experiments** Dr. Delgado's contention that brain research has reached a stage of refinement where it can contribute to the solution of some of these problems is based, he said, on many of his own experiments. **These have shown, he explained, that \"functions traditionally related to the psyche, such as friendliness, pleasure or verbal expression, can be induced, modified and inhibited by direct electrical stimulation of the brain.\"** ** For example, he has been able to \"play\" monkeys and cats 'like little electronic toys\" that yawn, hide, fight, play, mate and go to sleep on command. And with humans under treatment for epilepsy, he has increased word output sixfold in one person, has produced severe anxiety in another, and in several others has induced feelings of profound friendliness-all by electrical stimulation of various specific regions of their brains.** The evocation of bodily responses from electrically stimulated brains goes back to the middle of the 19th century, when scientists produced limb movements and other reactions by applying weak electrical currents to the exposed brains of 'anesthetized animals. **Emotions Were Inaccessible** One trouble with that sort of work, however, was that the animals were asleep, and thus many of the most important aspects of brain activity, such as emotions and intelligence, were inaccessible to study. This limitation was overcome at the turn of the century by the development of techniques to insert wires into the animal's brain through an ivory plug screwed into the skull. This served as an anchor for the wires, which carried weak stimulating currents from dry cell batteries. In 1932, Dr. F. R. Hess of Switzerland used a similar set-up to stimulate various cerebral regions in conscious cats. He showed that electrical currents could influence the animal's posture, balance, movement and such basic psychic manifestations as fear and rage.

He showed that electrical currents could influence the animal's posture, balance, movement and such basic psychic manifestations as fear and rage. For some still unexplained reason, those techniques were not used much by biologists until the early nineteen-fifties. Then important developments in brain surgery, psychosomatic medicine, psycho-pharmacology and physiological psychology turned the attention of scientists to electrical exploration of the brain. **Makes Use of Telemetry** Of all the scientists who are working in this area, however, Dr. Delgado appears to be the only one using radio to stimulate animals' brains, with special attention to effects on social behavior. He also makes use of telemetry in studying physiological activity in brains and other organs. **\"I do not know why more work of this sort isn't done,\" he remarked recently, \"because it is so economical and easy.\"** Essentially, Dr. Delgado's system for studying social behavior consists of constant time-lapse photography of animal colonies, the analysis of those films and recording of of all the animals, details in the behavior patterns. This permits not just qualitative assessment of the animals' social interactions but also the quantification of each one's behavioral profile, Dr. Delgado said. This is particularly important when analyzing the modifications in social behavior of the group produced by radio stimulation of a particular response in one or more of the animals. **For example, stimulation of several specific regions of the brain can induce aggressiveness in a monkey.** Having quantatative data on that animal's behavior, as well as on that of others in the colony can reveal more precisely the magnitude, of various, sometimes subtle, effects of electrical stimulation on individual and collective social behavior. ** Some of the Results Listed** With such techniques, Dr. Delgado has shown: **Monkeys will learn to press a button that sends a stimulus to the brain of an enraged member of the colony and calms it down, indicating that animals can be taught to control one another's behavior. ** A monkey, stimulated to extremely aggressive behavior, will make \"intelligent\" attacks only on competitive members of the colony, sparing other, friendlier, ones. **Monkeys and cats can be triggered into sequential behavior in which one might open its mouth, turn around, walk to a corner, climb a wall, jump down and return to \"start,\" repeating those movements in the same order every time they are stimulated, but they will modify the pattern if other animals get in the way or if they are threatened.** **The latter two experiments, show that electrical brain stimulation does not simply evoke automatic responses but", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:650517nytimes.txt:2:9dae6689b7c9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8042, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "650517nytimes.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "650517nytimes", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "other, friendlier, ones. **Monkeys and cats can be triggered into sequential behavior in which one might open its mouth, turn around, walk to a corner, climb a wall, jump down and return to \"start,\" repeating those movements in the same order every time they are stimulated, but they will modify the pattern if other animals get in the way or if they are threatened.** **The latter two experiments, show that electrical brain stimulation does not simply evoke automatic responses but reactions that become integrated into social behavior according to the individual's own personality or temperament, Dr. Delgado said.** ** Experiments have been conducted on human beings by Dr. Delgado and other scientists, primarily during the treatment of certain types of epilepsy. Stimulation of particular areas of the brain have produced anxiety, profound feelings of friendliness and, in one case, a six­fold increase in word output.** The Yale neurophysiologist believes that techniques such as the one he is using can lead to the discovery of the cerebral basis of anxiety, pleasure, aggression and other mental functions and that \"we shall be in a much better position to influence their development and manifestation (in various ways); especially by means of more scientifically programed education.\" [http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/650517nytimes&title=](http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=peers&url=https://www.WantToKnow.info/650517nytimes&title=) **What you can do:** Explore our comprehensive Mind Control Information Center at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrolinformation).

HORROCK** Special to the New York Times WASHINGTON, July 20 -- **The Central Intelligence Agency conducted a 14-year program to find ways to \"control human behavior\" through the use of chemical, biological and radiological material**, according to agency documents made public today by John Marks, a freelance journalist. Mr. Marks, an associate of the Center for National Security Studies, asserted at a news conference that Adm. Stansfield Turner, Director of Central Intelligence, in a letter to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence last week, \"seriously distorted\" what the C.I.A. research programs involved. Mr. Marks said that, based on documents about the program he had received under the Freedom of Information Act, he had concluded that Admiral Turner \"seems to be practicing what used to be called 'a modified limited hangout'\" when he called the agency's activity \"a program of experimentation with drugs.\" **\"To be sure, drugs were part of it,\" he said, \"but so were such other techniques as electric shock, radiation, ultrasonics, psychosurgery, psychology, and incapacitating agents**, all of which were referred to in documents I have received.\" The documents made public today and the disclosure by the C.I.A. last week that it had found another cache of previously undiscovered records suggested broader experimentation on unwitting humans by the intelligence agency or its paid researchers than had been publicly known before. Mr. Marks said he had obtained or read about 1,000 C.I.A. documents, many of which were never turned over to the Senate intelligence committee for its 1975 investigation of agency activities. C.I.A. spokesmen declined comment on Mr. Marks's charges. However, Admiral Turner told newsmen after leaving a meeting with senators that the agency was moving swiftly to review the documents it had found.

C.I.A. spokesmen declined comment on Mr. Marks's charges. However, Admiral Turner told newsmen after leaving a meeting with senators that the agency was moving swiftly to review the documents it had found. Mr. Marks distributed 20 documents that described the following incidents, among others: **In 1956, the C.I.A. contracted with a private physician to test \"bulbocapnine,\" a drug that can cause stupor or induce a catatonic state, on monkeys and \"convicts incarcerated at\" an unnamed state penitentiary.** The agency wanted to known [sic] if the drug caused the \"loss of speech in man,\" \"loss of sensitivity to pain -- loss of memory, loss of will power.\" **A letter from an unnamed C.I.A. official in 1949 discussed ways of killing people without leaving a trace. \"I believe that there are two chemical substances which would be most useful in that they would leave no characteristic pathological findings**, and the quantities needed could be easily transported to places where they were to be used,\" the letter said. The letter also suggested exposure of an individual to X-rays or to an environment in which he would freeze to death. If these methods were too difficult, two methods needing no special equipment, the letter said, would be to \"smother the victim with a pillow or to strangle him with a wide piece of cloth, such as a bath towel.\" **Aware of Questionable Nature ** **In 1952, two Russian agents who were \"suspected of being doubled\" were interrogated using \"narcohypnotic\" methods. Under medical cover, the documents said the two men were given sodium pentothal and a stimulant. One interrogation produced a \"remarkable\" regression, the papers said, during which \"the subject actually relived certain past activities of his life, some dating back 15 years while, in addition, the subject totally accepted Mr. [name deleted] as an old and trusted and beloved personal friend whom the subject had known in years past in Georgia, U.S.S.R.\" ** A summary of a 1953 meeting reported a suggestion that the C.I.A. work with scientists of an unidentified foreign government, since \"that country allowed experiments with anthrax,\" a disease contracted from infected cattle and sheep, and the United States did not. The documents given to Mr. Marks were heavily edited, apparently for security reasons, but they showed that even while the C.I.A. was operating this program it was conscious of its questionable nature. One 1950 memorandum, on finding psychiatrists to conduct experiments, noted that one applicant's \"ethics might be such that he might not care to cooperate in certain more revolutionary phases of our project.\" But it said another candidate's \"ethics are such that he", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:770721nytimes.ciahumanbehaviorcontrol.txt:1:dd86beb63a97", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8046, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "770721nytimes.ciahumanbehaviorcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "770721nytimes.ciahumanbehaviorcontrol", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "and the United States did not.

The C.I.A. inspector general's report in 1963 described the program as the \"research and development of chemical, biological and radiological materials capable of employment in clandestine operations to control human behavior.\" **5,000 New Documents ** Last week, Admiral Turner announced that the agency had discovered some 5,000 documents pertaining to the program that were not available to the Senate intelligence committee in 1975. They are financial records of the various experiments and include the names of doctors and medical institutions that performed the tests. Today, Admiral Turner gave the members a closed-door briefing on the new material. He will appear before a joint public hearing of the intelligence committee and Senator Edward M. Kennedy's health subcommittee on July 29 to more fully describe the new findings. The intelligence committee staff will begin studying the documents later this week. Under the Freedom of Information Act, private citizens can obtain heretofore secret government documents, provided they do not endanger current national security matters or disclose matters that could invade the privacy of other individuals. **Mr. Marks charged that it had taken him nearly two years of legal pressure to dislodge the material he had received. He said he had been promised the additional 5,000 documents before the end of the month. ** **Special Note:** For an excellent two-page summary of reliable, verifiable information on CIA human behavior control programs and much more related to secret government mind control programs, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol). **What you can do:** For more on CIA human behavior control studies and a wealth of related material, explore our comprehensive Mind Control Information Center at [this link](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrolinformation).

As some of the former high-ranking C.I.A. men recall now, they had looked into the vacant eyes of Joseph Cardinal Mindszenty at his treason trial in Budapest in 1949 and had been horrified. They had been convinced that his confession had been wrung from him while he was either under the influence of some mysterious mind-bending drug or that he was standing before the dock in a post-hypnotic trance. The sight touched off memories of earlier \"show trials\" in the Soviet Union. **The C.I.A. leaders were certain the Communists had embarked on a campaign to control men's minds and they were determined to find a defense, setting out in earnest the next year-1950-with Project Bluebird, which evolved into Project Artichoke, then became MK-ULTRA - MK-DELTA. With each code name change, they broadened their sweep, until there remained virtually no avenue of human behavior control they were not exploring.** **Fears Seemingly Confirmed** Subsequent developments seemed to confirm their fears: The arrest in Germany of two Soviet agents armed with identical plastic cylinders containing hypodermic needles, said to cause a victim \"to become amenable to the will of his captor.\" Then, the startling confessions of downed American airmen to false charges of carrying out germ warfare against North Korea. A short time later, however, in 1953, a high level military study group determined that events had not been what they seemed. Neither the Russians nor anyone else had devised a means of turning men into robots and there was \"little threat, if any, to national", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:770802nytimesmkultramindcontrol.txt:0:19457baa7899", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8049, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "770802nytimesmkultramindcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "770802nytimesmkultramindcontrol", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "needles, said to cause a victim \"to become amenable to the will of his captor.\" Then, the startling confessions of downed American airmen to false charges of carrying out germ warfare against North Korea. A short time later, however, in 1953, a high level military study group determined that events had not been what they seemed. Neither the Russians nor anyone else had devised a means of turning men into robots and there was \"little threat, if any, to national security,\" the study said. The intelligence community rationalized: They would go ahead anyway, against the chance that the Communists might some day live up to their dread. Furthermore, they saw great potential in developing these tools for their own offensive use. **There was an \"urgent need,\" the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies argued, to develop \"effective and practical techniques\" to \"render an individual subservient to an imposed will or control.\"** The C.I.A. men, who led the way, enlisting the support of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Departments of Agriculture, Health, Education and Welfare and several other agencies, acknowledged among themselves that much of what they were setting out to do was \"unethical,\" bordered on the illegal and would be repugnant to the American people. So they made certain that these activities were tightly held, known only to the director, Allen W. Dulles, and a handful of operatives and high-ranking aides. **\"Precautions must be taken,\" one agency official wrote in an internal memo, \"not only to protect the operation from exposure to enemy forces, but also to conceal these activities from the American public in general,\" adding that this information \"would be detrimental to the accomplishment [of the agency's] mission.\"** Fragmentary accounts of the C.I.A.'s efforts to control men's minds have been published in the past. But a far more comprehensive picture has emerged from a study of more than 2,000 pages of freshly released agency documents and an investigation by a team of New York Times reporters. The behavior control, undertaken by men who presumably saw themselves as sincere and patriotic, takes on in retrospect the appearance of a bizarre grope into the world of science fiction. The C.I.A. investigators let their imaginations run: Was there a way to dissolve the Berlin Wall? What about a knockout drug that could incapacitate an entire building full of people? A pill that would make a drunk man sober; a way to manufacture food that looked and tasted normal but, when eaten, would create \"confusion-anxiety-fear.\" **Rubber From Mushrooms?** One long discussion focused on whether rubber could be produced from mushrooms. Another on whether water witching could locate an enemy submarine. They worked on ways to achieve the \"controlled production\" of headaches and earaches; twitches, jerks and staggers. **They wanted to reduce a man to a bewildered, self-doubting mass to \"subvert his principles,\" a C.I.A. document said.

They wanted to direct him in ways that \"may vary from rationalizing a disloyal act to the construction of a new person.\"** One of their longest running goals was to develop a way to induce amnesia. They wanted to be able to interrogate enemy espionage agents in such a way that neither the agents nor their superiors would know they had been compromised, and they wanted to be able to wipe clean the memories of their own agents after certain missions and, especially, when they were going into retirement. They were interested in simple destruction, too. As with the other business that made amnesia so attractive, **they wanted to be able to get away with murder without leaving a trace.** **An Expert's Suggestions** One apparent medical or scientific expert, whose identity has been deleted from the documents, suggested that the agency might kill a man by putting him in a small, air-tight room with a chunk of dry ice, giving off suffocation carbon dioxide gas. He also proposed reducing a victim's body temperature to below freezing or exposing him to a lethal dose of X-rays. Or, he said, there were two \"techniques\" that required no special equipment: smothering the victim with a pillow case or strangling him with a bath towel. **In attempts to develop ways to administer lethal and mind-altering drugs surreptitiously through clothing as thick as a leather jacket, they tried out small spray guns and pencil-like injectors.** They conducted interviews with scientists and doctors and members of other intelligence agencies around the world. **They studied the writing of the psychologist who worked with Adolf Hitler, wondered about the use of the \"occult\" and of \"black psychiatry,\"** and of course pored over their own stream of intelligence data. There was an agent's report of a \"confession gang\" that had arrived in Shang-hai, and, without the use of \"old-fashioned torture or drugs,\" could obtain \"any confession they desire.\" In one case, the report from China went, \"the prisoner was not allowed to close his eyes for 26 days.\" Most of the ideas the C.I.A. considered never got off the drawing board. For a few years in the early 1950s, though, the agency had one or two \"special interrogation\" teams that went on operational missions in Europe and Asia. A team was supposed to consist of a psychiatrist, a hypnotist and an interrogator and was to elicit information through the use of drugs and", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:770802nytimesmkultramindcontrol.txt:2:d659d949d7e3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8051, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "770802nytimesmkultramindcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "770802nytimesmkultramindcontrol", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "from China went, \"the prisoner was not allowed to close his eyes for 26 days.\" Most of the ideas the C.I.A. considered never got off the drawing board. For a few years in the early 1950s, though, the agency had one or two \"special interrogation\" teams that went on operational missions in Europe and Asia. A team was supposed to consist of a psychiatrist, a hypnotist and an interrogator and was to elicit information through the use of drugs and hypnotism. In actual practice, the size of the teams and the procedure they followed varied. In one series of interrogations in Europe, for example, they employed neither hypnotism nor a combination of drugs and hypnotism-the very essence \"of special interrogation\" at the time-because the psychiatrist was in a hurry to resume an interrupted vacation and no hypnotist was available. **11 Days of Questioning** Working in the basement of a suburban home, guarded at times by armed military police in civilian clothes, the team questioned three European espionage agents who had been working for the C.I.A. \"behind the Iron Curtain\" and whose loyalty had become suspect. Over 11 days, the three agents were individually given intravenous injections of an unidentified drug-possibly sodium pentothal-then engaged by the interrogator and the psychiatrist in fantasies. The team decided that all three agents had responded to questions truthfully and should be continued in operational use. But they reported in the document that one of the agents who had resisted the effects of the drugs and later disappointed his interrogators by making reference to the \"solution\" that was injected, thus giving no indication of \"amnesia,\" seemed a \"poor operational type.\" They said they felt that \"if ever taken into custody by the Soviets he would also tell them the truth as he knew it under the slightest duress\" and should not be trusted with important assignments. A former senior intelligence official told of another \"special interrogation\" effort in Europe in which the C.I.A. tried to determine whether a Viennese count who had been promising information on Soviet cipher codes was telling the truth. The count was given sodium pentothal and hypnotized, the official said, but \"it was a complete bust; he just laughed at us.\" Some time later the count was subjected to the C.I.A.'s \"old reliable,\" the lie detector, and the agency concluded he had been lying. **The C.I.A. was fascinated by LSD and other psychochemicals that they thought might be useful in getting people to talk or in temporarily putting them out of action. They were aware that it was considered unethical to experiment on people with drugs without their knowledge, but they decided that \"unwitting\" testing was essential if accurate information on LSD and other substances was to be obtained.** **Fatal LSD Experiment** **In the C.I.A.'s very first experiment with LSD on a group of unwitting men, one of them, Dr. Frank Olson,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:770802nytimesmkultramindcontrol.txt:3:7c536d678acc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8052, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "770802nytimesmkultramindcontrol.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "770802nytimesmkultramindcontrol", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "psychochemicals that they thought might be useful in getting people to talk or in temporarily putting them out of action.

The fact that both men died in Government experiments was kept secret from their families and the general public for more than 20 years. **Two years after the deaths the C.I.A. made an arrangement with the agents of the Bureau of Narcotics to test LSD surreptitiously on unwitting patrons of bars in New York and San Francisco, some of whom became violently ill and were hospitalized, never knowing exactly what had happened to them.** Some of the C.I.A. officials-past and present-and former military men who worked on the behavior control project, look back at their endeavors with a measure of disappointment that they had accomplished so little, but they had no regrets. \"I think it was certainly worthwhile,\" said one former agency official who agreed to speak only with the promise of anonymity. \"People had quite a lot of fears, and if nothing had been done, people's imaginations could have gone most anywhere. I think what we did helped. It proved that things weren't as bad as people might have thought.\" **Special Note:** For lots more reliable, verifiable information suggesting a major cover-up of government mind control programs and the MKULTRA project, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol).

It is assumed that a single agency will be given the primary responsibility for developing military and para-military aspects of the basic plan. It is recommended that this responsibility for both overt and covert military operations be assigned the Joint Chiefs of Staff. **Page 5 of File** (page 2 of Joint Chiefs report) World opinion, and the United Nations forum should be favorably affected by developing the international image of the Cuban government as rash and irresponsible, and as an alarming and unpredictable threat to the peace of the Western Hemisphere. **Page 10-11 of File** (page 7-8 of Joint Chiefs report) A series of well coordinated incidents will be planned to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces. (1) Start rumors (many). Use clandestine radio. (2) Land friendly Cubans in uniform \"over-the-fence\" to stage attack on base. (3) Capture Cuban (friendly) saboteurs inside the base. (4) Start riots near the base main gate (friendly Cubans). (5) Blow up ammunition inside the base: start fires. (6) Burn aircraft on air base (sabotage). (7) Lob mortar shells from outside of base into base. (8) Capture assault teams approaching from the sea or vicinity of Guantanamo City. (9) Capture militia group which storms base.

Attacks on surface shipping and destruction of US military drone aircraft by MIG type planes would be useful as complementary actions. Reasonable copies of the MIG could be produced from US resources in about three months. ** Page 13 of File** (page 10 of Joint Chiefs report) Hijacking attempts against civil air and surface craft should appear to continue as harassing measures condoned by the government of Cuba. **It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner enroute from the United States.** The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan to cross Cuba. The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday. An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At the designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual aircraft would be converted to a drone. The drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will be transmitting on the international distress frequency a \"MAY DAY\" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal. ** Note from WantToKnow.info:** **Remember that these and other government leaders think of this like a chess game.

That Goss's congressional seat encompasses the 911 hijackers' [Florida base](http://portergoss.house.gov/) of operation, including their flight schools, is precisely the kind of meaningless factoid a conspiracy theorist would bring up. It's true that George HW Bush and Dick Cheney spent the evening of September 10 alone in the Oval Office, but what's wrong with old colleagues catching up?

That the FBI knew [precisely which](http://www.observer.com/pages/story.asp?ID=7816) Florida flight schools to descend upon hours after the attacks should make every American feel safer knowing their federal agents are on the ball.

[Le Figaro's report](http://www.guardian.co.uk/waronterror/story/0,1361,584444,00.html) in October 2001, known to have originated with French intelligence, that the CIA met Osama bin Laden in a Dubai hospital in July 2001, proves again the perfidy of the French.

That at the battle of Tora Bora, where bin Laden was surrounded on three sides, Special Forces received no order to advance and capture him and were forced to stand and watch as [two Russian-made helicopters](http://www.fayettevillenc.com/story-archive.php?Template=terrorism&Story=37935) flew into the area where bin Laden was believed hiding, loaded up passengers and returned to Pakistan, demonstrates how confusing the modern battlefield can be. That upon returning to Fort Bragg from Tora Bora, the same Special Operations troops who had been stood down from capturing bin Laden, suffered a unusual spree of [murder/suicides](http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_topic&forum=104&topic_id=1536576#1536694), is nothing more than a series of senseless tragedies. Reports that bin Laden is currently receiving [periodic dialysis treatment](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-789042,curpg-1.cms) in a Pakistani medical hospital are simply too incredible to be true. That the White House went on [Cipro September 11](http://www.judicialwatch.org/2953.shtml) shows the foresightedness of America's emergency response. That the anthrax was mailed to perceived liberal media and the [Democratic leadership](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/jan2002/anth-j23.shtml) demonstrates only the perversity of the terrorist psyche. That the [anthrax attacks](http://www.oilempire.us/anthrax.html) appeared to silence opponents of the [Patriot Act](http://www.freefromterror.net/other_articles/gov_anthrax.html) shows only that appearances can be deceiving.

That the Department of Justice consistently chooses to see accused 911 plotters go free rather than permit the [courtroom testimony of al Qaeda leaders](http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0206-04.htm) in American custody looks bad, but only because we don't have all the facts. That the White House [balked](http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/01/29/inv.terror.probe/) at any inquiry into the events of 911, then [starved it of funds](http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,437267,00.html) and [stonewalled](http://home.earthlink.net/~imfalse/9-11_commission_says.html) it, was unfortunate, but since the commission didn't find for conspiracy it's all a non issue anyway. That the 911 commission's executive director and \"gatekeeper,\" Philip Zelikow, was so closely involved in the events under investigation that he [testified](http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20040115-024012-7011r) before the commission as part of the inquiry, shows only an apparent conflict of interest. That commission chair Thomas Kean is, like George Bush, a Texas oil executive who had business dealings with reputed al Qaeda financier [Khalid bin Mafouz](http://www.disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml?title=Thomas_H._Kean), suggests Texas is smaller than they say it is. That co-chair Lee Hamilton has a history as a Bush family \"fixer,\" including clearing Bush Sr of the claims arising from the 1980 [\"October Surprise\"](http://www.btinternet.com/~nlpwessex/Documents/hamiltonoctsurprise.htm), is of no concern, since only conspiracists believe there was [such a thing](http://www.consortiumnews.com/archive/xfile.html) as an October Surprise. That FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds accuses the agency of [intentionally fudging specific pre-911 warnings and harboring a foreign espionage ring in its translation department](http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;forum=102&topic_id=442067&mesg_id=442067), and claims she witnessed evidence of the [semi-official](http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=102x655980) infrastructure of [money-laundering](http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;forum=104&topic_id=1555133&mesg_id=1555133) and [narcotics trade](http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&forum=102&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;topic_id=610235&mesg_id=610235) behind the attacks, is of no account, since John Ashcroft has gagged her with the rare invocation of \"State Secrets Privilege,\" and retroactively classified her public testimony. For the sake of national security, let us speak no more of her. That, when commenting on Edmond's case, [Daniel Ellsberg](http://www.breakfornews.com/Sibel-Edmonds1.htm) remarked that Ashcroft could go to prison for his part in a cover-up, suggests Ellsberg is giving comfort to the terrorists, and could, if he doesn't wise up, find himself declared an [enemy combatant](http://www.claremont.org/projects/jurisprudence/hamdi_ussc.html). I could go on. And on and on. But I trust you get the point. Which is simply this: there are no secrets, an American government would never accept civilian casualties for geostrategic gain, and conspiracies are for the weak-minded and gullible. -- To subscribe to or unsubscribe from the WantToKnow.info list (one email every few days): [https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe](https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe.php) -- 911 Information", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:9-11information.txt:7:3a19a7298385", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8091, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "9-11timeline25pg.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "9-11timeline25pg", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "9/11 Attacks **9/11 Attacks** **Verifiable Media Reports on 9/11 Attacks** **25-Page Summary of 9/11 Attacks Timeline Developed by Paul Thompson** **For an excellent two-page summary of the best of this 9/11 attacks timeline, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11-timeline) For excerpts from 20 of the most revealing major media articles on 9/11 attacks, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911newsarticles) To verify 9/11 attacks information below, use links to original articles on mass media websites Join in powerfully building a better world for all by [spreading the word](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11)** The 9/11 attack was one of the most pivotal events in world history.

A number of foreign media sources are used in this 9/11 research summary, especially since these stories have often received much more attention in Europe than in the US. But we've tried to use common sense. For instance, a story in a Pakistani newspaper that reflects poorly on Pakistan would be much less likely to be propaganda than the same story coming from an Indian newspaper. In a few cases we've used partisan sources to add more detail. Information or comments from partisan sources (including our own comments) is either italicized, or noted as such.

[[Washington Post, 12/17/02](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64338-2002Dec16.html)] In an appearance on NBC, Kean promises an aggressive investigation. \"It's really a remarkably broad mandate, so I don't think we'll have any problem looking under every rock. I've got no problems in going as far as we have to in finding out the facts.\" [[AP, 12/17/02](https://www.WantToKnow.info/021217ap)] However, Kean plans to remain President of Drew University and devote only one day a week to the commission. He also claims he would have no conflicts of interest, stating: \"I have no clients except the university.\" [[Washington Post, 12/17/02](https://www.WantToKnow.info/021217post)] However, he has a history of such conflict. *Multinational Monitor* has previously stated: \"Perhaps no individual more clearly illustrates the dangers of university presidents maintaining corporate ties than Thomas Kean,\" citing the fact that he is on the Board of Directors of Aramark (which received a large contract with his university after he became president), Bell Atlantic, United Health Care, Beneficial Corporation, Fiduciary Trust Company International, and others.

In an earlier incident related to my own awakening on 9/11, I interpreted for the commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, [Charles Krulak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_C._Krulak), during a 1997 visit from the top generals of the Indonesian Marine Corps. During that visit, US generals informed the Indonesian delegation that through their ultra-secure [Cheyenne Mountain command center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Mountain_nuclear_bunker), they were tracking in real time literally every flight in the US. **General Krulak bragged that if any plane were to veer from it's designated flight plan anywhere in the US, air force jets could intercept that plane within 10 minutes. ** On the morning of 9/11, the first plane struck the World Trade Center at 8:46 AM. Several minutes earlier at between 8:38 and 8:40 AM, NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) was informed of the hijacking according to [this*New York Times*article](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/16/national/16PLAN.html?pagewanted=all) and [this*Washington Post*article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11_summary_articles/010915postX3.911).

Do you remember the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative to build a massive missile defense system that raised so much controversy during the Reagan and first Bush years? [130 billion of our tax dollars](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-ed-missiles20dec20,0,1532739.story) were poured into developing that system. It was designed to detect and intercept missiles fired from an *unknown destination* traveling at well *over 10 times the speed* of a commercial airliner, and to shoot them down in 15 minutes or less, before they reached their US targets. According the [Congressional Budget Office](http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=5679&type=0&sequence=2) (CBO) website, \"a defensive system may need to hit a warhead smaller than an oil drum that is traveling above the atmosphere at speeds greater than 13,000 miles per hour.\" The [CBO report](http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=5679&type=0) states that missile defense and intercept systems must take down an ICBM in a matter of minutes or it is all over. You may remember that before 9/11, there were a number of tests of the Pentagon's missile defense systems. Some tests failed, while others succeeded. But there is an important question here. **If these sophisticated military systems were designed to detect missiles fired from unknown locations at over 13,000 mph and shoot them down in mere minutes, why on 9/11 could they not detect any one of the four large airliners traveling at a mere 600 mph, especially when two of them were known to be lost for over 40 minutes before they crashed?** This question applies especially to Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon. The first plane hijacking on 9/11 was reported at about 8:20 AM (see [*NY Times*article](https://www.WantToKnow.info/010915nytimes11)), well over an hour before Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon at 9:38. According to the *Times* article, Flight 77 was reported lost at 8:56 A.M., 42 minutes before it crashed. Even if the FAA radar systems completely failed and FAA officials failed to alert the military, all military leaders certainly knew within minutes that the World Trade Center had been hit at 8:46. By 9:03, when the second tower was hit, they certainly knew there were big problems. **How is it possible that the Pentagon's highly touted missile detections systems could not locate Flight 77 in the 42 minutes it was known to be lost before it crashed into the heart of the defense system of the U.S.?** The missile detection systems did not depend on FAA radar and were programmed to pick up any unaccounted for objects and raise alarms immediately, as mentioned on the CBO website. Here's another related question. Why was the Pentagon's billion-dollar missile defense system such a hot topic in the media before 9/11, yet we've heard almost nothing about it since? Could it be that there are elements in the government and military who don't", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_pentagon_missile_defense.txt:0:1d3153e7f8c9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8285, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_pentagon_missile_defense.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_pentagon_missile_defense", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "of the defense system of the U.S.?** The missile detection systems did not depend on FAA radar and were programmed to pick up any unaccounted for objects and raise alarms immediately, as mentioned on the CBO website.

Could it be that there are elements in the government and military who don't want people to think about questions like those asked here? And an even bigger question is why isn't our media asking these questions and more? **Why is it that the 9/11 Commission budget was far less than the budget allotted to the Challenger space shuttle disaster or even the Monica Lewinsky affair?** The 9/11 commission was originally [allotted only $3 million](http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/about/faq.htm#q5). Eventually, after much begging and haggling, the commission was given $15 million. Yet a [CNN article](http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/01/starr.costs/) lists the cost of the Lewinsky investigation at $30 million. A [*Los Angeles Times*article](http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/15/nation/na-probe15) states the cost of the Columbia space shuttle disaster investigation was $175 million. How could 9/11 - the greatest disaster in American history - be given such a small budget for investigation? Why didn't the Pentagon aggressively investigate the greatest failure ever in U.S. defenses? And why did both the president (see [CNN article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bush-opposes-9-11-query-panel/)) and vice-president (see [*Newsweek*article](http://www.newsweek.com/battle-back-home-147649)) initially oppose any investigation at all? Why aren't we, the public, asking these questions and demanding answers? It's not too late. Let us take action now and seek answers to these vital questions.

Literally thousands of people in positions of power around the world were called to action by what happened on 9/11. [Many commercial and military pilots](http://pilotsfor911truth.org/), for instance, knew on the day of 9/11 that it was impossible for alleged hijacker pilot Hani Hanjour, who had very limited flight experience and poor flying skills, to execute a 330 degree turn with a large commercial airliner in under four minutes to make a precision hit on the Pentagon ([click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#hanjourskills) for more information on this). Numerous [senior military and government officials](https://www.WantToKnow.info/officialsquestion911commissionreport) not only in the U.S., but around the world, also knew that it was virtually impossible for the Pentagon's powerful defenses to be defeated when the U.S. military had already been on high alert after two planes hit the World Trade Center towers. Sadly, many of these leaders have kept their suspicions quiet, particularly as it has proven to be [political suicide](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32712017/ns/politics-white_house/t/obama-adviser-jones-resigns-amid-controversy) to question the official government story of 9/11. **9/11 also served as a huge awakening to me personally.** At the time, I had [worked as a language interpreter](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050418fredburksinterpretingstories) with top U.S. generals who bragged about being able to have fighter jets on any errant plane anywhere in the country in 10 minutes or less. So the moment it was announced on the morning of 9/11 that a plane had hit the Pentagon, I suspected that, at the very least, this tragic act was allowed to happen. And like many others, I question why the Pentagon to this day has refused to release any surveillance tapes of the Pentagon strike that are conclusive as to what hit the Pentagon. I find it very hard to believe that none exist on this highly monitored fortress. After 9/11, millions of people with open minds began to explore what really happened on 9/11. Thanks to excellent websites like [WantToKnow.info](https://www.WantToKnow.info/), these caring individuals were able to find reliable, verifiable information which showed them a level of manipulation far beyond what they had previously known.

Dr. Griffin is a renowned theologian who has now become the most respected spokesperson for the 9/11 movement. In the 10 years since that fateful day, he has authored or edited [more than a dozen scholarly books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_tc_2_0?rh=i%3Astripbooks%2Ck%3ADavid+Ray+Griffin&keywords=David+Ray+Griffin&ie=UTF8&qid=1314901056&sr=1-2-ent&field-contributor_id=B000APTCK4) which explore the deeper realities of 9/11 and global politics. Architect Richard Gage, in turn, learned of the 9/11 cover-up through the work of Dr. Griffin. Mr. Gage has gone on to become the most visible scientific voice of the 9/11 movement. He founded and heads up [Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth](http://www.ae911truth.org/), which now has over 3,000 architects and engineers who have signed a petition demanding a new, independent investigation of the collapse of the three World Trade Center buildings on 9/11 ([click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/9-11_world_trade_center_building_7) for more). So the work of WantToKnow.info has played a key role in the awakening of these two major figures in the 9/11 movement and many, many others. Our website has now received over 7.5 million visits, and our [email list](https://www.WantToKnow.info/subscribe.php) has nearly 10,000 subscribers from more than 120 countries. We've received many hundreds of [messages from supporters](https://www.WantToKnow.info/inspiringmessages) who are most grateful for our work. The mainstream media post 9/11 sadly continues to focus largely on spreading fear and sensationalism. The corporate owners of the media have been quite successful in keeping key information on 9/11 and other critically important issues from [getting the headlines they deserve](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mediacorruption). **Yet the good news is that the corporate-owned major media is rapidly losing credibility as the public increasingly looks for quality, unfiltered information on the Internet. ** Though there is a lot of trash and baseless speculation on many Internet websites, those with a discerning eye are able to find reliable information from verifiable sources as they begin to unravel the mystery of 9/11 and of all that goes on in our world. Some like myself also open to inner spiritual guidance as they put the pieces of the puzzle together. **What", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_perspective.txt:1:784b87161e67", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8289, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_perspective.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_perspective", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "losing credibility as the public increasingly looks for quality, unfiltered information on the Internet. ** Though there is a lot of trash and baseless speculation on many Internet websites, those with a discerning eye are able to find reliable information from verifiable sources as they begin to unravel the mystery of 9/11 and of all that goes on in our world. Some like myself also open to inner spiritual guidance as they put the pieces of the puzzle together. **What I have learned in my research over the years since 9/11 is that there are many factions within the [power elite](https://www.WantToKnow.info/secretsocietiesnewsarticles) of our world. And thanks to the after effects of 9/11, these factions are now fighting against each other more than ever.** Those factions which are most focused on dominating and even destroying our world are gradually being shut down and marginalized. A few of their members are even waking up and now beginning to work for the good of all humanity. This is not to say that there aren't still some crazy things being pulled off. There are, but I believe the chances of a major event of the scale of 9/11 happening again are very slim. Thanks to both the wake-up call of 9/11 and the rapid availability of reliable, verifiable information on the Internet, I suspect there are too many good people in high places now who are aware of the deeper, hidden political agendas to allow for the coordination of a complex event like 9/11 to happen again. In addition, I have received information that there are growing numbers of military and government intelligence officers around the world who are working to stop the craziness and expose the many manipulations being carried out by the global power elite. **A few years ago, I learned about an intelligence organization called \"The Library\" which plays an active role in blocking key destructive plans of the power elite.** Working quietly behind the scenes, this unusual group of intelligence professionals has both leaked key documents at crucial moments, and carried out small, but effective activities which prevented major destructive plans of the power-hungry factions of the global elite from being implemented. For more fascinating information on this, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/fredburksresigns#library). In the old paradigm, global politics operated based largely on hierarchical structures which placed a small number of chosen people and groups at the top of the hierarchy. For many centuries, the common folk willingly surrendered their power to those above them in the political and military hierarchies in exchange for safety and protection. Yet many individuals and groups in the top rungs of this global hierarchy secretly used the power given them for personal profit and gain. For thousands of years, selfish factions of the power elite have controlled the general population by promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life.

This is what has led to much of the craziness in the world even today.

We are realizing that it's time to let go of the old polarizing us vs. them paradigm and start working together for a new paradigm which supports [the good of all](https://www.weboflove.org/keystolife#whatsbest) on our planet. We are embracing the understanding that each of us has unlimited power within, and that we are all interconnected. And the Internet is making it easier for us to connect and even to come together in person to promote ever more love and understanding in our world. It's really an exciting time to be alive! I'm not at all saying that everything is going to be nice and easy in the years ahead of us. **I suspect that as we give birth to the new paradigm, the world will experience birth pains, particularly as the old hierarchical power structures of this world begin to crumble.** How much pain is experienced will likely be a matter of how fast and how hard this collapse happens. I'm very hopeful that the collapse of the old paradigm structures will be relatively slow, which I believe would make it easier on all of us. This would more easily allow the grass roots, new paradigm networks rapidly growing around the world to catch the pieces as the old hierarchy falls apart and the new paradigm takes its place. Once an ever increasing number of people see the need for this change, I suspect we will all join in co-creating a new way of life that is much healthier and more cooperative than ever before.

Questions about the time it took U.S. military planes to respond to the threat of several hijacked aircraft speeding toward the nation's financial and military centers have dogged the Pentagon since the attacks. Gen. Richard B. Myers, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was pressed by a Senate panel about the reaction times of military interceptors during a hearing Thursday on his nomination to become chairman. And the matter has stood as emblematic of the U.S. government's overall lack of preparedness for the terrorist assault. Top Pentagon officials have been slow to respond to press inquiries for a time line that would establish the exact times that civil aviation authorities became aware of the hijackings, when U.S. military commanders were notified and when U.S. fighter jets took to the air. At least part of the Pentagon's reluctance to disclose the information has been explained by a spokesman for Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld as resistance to discussing any operational information. But three senior officers with access to information about the response times filled in details yesterday, saying they showed that military planes never stood a chance of blocking the attacks. At the time of the terrorist strikes, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which has charge of defending the United States against air attack, kept fighter jets on alert at only seven bases around the country. The planes and their pilots were primed to be in the air within 15 minutes of an order to scramble. **NORAD received word at 8:38 a.m. that a United Airlines flight had been hijacked,** and six minutes later, two F-15 fighter jets were ordered into the air from Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod. But two minutes later, the United plane crashed into the first New York tower. **The military jets were airborne at 8:52.** When a second United plane hit the other tower at 9:02, they were still 70 miles away from Manhattan, officials said. **Military authorities learned that still another hijacked plane might be headed toward Washington several minutes after the second attack in New York [which occurred at 9:02].** Two F-16 fighter jets took off from Langley Air Force Base in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__010915postX3.911.txt:0:254e71052c08", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8296, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__010915postX3.911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__010915postX3.911", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "But two minutes later, the United plane crashed into the first New York tower. **The military jets were airborne at 8:52.** When a second United plane hit the other tower at 9:02, they were still 70 miles away from Manhattan, officials said. **Military authorities learned that still another hijacked plane might be headed toward Washington several minutes after the second attack in New York [which occurred at 9:02].** Two F-16 fighter jets took off from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:35, but the American Airlines plane that roared into the Pentagon struck two minutes later. Even if any of the fighter jets had gotten over New York or Washington ahead of the hijacked planes, several senior Air Force officers voiced doubts that the military pilots would have had time to run through standing procedures before shooting down the commercial airliners. While military air defense crews had practiced intercepts of hijacked planes, the exercises had tended to assume the aircraft would be outside U.S. borders, over the Atlantic or Pacific, with time to consult the White House before any drastic action was taken. The F-16s were in position over Washington in time to have intercepted the fourth plane hijacked, the one that crashed in a Pennsylvania forest. Asked if rules of engagement would have allowed the Air Force to shoot the plane down, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said yesterday: \"I think it was pretty clear at that point that that airliner was not under the pilot's control and that it was heading to do major damage.\" He said any military intervention would have ultimately been the decision of President Bush. \"We were already tracking that plane that crashed in Pennsylvania,\" Wolfowitz said in an interview with public television's \"Newshour with Jim Lehrer.\" \"I think it was the heroism of the passengers on board that brought it down but the Air Force was in a position to do so if we had to,\" Wolfowitz added. Accounts from telephone calls to relatives from passengers aboard the plane, which had taken off from Newark, N.J., and was bound for San Francisco, indicated they tried to take back control from the hijackers before the plane crashed. **Special Note:** For lots more reliable, verifiable information suggesting a major cover-up of 9/11, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911information).

Ashcroft accused the Democratic-controlled Senate of delaying legislation that he says is urgently needed to thwart another terrorist attack. One day after House negotiators reached a bipartisan compromise on the bill, talks between Bush administration officials and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) stumbled on -- among other things -- a provision setting out rules under which law enforcement agencies could share wiretap and grand jury information with intelligence agencies. Leahy accused the White House of reneging on an agreement Sunday settling the last significant differences between his committee and the administration on the final shape of the legislation to expand police powers in surveillance and other realms. Ashcroft, though he did not comment directly on the dispute, complained that the Senate was not moving with sufficient speed given what he said was the urgent need for additional law enforcement tools with which to fight terrorism. \"Talk won't prevent terrorism,\" Ashcroft said after meeting with Leahy yesterday, adding that he was \"deeply concerned about the rather slow pace\" of the legislation. The finger-pointing marked a breach in the facade of public unity that has governed relations between Congress and the administration -- and Republicans and Democrats -- since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. On Monday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) reached agreement with Rep. John Conyers Jr. (Mich.), the committee's ranking Democrat, on a bipartisan compromise that incorporates many administration proposals. Among them are measures to expand police powers to install wiretaps, monitor Internet communications, and apprehend and prosecute suspected terrorists. The House negotiators rejected the most controversial proposal, which would have permitted the indefinite jailing of noncitizens suspected of terrorism. Under their version of the bill, the attorney general could detain suspected terrorists for seven days, after which they would have to be charged or released. While emphasizing the need to safeguard civil liberties, Leahy has also expressed his desire to get the bill done quickly. But Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters that he wanted an agreement on the bill in the next few days but that he doubted the Senate could take up the legislation before next week, as the administration had asked. Some Republican lawmakers, notably Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), the ranking minority member of the judiciary panel, said they shared Ashcroft's frustration over the delay. \"It's a very dangerous thing,\" said Hatch, who attended the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__011003post-leahy-patriot-act-911.txt:0:8f090d6bb647", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8299, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__011003post-leahy-patriot-act-911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__011003post-leahy-patriot-act-911", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "bill done quickly.

Hatch (Utah), the ranking minority member of the judiciary panel, said they shared Ashcroft's frustration over the delay. \"It's a very dangerous thing,\" said Hatch, who attended the meeting late yesterday morning with Ashcroft, Leahy and White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales. \"It's time to get off our duffs and do what's right.\" Since the administration delivered its bill to Capitol Hill almost two weeks ago, negotiations between Senate Judiciary Committee staff and the Justice Department have proceeded at a fever pitch. According to participants in the discussions, both sides had narrowed their differences over the weekend to just a few issues. One of the most difficult involved an administration proposal that would allow the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to share wiretap and grand jury information with the CIA, the National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies. Under current law aimed at preventing political abuses by the executive branch, such information cannot be shared in the absence of a court order. The administration would have dispensed with that requirement. The House negotiators drafted a slightly narrower version of the administration proposal. Leahy, however, insisted on a compromise under which agencies could share sensitive information in times of emergency, so long as they obtained a court order afterward. White House officials agreed to the compromise in discussions with committee staff on Sunday but backed off the agreement this morning, according to Leahy and a Democratic committee source. \"Right off the bat they said they wanted to pull back from the language agreed to on Sunday night,\" the source said. \"It was the last major issue.\" A Democratic participant in the talks said the White House had also backed away from agreement on several other provisions in the bill, including one relating to the definition of a terrorist crime. The administration had asked for the removal of statutes of limitations on all crimes associated with terrorist activity. The House negotiators as well as Leahy and his staff felt the proposal was overly broad. They agreed on a measure that would impose no statute of limitations for the most serious terrorist crimes and a 15-year limit on others, such as destruction of property. A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, declined to comment on the specifics of the dispute. \"We're continuing to work with members of both parties,\" McClellan said. \"The discussions are positive and ongoing.\" **Special Note:** For lots more reliable, verifiable information suggesting a major cover-up of 9/11, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911information).

Robert M. Schwartz, 57, a founding member of the Virginia Biotechnology Association, was found dead in the secluded fieldstone farmhouse southwest of Leesburg where he lived alone. Friends said Schwartz's wife died of cancer several years ago and their three children are away at college. Loudoun sheriff's officials said an autopsy will be conducted today at the medical examiner's office in Fairfax County. Sources said it appeared that Schwartz had been stabbed. Loudoun Sheriff Stephen O. Simpson said Schwartz was last heard from Friday. Co-workers at Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology, a government-funded nonprofit agency in Herndon that was created by the General Assembly in 1984, asked neighbors to check on Schwartz when he didn't show up for work Monday and then missed a 1 p.m. meeting. \"We're all stunned,\" said CIT President Anne Armstrong. \"We don't know anything. What we're assuming is maybe he walked in on something.\" Simpson declined to say whether investigators have any suspects but said officers worked all night Monday gathering evidence and preparing a search warrant for an undisclosed location. \"We have some leads we are following up on,\" Simpson said. Armstrong called Schwartz \"one of the smartest people I ever met\" and said Schwartz worked at CIT for almost 15 years. Recently he served as executive director of research and development and university relations, helping to administer public grants. According to CIT's Web site, Schwartz graduated* cum laude* from Catholic University and has a doctorate in biophysics from Stanford University. He worked at both Georgetown University and the University of Maryland and contributed chapters to the Nucleic Acid Sequence Database. He also worked on the first national online database of DNA sequence information. Robert G. Templin, who worked at CIT for about six years, described Schwartz as a brilliant scientist who had a gift for explaining complex scientific subjects in simple language. \"He was the kind of person who could live in the scientific world or the business world or the everyday world of Virginia citizens and explain why science is important,\" Templin said. Neighbors described Schwartz as a quiet man who always stopped to help if a car was stuck on the narrow dirt road leading to their homes.

Armstrong said Schwartz's assistant came to her Monday when he didn't come into the office. \"She said, 'Did Bob tell you he was going to be anyplace different today?' \" Armstrong recalled. \"She said he never goes anyplace without calling.\" When Schwartz still hadn't arrived for a 1 p.m. meeting, Armstrong said, they asked a neighbor to check on him. \"We know very little about the circumstances of Bob's death, except that the Loudoun County authorities have informed us they are treating it as a crime,\" Armstrong said. \"If that is the case, it is a senseless and random act of violence against a brilliant man.\" *Staff researcher Bobbye Pratt contributed to this report.* **Special Note:** For lots more reliable, verifiable information suggesting a major cover-up of 9/11, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911information).

It's good to be back home. It brings back a lot of wonderful memories. My years in San Francisco were among the most satisfying and enjoyable of my career. It gave me the opportunity to work with some of the finest criminal justice and law enforcement professionals in the country. They taught me a great deal, and it was an honor to serve along side them. As much as I miss San Francisco, I am grateful to have the opportunity to serve in what I believe to be the world's finest law enforcement agency -- the FBI. It is particularly rewarding to serve at this unparalleled moment in history, when America is depending on the FBI more than ever, when protecting the homeland from terrorist attacks has taken on new meaning and new urgency. Like most Americans, I'll never forget the day it all began. I had been on the job exactly one week when word came that a plane had struck the World Trade Center. We rushed down to the FBI's command center, hoping it had been a terrible accident but fearing the worst. Minutes later, we watched in horror as a plane hit the second tower. Then, reality hit even closer to home, when across the Potomac, another plane rammed into the Pentagon. Not long after learning that the third hijacked airliner had gone down, a controller from the Federal Aviation Administration, who was on the phone with his agency, told us more shocking news. A fourth plane had been hijacked. It was heading straight towards the nation's capitol. And it was just 15 minutes away. It was a surreal moment for us all, realizing this plane - this flying bomb - was headed our way, yet not knowing where it might hit: the White House, the Capitol, a school yard, or FBI Headquarters. As we all know, Flight 93 never made it to Washington.

As we all know, Flight 93 never made it to Washington. The brave passengers on board - including many from the San Francisco Bay area - were determined that this flying missile would not reach its target, and they sacrificed their lives to save our city. They are among the true heroes of that day. From those first moments, we in the FBI, like the rest of the nation, knew that the world had changed. And we knew that our institution would never be the same. Our first thought was to do what we'd always done after a terrorist attack: set up command centers and start managing the crisis from a law enforcement perspective; get control of the crime scenes and begin gathering evidence; and deploy our vast investigative force to find out everything we could about the attacks. At the same time, we realized that we had to conduct this investigation somewhat differently. These attacks were not just an act of terror. They were an act of war. The most pressing issue for the FBI and for the nation was to find out who we were at war with, and more importantly, to make sure we were not attacked again. To do that, the FBI began working in concert with its many partners to find out everything we could about the hijackers and how they pulled off their attacks. We ran down literally hundreds of thousands of leads and checked every record we could get our hands on, from flight reservations to car rentals to bank accounts. What emerged from our massive investigation was a sobering portrait of 19 hijackers who carried out their attacks with meticulous planning, extraordinary secrecy, and extensive knowledge of how America works. The plans were hatched and financed overseas, beginning as long as five years ago. Each of the hijackers came from abroad: fifteen from Saudi Arabia, two from the United Arab Emirates, and one each from Lebanon and Egypt. All 19 entered our country legally, and only three had overstayed the legal limits of their visas on the day of the attacks. While here, the hijackers did all they could to stay below our radar. They contacted no known terrorist sympathizers. They committed no egregious crimes. They dressed and acted like Americans, shopping and eating at places like Wal-Mart and Pizza Hut, blending into the woodwork all the while. When four got speeding tickets in the days leading up to September 11th, they remained calm and aroused no suspicion. Since none were known terrorists, law enforcement had no reason to question or detain them. **The hijackers also", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911.txt:1:e4f67284891b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8306, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "all they could to stay below our radar.

Since none were known terrorists, law enforcement had no reason to question or detain them. **The hijackers also left no paper trail. In our investigation, we have not uncovered a single piece of paper - either here in the U.S. or in the treasure trove of information that has turned up in Afghanistan and elsewhere - that mentioned any aspect of the September 11th plot. The hijackers had no computers, no laptops, no storage media of any kind.** They used hundreds of different pay phones and cell phones, often with prepaid calling cards that are extremely difficult to trace. And they made sure that all the money sent to them to fund their attacks was wired in small amounts to avoid detection. In short, the terrorists had managed to exploit loopholes and vulnerabilities in our systems, to stay out of sight, and to not let anyone know what they were up to beyond a very closed circle. The investigation was enormously helpful in figuring out who and what to look for as we worked to prevent attacks. It allowed us to see where we as a nation needed to close gaps in our security. And it gave us clear and definitive proof that al Qaeda was behind the strikes. At the same time, we were taking other steps to track down any potential associates who might still be out there. We began to identify individuals whom we needed to question. We went to the flight schools to identify associates of the hijackers. We went to those who run a popular travel website that several of the hijackers used to make their flight reservations. They showed us the patterns the hijackers followed and identified others who fit a similar profile. And we ran down all leads in the hopes that they might turn up associates of the terrorists. Through this process, and with the help of state and local authorities, we interviewed thousands of persons to develop a full picture of the hijackers and others associated with them. In the United States, a number of suspects were detained on federal, state, or local charges; on immigration violations; or on material witness warrants. Ultimately, these and other actions with our partners around the world have helped prevent more terrorist attacks. As the days and weeks went by, though, it became clear that the war on terror had only just begun.

Our investigation moved from the events of September 11th to the anthrax attacks, to the foiled shoe bombing on the flight from Paris to Miami, to the kidnapping and murder of a Wall Street Journal reporter in Pakistan. Through it all, the FBI had become part and parcel of what is now called \"homeland security,\" a government-wide campaign to protect America from terrorist attacks. And we have been given a critical role to play, one that is redefining much of what we do. The homeland security effort is being waged on many fronts. The law enforcement component is building cases against terrorists in the court of law. The military component is deploying our armed forces to attack terrorist strongholds overseas. The intelligence component is using information and analysis to anticipate and prevent attacks, and to better understand the enemy. The diplomatic component is building an international coalition against terror. The financial component is drying up the pool of funds used by terrorists. And the public health component is preparing now to save lives and protect our communities. Today, the FBI is fully integrated into this campaign. We play a leadership role, of course, in the law enforcement arena. At the same time, we are supporting each of the other components of the campaign and each of its players. In this environment, we realize that what we do to help our colleagues is every bit as important as what we do within our own agency. We are supporting the military, for example, by sharing information and intelligence that we gather in our investigations and in our interviews of prisoners. In some cases, we have also facilitated the capture and arrest of terrorists overseas. We are supporting the intelligence effort by working more closely than ever with our partners in the intelligence community here and around the world to gather and share information. We are developing new tools to make this process easier and more effective. To cut off terrorist funding, we've created a financial review group that is working with many other agencies to investigate shady bank accounts and wire transfers and to develop predictive models that can help target suspicious ones in the future. So far, this group has reviewed over 75,000 transactions and helped freeze millions in terrorist funds worldwide. In the public health area, we continue to investigate any incidents involving biological or chemical agents. Since September 11th, we've not only launched a massive investigation into the anthrax attacks, we've also responded to the 16,000 hoaxes and threats", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911.txt:3:0f4ad9c6fab9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8308, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "other agencies to investigate shady bank accounts and wire transfers and to develop predictive models that can help target suspicious ones in the future.

Since September 11th, we've not only launched a massive investigation into the anthrax attacks, we've also responded to the 16,000 hoaxes and threats that have followed in their wake. We have also stepped up efforts to work more closely with state and local officials, and we continue to coordinate issues, provide training, and stage exercises. As I'll discuss later, the FBI also plays a role in the diplomatic component through our overseas offices, which work closely with American Embassies and foreign governments. Our role in homeland security builds upon what we have been doing for many years. We're still the lead law enforcement agency for counterterrorism. We're still assessing threats and issuing warnings and advisories to our law enforcement partners and to the American people. We're still leading the multi-agency National Infrastructure Protection Center, a key force in protecting our nation's critical physical and electronic infrastructures. And most of all, our top priority is still prevention. The difference is largely a matter of degree. Terrorists have shown they are willing to go to great lengths to destroy America. We must be willing to go to even greater lengths to stop them. Our worldwide network must be more powerful. Our financial commitment must be stronger. Our techniques and training must be more sophisticated. And our sense of urgency and intensity must be greater. This reality is driven home to me in a very real way each day. Since the attacks, I have briefed President Bush in the Oval Office each morning. Together with George Tenet, the Director of the CIA, we go over what we call the \"threat matrix,\" a list of every threat directed at the US in the past 24 hours. During these briefings, the President is not so much interested in who has been arrested or who has been prosecuted. What the President cares about most is what we in the FBI are doing - in concert with our partners - to run down each of these threats. He wants to be absolutely sure that we are aggressively pursuing every angle and every lead, so that America never wakes up to another morning like September 11th. George Tenet calls those meetings \"galvanizing.\" He recognizes, as I do, that you simply cannot walk into that briefing without feeling completely confident that your people are on top of every issue. More importantly, you cannot come back day after day without being sure that your agency is taking every step to make prevention both a priority and a reality. In the Bureau, we have", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911.txt:4:4cf479fc6bac", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8309, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "and every lead, so that America never wakes up to another morning like September 11th.

More importantly, you cannot come back day after day without being sure that your agency is taking every step to make prevention both a priority and a reality. In the Bureau, we have taken a long, hard look in the mirror to see how we measure up to this mandate. We see some strong counterterrorism capabilities, expertise that has been refined over time and sharpened by experience. But we also see areas where we could do more. And we are moving forward to address them as quickly as possible. First, we are putting more resources into the fight. As we speak, we are overhauling our counterterrorism operations so that we have twice as many Agents focused on prevention. As we hire nearly one thousand new Agents this year, we are also recruiting the right mix of skills -- primarily computer, scientific, and language -- that we need to fight terror. More resources also means a much stronger presence at major special events. We were out in force, for example, at this week's Boston Marathon. At the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, we stationed nearly 1,400 personnel -- about five percent of our workforce -- to support the many professionals devoted to ensuring the safety of the games. We are also expanding and improving our analytic capability. The September 11th terrorists spent a great deal of time and effort figuring out how America works. They knew the ins and outs of our systems. We need to have a complete grasp on how terrorists operate as well. Our analysts do some great work, but we need more of them and we need to do more of the kind of strategic thinking that helps us stay one step ahead of those who would do us harm. Second, we are overhauling our technology. Here in the heart of Silicon Valley, you understand how quickly technology changes and how fast you can be left behind. The fact is, for all the state-of-the-art systems in our lab, for all the high-tech services we provide to law enforcement, the Bureau has simply not kept pace when it comes to the equipment on our desktops. We have computers discarded by other agencies that we took as upgrades. We have systems that cannot talk with other Bureau systems, much less with other federal agencies. We have 34 different investigative applications, none of which are easy to use and all of which must ultimately be integrated. In the wake of September 11th, we have accelerated our plans to fix these problems. We will put in place new hardware this year and we", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911.txt:5:9a661f1518c9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8310, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "the equipment on our desktops.

We have 34 different investigative applications, none of which are easy to use and all of which must ultimately be integrated. In the wake of September 11th, we have accelerated our plans to fix these problems. We will put in place new hardware this year and we will overhaul our key applications by the end of next year. Our goal is a near paperless environment, a development that will put us light years ahead of where we are today. Technology will also help us share information more quickly and effectively outside the Bureau. We don't have the right systems in place now to make information flow as freely and as seamlessly as we'd like. We're working to create a database - one that sits on top of all the others - that we can use to share information and intelligence with the outside world. We hope to test it later next year. We're also looking for a way to get information out more quickly and universally. Today, there is no one system - no digital pipeline - that we can use to send advisories and information to all of law enforcement. We have to do it piecemeal and patchwork. We're working hard to find a solution. Third, effective prevention requires strengthening the defensive infrastructure of the country. This means immigration and customs programs that keep terrorists out, airports that are secure, and seaports that are on alert. We are supporting these efforts wherever we can. It also means a national program where the FBI joins with state and local law enforcement to form a national anti-terror network. There are just over 11,000 Special Agents. There are 650,000 state and local law enforcement officers. An integrated national program that combines our resources and expertise substantially increases the safety of all Americans. Finally, prevention also means something America has not really focused on before September 11th. It means an aggressive -- but rigorously lawful -- program of disruption abroad and at home. The September 11th terrorists had the luxury of time and tranquility to put the pieces of their plan in place. From the training camps of Afghanistan to the universities of Germany to the flight schools of America, they were able to assemble the components of their plan and pick their moment to execute it. We cannot afford them this operational luxury again. For America, prevention must include an international offensive capability in which the intelligence and law enforcement resources of the global community are integrated into a program to disrupt and attack terrorist operations in their infancy. It is this international component, as much as any other ingredient, which heralds a new day for the FBI. In", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911.txt:6:c8733acba882", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8311, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "they were able to assemble the components of their plan and pick their moment to execute it.

It is this international component, as much as any other ingredient, which heralds a new day for the FBI. In a post 9-11 world, partnerships abroad equal security at home. We are working to build these partnerships through our 44 overseas offices, what we call Legal Attaches. Today more than ever, they are an important first line of defense against terror. They enable us to build the kind of face-to-face, personal relationships we need to track down terrorists around the globe and root them out of their hiding places. Last month, working through our Legal Attache in Manila, a group of 28 senior level government officials from the Republic of the Philippines came to our National Academy in Virginia for a two-week seminar. They wanted to learn how to knock the financial legs out from under terrorists. One of the participants in the class was Jose Calida, the Undersecretary for the Department of Justice in the Philippines. He decided to give the class a name. He came up with the word \"Balikatan,\" which in his native tongue means \"shoulder-to-shoulder.\" Because when he looked out at the class, that's what he saw: 28 leaders sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with each other and with us, united in a common purpose of defeating terror. Al-Qaeda and other international terrorist groups have developed networks around the world. We need the same kind of networks to defeat them. Even in this age of sophisticated technologies and techniques, it is critically important that we be able to sit down with a colleague and develop a rapport that will ultimately help us build a national and international coalition against terror. That is why our overseas offices are so important and why we need even more of them in the days ahead. As we in the Bureau move through a period of intense change, as we adjust to our new role in homeland security, we must be flexible and open-minded. We can never afford to cling to the status quo. Where our capabilities are strong, they must be stronger. Where problems exist, we must acknowledge them, fix them, and move on. The reality is, change is never smooth or easy. That is especially true for an agency like the FBI, one that is always on the cutting edge, pioneering new tools and techniques to help us catch an increasingly savvy band of criminals. In the past, though, the FBI has sometimes made problems worse by ignoring or denying them. That can't be the way we do business going forward. We've", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911.txt:7:7d1880620693", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8312, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020419fbinolaptops911", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "problems exist, we must acknowledge them, fix them, and move on.

In the past, though, the FBI has sometimes made problems worse by ignoring or denying them. That can't be the way we do business going forward. We've got to welcome and even embrace constructive criticism. We have to acknowledge problems and be ahead of the curve in fixing them. That has been our approach in recent months, and it will remain our approach. Standing behind all the capabilities that we have now and that we are working to build is a cadre of FBI professionals, men and women who exemplify courage, integrity, respect for the law, and respect for others. We are extremely proud of how they have performed over the past seven months. They have worked long days and nights, sacrificing time with their families to get the job done. They have shown grace under fire in difficult and often dangerous situations. There is one Special Agent, though, who made the ultimate sacrifice for the FBI and for the country he cared about so deeply. His name is Lenny Hatton, and he is one of the many law enforcement professionals lost on September 11th. Lenny was an exceptional Agent and a remarkable man. He was on his way to work on September 11th when he saw the World Trade Center on fire. Instinctively, he went straight to the scene and started working with police and firefighters to evacuate the buildings. He was last seen helping a victim out of one of the buildings, and rushing back in to save more. Several days later at Lenny's funeral Mass, an individual by the name of Chris O'Connell paid tribute to the fallen Agent. Chris talked about how Lenny devoted his life to serving -- as a Marine, as a volunteer firefighter, as an FBI Special Agent, as a husband and father -- and how Lenny had served until his last breath, trying to save lives. In tears, Chris O'Connell closed his eulogy by saying: \"On September 11th, we saw a horrific event in this country and our city. Special Agent Lenny Hatton stood shoulder to shoulder with the finest and the bravest. Until we meet again, my partner, my friend.\" Chris O'Connell was Lenny's partner, and Chris O'Connell was and is a detective with the New York Police Department. Lenny and Chris cared for each other like brothers. It didn't matter to them that one worked for the FBI and one worked for the NYPD. They just wanted to get the job done. They were a team.

May 21, 2002 FBI Director Robert Mueller FBI Headquarters Washington, D.C. Dear Director Mueller: I feel at this point that I have to put my concerns in writing concerning the important topic of the FBI's response to evidence of terrorist activity in the United States prior to September 11th. The issues are fundamentally ones of INTEGRITY and go to the heart of the FBI's law enforcement mission and mandate. Moreover, at this critical juncture in fashioning future policy to promote the most effective handling of ongoing and future threats to United States citizens' security, it is of absolute importance that an unbiased, completely accurate picture emerge of the FBI's current investigative and management strengths and failures. To get to the point, I have deep concerns that a delicate and subtle shading/skewing of facts by you and others at the highest levels of FBI management has occurred and is occurring. The term \"cover up\" would be too strong a characterization which is why I am attempting to carefully (and perhaps over laboriously) choose my words here. I base my concerns on my relatively small, peripheral but unique role in the Moussaoui investigation in the Minneapolis Division prior to, during and after September 11th and my analysis of the comments I have heard both inside the FBI (originating, I believe, from you and other high levels of management) as well as your Congressional testimony and public comments. I feel that certain facts, including the following, have, up to now, been omitted, downplayed, glossed over and/or mis-characterized in an effort to avoid or minimize personal and/or institutional embarrassment on the part of the FBI and/or perhaps even for improper political reasons: 1) **The Minneapolis agents who responded to the call about Moussaoui's flight training identified him as a terrorist threat from a very early point. The decision to take him into custody on August 15, 2001, on the INS \"overstay\" charge was a deliberate one to counter that threat and was based on the agents' reasonable suspicions. **While it can be said that Moussaoui's overstay status was fortuitous,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt:0:3f50f2feb787", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8315, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "on the part of the FBI and/or perhaps even for improper political reasons: 1) **The Minneapolis agents who responded to the call about Moussaoui's flight training identified him as a terrorist threat from a very early point. The decision to take him into custody on August 15, 2001, on the INS \"overstay\" charge was a deliberate one to counter that threat and was based on the agents' reasonable suspicions. **While it can be said that Moussaoui's overstay status was fortuitous, because it allowed for him to be taken into immediate custody and prevented him receiving any more flight training, it was certainly not something the INS coincidentally undertook of their own volition. I base this on the conversation I had when the agents called me at home late on the evening Moussaoui was taken into custody to confer and ask for legal advice about their next course of action. The INS agent was assigned to the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and was therefore working in tandem with FBI agents. 2) As the Minneapolis agents' reasonable suspicions quickly ripened into probable cause, which, at the latest, occurred within days of Moussaoui's arrest when **the French Intelligence Service confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups and activities connected to Osama Bin Laden**, they became desperate to search the computer lap top that had been taken from Moussaoui as well as conduct a more thorough search of his personal effects. The agents in particular believed that Moussaoui signaled he had something to hide in the way he refused to allow them to search his computer. 3) The Minneapolis agents' initial thought was to obtain a criminal search warrant, but in order to do so, they needed to get FBI Headquarters' (FBIHQ's) approval in order to ask for DOJ OIPR's approval to contact the United States Attorney's Office in Minnesota. Prior to and even after receipt of information provided by the French, FBIHQ personnel disputed with the Minneapolis agents the existence of probable cause to believe that a criminal violation had occurred/was occurring. As such, FBIHQ personnel refused to contact OIPR to attempt to get the authority. While reasonable minds may differ as to whether probable cause existed prior to receipt of the French intelligence information, it was certainly established after that point and became even greater with successive, more detailed information from the French and other intelligence sources. The two possible criminal violations initially identified by Minneapolis Agents were violations of Title 18 United States Code Section 2332b (Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, which, notably, includes \"creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to any other person by destroying or damaging any structure, conveyance, or other real or personal property within the United States or by attempting or conspiring to destroy or damage any structure, conveyance, or other real or personal property within the United States\") and Section 32", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt:1:5f01240a0702", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8316, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "criminal violations initially identified by Minneapolis Agents were violations of Title 18 United States Code Section 2332b (Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, which, notably, includes \"creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to any other person by destroying or damaging any structure, conveyance, or other real or personal property within the United States or by attempting or conspiring to destroy or damage any structure, conveyance, or other real or personal property within the United States\") and Section 32 (Destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities). It is important to note that the actual search warrant obtained on September 11th was based on probable cause of a violation of Section 32.1 Notably also, the actual search warrant obtained on September 11th did not include the French intelligence information. Therefore, the only main difference between the information being submitted to FBIHQ from an early date which HQ personnel continued to deem insufficient and the actual criminal search warrant which a federal district judge signed and approved on September 11th, was the fact that, by the time the actual warrant was obtained, suspected terrorists were known to have highjacked planes which they then deliberately crashed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. To say then, as has been iterated numerous times, that probable cause did not exist until after the disasterous event occurred, is really to acknowledge that the missing piece of probable cause was only the FBI's (FBIHQ's) failure to appreciate that such an event could occur. The probable cause did not otherwise improve or change. When we went to the United States Attorney's Office that morning of September 11th, in the first hour after the attack, we used a disk containing the same information that had already been provided to FBIHQ; then we quickly added Paragraph 19 which was the little we knew from news reports of the actual attacks that morning. The problem with chalking this all up to the \"20-20 hindsight is perfect\" problem, (which I, as all attorneys who have been involved in deadly force training or the defense of various lawsuits are fully appreciative of), is that this is not a case of everyone in the FBI failing to appreciate the potential consequences. It is obvious, from my firsthand knowledge of the events and the detailed documentation that exists, that the agents in Minneapolis who were closest to the action and in the best position to gauge the situation locally, did fully appreciate the terrorist risk/danger posed by Moussaoui and his possible co-conspirators even prior to September 11th. Even without knowledge of the Phoenix communication (and any number of other additional intelligence communications that FBIHQ personnel were privy to in their central coordination roles), the Minneapolis agents appreciated the risk. So I think it's very hard for the FBI to offer the \"20-20 hindsight\" justification for its failure to act!

So I think it's very hard for the FBI to offer the \"20-20 hindsight\" justification for its failure to act! Also intertwined with my reluctance in this case to accept the \"20-20 hindsight\" rationale is first-hand knowledge that I have of statements made on September 11th, after the first attacks on the World Trade Center had already occurred, made telephonically by the FBI Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) who was the one most involved in the Moussaoui matter and who, up to that point, seemed to have been consistently, almost deliberately thwarting the Minneapolis FBI agents' efforts (see number 5). Even after the attacks had begun, the SSA in question was still attempting to block the search of Moussaoui's computer, characterizing the World Trade Center attacks as a mere coincidence with Misseapolis' prior suspicions about Moussaoui.2 4) In one of my peripheral roles on the Moussaoui matter, I answered an e-mail message on August 22, 2001, from an attorney at the National Security Law Unit (NSLU). Of course, with (ever important!) 20-20 hindsight, I now wish I had taken more time and care to compose my response. When asked by NSLU for my \"assessment of (our) chances of getting a criminal warrant to search Moussaoui's computer\", I answered, \"Although I think there's a decent chance of being able to get a judge to sign a criminal search warrant, our USAO seems to have an even higher standard much of the time, so rather than risk it, I advised that they should try the other route.\" Leaked news accounts which said the Minneapolis Legal Counsel (referring to me) concurred with the FBIHQ that probable cause was lacking to search Moussaoui's computer are in error. (or possibly the leak was deliberately skewed in this fashion?) What I meant by this pithy e-mail response, was that although I thought probable cause existed (\"probable cause\" meaning that the proposition has to be more likely than not, or if quantified, a 51% likelihood), I thought our United States Attorney's Office, (for a lot of reasons including just to play it safe) in regularly requiring much more than probable cause before approving affidavits, (maybe, if quantified, 75%-80% probability and sometimes even higher), and depending on the actual AUSA who would be assigned, might turn us down. As a tactical choice, I therefore thought it would be better to pursue the \"other route\" (the FISA search warrant) first, the reason being that there is a common perception, which for lack of a better term, I'll call the \"smell test\" which has arisen that", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt:3:a42391525380", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8318, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "in regularly requiring much more than probable cause before approving affidavits, (maybe, if quantified, 75%-80% probability and sometimes even higher), and depending on the actual AUSA who would be assigned, might turn us down.

Of course this isn't true, but I think the perception still exists. So, by this line of reasoning, I was afraid that if we first attempted to go criminal and failed to convince an AUSA, we wouldn't pass the \"smell test\" in subsequently seeking a FISA. I thought our best chances therefore lay in first seeking the FISA. Both of the factors that influenced my thinking are areas arguably in need of improvement: requiring an excessively high standard of probable cause in terrorism cases and getting rid of the \"smell test\" perception. It could even be argued that FBI agents, especially in terrorism cases where time is of the essence, should be allowed to go directly to federal judges to have their probable cause reviewed for arrests or searches without having to gain the USAO's approval.4 5) The fact is that key FBIHQ personnel whose job it was to assist and coordinate with field division agents on terrorism investigations and the obtaining and use of FISA searches (and who theoretically were privy to many more sources of intelligence information than field division agents), continued to, almost inexplicably,5 throw up roadblocks and undermine Minneapolis' by-now desperate efforts to obtain a FISA search warrant, long after the French intelligence service provided its information and probable cause became clear. HQ personnel brought up almost ridiculous questions in their apparent efforts to undermine the probable cause.6 In all of their conversations and correspondence, HQ personnel never disclosed to the Minneapolis agents that the Phoenix Division had, only approximately three weeks earlier, warned of Al Qaeda operatives in flight schools seeking flight training for terrorist purposes! Nor did FBIHQ personnel do much to disseminate the information about Moussaoui to other appropriate intelligence/law enforcement authorities. **When, in a desperate 11th hour measure to bypass the FBIHQ roadblock, the Minneapolis Division undertook to directly notify the CIA's Counter Terrorist Center (CTC), FBIHQ personnel actually chastised the Minneapolis agents for making the direct notification without their approval!** 6 ) Eventually on August 28, 2001, after a series of e-mails between Minneapolis and FBIHQ, which suggest that the FBIHQ SSA deliberately further undercut the FISA effort by not adding the further intelligence information which he had promised to add that supported Moussaoui's foreign power connection and making several changes in", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt:4:f823a9b77ac7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8319, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "the Minneapolis Division undertook to directly notify the CIA's Counter Terrorist Center (CTC), FBIHQ personnel actually chastised the Minneapolis agents for making the direct notification without their approval!** 6 ) Eventually on August 28, 2001, after a series of e-mails between Minneapolis and FBIHQ, which suggest that the FBIHQ SSA deliberately further undercut the FISA effort by not adding the further intelligence information which he had promised to add that supported Moussaoui's foreign power connection and making several changes in the wording of the information that had been provided by the Minneapolis Agent, the Minneapolis agents were notified that the NSLU Unit Chief did not think there was sufficient evidence of Moussaoui's connection to a foreign power. Minneapolis personnel are, to this date, unaware of the specifics of the verbal presentations by the FBIHQ SSA to NSLU or whether anyone in NSLU ever was afforded the opportunity to actually read for him/herself all of the information on Moussaoui that had been gathered by the Minneapolis Division and the French intelligence service. Obviously verbal presentations are far more susceptible to mis-characterization and error. The e-mail communications between Minneapolis and FBIHQ, however, speak for themselves and there are far better witnesses than me who can provide their first hand knowledge of these events characterized in one Minneapolis agent's e-mail as FBIHQ is \"setting this up for failure.\" My only comment is that the process of allowing the FBI supervisors to make changes in affidavits is itself fundamentally wrong, just as, in the follow-up to FBI Laboratory Whistleblower Frederic Whitehurst's allegations, this process was revealed to be wrong in the context of writing up laboratory results. With the Whitehurst allegations, this process of allowing supervisors to re-write portions of laboratory reports, was found to provide opportunities for over-zealous supervisors to skew the results in favor of the prosecution. In the Moussaoui case, it was the opposite -- the process allowed the Headquarters Supervisor to downplay the significance of the information thus far collected in order to get out of the work of having to see the FISA application through or possibly to avoid taking what he may have perceived as an unnecessary career risk.7 I understand that the failures of the FBIHQ personnel involved in the Moussaoui matter are also being officially excused because they were too busy with other investigations, the Cole bombing and other important terrorism matters, but the Supervisor's taking of the time to read each word of the information submitted by Minneapolis and then substitute his own choice of wording belies to some extent the notion that he was too busy. As an FBI division legal advisor for 12 years (and an FBI agent for over 21 years), I can state that an affidavit is better and will tend to be more accurate when the affiant has first hand information of all the information he/she must attest to.

As an FBI division legal advisor for 12 years (and an FBI agent for over 21 years), I can state that an affidavit is better and will tend to be more accurate when the affiant has first hand information of all the information he/she must attest to. Of necessity, agents must continually rely upon information from confidential sources, third parties and other law enforcement officers in drafting affidavits, but the repeating of information from others greatly adds to the opportunities for factual discrepancies and errors to arise. To the extent that we can minimize the opportunity for this type of error to arise by simply not allowing unnecessary re-writes by supervisory staff, it ought to be done. (I'm not talking, of course, about mere grammatical corrections, but changes of some substance as apparently occurred with the Moussaoui information which had to be, for lack of a better term, \"filtered\" through FBIHQ before any action, whether to seek a criminal or a FISA warrant, could be taken.) Even after September 11th, the fear was great on the part of Minneapolis Division personnel that the same FBIHQ personnel would continue their \"filtering\" with respect to the Moussaoui investigation, and now with the added incentive of preventing their prior mistakes from coming to light. For this reason, for weeks, Minneapolis prefaced all outgoing communications (ECs) in the PENTTBOM investigation with a summary of the information about Moussaoui. We just wanted to make sure the information got to the proper prosecutive authorities and was not further suppressed! This fear was probably irrational but was nonetheless understandable in light of the Minneapolis agents' prior experiences and frustrations involving FBIHQ. (The redundant preface information regarding Moussaoui on otherwise unrelative PENTTBOM communications has ended up adding to criminal discovery issues, but this is the reason it was done.) 7) Although the last thing the FBI or the country needs now is a witch hunt, I do find it odd that (to my knowledge) no inquiry whatsoever was launched of the relevant FBIHQ personnel's actions a long time ago. Despite FBI leaders' full knowledge of all the items mentioned herein (and probably more that I'm unaware of), the SSA, his unit chief, and other involved HQ personnel were allowed to stay in their positions and, what's worse, occupy critical positions in the FBI's SIOC Command Center post September 11th. (The SSA in question actually received a promotion some months afterward!) It's true we all make mistakes and I'm not suggesting that HQ personnel in question ought to be burned at the stake, but, we all need to be held accountable for serious mistakes. I'm relatively certain that if it appeared that a lowly field office agent", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt:6:6cc277ed52ee", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8321, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "personnel were allowed to stay in their positions and, what's worse, occupy critical positions in the FBI's SIOC Command Center post September 11th.

It's true we all make mistakes and I'm not suggesting that HQ personnel in question ought to be burned at the stake, but, we all need to be held accountable for serious mistakes. I'm relatively certain that if it appeared that a lowly field office agent had committed such errors of judgment, the FBI's OPR would have been notified to investigate and the agent would have, at the least, been quickly reassigned. I'm afraid the FBI's failure to submit this matter to OPR (and to the IOB) gives further impetus to the notion (raised previously by many in the FBI) of a double standard which results in those of lower rank being investigated more aggressively and dealt with more harshly for misconduct while the misconduct of those at the top is often overlooked or results in minor disciplinary action. From all appearances, this double standard may also apply between those at FBIHQ and those in the field. 8) The last official \"fact\" that I take issue with is not really a fact, but an opinion, and a completely unsupported opinion at that. In the day or two following September 11th, you, Director Mueller, made the statement to the effect that if the FBI had only had any advance warning of the attacks, we (meaning the FBI), may have been able to take some action to prevent the tragedy. Fearing that this statement could easily come back to haunt the FBI upon revelation of the information that had been developed pre-September 11th about Moussaoui, I and others in the Minneapolis Office, immediately sought to reach your office through an assortment of higher level FBIHQ contacts, in order to quickly make you aware of the background of the Moussaoui investigation and forewarn you so that your public statements could be accordingly modified. When such statements from you and other FBI officials continued, we thought that somehow you had not received the message and we made further efforts. Finally when similar comments were made weeks later, in Assistant Director Caruso's congressional testimony in response to the first public leaks about Moussaoui we faced the sad realization that the remarks indicated someone, possibly with your approval, had decided to circle the wagons at FBIHQ in an apparent effort to protect the FBI from embarrassment and the relevant FBI officials from scrutiny. Everything I have seen and heard about the FBI's official stance and the FBI's internal preparations in anticipation of further congressional inquiry, had, unfortunately, confirmed my worst suspicions in this regard. After the details began to emerge concerning the pre-September 11th investigation of Moussaoui, and subsequently with the recent release of the information about the Phoenix EC, your statement", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt:7:41f815760eec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8322, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "the wagons at FBIHQ in an apparent effort to protect the FBI from embarrassment and the relevant FBI officials from scrutiny.

After the details began to emerge concerning the pre-September 11th investigation of Moussaoui, and subsequently with the recent release of the information about the Phoenix EC, your statement has changed. The official statement is now to the effect that even if the FBI had followed up on the Phoenix lead to conduct checks of flight schools and the Minneapolis request to search Moussaoui's personal effects and laptop, nothing would have changed and such actions certainly could not have prevented the terrorist attacks and resulting loss of life. With all due respect, this statement is as bad as the first! It is also quite at odds with the earlier statement (which I'm surprised has not already been pointed out by those in the media!) I don't know how you or anyone at FBI Headquarters, no matter how much genius or prescience you may possess, could so blithely make this affirmation without anything to back the opinion up than your stature as FBI Director. The truth is, as with most predictions into the future, no one will ever know what impact, if any, the FBI's following up on those requests, would have had. Although I agree that it's very doubtful that the full scope of the tragedy could have been prevented, it's at least possible we could have gotten lucky and uncovered one or two more of the terrorists in flight training prior to September 11th, just as Moussaoui was discovered, after making contact with his flight instructors. It is certainly not beyond the realm of imagination to hypothesize that Moussaoui's fortuitous arrest alone, even if he merely was the 20th hijacker, allowed the hero passengers of Flight 93 to overcome their terrorist hijackers and thus spare more lives on the ground. And even greater casualties, possibly of our Nation's highest government officials, may have been prevented if Al Qaeda intended for Moussaoui to pilot an entirely different aircraft. There is, therefore at least some chance that discovery of other terrorist pilots prior to September 11th may have limited the September 11th attacks and resulting loss of life. Although your conclusion otherwise has to be very reassuring for some in the FBI to hear being repeated so often (as if saying it's so may make it so), I think your statements demonstrate a rush to judgment to protect the FBI at all costs.

You do have some good ideas for change in the FBI but I think you have also not been completely honest about some of the true reasons for the FBI's pre-September 11th failures. Until we come clean and deal with the root causes, the Department of Justice will continue to experience problems fighting terrorism and fighting crime in general. I have used the \"we\" term repeatedly herin to indicate facts about others in the Minneapolis Office at critical times, but none of the opinions expressed herin can be attributed to anyone but myself. I know that those who know me would probably describe me as, by nature, overly opinionated and sometimes not as discreet as I should be. Certainly some of the above remarks may be interpreted as falling into that category, but I really do not intend anything as a personal criticism of you or anyone else in the FBI, to include the FBIHQ personnel who I believe were remiss and mishandled their duties with regard to the Moussaoui investigation. Truly my only purpose is to try to provide the facts within my purview so that an accurate assessment can be obtained and we can learn from our mistakes. I have pointed out a few of the things that I think should be looked at but there are many, many more.8 An honest acknowledgment of the FBI's mistakes in this and other cases should not lead to increasing the Headquarters bureaucracy and approval levels of investigative actions as the answer. Most often, field office agents and field office management on the scene will be better suited to the timely and effective solution of crimes and, in some lucky instances, to the effective prevention of crimes, including terrorism incidents. The relatively quick solving of the recent mailbox pipe-bombing incidents which resulted in no serious injuries to anyone are a good example of effective field office work (actually several field offices working together) and there are hundreds of other examples. Although FBIHQ personnel have, no doubt, been of immeasurable assistance to the field over the years, I'm hard pressed to think of any case which has been", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt:9:aa55ca2efc33", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8324, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "in some lucky instances, to the effective prevention of crimes, including terrorism incidents.

Although FBIHQ personnel have, no doubt, been of immeasurable assistance to the field over the years, I'm hard pressed to think of any case which has been solved by FBIHQ personnel and I can name several that have been screwed up! Decision-making is inherently more effective and timely when decentralized instead of concentrated. Your plans for an FBI Headquarters' \"Super Squad\" simply fly in the face of an honest appraisal of the FBI's pre-September 11th failures. The Phoenix, Minneapolis and Paris Legal Attache Offices reacted remarkably exhibiting keen perception and prioritization skills regarding the terrorist threats they uncovered or were made aware of pre-September 11th. The same cannot be said for the FBI Headquarters' bureaucracy and you want to expand that?! Should we put the counterterrorism unit chief and SSA who previously handled the Moussaoui matter in charge of the new \"Super Squad\"?! You are also apparently disregarding the fact the Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs), operating out of field divisions for years, (the first and chief one being New York City's JTTF), have successfully handled numerous terrorism investigations and, in some instances, successfully prevented acts of terrorism. There's no denying the need for more and better intelligence and intelligence management, but you should think carefully about how much gate keeping power should be entrusted with any HQ entity. If we are indeed in a \"war\", shouldn't the Generals be on the battlefield instead of sitting in a spot removed from the action while still attempting to call the shots? I have been an FBI agent for over 21 years and, for what it's worth, have never received any form of disciplinary action throughout my career. From the 5th grade, when I first wrote the FBI and received the \"100 Facts about the FBI\" pamphlet, this job has been my dream. I feel that my career in the FBI has been somewhat exemplary, having entered on duty at a time when there was only a small percentage of female Special Agents. I have also been lucky to have had four children during my time in the FBI and am the sole breadwinner of a family of six. Due to the frankness with which I have expressed myself and my deep feelings on these issues, (which is only because I feel I have a somewhat unique, inside perspective of the Moussaoui matter, the gravity of the events of September 11th and the current seriousness of the FBI's and United States' ongoing efforts in the \"war against terrorism\"), I hope my continued employment with the FBI is not somehow", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt:10:7f6fc5657671", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8325, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "and am the sole breadwinner of a family of six.

I have never written to an FBI Director in my life before on any topic. Although I would hope it is not necessary, I would therefore wish to take advantage of the federal \"Whistleblower Protection\" provisions by so characterizing my remarks. Sincerely Coleen M. Rowley Special Agent and Minneapolis Chief Division Counsel NOTES 1) And both of the violations originally cited in vain by the Minneapolis agents disputing the issue with FBIHQ personnel are among those on which Moussaoui is currently indicted. 2) Just minutes after I saw the first news of the World Trade Center attack(s), I was standing outside the office of Minneapolis ASAC M. Chris Briesse waiting for him to finish with a phone call, when he received a call on another line from this SSA. Since I figured I knew what the call may be about and wanted to ask, in light of the unfolding events and the apparent urgency of the situation, if we should now immediately attempt to obtain a criminal search warrant for Moussaoui's laptop and personal property, I took the call. I said something to the effect that, in light of what had just happened in New York, it would have to be the \"hugest coincidence\" at this point if Moussaoui was not involved with the terrorists. The SSA stated something to the effect that I had used the right term, \"coincidence\" and that this was probably all just a coincidence and we were to do nothing in Minneapolis until we got their (HQ's) permission because we might \"screw up\" something else going on elsewhere in the country. 4) Certainly Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which begins, \"Upon the request of a federal law enforcement officer or an attorney for the government\" does not contain this requirement. Although the practice that has evolved is that FBI agents must secure prior approval for any search or arrest from the United States Attorneys Office, the Federal Rule governing Search and Seizure clearly envisions law enforcement officers applying, on their own, for search warrants. 5) During the early aftermath of September 11th, when I happened to be recounting the pre-September 11th events concerning the Moussaoui investigation to other FBI personnel in other divisions or in FBIHQ, almost everyone's first question was \"Why?--Why would an FBI agent(s) deliberately sabotage a case? (I know I shouldn't be flippant about this,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt:11:195fc11ac583", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8326, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "arrest from the United States Attorneys Office, the Federal Rule governing Search and Seizure clearly envisions law enforcement officers applying, on their own, for search warrants. 5) During the early aftermath of September 11th, when I happened to be recounting the pre-September 11th events concerning the Moussaoui investigation to other FBI personnel in other divisions or in FBIHQ, almost everyone's first question was \"Why?--Why would an FBI agent(s) deliberately sabotage a case? (I know I shouldn't be flippant about this, but jokes were actually made that the key FBIHQ personnel had to be spies or moles, like Robert Hansen, who were actually working for Osama Bin Laden to have so undercut Minneapolis' effort.) Our best real guess, however, is that, in most cases avoidance of all \"unnecessary\" actions/decisions by FBIHQ managers (and maybe to some extent field managers as well) has, in recent years, been seen as the safest FBI career course. Numerous high-ranking FBI officials who have made decisions or have taken actions which, in hindsight, turned out to be mistaken or just turned out badly (i.e. Ruby Ridge, Waco, etc.) have seen their careers plummet and end. This has in turn resulted in a climate of fear which has chilled aggressive FBI law enforcement action/decisions. In a large hierarchal bureaucracy such as the FBI, with the requirement for numerous superiors approvals/oversight, the premium on career-enhancement, and interjecting a chilling factor brought on by recent extreme public and congressional criticism/oversight, and I think you will see at least the makings of the most likely explanation. Another factor not to be underestimated probably explains the SSA and other FBIHQ personnel's reluctance to act. And so far, I have heard no FBI official even allude to this problem-- which is that FBI Headquarters is staffed with a number of short term careerists* who, like the SSA in question, must only serve an 18 month-just-time-to-get-your-ticket-punched minimum. It's no wonder why very little expertise can be acquired by a Headquarters unit! (And no wonder why FBIHQ is mired in mediocrity! -- that maybe a little strong, but it would definitely be fair to say that there is unevenness in competency among Headquarters personnel.) (It's also a well known fact that the FBI Agents Association has complained for years about the disincentives facing those entering the FBI management career path which results in very few of the FBI's best and brightest choosing to go into management. Instead the ranks of FBI management are filled with many who were failures as street agents. Along these lines, let me ask the question, why has it suddenly become necessary for the Director to \"handpick\" the FBI management?) It's quite conceivable that many of the HQ personnel who so vigorously disputed Moussaoui's ability/predisposition to fly a plane into a building were simply unaware of all the various incidents and reports worldwide of Al Qaeda terrorists attempting or plotting", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt:12:350d7a85950a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8327, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "into management.

It's quite conceivable that many of the HQ personnel who so vigorously disputed Moussaoui's ability/predisposition to fly a plane into a building were simply unaware of all the various incidents and reports worldwide of Al Qaeda terrorists attempting or plotting to do so. *By the way, just in the event you did not know, let me furnish you the Webster's definition of \"careerism - - the policy or practice of advancing one's career often at the cost of one's integrity\". Maybe that sums up the whole problem! 6) For example, at one point, the Supervisory Special Agent at FBIHQ posited that the French information could be worthless because it only identified Zacarias Moussaoui by name and he, the SSA, didn't know how many people by that name existed in France. A Minneapolis agent attempted to surmount that problem by quickly phoning the FBI's legal Attache (Legat) in Paris, France, so that a check could be made of the French telephone directories. Although the Legat in France did not have access to all of the French telephone directories, he was able to quickly ascertain that there was only one listed in the Paris directory. It is not known if this sufficiently answered the question, for the SSA continued to find new reasons to stall. 7) Another factor that cannot be underestimated as to the HQ Supervisor's apparent reluctance to do anything was/is the ever present risk of being \"written up\" for an Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB) \"error.\" In the year(s) preceding the September 11th acts of terrorism, numerous alleged IOB violations on the part of FBI personnel had to be submitted to the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) as well as the IOB. I believe the chilling effect upon all levels of FBI agents assigned to intelligence matters and their manager hampered us from aggressive investigation of terrorists. Since one generally only runs the risk of IOB violations when one does something, the safer course is to do nothing. Ironically, in this case, a potentially huge IOB violation arguably occurred due to FBIHQ's failure to act, that is, FBIHQ's failure to inform the Department of Justice Criminal Division of Moussaoui's potential criminal violations (which, as I've already said, were quickly identified in Minneapolis as violations of Title 18 United States Code Section 2332b [Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries] and Section 32 [Destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities]). This failure would seem to run clearly afoul of the Attorney General directive contained in the \"1995 Procedures for Contacts Between the FBI and the Criminal Division Concerning Foreign Intelligence and Foreign Counterintelligence Investigations\" which mandatorily require the FBI to notify the", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt:13:d884f77c9dcc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8328, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__020521coleenrowleymemofbidirectormueller", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "potential criminal violations (which, as I've already said, were quickly identified in Minneapolis as violations of Title 18 United States Code Section 2332b [Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries] and Section 32 [Destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities]). This failure would seem to run clearly afoul of the Attorney General directive contained in the \"1995 Procedures for Contacts Between the FBI and the Criminal Division Concerning Foreign Intelligence and Foreign Counterintelligence Investigations\" which mandatorily require the FBI to notify the Criminal Division when \"facts or circumstances are developed\" in an FI or FCI investigation \"that reasonably indicate that a significant federal crime has been, is being, or may be committed.\" I believe that Minneapolis agents actually brought this point to FBIHQ's attention on August 22, 2001, but HQ personnel apparently ignored the directive, ostensibly due to their opinion of the lack of probable cause. But the issue of whether HQ personnel deliberately undercut the probable cause can be sidestepped at this point because the Directive does not require probable cause. It requires only a \"reasonable indication\" which is defined as \"substantially lower than probable cause.\" Given that the Minneapolis Division had accumulated far more than \"a mere hunch\" (which the directive would deem as insufficient), the information ought to have, at least, been passed on to the \"Core Group\" created to assess whether the information needed to be further disseminated to the Criminal Division. However, (and I don't know for sure), but to date, I have never heard that any potential violation of this directive has been submitted to the IOB or to the FBI's OPR. It should also be noted that when making determinations of whether items need to be submitted to the IOB, it is my understanding that NSLU normally used/uses a broad approach, erring, when in doubt, on the side of submitting potential violations. 8) For starters, if prevention rather than prosecution is to be our new main goal, (an objective I totally agree with), we need more guidance on when we can apply the Quarles \"public safety\" exception to Miranda's 5th Amendment requirements. We were prevented from even attempting to question Moussaoui on the day of the attacks when, in theory, he could have possessed further information about other co-conspirators. (Apparently no government attorney believes there is a \"public safety\" exception in a situation like this?!)

Tenet told Congress yesterday. \"The threat environment we find ourselves in today is as bad as it was last summer,\" Tenet told the joint House-Senate panel examining the performance of U.S. intelligence agencies before the attacks on New York and Washington. \"They are reconstituted. They are coming after us. They are planning in multi-theaters. They are planning to strike the homeland again.\" Tenet said he had met with Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge yesterday and will meet with him again today, adding that administration officials have \"taken action in sectors we're most concerned about.\" Other intelligence officials said analysts who have followed the string of terror attacks the past two weeks in Yemen, Kuwait and Bali said they are particularly concerned about strikes on oil shipments from the Middle East and on targets in the United States described only as \"economic.\" The threat information has often proved real, even when details such as time or location are not known. Earlier this month a French oil tanker was attacked off the Yemeni coast by terrorists believed to be part of al Qaeda. U.S. officials learned from interviews with Muhammad Darbi, an al Qaeda member captured in Yemen in August, that a Yemen cell was planning an attack on a Western oil tanker, sources said. Similarly, in late September, U.S. intelligence officials learned of a communication from leaders of the South Asian terrorist group Jamaat Islamiyyah directing followers to attack Western targets, including tourist sites such as Bali, government sources said. As was the case in the months before the Sept. 11 attacks, when Tenet tried urgently to alert administration officials to an imminent, if unspecified threat, the director of central intelligence said yesterday that he did not know the dates, times or places likely to be struck in the future. Despite the heightened concern about the threat, the administration has so far decided that the information is too generalized to raise the nation's alert status from its current yellow or \"elevated\" risk level to orange or \"high\" risk, officials said last night. The FBI sent out an alert to law enforcement agencies eight days ago warning of a heightened risk of attack after the release of separate communications, purportedly from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__021016post-noone-punished-911.txt:0:33d593b8a936", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8331, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__021016post-noone-punished-911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__021016post-noone-punished-911", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "the future. Despite the heightened concern about the threat, the administration has so far decided that the information is too generalized to raise the nation's alert status from its current yellow or \"elevated\" risk level to orange or \"high\" risk, officials said last night. The FBI sent out an alert to law enforcement agencies eight days ago warning of a heightened risk of attack after the release of separate communications, purportedly from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his second-in-command, Ayman Zawahiri. The warning also followed the shooting of a Marine in Kuwait and the attack on the oil tanker off Yemen. Since then, U.S. officials have worked closely with operators of key facilities, such as nuclear and water treatment plants, and government officials to arrive at a proper response. Tenet's assessment came during the last public session of the joint panel convened to investigate the intelligence community's handling of information before the Sept. 11 attacks, a 61/2-hour hearing that also included FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III and Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden, director of the National Security Agency. **All three, responding to what has been a barrage of criticism over missed clues and poor communication among their agencies, conceded that mistakes had been made, but praised their employees as hardworking heroes.** **They said they had instituted new information-sharing and warning systems, and had, in general, increased the number of human intelligence sources, linguists and covert operations to better handle future threats. Under questioning, all three said no individual at their agencies had been punished or fired for any of the missteps surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks.** This did not satisfy several panel members, who argued forcefully that individuals in the three agencies should be held personally responsible for what amounts to a huge failure. \"People have to be held accountable,\" said Sen. Carl M. Levin (D-Mich.). He was particularly concerned that while the CIA identified two of the hijackers as suspected terrorists in early 2001, an agency employee had failed to put the names on a State Department watch list until late August of that year. By then, Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid Almihdhar, both of whom would later take part in the Sept. 11 attacks, were already in the country. Tenet faulted \"uneven standards, poor training and lack of redundancy\" in the watch-listing system at the time. \"The notion that I'm going to take her out and shoot her is ridiculous,\" he said of the CIA employee. \"Accountability is important but we need to be careful. There was no intent to withhold information . . . if anyone is going to take responsibility, I take responsibility.\" \"Good!\" came a voice from the side of the witness table, where Sally Regenhard sat with a photo of her son Christopher, a firefighter who was killed at the World Trade Center. Tenet warned the panel that intelligence agencies will never be", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__021016post-noone-punished-911.txt:1:ed02ce55a7bb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8332, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__021016post-noone-punished-911.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__021016post-noone-punished-911", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "her is ridiculous,\" he said of the CIA employee. \"Accountability is important but we need to be careful.

Tenet warned the panel that intelligence agencies will never be infallible and that the nation must bolster homeland security precautions. Referring to legislation to establish a Homeland Security Department, now mired in Congress, he said: \"You better get it done. Don't wait for us to tell you [al Qaeda] is on top of us.\" Tenet also told the panel in written testimony that the CIA believes Almihdhar and Alhazmi were actually in the country not for the Sept. 11 strike but for another al Qaeda operation. The pair operated on a different timetable than the other hijackers and received special training in Afghanistan in 1999 with operatives who planned and executed the Oct. 12, 2000, attack on the USS Cole, Tenet noted. \"We speculate that this difference may be explained by the possibility that the two men originally entered the U.S. to carry out a different terrorist operation prior to being folded into the 9/11 plot,\" Tenet noted in written testimony submitted to the panel. CIA officials said after the hearing that they do not know what other plot the men might have been trying to complete. In his written testimony, Tenet said the men may have been inserted as last-minute recruits in the Sept. 11 plot when two other would-be hijackers were unable to obtain visas. They are Ramzi Binalshibh, a Yemeni national who was captured in Pakistan last month, and Moroccan Zakaria Essabar. *Staff writer John Mintz contributed to this report.* **Special Note:** For lots more reliable, verifiable information suggesting a major cover-up of 9/11, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911information).

The report concluded that the FAA generally cooperated with the independent panel investigating the terrorist attacks by providing documents about its activities on Sept. 11, but the actions of two FAA managers \"did not, in our view, serve the interests of the FAA, the Department [of Transportation] or the public.\" The report was conducted at the request of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) after the panel investigating the Sept. 11 attacks, officially known as the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, complained that the FAA had been less than forthcoming in turning over documents and issued a subpoena to the agency for more information. The FAA said it was cooperating fully with the 9/11 panel. The agency said it took disciplinary action against the employee who destroyed the tape but declined to elaborate on what kind of action they took. [Earlier, an FAA official incorrectly stated that the agency took action against two employees in the case.] \"We believe the audiotape in question appears to be consistent with written statements and other materials provided to FBI investigators and would not have added in any significant way to the information contained in what has already been provided to investigators and members of the 9/11 commission,\" said FAA spokesman Greg Martin. Hours after the hijacked planes flew into the World Trade Center Towers, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, an FAA manager at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center gathered six controllers who communicated or tracked two of the hijacked planes and recorded in a one-hour interview their personal accounts of what occurred, the report stated. The manager, who is not named in the report, said that his intentions were to provide quick information to federal officials investigating the attack before the air traffic controllers involved took sick leave for the stress of their experiences, as is common practice. According to the report, a second manager at the New York center promised a union official representing the controllers that he would \"get rid of\" the tape after controllers used it to provide written statements to federal officials about the events of the day. Instead, the second manager said he destroyed the tape between December 2001 and January 2002 by crushing the tape with his hand, cutting it into small pieces and depositing the pieces into", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__040506post-faa-tape-destroyed.txt:0:9d81ff7226db", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8335, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__040506post-faa-tape-destroyed.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__040506post-faa-tape-destroyed", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "as is common practice.

Instead, the second manager said he destroyed the tape between December 2001 and January 2002 by crushing the tape with his hand, cutting it into small pieces and depositing the pieces into trash cans around the building, the report said. The tape's existence was never made known to federal officials investigating the attack, nor to FAA officials in Washington. Staff members of the 9/11 panel found out about the tape during interviews with some controllers who participated in the recording. One controller said she asked to listen to the tape in order to prepare her written account of her experience, but one of the managers denied her request. The New York managers acknowledged that they received an e-mail from FAA officials instructing them to retain all materials related to the Sept. 11 attacks. \"If a question arises whether or not you should retain the data, RETAIN IT,\" the report quoted the e-mail as saying. But the managers decided not to include the tape in a November 2001 \"Formal Accident Package\" report the office prepared because one manager said he did not want to break his word to the union official and he did not think the tape should ever have been made. The inspector general concluded today that the managers' actions resulted in the loss of potential evidence that would allow the 9/11 commission to compare controllers' recollection of the events immediately after the attacks with the written statements prepared three weeks later. \"The destruction of evidence in the Government's possession, in this case an audiotape -- particularly during times of national crisis -- has the effect of fostering an appearance that information is being withheld from the public.\" **Special Note:** For lots more reliable, verifiable information suggesting a major cover-up of 9/11, [click here](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911information).

This self-perpetuating and privately funded group of lobbyists and lawyers has recently opined on hurricanes, nuclear weapons, the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel and even the New York subway system. Now it offers yet another \"report card\" on the progress of the FBI and CIA in the war against terrorism, along with its \"back-seat\" take and some further unsolicited narrative about how things ought to be on the \"front lines.\" Yet this is also a good time for the country to make some assessments of the 9/11 Commission itself. Recent revelations from the military intelligence operation code-named \"Able Danger\" have cast light on a missed opportunity that could have potentially prevented 9/11. Specifically, Able Danger concluded in February 2000 that military experts had identified Mohamed Atta by name (and maybe photograph) as an al Qaeda agent operating in the U.S. Subsequently, military officers assigned to Able Danger were prevented from sharing this critical information with FBI agents, even though appointments had been made to do so. Why? There are other questions that need answers. Was Able Danger intelligence provided to the 9/11 Commission prior to the finalization of its report, and, if so, why was it not explored? In sum, what did the 9/11 commissioners and their staff know about Able Danger and when did they know it? **The Able Danger intelligence, if confirmed, is undoubtedly the most relevant fact of the entire post-9/11 inquiry. **Even the most junior investigator would immediately know that the name and photo ID of Atta in 2000 is precisely the kind of tactical intelligence the FBI has many times employed to prevent attacks and arrest terrorists. **Yet the 9/11 Commission inexplicably concluded that it \"was not historically significant.\" This astounding conclusion--in combination with the failure to investigate Able Danger and incorporate it into its findings--raises serious challenges to the commission's credibility and, if the facts prove out, might just render the commission historically insignificant itself.** The facts relating to Able Danger finally started to be reported in mid-August.

Anthony Shaffer, a veteran intelligence officer, publicly revealed", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__051117_wsj_freeh_able_danger.txt:0:16ca7f53cf1b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8338, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__051117_wsj_freeh_able_danger.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__051117_wsj_freeh_able_danger", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "employed to prevent attacks and arrest terrorists. **Yet the 9/11 Commission inexplicably concluded that it \"was not historically significant.\" This astounding conclusion--in combination with the failure to investigate Able Danger and incorporate it into its findings--raises serious challenges to the commission's credibility and, if the facts prove out, might just render the commission historically insignificant itself.** The facts relating to Able Danger finally started to be reported in mid-August. U.S. Army Col. Anthony Shaffer, a veteran intelligence officer, publicly revealed that the Able Danger team had identified Atta and three other 9/11 hijackers by mid-2000 but were prevented by military lawyers from giving this information to the FBI. One week later, Navy Capt. Scott J. Phillpott, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who managed the program for the Pentagon's Special Operations Command, confirmed \"Atta was identified by Able Danger by January-February of 2000.\" On Aug. 18, 2005, the Pentagon initially stated that \"a probe\" had found nothing to back up Col. Shaffer's claims. Two weeks later, however, Defense Department officials acknowledged that its \"inquiry\" had found \"three more people who recall seeing an intelligence briefing slide that identified the ringleader of the 9/11 attacks a year before the hijackings and terrorist strikes.\" These same officials also stated that \"documents and electronic files created by . . . Able Danger were destroyed under standing orders that limit the military's use of intelligence gathered about people in the United States.\" Then in September 2005, the Pentagon doubled back and blocked several military officers from testifying at an open Congressional hearing about the Able Danger program. Two members of Congress, Curt Weldon and Dan Burton, have also publicly stated that shortly after the 9/11 attacks they provided then-Deputy National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley with a \"chart\" containing preattack information collected by Able Danger about al Qaeda. A spokesperson for the White House has confirmed that Mr. Hadley \"recalled seeing such a chart in that time period but . . . did not recall whether he saw it during a meeting . . . and that a search of National Security Council files had failed to produce such a chart.\" Thomas Kean, the chairman of the 9/11 Commission, reacted to Able Danger with the standard Washington PR approach. He lashed out at the Bush administration and demanded that the Pentagon conduct an \"investigation\" to evaluate the \"credibility\" of Col. Shaffer and Capt. Phillpott--rather than demand a substantive investigation into what failed in the first place. This from a former New Jersey governor who, along with other commissioners, routinely appeared in public espousing his own conclusions about 9/11 long before the commission's inquiry was completed and long before all the facts were in! This while dismissing out of hand the major conflicts of interest on the commission itself about obstructions to information-sharing within the intelligence community! Nevertheless, the final 9/11 Commission report, released on July 22,", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_summary_articles__051117_wsj_freeh_able_danger.txt:1:20126ec54a53", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8339, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_summary_articles__051117_wsj_freeh_able_danger.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_summary_articles__051117_wsj_freeh_able_danger", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "a substantive investigation into what failed in the first place.

This while dismissing out of hand the major conflicts of interest on the commission itself about obstructions to information-sharing within the intelligence community! Nevertheless, the final 9/11 Commission report, released on July 22, 2004, concluded that \"American intelligence agencies were unaware of Mr. Atta until the day of the attacks.\" This now looks to be embarrassingly wrong. Yet amazingly, commission leaders acknowledged on Aug. 12 that their staff in fact met with a Navy officer 10 days before releasing the report, who \"asserted that a highly classified intelligence operation, Able Danger, had identified Mohammed Atta to be a member of an al Qaeda cell located in Brooklyn.\" (Capt. Phillpott says he briefed them in July 2004.) The commission's statement goes on to say that the staff determined that \"the officer's account was not sufficiently reliable to warrant revision of the report or further investigation,\" and that the intelligence operation \"did not turn out to be historically significant,\" despite substantial corroboration from other seasoned intelligence officers. This dismissive and apparently unsupported conclusion would have us believe that a key piece of evidence was summarily rejected in less than 10 days without serious investigation. The commission, at the very least, should have interviewed the 80 members of Able Danger, as the Pentagon did, five of whom say they saw \"the chart.\" But this would have required admitting that the late-breaking news was inconveniently raised. So it was grossly neglected and branded as insignificant. Such a half-baked conclusion, drawn in only 10 days without any real investigation, simply ignores what looks like substantial direct evidence to the contrary coming from our own trained military intelligence officers. No wonder the 9/11 families were outraged by these revelations and called for a \"new\" commission to investigate. \"I'm angry that my son's death could have been prevented,\" seethed Diane Horning, whose son Matthew was killed at the World Trade Center. On Aug. 17, 2005, a coalition of family members known as the September 11 Advocates rightly blasted 9/11 Commission leaders Mr. Kean and Lee Hamilton for pooh-poohing Able Danger's findings as not \"historically significant.\" Advocate Mindy Kleinberg aptly notes, \"They [the 9/11 Commission] somehow made a determination that this was not important enough. To me, that says somebody there is not using good judgment. And if I'm questioning the judgment of this one case, what other things might they have missed?\" This is a stinging indictment of the commission by the 9/11 families. The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter, has led the way in cleaning up the 9/11 Commission's unfinished business.

The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter, has led the way in cleaning up the 9/11 Commission's unfinished business. Amid a very full plate of responsibilities, he conducted a hearing after noting that Col. Shaffer and Capt. Phillpott \"appear to have credibility.\" Himself a former prosecutor, Mr. Specter noted: \"If Mr. Atta and other 9/11 terrorists were identified before the attacks, it would be a very serious breach not to have that information passed along . . . we ought to get to the bottom of it.\" Indeed we should. The 9/11 Commission gets an \"I\" grade--incomplete--for its dereliction regarding Able Danger. The Joint Intelligence Committees should reconvene and, in addition to Able Danger team members, we should have the 9/11 commissioners appear as witnesses so the families can hear their explanation why this doesn't matter. *Mr. Freeh, a former FBI director, is the author of \"My FBI\" (St. Martin's, 2005).* FAIR USE NOTICE: This site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

I also helped to find three other prominent signers. You likely know that recently Van Jones, one of Obama's advisors, was [pressured into resigning](http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/09/06/obama.adviser.resigns/index.html) largely because he signed that 9/11 truth petition.

A salon.com reporter tried to find others who felt similarly, yet found that almost all other signers they contacted (including me) \"expressed their full-fledged support for the petition.\" ([Story here](http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/09/11/truth_petition)) [911truth.org](http://911truth.org/) is the informative website which originally sponsored that petition. I am on their advisory board and very much appreciate this empowering organization of courageous, intelligent, level-headed individuals. The fact that their 9/11 truth petition finally made news headlines is a great sign. **Hard truths are at first usually ignored, then denied, and finally accepted as truth.** So we've moved past the ignore stage now into denial. I've copied the entire new 9/11 petition below and invite you all to sign it, so that we can move towards the final stage of acceptance as truth in this important movement. I also most highly recommend watching the revealing six-minute video clip of Charlie Sheen asking the U.S. president tough questions on 9/11.

Of the New York City residents, 66% called for a new probe of unanswered questions by Congress or the New York Attorney General. Since that time, multiple professional polling organizations have obtained similar [results](http://www.911blogger.com/node/20824) in polls conducted nationally and internationally. In 2004, 911truth.org assembled a list of notable Americans and family members of those who died who signed a [9/11 Statement](http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20041026093059633), calling for \"immediate public attention to unanswered questions that suggest that people within the current administration may indeed have deliberately allowed 9/11 to happen, perhaps as a pretext for war.\" On the eighth anniversary of 9/11, we find ourselves asking these same questions and encountering the same resistance to transparency. The ensuing wars have destroyed countless lives, our civil liberties (including habeas corpus) are in tatters, posse comitatus is history, and our economy lies essentially in ruin. Meanwhile, thousands of 9/11 [responders](http://www.fealgoodfoundation.com/) who rushed to stand with America in its time of need [are now sick](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2007/04/18/2007-04-18_the_awardwinning_editorials.html) -- many dying -- from the exposure to toxins at Ground Zero, receiving inadequate medical help or compensation in return. Because this issue is as relevant as the day we issued this Statement in 2004, we now offer again the opportunity to endorse this call for answers, and join with those who have already taken a stand. Within the last month, one of these original 12 questions has finally been answered: ***Why has Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator who claims to have knowledge of advance warnings, been publicly silenced with a gag order requested by Attorney General Ashcroft and granted by a Bush-appointed judge? *** [Only*now*do we know why](http://www.bradblog.com/?p=7374).

Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, as an intermediary. **The woman, Susan P. Lindauer, 40, was arrested Thursday morning by federal agents at her home in Takoma Park, Md.** Federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment that said she had repeatedly met with representatives of the Iraqi intelligence service starting in 1999 and that she had traveled to Baghdad in 2002 for meetings with Iraqi intelligence officials. Ms. Lindauer described herself as an antiwar activist and said she was innocent. The indictment said Ms. Lindauer delivered a letter early last year to a United States government official listing her access to and contacts with Saddam Hussein's government. Investigators said the official was Mr. Card, one of President Bush's closest associates. Ms. Lindauer [is] either a second cousin or a distant relative of Mr. Card. **Federal law enforcement officials said that despite Ms. Lindauer's extensive contacts with the Iraqis, there was little evidence to suggest that she had harmed national security by passing any sensitive", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_whistleblower_susan_lindauer.txt:0:d4c12865f44b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8349, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_whistleblower_susan_lindauer.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_whistleblower_susan_lindauer", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "Lindauer delivered a letter early last year to a United States government official listing her access to and contacts with Saddam Hussein's government.

Lindauer ... has traversed an unusual path in her 40 years, rejecting the politics of her father, a onetime Republican gubernatorial nominee in Alaska, and moving from job to job until her arrest yesterday on charges that she was paid by Iraqi intelligence agents before the U.S. invasion. **A Smith College graduate with a master's degree in public policy from the London School of Economics, she worked as a temporary business reporter with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in 1987 and then as an editorial writer at the Herald of Everett, Wash., for two years. The Herald is owned by The Washington Post Co.** She worked briefly as a researcher at U.S. News and World Report before becoming a press aide for a succession of Democrats in Congress. **Note:** This 9/11 whistleblower had an advanced degree from the London School of Economics, [described in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_School_of_Economics) as \"among the world's most selective universities.\" And though she had worked for top newspapers and was trusted by members of Congress, she was later painted as being crazy, possibly since age 7, by government prosecutors and psychologists. **Susan Lindauer's Mission To Baghdad** **August 29, 2004, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/magazine/susan-lindauer-s-mission-to-baghdad.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/magazine/susan-lindauer-s-mission-to-baghdad.html) On the morning of March 11, 2004, Susan Lindauer woke to find five F.B.I. agents at her front door. She was charged with having acted as an unregistered agent of Saddam Hussein's Iraqi government. Having grown up in a household in which public policy was frequently the stuff of dinner-table conversation ... Lindauer wanted to help change the world. The way she chose to do so, however, was not by signing petitions or marching in demonstrations, but by engaging in the kinds of clandestine encounters that you read about in spy novels -- meeting foreign diplomats, passing along secret messages and engaging in other activities that would eventually lead to her", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_whistleblower_susan_lindauer.txt:1:84dacf277c14", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8350, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_whistleblower_susan_lindauer.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_whistleblower_susan_lindauer", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "Hussein's Iraqi government.

The way she chose to do so, however, was not by signing petitions or marching in demonstrations, but by engaging in the kinds of clandestine encounters that you read about in spy novels -- meeting foreign diplomats, passing along secret messages and engaging in other activities that would eventually lead to her arrest. While Lindauer was not accused of espionage, as initial reports of her arrest suggested, the government did charge her with a serious crime, even if the charge itself may seem like a technicality. By failing to register herself formally as a lobbyist and by supposedly following instructions from Iraqi diplomats and intelligence agents at the United Nations, the government charged, Lindauer had been acting as ''an unregistered agent of a foreign government.\" Lindauer acknowledges that the meetings detailed in the federal indictment took place, but denies acting as an agent of Iraq or any other country. Her aim, as she explained it, was to function as ... an unofficial go-between who could help break the cycle of isolation, paranoia and suffering created by sanctions. \"U.S. intelligence knew what I was doing,'' she said. ''Everything that I did,'' she said, ''I was giving to the chief of staff of the White House.'' **[Dr. Richard Fuisz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Carl_Fuisz) [is] a globe-trotting Virginia-based businessman whom Lindauer described ... as ''my contact in the C.I.A..'' **Citing unnamed sources, *The Sunday Herald*, a Scottish newspaper, reported in 2000 that Fuisz had been the C.I.A.'s most important agent in Damascus during the 80's. ''This is not an issue I can confirm or deny,'' Fuisz told *The Herald*. ''I am not allowed to speak about these issues. In fact, I can't even explain why I can't speak about these issues.'' Fuisz confirmed that he saw Lindauer about once a week on average between 1994 and 2001. **John Lindauer [is Lindauer's] younger brother. One conversation John had with his sister in the summer of 2001 stuck in his mind. ''She goes, 'Listen, the gulf war isn't over. There are plans in effect right now. They will be raining down on us from the skies.''' His sister told him that Lower Manhattan would be destroyed.** ''And I was like, yeah, whatever,'' he continued. When he woke up six weeks later to the news that two planes had crashed into the twin towers ... he had a dislocating sense of having his reality replaced by Susan's strange world. Parke Godfrey, a close friend of Lindauer's for the last 15 years, is a professor of computer science at York University in Ontario. He says that Lindauer warned him not to take a job at N.Y.U. the summer before the Sept. 11 attacks. **Note:** Though the entire, long article at the link above", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__9-11_whistleblower_susan_lindauer.txt:2:d08af0017dd9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8351, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__9-11_whistleblower_susan_lindauer.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__9-11_whistleblower_susan_lindauer", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "to the news that two planes had crashed into the twin towers ... he had a dislocating sense of having his reality replaced by Susan's strange world.

Prosecutors said she met with Iraqi intelligence officers at places in Baghdad, including Al Rashid Hotel, in 2002, where she accepted $5,000 in cash. One doctor found that Ms. Lindauer had a history of psychotic episodes going back to her childhood, possibly at the age of 7. **Note:** This article paints Susan Lindauer as being quite crazy, and having been so possibly since age seven. Yet clearly, she had enough sense to cause the government to want to put her in prison for her activities trying to make peace between the U.S. and certain Arab countries. **Woman Accused of Iraq Ties Is Ruled Unfit for Trial Again ** **September 16, 2008, *New York Times*** [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/nyregion/17lindauer.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/nyregion/17lindauer.html) A federal judge in Manhattan has ruled that Susan P. Lindauer, a former journalist and Congressional aide who was accused of working with Iraqi intelligence before the war, is still mentally incompetent to stand trial. **Ms. Lindauer, who had been declared incompetent for trial by Judge Michael B. Mukasey, now the United States attorney general, tried to persuade a different judge that she was now competent. But the second judge, Loretta A. Preska [ruled] that while Ms. Lindauer was \"highly intelligent\" and \"generally capable of functioning at a high level in many ways,\" she also was suffering from a mental disease or defect.** Ms. Lindauer, 45, pleaded not guilty to the charges against her.

Ms. Lindauer ... said by phone on Tuesday: \"The right to a trial is fundamental in a democracy. I have been fighting for a trial because I am innocent and I believe I have the right to prove my innocence.\" Judge Preska, in her ruling, said that Ms. Lindauer generally understood the roles of jurors, prosecutors, defense lawyers and judges, but did not seem to have a \"rational understanding of the roles\" they played in her case. **Note:** How interesting that the first judge in Lindauer's, Michael Mukasey, case ended up becoming the U.S. attorney general. Mukasey also [defended Larry Silverstein](http://www.nysun.com/new-york/as-judge-leaves-for-law-firm-his-legacy-is/36714/), owner of the lease on the World Trade Centers, in his claims for [double insurance payments](https://www.WantToKnow.info/030216nytimes) of $7 billion on the attacks. Now according to the second judge, Loretta Preska, she is \"highly intelligent\" yet incapable of understanding the roles of those involved in a trail. Hmmmm. Watch [the video of her](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=GxJTwbHdH6k), you will likely agree that something is fishy here. **Case dropped against aide accused of helping Iraq** **January 16, 2009, Fox News/Associated Press** [http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2009Jan16/0,4670,IraqSpyCase,00.html](http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2009Jan16/0,4670,IraqSpyCase,00.html) The government has quietly dropped its case against a former congressional aide accused of helping an Iraqi spy agency but later ruled mentally unfit for trial. But Susan Lindauer said she won't go away quietly. [She] vowed to sue, saying she was falsely arrested and prosecuted. \"I am furious. I am going to be filing a civil lawsuit seeking punitive damages,\" Lindauer said Friday. Prosecutors said in court papers filed Thursday that prosecuting Lindauer would no longer be in the interests of justice. During a hearing last year, psychiatrist Stuart Kleinman, who examined Lindauer at prosecutors' request, said Lindauer has a serious, long-standing mental disorder that includes grandiose delusions. **She had been jailed for about a year but released from custody in 2006 after another judge ruled the government could not force her to be medicated for her delusions so she could stand trial.** Lindauer said she helped provide information for years to the U.S. government about Iraq and Libya. She said she was prosecuted in retaliation for opposing the invasion of Iraq. **Case Dropped Against Md.

We think they're going to fly the airplanes into the World Trade Center.** And we want the Iraqis to provide any 'actionable intelligence.'

There are many important questions which the official government report by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) failed to answer on the collapse of this 47-story skyscraper at 5:20 PM on September 11, 2001. Can 3,000 architects and engineers all be wrong? These concerned professionals have created an eye-opening website filled with reliable information which examines the WTC 7 collapse. They conclude beyond any reasonable doubt that it must have been a controlled demolition. They have also found many problems with the official story on the collapse of the main two World Trade Center towers. [Click here](http://www.ae911truth.org) for this information-packed website. **Of particular interest is an excellent 15-minute video examining the WTC 7 collapse with input from highly respected architects and engineers with scientific understanding of what happened on that fateful day.** Narrated by past president of the Screen Actors Guild Ed Asner, this compelling documentary explains in laymen's terms how planned demolition is carried out, and how it is virtually impossible that WTC Building 7 collapsed because of office fires, as claimed in the official NIST report.

Yet the investigation results are being kept secret. **Collateral Damage: U.S. Covert Operations and the Terrorist Attacks on 9/11** The September 11th attacks were likely meant as a cover-up for financial crimes being investigated by the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), whose offices in the Pentagon were destroyed on September 11th. [1] **The attacks ... were intended to cover-up the clearing of $240 billion dollars in securities covertly created in September 1991 to fund a covert economic war against the Soviet Union, during which 'unknown' western investors bought up much of the Soviet industry, with a focus on oil and gas.** The 9/11 attacks also served to derail multiple Federal investigations of crimes associated with the 1991 covert operation. Hundreds of billions of dollars of government securities had to be destroyed. A critical mass of brokers from the major government security brokerages in the Twin Towers had to be eliminated to create chaos in the government securities market. A situation needed to be created wherein $240 billion dollars of covert securities could be [electronically \"cleared\"](https://www.WantToKnow.info/011218reuters) without anyone asking questions - which happened when the Federal Reserve declared an emergency and invoked its \"emergency powers\" that very afternoon.

Cantor Fitzgerald was the largest securities dealer in the US [7] and arguably the primary target. [8] 41% of the fatalities in the Twin Towers came from Cantor Fitzgerald and Eurobrokers.

[19] ** **The Origins of the World Trade Center Attack** Emboldened by the lack of consequences for subverting the U.S. constitution and breaking international law during the [Iran-Contra scandal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair) of the 1980s, a Bush administration group known as \"the Vulcans\" planned a bigger drive to crush Communism once and for all. They waged war against the Soviet Union and Iraq under George H.W. Bush, and against Iraq and Afghanistan under George W. Bush. Belonging to this group were Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Armitage, and Condoleezza Rice. [31] **The Vulcan's drive to bring an end to the Cold War was fueled by a covert war chest invisible to congressional oversight. [32] This war chest would be known by several names: Black Eagle Trust, the Marcos gold, Yamashita's Gold, the Golden Lily Treasure, the Durham Trust or Project Hammer.** [33] The program also seems to have lined the pockets of the individuals that executed this policy. This was done to the tune of a staggering $240 billion dollars in covert and allegedly illegal bonds, which appear to have been replaced with Treasury notes backed by U.S. taxpayers in the aftermath of September 11. The covert securities used to accomplish the national security objective of ending the Cold War ended up in the vaults of the brokers in the World Trade Center, and were destroyed on September 11, 2001. [36] **They came due for settlement and clearing on September 12. The federal Agency investigating these bonds - The Office of Naval Intelligence - was in the section of the Pentagon that was destroyed on 9/11.** [37] **To this key group of senior National Security officials called the Vulcans, who had participated in the victory of the economic cold war in 1991, the WTC, the Pentagon, the four airliners and their occupants would became 'collateral' damage in the ending of the Cold War.

Numerous sources have documented that at the end of WWII, the treasury of the Japanese Empire was discovered in the Philippines by a staff member of General Charles Willoughby, [Edward Lansdale], who was General MacArthur's chief of Intelligence. Then known as the [Golden Lily Treasure](http://www.voltairenet.org/article30068.html), this mass of wealth had been accumulated by the Japanese through over fifty years of pillaging by its army in Southeast Asia and China. It was deposited in the Philippines due to the U.S. submarine blockade of Japan. Reports vary, but **documents in the public domain suggest the recovered treasure was in excess of 280,000 metric tonnes of gold, not including jewels and diamonds.** [40] After the War [Lansdale] tortured Major Kojima Kashii - General Yamashita Tomoyuki's driver - until he revealed and created a map of the gold sites. [41] Lansdale briefed Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy about the findings, and **a U.S. Cabinet level decision was made to confiscate the gold and cover-up its discovery. The gold would be added to the Black Eagle Trust fund. **It was McCloy, along with Secretary of the Navy Robert B. Anderson and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson who created the [Black Eagle Trust](http://www.amazon.com/Gold-Warriors-Americas-Recovery-Yamashitas/dp/1844675319/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1306912800&sr=8-1). [42] [John McCloy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._McCloy), who had shared a box at the 1936 Olympics with Adolph Hitler, went on to become President of the World Bank. [Robert Anderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_B._Anderson) would go on to operate the Commercial Exchange Bank in the British West Indies, be convicted of running [illegal banking operations and tax evasion](http://articles.latimes.com/1987-03-27/business/fi-127_1_tax-evasion), and be sentenced to prison. [43] A fourth member of that group - [William 'Wild Bill' Donovan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Joseph_Donovan) - would go on to found the CIA and distribute the gold to key banks represented by his staffers. The trust they created takes its name from the Nazi Black Eagle stamped on the gold bars of the Third Reich. Gold bullion confiscated from the Reich and not returned to its rightful owners and their heirs was the original source of funding for this trust. [44] Over the years, the significance of the Nazi gold would pale in comparison to the confiscated Japanese treasure.

The financial institutions represented by these individuals would become the major financial banks in the world, along with the Swiss-German banks they hid their gold in. **The Yamashita gold would become the cornerstone of the Black Eagle Fund, from which many covert operations of the U.S. intelligence would be funded.** [58] Lansdale's operation in the Philippines gave birth to most of the common features of modern covert operations for U.S. Intelligence: bribery, theft, torture, and [false flag operations](https://www.WantToKnow.info/falseflag). It would be Lansdale who would initiate a bond between the US intelligence organizations and Israeli intelligence. It would be Lansdale that would set precedents for the Intelligence community to retain the services of organized crime on U.S. soil. Lansdale would hire American Mafia family heads Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante, Meyer Lansky, and Lucky Luciano in the U.S. war against Fidel Castro in 1961. It would be Lansdale's team that would propose and justify sacrificing innocent U.S. civilians in order to rally the American citizenry to support an invasion of foreign soil. This was done under a program run by Brigadier General William H. Craig, who reported to Lansdale for the Cuba project. [61] This project was called Operation Northwoods. Documents for this project would be accidentally released from the files of Robert McNamara into the public domain some 40 years later, exposing the degree to which Lansdale's operatives would go to wage war. [62] These [declassified documents](https://www.WantToKnow.info/010501operationnorthwoods) revealed secret plans of the U.S. military to wage a fabricated \"terror\" campaign against US citizens as a pretext to justify a second invasion of Cuba. [Barrick Gold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrick_Gold) would become an investment for nearly every gold bullion bank associated with the Marcos gold recovery. These banks would loan gold to Barrick, which would then sell the borrowed gold as derivatives, with the promise of replacing the borrowed gold with their gold mining operation. The records of many of those transactions disappeared when Enron collapsed and the trading operation and all its records were taken over by UBS, another major recipient of Marcos gold. The FBI was reportedly conducting an investigation into those transactions, and the investigation files were kept on the 23rd floor of the North Tower of the WTC.

A review of the personal accounts of September 11 now suggests that office was deliberately targeted with explosives prior to the collapse of the WTC towers. [73] **Taking Control** **In November 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected to the White House. Sixty-nine days after the inauguration, John Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Reagan. Eight days prior to that attempt, there were a series of unprecedented policy changes that put George Bush in charge of Foreign Policy and National Security.** That conferred new roles and powers on Bush, including \"unprecedented powers for a vice president.\" [85] Vice President George Bush was named the leader of the United States \"crisis management'' staff, as a part of the National Security Council system. [86] Then, on March 30, 1981, just eight days after these powers were conferred on Bush, President Reagan was shot. **The [father of the assassin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hinckley,_Jr.) that put Bush in power was John (a.k.a. Jack) Hinckley, Sr., the owner of Vanderbilt Oil.** Hinckley had been giving maximum donations every year to George H.W. Bush since he started running for Congress. In *[The Black Hole of Guyana: The Untold Story of the Jonestown Massacre](http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/JohnJudge/Jonestown.html)*, John Judge painstakingly documents that Jonestown was a CIA operation for converting dispossessed and lonely refugees [into assassins](https://www.WantToKnow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse). In an operation that was falling under Congressional investigation, the evidence had to be eliminated - and nearly all the inhabitants were murdered to prevent disclosure. [88] A key player in the Marcos gold would be Banker's Trust, which was taken over by Alex Brown & Sons, after Banker's Trust floundered financially on its Russian loans in the mid 1990s. These Russian loans were facilitated by Enron, starting in August of 1993, and very possibly were part of the Project Hammer takeover of Soviet industry. Alex Brown's involvement would bring to the forefront the names of three names of individuals who would play multiple roles in this mystery: Buzz Krongard, Mayo Shattuck, and J Carter Beese. [Buzz Krongard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._B._Krongard) is reported as the mentor of Beese and Shattuck from their years together at Alex Brown. Additionally, he managed the merger between Bankers Trust and Deutschebank Alex Brown. Bankers Trust, Zurich was a key Marcos gold holder. Krongard would move on to become Chairman of the investment bank A.B. Brown, Vice Chairman of Banker's Trust, and Executive Director of the CIA at the time of September 11. [Mayo Shattuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_A._Shattuck_III) would be reported to be the personal banker for Adnan Khashoggi and Edgar Bronfmann during their partnership at Barrick Gold.

[107] He would move on to become the CEO of Deutschebank who would resign for unexplained reasons the day after September 11, and would not be at the WTC office that day when the tower collapsed. It was his bank that was identified as the source of the [illegal stock options](https://www.WantToKnow.info/9-11timeline60pg#options) that indicated there was insider trading taking advantage of the September 11 tragedy. **What happened to the Marcos gold after it was confiscated by U.S. agents in 1986 has never been reported, but throughout the early 1990s, the world gold market would be befuddled by the mysterious appearance of thousands of tonnes of gold which appeared to suppress the price of gold.** In preparation for their war against Communism, and in the years leading up to the failed - or faux - coup of 1991 which initiated the last days of Gorbachev and the rise of Yeltsin, Bush and a cadre of rogue KGB officials built a complex international network of banks and holding companies that would be used to take over ownership of the Soviet economy. Over 300 of these KGB turncoats who supported this operation would later be re-located to the US in the early 1990s and pensioned. [111] Periodic CIA reports to Congress would review KGB and organized crime complicity in the takeover of Russia by criminal elements, but all mention of the formidable role of the U.S. would be expunged from Congressional oversight and the public record. [112] In the first phase of the economic attack on the Soviet Union, George Bush authorized [Leo Wanta](https://web.archive.org/web/20120121100627/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Wanta) and others to destabilize the ruble and facilitate the theft of the Soviet/Russian treasury. This would result in draining the Russian treasury of between 2,000 to 3,000 tonnes of gold bullion, ($35 billion at the time). [113] The gold was 'stolen' in March of 1991, facilitated by Leo Wanta and signed off by Boris Yeltsin's right hand man. The majority of the leaked reports from the CIA and FBI suggest the theft of the Russian treasury was a KGB and Communist party operation, but what those reports omitted was the extensive involvement of Boris Yeltsin, the U.S. banking industry and the CIA. In the second phase, Wanta, George Soros and a group of Bush appointees would begin to destabilize the ruble. There were two major operations: the largest was coordinated by Alan Greenspan and Oliver North, and implemented by Leo Wanta. **The 9/11 Cover-up and the Black Eagle Trust** With an understanding of the economic war being waged on the Soviet Union, the focus needs to turn to", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__black_eagle_trust_fund.txt:6:c929acd026da", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8384, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__black_eagle_trust_fund.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__black_eagle_trust_fund", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "was the extensive involvement of Boris Yeltsin, the U.S. banking industry and the CIA.

There were two major operations: the largest was coordinated by Alan Greenspan and Oliver North, and implemented by Leo Wanta. **The 9/11 Cover-up and the Black Eagle Trust** With an understanding of the economic war being waged on the Soviet Union, the focus needs to turn to reports that on September 11, 1991, President George Bush was responsible for issuing $240 billion dollars in secretive bonds as a part of this attack on the Russian ruble. There are six lines of evidence from eight sources that suggest this was indeed the case. Many of these instances are corroborated with documents available on the Internet, presented by those making the claims. [174] **The bonds sat for ten years, like a ticking time bomb. They had to be settled - or cashed in by September 12, 2001. The two firms in the U.S. most likely to be handling them would be Cantor Fitzgerald and Eurobrokers - the two largest government securities firms in the U.S. The federal agency mostly involved in investigating those transactions was the Office of Naval Intelligence. On 9/11, those same three organizations: the two largest government securities brokers and the Office of Naval Intelligence in the US took direct hits.** What happened inside the buildings of the World Trade on September 11 is difficult, but not impossible to discern. The government has put a seal on the testimony gathered by the investigating 911 Commission, and instructed government employees to not speak on the matter or suffer severe penalties, but there are a number of personal testimonies posted on the Internet as to what happened in those buildings that day. Careful reconstruction from those testimonies indicates the deliberate destruction of evidence not only by a targeted assault on the buildings, but also by targeted fires and explosions. **In the event that either the hijacking failed, or the buildings were not brought down, the evidence would be destroyed by fires.** In addition to the investigative evidence being destroyed, the Federal Register reported that the physical securities held by the brokers in their vaults had been destroyed. What would be even more revealing would be the actions of the Federal Reserve Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission on that day, and in the immediate aftermath. As one of many coincidences on 9/11, the Federal Reserve Bank was operating its information system from its remote back-up site rather than it's downtown headquarters. The SEC and Federal Reserve system remained unfazed by the attack. All of their systems continued to operate. The two major security trading firms had their trade data backed up on remote systems. Nevertheless, the Commission for the first time invoked its emergency powers under Securities", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__black_eagle_trust_fund.txt:7:0a4b887021e8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8385, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__black_eagle_trust_fund.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__black_eagle_trust_fund", "chunk_index": 8, "text": "on that day, and in the immediate aftermath.

The SEC and Federal Reserve system remained unfazed by the attack. All of their systems continued to operate. The two major security trading firms had their trade data backed up on remote systems. Nevertheless, the Commission for the first time invoked its emergency powers under Securities Exchange Act Section 12(k) and issued several orders to ease certain regulatory restrictions temporarily. **The Federal Reserve Suspends the Rules** On the first day of the crisis, the SEC lifted \"[Rule 15c3-3](https://web.archive.org/web/20110410222803/http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34ActRls/rule15c3-3.html): Customer Protection - Reserves and Custody of Securities.\" Thus GSCC [Government Securities Clearing Corporation] was thus allowed to substitute other securities for the physical securities destroyed during the attack. \"...collateral substitutions can and should be made with regard to immediately maturing collateral.\" [191] At this point in time, **the Federal Reserve and its GSCC had created a settlement environment totally void of controls and reporting - where it could substitute valid, new government securities for the mature, illegal securities, and not have to record where the original bad securities had come from, or where the new securities went** - all because the paper for the primary brokers for US securities had been eliminated. A review of the explanations for the actions of the Federal Reserve after September 11th exposes an amazingly complex web of analysis and speculation. The reports published by the Federal Reserve argue that the Federal Reserve's actions increasing the monetary supply by over $300 billion were justified to overcome operational difficulties in the financial sector. While impressive as the reports are, what is noted by the casual reader is that all of the Federal Reserve analysis is speculative and suggestive, using phraseology such as \"may have,\" \"likely,\" \"presumably,\" or \"should have.\" There are few - if any - definitive statements about root cause and the appropriateness of the Federal Reserve response. While the Fed was reporting outstanding account balances of over $100 billion per day (while not identifying the banks involved), the *Wall Street Journal* reported that at one point during the week after 9/11, BoNY was publicly reported to be overdue on $100 billion in payments. [198] The Deutschebank, which sat inside the WTC and was totally decimated, reported no such account balance increase, and JP Morgan, the other of only two clearing banks which uses the same traders and communications hub, reported no such increase in its account balance. **No one has publicly asked: why is it that these other two banks were not seriously disrupted, while the Bank of New York - which had no structural damage - seemed unable to operate?** Certain key unknown figures in the Federal Reserve may have 'conspired' with key unknown figures at the Bank of New", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__black_eagle_trust_fund.txt:8:9622e7622cd4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8386, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__black_eagle_trust_fund.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__black_eagle_trust_fund", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "and JP Morgan, the other of only two clearing banks which uses the same traders and communications hub, reported no such increase in its account balance. **No one has publicly asked: why is it that these other two banks were not seriously disrupted, while the Bank of New York - which had no structural damage - seemed unable to operate?** Certain key unknown figures in the Federal Reserve may have 'conspired' with key unknown figures at the Bank of New York to create a situation where $240 billion in off balance sheet securities created in 1991 as part of an official covert operation to overthrow the Soviet Union, could be cleared without publicly acknowledging their existence. These securities, originally managed by Cantor Fitzgerald, were cleared and settled in the aftermath of September 11th through the BoNY. The $100 billion account balance bubble reported by the *Wall Street Journal* as being experienced in the BoNY was tip of a three day operation, when these securities were moved from off-balance-sheet to the balance sheet. [As reported on page 12 of a [Federal Reserve document](http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/epr/02v08n2/0211flem.html)] \"In the absence of complete information on deliveries into and out of its account at BoNY on September 11, and as a result of its assumption of settlement fails on the starting legs of blind-brokered RPs, GSCC recorded (after the close of business on September 11) $266 billion in transactions that apparently failed to settle.... Continuing connectivity problems prevented GSCC from giving BoNY delivery instructions after the close of business on September 11 and prevented it from acquiring information on activity in its account at BoNY during the day on September 12. Consequently, GSCC recorded $440 billion in settlement fails as of the close of business on September 12.\" [201] What appears to be the case is that the Federal Reserve imbalances reported on three consecutive days in the aftermath were largely concentrated at the Bank of New York, which is reported to represent over 90% of the imbalance, suggesting the Bank had been the recipient of massive fund transfers, and unable to send out transfers. Overall transactions for the day of 9/11 were seemingly down even more significantly than volume, but the transactions that came in after closing were extremely large, averaging in size in packages of $35 million or more. This would be consistent with a hypothesis that $240 billion of securities were being pushed surreptitiously into the money supply. **The Federal Reserve, without providing the detail required to substantiate it's claims, would have the public believe that there were widespread liquidity issues, when in fact the issues were very concentrated primarily, if not singularly, in the BoNY, which has been the subject of an ongoing major [money-laundering investigation](http://money.cnn.com/1999/08/19/worldbiz/crime_a/) for many years. **These account balance issues resulted in the defacto expansion of the monetary supply, details of which are no longer reported by the Federal Reserve.", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911__black_eagle_trust_fund.txt:9:d055554f8b7f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8387, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911__black_eagle_trust_fund.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911__black_eagle_trust_fund", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "into the money supply. **The Federal Reserve, without providing the detail required to substantiate it's claims, would have the public believe that there were widespread liquidity issues, when in fact the issues were very concentrated primarily, if not singularly, in the BoNY, which has been the subject of an ongoing major [money-laundering investigation](http://money.cnn.com/1999/08/19/worldbiz/crime_a/) for many years. **These account balance issues resulted in the defacto expansion of the monetary supply, details of which are no longer reported by the Federal Reserve. The reported cause of this market malfunction is seemingly suspect. By comparison, the Deutschebank which sat inside the World Trade Center reported no such account balance increase, and JP Morgan, the other of two clearing banks which uses the same traders and communications hub, reported no such increase in account balance. Additionally, while problems were being documented between the BoNY and GCSS, no other institution had those problems. There is a contention that at the core of the September 11th attack, someone was planning to cover the 1991 issuance of $240 billion in covert securities used to finance the collapse the Soviet Union. The facts surrounding the financial aftermath of September 11 suggest this is not only possible, but that reports describing the aftermath have deliberately been misleading. The US dollar money supply was significantly increased in the aftermath of 9/11; The bank at the core of the illegal money laundering by ex-Soviet criminals was the source of the increased money supply (BoNY); The generally disseminated rationale for BoNY's operational problems seems to have affected no other bank in a similar manner or magnitude and is inconsistent with reports on the BoNY operations in the aftermath; A key witness who might provide insight to these issues is a statistically aberrant death; The source of the BoNY's $330 billion increase in assets is cloaked under the privilege of \"private banking;\" The only alleged \"severe\" disruption to the financial systems was the Federal Reserves account balance and the securities trading fails - both systems required to hide the laundering of $240 billion in covert securities. This is not a 'proof' that $240 billion was laundered, but it provides probable cause for paying serious attention. **Conclusion** History has many interpretations, and this report has been just one of many - an interpretation pieced together from the bold admissions and revelations of insiders, whose stories have been ignored and suppressed by the major media organizations. **It is an interpretation of history that suggests a few determined men strove to change the world in defense of Western capitalism in ways which they felt needed to be hidden from the public.

Based largely on the excellent work of bestselling author and former ABC News investigative producer [James Bamford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bamford), *The Spy Factory* leaves no doubt that the NSA was following several of the alleged hijackers for many months before 9/11 and refused to share the vital information they gathered with the FBI or CIA. **Among the many other strange incidents presented is how starting in 1996, the NSA was able to listen in on all of Osama bin Laden's private phone conversations with Al Qaeda's headquarters in Yemen. ** As Bamford states towards the end of the documentary, \"the NSA had all the information it needed to stop the hijackers.\" James Bamford is the intrepid journalist who broke the story on [Operation Northwoods](https://www.wanttoknow.info/010501operationnorthwoods). He presented declassified documents on this top secret operation revealing that \"in the early 1960s, America's top military leaders reportedly drafted plans to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in U.S. cities to create public support for a war against Cuba\" (see [ABC News article here](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92662&page=1)). Though this shocking news was reported on ABC, no other major network picked up the story. The astonishing Northwoods documents show that the top Pentagon generals were willing to kill US civilians and falsely blame it on the Cubans as a ruse to get the American public to support war against Cuba. In the same fashion, could 9/11 have in some way been a means to get the US involved in a never-ending war in the Middle East? **In the beautifully produced, 52-minute PBS documentary *Spy Factory*, interviews with Bamford and numerous former officials of the NSA show that we are far from understanding all that happened on that fateful day.** To watch the full revealing video, click on this link: [**https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/911/spy-factory-pbs-nova**](https://www.personalgrowthcourses.net/video/911/spy-factory-pbs-nova) Among those calling for a new, impartial investigation of 9/11 are [50 government and military officials](https://www.wanttoknow.info/officialsquestion911commissionreport), over [3,000 architects and engineers](https://www.ae911truth.org/), over [100 professors](https://www.wanttoknow.info/070618professorsquestion911), [250 pilots and aviation officials](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225160328/http://patriotsquestion911.com/pilots.html), and [300 9/11 survivors and family members](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225160328/http://patriotsquestion911.com/survivors.html).

Tod Fletcher: Dedicated Advocate for 9/11 Truth** Dear friends, Most subscribers to this list will recognize the name Tod Fletcher from the [weekly news summaries](https://www.WantToKnow.info/medianewsarticles) we send out. I'm very sad to inform you that Tod is no longer with us. Though I found the news articles each week (with help from many supporters) and chose the ones to be summarized, Tod did the summarizing on these articles for many years. He did great work with [PEERS](https://www.peerservice.org/) and WantToKnow.info from 2007 until his recent death. He was also a dedicated researcher and advocate for bringing the truth out on the tragic events of 9/11. Tod's wife Susan had major struggles with severe chronic fatigue syndrome and numerous hypersensitivities for nearly three decades, to the point that she was bed-ridden much of that time. Her pain and suffering was such that she contemplated suicide several times. She even attempted it once about 10 years ago, saved only when Tod found her and rushed her to the emergency room. The two were very close, and Tod spent much of his time caring for her. Below is the letter I received in the from Tod on September 30th. It was dated Sept. 28, 2014. Dear Fred, Susan has reached the point at which she requires release, and as she can't effect this herself, I must help her, as I promised her long ago I would do. But helping her will make me a criminal in deed as well as thought, and I don't expect I'd be fairly or mercifully treated. So I am going to accompany Susan to the world beyond. By the time you read this, we will have made our passage. I am indeed sorry for the difficulties this will make for you. I never intended to give you little \"notice\" should I quit, but Susan's sudden worsening was beyond my control. I don't need, I imagine, to say what a great pleasure and privilege it was to work with you all these years. Nor to say, be happy for us, for we are at peace at last. Our love to you, Tod and Susan I was shocked to receive this letter. I made some calls to the authorities a couple hours after receiving it. They would not confirm any information other than to next of kin, but it became very clear in our conversations that the bodies had been found at Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, CA, about an hour north of San Francisco. What a sad and tragic ending to the lives of these two caring souls. Tod worked closely with [Prof. David Ray Griffin](https://www.WantToKnow.info/050504davidraygriffin), one of the most prominent voices in the 9/11 truth movement. I called Prof. Griffin the day after I received the above letter.

I called Prof. Griffin the day after I received the above letter. He was also greatly saddened by the news, particularly as Tod played an invaluable role in editing his soon-to-be-published book *[Unprecedented: Can Civilization Survive the CO2 Crisis](http://www.amazon.com/Unprecedented-Can-Civilization-Survive-Crisis/dp/0986076902/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412281481&sr=8-1&keywords=Unprecedented%3A+Can+Civilization+Survive+the+CO2+Crisis).* Tod was the chief editor of numerous books on 9/11 by Prof. Griffin and even stepped in for him to do interviews when Prof. Griffin was not available. Tod also wrote [an excellent summary](https://www.WantToKnow.info/911/david-ray-griffin-fletcher.pdf) of Prof. Griffin's 9/11 work. As a respected member of the 9/11 truth movement, Tod was on the [9/11 Consensus Panel](http://www.consensus911.org/911-consensus-panel-member-tod-fletcher-kpfa-interview-the-pentagon-attack-in-context/). He authored many articles about 9/11 and how it fit into the greater context of our world. Well before 9/11, he wrote articles about the ecological crisis and the anti-globalization movement. These can be found at the [Daily Battle website](http://www.dailybattle.pair.com) under either his name or under Max Kolskegg, Will Guest and I. Berg. These articles were informed by his background in physical geography, in which he was a graduate student. In years past, he taught at the University of California and several junior colleges. You can listen to Tod in [a recent interview](http://www.kpfa.org/archive/id/106255) on KPFA's Guns and Butter Program with Bonnie Faulkner, or in [a 2011 interview](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/resistanceradio/2010/11/18/911-in-context-with-tod-fletcher) with 9/11 whistleblower and former lab director [Kevin Ryan](http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/author/kevin-ryan/). He also worked with the [Journal of 9/11 Studies](http://www.journalof911studies.com/), where he co-authored in 2012 [an article](http://www.journalof911studies.com/resources/2012NovemberFletcherEastman.pdf) on the 9/11 Pentagon attack. He additionally contributed to the [globalresearch.ca](http://www.globalresearch.ca/) website, where you can read [a 2009 article](http://www.globalresearch.ca/osama-bin-laden-dead-or-alive/13743) he published, titled \"Osama Bin Laden: Dead Or Alive?\" Tod did all this in spite of the incredible constraints placed upon his time due to Susan's illness. Susan earned graduate degrees in English literature, and had taught classes at UC. Her own pursuits were short-circuited by her limiting health condition. Please join me in sending a heartfelt thank you to Tod for all his great work with PEERS and with many others. And let us send very best wishes to these two caring souls wherever they are.

One Man's Ad Campaign Says So** **By IAN URBINA** Published: November 8, 2004 WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 - The grainy 30-second commercials are eerie and cryptic, and they suggest a government cover-up of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. One implies that no plane flew into the Pentagon. The other suggests that 7 World Trade Center, which collapsed late in the afternoon that day, was detonated from within. The advertisements, which ran repeatedly here and in New York between Oct. 20 and Nov. 2 on several cable networks, including CNN, Fox News and ESPN, offer a Web site, an address and a phone number but give little indication who is behind them. The ads are the latest salvo from James W. Walter, a millionaire from Santa Barbara, Calif., who over the years has financed programs promoting voter registration in low-income neighborhoods and prison reform. Recently he has taken a growing interest in the investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks. The television commercials, as well as ads in magazines and newspapers, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Daily News, are part of a $3 million national campaign paid for by Mr. Walter in an effort to press for the reopening of the investigation by the independent Sept. 11 commission. \"It just isn't possible that 19 screw-ups with box cutters pulled this whole thing off,\" Mr. Walter said in a telephone interview Friday as he traveled from Florida to California by train. He has traveled by train since Sept. 11, 2001, he said, because he has been too scared to fly. \"We've never gotten solid answers on why Tower 7 collapsed when it was two full blocks away from where the planes hit,\" he said. \"We've also never received an answer for how such a large plane left such a small hole in the side of the Pentagon.\" The independent commission, which issued its final report in July, disputed some commonly held beliefs about the attacks", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911breakthrough.txt:0:90e409027f1d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8405, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911breakthrough.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911breakthrough", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "train since Sept. 11, 2001, he said, because he has been too scared to fly. \"We've never gotten solid answers on why Tower 7 collapsed when it was two full blocks away from where the planes hit,\" he said. \"We've also never received an answer for how such a large plane left such a small hole in the side of the Pentagon.\" The independent commission, which issued its final report in July, disputed some commonly held beliefs about the attacks but not the general conclusion, that 19 young terrorists hijacked planes and flew them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. For Mr. Walter, though, what started as a hunch about official negligence has blossomed into a full-blown conspiracy theory involving government officials looking for a pretext to send troops into Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr. Walter has tapped into a long tradition in which national tragedies - from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to the downing of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 - inflame the most feverish imaginations. But in New York, the ads may have found a particularly receptive audience. A Zogby poll of New Yorkers' opinions about the 9/11 investigation, released last month, indicated that 49 percent of New York City residents and 41 percent of New York state residents believed that some federal officials \"knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to act.\" The poll also found that 66 percent of New York City residents and 56 percent of state residents wanted a fuller investigation of the \"still unanswered questions.\" Using the poll findings to make their case, relatives of victims of the attacks and others skeptical of the commission's investigation have asked Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, to open an investigation into what they said were unanswered questions. Glenn P. Corbett, a professor of fire science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who is part of an investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center towers by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, said that he was not surprised by the lingering speculation about the attacks, but that there were clear answers to most questions raised by Mr. Walter's ad campaign. The hole left by the attack on the Pentagon was not bigger, Mr. Corbett said, because the wings were lighter than most other parts of the plane and probably disintegrated on impact with the ground and the building. The reason 7 World Trade Center collapsed straight down, he said, was most likely the large amounts of diesel fuel stored in the building's lower levels. The fuel was meant to power emergency generators. \"The conspiracy theorists fail to recognize that there was structural damage in Building 7 caused by flying debris after the first two towers collapsed,\" Mr. Corbett said. \"This led to fires that burned for", "chunk_id": "wtk_clean_text_final:911breakthrough.txt:1:ce9e619ea018", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 8406, "dataset": "wtk_clean_text_final", "filename": "911breakthrough.txt", "source_url": "", "publisher": "", "found_on": "", "title": "911breakthrough", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "plane and probably disintegrated on impact with the ground and the building.

David Kubiak, who lives in Kennebunkport, Maine, and runs a Web site called 911Truth.org. He said that not all doubters had gone as far as Mr. Walter in their conspiracy theories. Most people in his group, he said, including families of 9/11 victims, simply want more of an explanation why there were so many problems that day involving emergency communication and the chain of command. \"I guess I'm one of the few people with the wherewithal to push the issue,\" said Mr. Walter, who says he is worth about $7 million, most of which he inherited from his father's building materials company in Tampa, Fla. Besides making financial donations to various causes, Mr. Walter, 57, also founded Walden Three, a nonprofit group in Santa Barbara that researches futuristic ideas for environmentally friendly urban development. Much of his time, Mr. Walter said, is spent working on a science fiction novel that he hopes to publish to promote utopian visions for city planning. \"Sometimes Jimmy gets a little carried away with his own ideas,\" said Assia Mortensen, who works occasionally as an editor for Walden Three. \"But at root, he's an eccentric sweetheart with a lot of money and he shares it with a lot of important groups.\" Mr. Walter said he was no stranger to adversity, having overcome an addiction to cocaine. He also has Tourette's syndrome, he said. \"I have a hard time not speaking up when I see something that doesn't seem right,\" Mr. Walter said. \"I guess that is just the way I am.\" **Comments and Other Resources: **Visits to the website mentioned in the article, [www.911truth.org](http://www.911truth.org) have increased dramatically since the article came out.

We all know that you need to be within range of a cell phone tower in order to make cell phone calls. The new technology reported below sets up a beacon on planes allowing the use of cell phones. Yet, it is most interesting that all of the newspapers at the time of 9/11 reported multiple cell phone calls from the hijacked planes which could not have been within reach of a cell phone tower. Particularly on Flight 93, which crashed in the countryside of Pennsylvania, numerous calls were reported to have been made using cell phones, with at least one being a 30-minute call. How is this possible? Note the claim towards the end of the article: \"It was widely known that cell phones will sometimes work on jetliners. Some travelers use them surreptitiously. On Sept. 11, 2001, several passengers aboard hijacked airliners called loved ones.\" As far as I can tell, this is not at all a widely known fact. In my work as an interpreter, I have at times flown over 50,000 miles a year, yet have never seen or heard of someone making a cell phone call from a plane. Have any of you ever heard of this? Another unanswered question about 9/11. Please help spread the news.

After chatting with a telecom industry lobbyist for a few minutes, Jacobs pronounced the technology behind the airborne phone call a success, although adding that it will be improved over the next couple years.

After chatting with a telecom industry lobbyist for a few minutes, Jacobs pronounced the technology behind the airborne phone call a success, although adding that it will be improved over the next couple years. Jacobs and a group of reporters were aboard an American Airlines jetliner Thursday as it took off from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport for a demonstration of Qualcomm's cellular technology at 25,000 feet. The flight required special clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Communications Commission, which ban the use of electronic devices abroad planes because of fear they would interfere with navigation systems and cellular networks on the ground. \"It's pretty cool,\" said Monte Ford, American's top technology official. Ford said he called his wife, secretary and friends in Paris and Madrid and pronounced the quality of the links good, although he acknowledged the international connections weren't quite as good as domestic ones. Reporters were given phones with code division multiple access, or CDMA technology, and a few minutes to make and receive calls. Qualcomm commercialized the CDMA technology used in wireless network equipment and licenses system software to cell phone makers. Connections from the plane were generally good, although some calls were dropped. Sound quality was about the same as a regular cell call on the ground, other than the loud background noise on the MD-80 jet. There was a delay of about one second in the voice communications, like that encountered when using a satellite phone, which interfered with natural conversation. The delay was caused by the way voices are digitally transmitted in so-called packets from the airplane to the ground. Also, the caller could not hear the phone ringing on the other end, which caused at least one reporter to hang up while the person on the other end was shouting into the receiver. Jacobs said San Diego-based Qualcomm would spend the next two years testing whether electronic signals interfered with the jet's avionics system. He also said the technology would be improved and the one-second delay would be shortened. Eventually, air travelers should be able to make calls, download movies and do all sorts of other things with wireless devices aboard jetliners, he said. \"My guess is we will see the same kind of uses that you have with cell phones on the ground - maybe even more because you're confined to a seat for some time in a plane,\" Jacobs said. The cooperation between Qualcomm and American is not exclusive. Qualcomm is talking to other carriers around the world about testing CDMA phones on their jets, and American may talk to other telecommunications companies, officials said. Qualcomm's CDMA technology is one of a few standards used worldwide to convert voice into digital form for transmission over a wireless network.

Qualcomm's CDMA technology is one of a few standards used worldwide to convert voice into digital form for transmission over a wireless network. American would have an important advantage over competitors if it could become the first U.S. carrier to allow cell phone use on most of its planes, Ford said. Several years ago, American installed seatback phones, which could be used with a credit card, on many of its planes but ripped them out except in some Boeing 777s and 767s on international routes. \"People found those phones expensive to use and not necessarily convenient,\" Ford said. \"They waited to get on the ground to make calls with their cell phones.\" The seatback phones use FAA-approved technology that doesn't interfere with jet navigation systems. Airlines generally charge about $4 a minute plus a $4 access charge. Even before Thursday it was widely known that cell phones will sometimes work on jetliners. Some travelers use them surreptitiously. On Sept. 11, 2001, several passengers aboard hijacked airliners called loved ones. However, the FAA and the airlines ban them because they fear that the signals could interfere with navigational equipment. The FCC bans their use from planes because the signals reach many cell-phone towers and have been shown to disrupt cellular networks. A nonprofit aeronautics group, RTCA Inc., is working on recommendations to the FAA on guidelines for testing wireless devices. **What you can do:** Inform your media and political representatives of this vital information on 9/11 cell phone calls.
