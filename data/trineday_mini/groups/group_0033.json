What Could It Mean for Americans Health EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin provided few details about the rules and regulations under review but they include rules that set limits for pollutants like ozone particulate matter and volatile organic carbon that can harm human health You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Richard E Peltier Ph D The Trump administration announced on March 12 that it is reconsidering more than 30 air pollution regulations in a series of moves that could impact air quality across the U S Reconsideration is a term used to review or modify a government regulation While the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA administrator Lee Zeldin provided few details the breadth of the regulations being reconsidered affects all Americans They include rules that set limits for pollutants that can harm human health such as ozone particulate matter and volatile organic carbon Zeldin wrote that his deregulation moves would roll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden taxes on U S families But that s only part of the story What Zeldin didn t say is that the economic and health benefits from decades of federal clean air regulations have far outweighed their costs Some estimates suggest every 1 spent meeting clean air rules has returned 10 in health and economic benefits How far America has come because of regulations In the early 1970s thick smog blanketed American cities and acid rain stripped forests bare from the Northeast to the Midwest Air pollution wasn t just a nuisance it was a public health emergency But in the decades since the U S has engineered one of the most successful environmental turnarounds in history Thanks to stronger air quality regulations pollution levels have plummeted preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths annually And despite early predictions that these regulations would cripple the economy the opposite has proven true The U S economy more than doubled in size while pollution fell showing that clean air and economic growth can and do go hand in hand Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us The numbers are eye popping An EPA analysis of the first 20 years of the Clean Air Act from 1970 to 1990 found that the economic benefits of the regulations were about 42 times greater than the costs The EPA later estimated that the cost of air quality regulations in the U S would be about U S 65 billion in 2020 and the benefits primarily in improved health and increased worker productivity would be around 2 trillion Other studies have found similar benefits That s a

with the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970 which put in place strict rules on pollutants from industry vehicles and power plants These rules targeted key culprits lead ozone sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and particulate matter substances that contribute to asthma heart disease and premature deaths An example was the removal of lead which can harm the brain and other organs from gasoline That single change resulted in far lower levels of lead in people s blood including a 70 drop in U S children s blood lead levels Air Quality regulations lowered the amount of lead being used in gasoline which also resulted in rapidly declining lead concentrations in the average American between 1976 and 1980 This shows us how effective regulations can be at reducing public health risks to people Credit EPA Environmental Criteria and Assessment Office 1986 The results have been extraordinary Since 1980 emissions of six major air pollutants have dropped by 78 even as the U S economy has more than doubled in size Cities that were once notorious for their thick choking smog such as Los Angeles Houston and Pittsburgh now see far cleaner air while lakes and forests devastated by acid rain in the Northeast have rebounded Comparison of growth areas and declining emissions 1970 2023 Credit EPA And most importantly lives have been saved The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to periodically estimate the costs and benefits of air quality regulations In the most recent estimate released in 2011 the EPA projected that air quality improvements would prevent more than 230 000 premature deaths in 2020 That means fewer heart attacks fewer emergency room visits for asthma and more years of healthy life for millions of Americans The economic payoff Critics of air quality regulations have long argued that the regulations are too expensive for businesses and consumers But the data tells a very different story EPA studies have confirmed that clean air regulations improve air quality over time Other studies have shown that the health benefits greatly outweigh the costs That pays off for the economy Fewer illnesses mean lower healthcare costs and healthier workers mean higher productivity

Commons The next chapter in clean air The air Americans breathe today is cleaner much healthier and safer than it was just a few decades ago Yet despite this remarkable progress air pollution remains a challenge in some parts of the country Some urban neighborhoods remain stubbornly polluted because of vehicle emissions and industrial pollution While urban pollution has declined wildfire smoke has become a larger influence on poor air quality across the nation That means the EPA still has work to do If the agency works with environmental scientists public health experts and industry and fosters honest scientific consensus it can continue to protect public health while supporting economic growth At the same time it can ensure that future generations enjoy the same clean air and prosperity that regulations have made possible By instead considering retracting clean air rules the EPA is calling into question the expertise of countless scientists who have provided their objective advice over decades to set standards designed to protect human lives In many cases industries won t want to go back to past polluting ways but lifting clean air rules means future investment might not be as protective And it increases future regulatory uncertainty for industries The past offers a clear lesson Investing in clean air is not just good for public health it s good for the economy With a track

The Defender that ongoing lawsuits are important for ensuring that military members receive full back pay as stipulated in the executive order You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up President Donald Trump on late Monday signed an executive order to reinstate service members who were discharged under the military s COVID 19 vaccination mandate The order calls on the secretary of defense and the secretary of homeland security to take action to enable those service members reinstated under this section to revert to their former rank and receive full back pay benefits bonus payments or compensation The order also covers service members who voluntarily left the service rather than comply with the COVID 19 vaccine mandate However Children s Health Defense CHD General Counsel Kim Mack Rosenberg said court cases are still important for ensuring that all military members negatively affected by the military s COVID 19 vaccine mandate receive the mandated backpay Mack Rosenberg explained The executive order signed by President Trump offers a variety of means of redress to service members who refused the COVID 19 injections during the almost year and a half that military mandates were in place and who either were discharged because of that refusal or who left the service because of the mandate However the order does not create a private remedy The executive government cannot magically issue checks for back pay to these members overnight The final clause of the executive order states that it is not intended to and does not create any right or benefit substantive or procedural enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States its departments agencies or entities its officers employees or agents or any other person In other words the executive order is a wonderful gesture but it lacks the teeth to ensure that all members affected by the military s vaccine mandate are justly compensated for the harms they suffered she

discharged due to their unvaccinated status or forced into early retirement The suit also represents Coast Guard members who chose to leave rather than comply with the mandate Lawyers representing the U S tried unsuccessfully to dismiss the case On Jan 23 Judge Armando O Bonilla ruled that the U S government illegally mandated an unlicensed product when the military told members they must get the COVID 19 shot The COVID 19 vaccines used at the time of the military s mandate had only emergency use authorization EUA from the U S Food and Drug Administration Bonilla s ruling is a huge deal that paves the way for justice for thousands of service members said attorney Ray Flores Flores called it a miracle that a judge for the U S Court of Federal Claims would expose government falsehoods by

wrote Mack Rosenberg commended Bonilla for highlighting the importance of informed consent and exemptions especially with an EUA product According to the ruling It is against this backdrop of human

Whitney Webb cautioned against reading too much into Trump s withdrawal from the WHO She wrote in an X post To be fair Trump also left the WHO in mid 2020 and then just redirected what was once WHO

federal funding of dangerous gain of function research in China Iran and other nations which he said lack sufficient oversight The order ends any present and all future federal funding for such research in those countries The order also temporarily pauses federally funded research using infectious pathogens and toxins in the U S for 120 days These measures will drastically reduce the potential for lab related incidents involving gain of function research like that conducted on bat coronaviruses in China by the EcoHealth Alliance and Wuhan Institute of Virology according to a White House fact sheet released the same day During the 120 day pause in the U S the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the national security adviser will work with funding agencies namely the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS to develop a new policy for that research that is safer more enforceable and transparent The order also directs relevant public health officials and agencies to develop a strategy to limit and track gain of function research in the private sector and create a legislative proposal to close regulatory loopholes for that type of research According to the fact sheet the goal is to promote American biotechnology dominance and improve the safety and security of biological research both domestically and globally At the signing ceremony Trump was flanked by HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and National Institutes of Health NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya both of whom praised the order Kennedy said during the signing event that Dr Anthony Fauci s research on viruses and bioweapons created an arms race involving Russia China and Iran He said It s a kind of weapon that always has blowback There s always bad news and the justification for this kind of weaponry and this kind of research was always that we have to do this to develop vaccines to counter a future pandemic In all of the history of gain of function research we cannot point to a single good thing that s come from it Bhattacharya said The conduct of this research does not protect us against pandemics as some people might say it doesn t protect us against other nations There s always a danger that in doing this research it might leak out just by accident even and cause a pandemic Internist and bioweapons", "chunk_id":

provided input for the executive order said that although she thought that a global ban and global enforcement were ultimately necessary the executive order was an excellent start and she was thrilled with the result However critics raised concerns that the order merely pauses the research rather than banning it outright Investigative journalist Sam Husseini who reported extensively on gain of function research during the COVID 19 pandemic said Pausing federal funding of so called gain of function lab work is not the same as stopping it If this is a temporary pause on federal funding which will be followed by minimal reforms then it will be more than anything an exercise in the management of the public mind McCullough Foundation epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher expressed cautious optimism calling the order a critical first step toward ending dangerous gain of function research once and for all Hulscher welcomed the pause on experiments in the U S involving infectious pathogens and toxins He also noted the order acknowledges a long ignored danger non federally funded GOF research in private labs Still Hulscher warned We must remain clear eyed a temporary pause is not a permanent solution Some of the most reckless and high risk gain of function experiments have taken place right here on U S soil Gain of function research has faced restrictions before Gain of function research typically involves altering a pathogen often to make it more transmissible or deadly usually with the stated goal of preemptive vaccine development Critics argue that it has a dual use potential as the pathogens can be used for bioweapons research and development The question of COVID 19 s origins has largely become a partisan debate that sees it as either a natural spillover or a lab leak although other researchers argue it could have been an intentional leak or that there was no pandemic virus While many scientists pointed to likely origins resulting from a lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology public health officials including Fauci and Dr Francis Collins then head of the NIH maintained that the virus had natural origins spilling over from animals to humans

off The first Trump administration in 2017 also lifted the ban on domestic gain of function research restarting funding for research on influenza and the SARS and MERS coronaviruses That decision was framed as a response to a new and more stringent oversight process said to have been set up by HHS at the time Husseini also criticized the new order for omitting any reference to international law specifically the Biological Weapons Convention or its U S implementing legislation the Biological Weapons Anti Terrorism Act of 1989 drafted by the late Francis Boyle J D Ph D He said it indicated the order was about pausing federal funding not stopping such research much less prosecuting individuals responsible Nass also said that strengthening the Biological Weapons Convention could be an

s second term health agenda which could include agency reform and changes to public health policies Axios reported The three agencies report to the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS Earlier this month Trump nominated Robert F Kennedy Jr founder of Children s Health Defense CHD to lead HHS Weldon previously criticized COVID 19 vaccines and restrictions Makary and Nesheiwat first expressed support for vaccines and other pandemic related policies but have become more critical in recent years Kim Witczak a drug safety advocate who has worked with the FDA as a consumer representative addressed mainstream criticism of the nominations She told The Defender that the pharmaceutical and medical industrial complex is very worried She added The pharmaceutical and food

NPR noted that Makary voiced support for lockdowns early in the pandemic and encouraged universal masking but later became increasingly outspoken against such policies In 2021 Makary called the Biden administration s CDC the most political CDC in history for not being forthcoming with the public about COVID 19 and the vaccines According to the New York Post he criticized the CDC and Biden administration for their unsupported claims about COVID 19 vaccine effectiveness Makary has also been vocal about the potency of natural immunity to COVID 19 criticizing the medical establishment s complete dismissal of natural immunity In May he criticized The New York Times for being slow to report on the thousands of people injured by the COVID 19 vaccines Last year Makary said during congressional testimony that public health officials have made many tragic mistakes during the pandemic Those mistakes included ignoring natural immunity dismissing the possibility of COVID 19 originating from a lab leak closing schools masking toddlers and pushing boosters for young people In September Makary appeared alongside Kennedy at a congressional roundtable hosted by Sen Ron Johnson R Wis on the chronic disease epidemic During the roundtable Makary said The greatest perpetrator of misinformation has been the United States government In his announcement Trump said Makary

Army veteran who served as a Republican member of the U S House of Representatives between 1995 and 2009 In a statement Kennedy praised Weldon s experience saying he will bring the truth and transparency needed to restore the public s confidence in the CDC In 2007 Weldon sponsored a bill that would have banned mercury from vaccines expressing concern about an enormous inherent conflict of interest within the CDC because the agency promotes vaccination while assessing their safety According to Politico Weldon also raised concerns about the safety of the measles mumps and rubella vaccine and Gardasil Merck s papillomavirus virus or HPV vaccine While in Congress Weldon also introduced legislation outlawing human cloning and helped secure a deal that banned patents on human organisms including genetically engineered embryos according to The Associated Press According to NPR Trump said Weldon would proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic and prioritize Transparency Competence and High Standards John Gilmore executive director of the Autism Action Network said Weldon was sounding the alarm on failures in the vaccine system 20 years ago He said Weldon attended conferences like Defeat Autism Now and listened to mothers of vaccine injured children which is not a behavior many doctors are inclined to do Hooker said he was very encouraged by Weldon s nomination and that he d like to know more about Weldon s position on the bloated vaccine schedule as well as COVID 19 countermeasures He credited Weldon with helping independent thimerosal researchers gain access to the Vaccine Safety Datalink a collaborative project that monitors vaccine safety and conducts studies on vaccine side effects Hooker who participated in that project said Our access to the VSD was rescinded months later because the CDC didn t like our results which included a definitive link between thimerosal and autism Weldon indeed will need to

catastrophic for global health America is going to leave a huge vacuum in global health financing and leadership Gostin told FT I see no one that is going to fill the breach The U S historically has been the single largest contributor to the WHO In 2022 23 the U S shelled out 1 284 billion to the organization which FT reported was about 16 of its funding If the U S were to withdraw it would eliminate the WHO s biggest source of funding and leadership and hamper its ability to direct global public health In 2020 the Trump administration initiated the process to sever ties with the WHO and redirect the funding to U S global health priorities However when President Joe Biden took office he canceled the withdrawal on his first day Some funding was withheld that year making the U S only the third largest contributor in 2020 21 behind Germany and the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation The experts told FT that some members of Trump s team want to initiate the process immediately and move much more quickly this time Ashish Jha Biden s former White House COVID 19 response coordinator said the team wanted to make the move on day one because of the symbolism of reversing Biden s action

attempting to reverse over 100 environmental regulations said Phil Landrigan a pediatrician and public health physician and director of the global public health program at Boston College An analysis he and colleagues conducted of the public health impacts of those actions found that they resulted in about 20 000 additional deaths Landrigan said The most air pollution related deaths during Trump s first term occurred in red states that voted for Trump as these states tend to have weaker state programs for public health and environmental protection The downstream consequences of these actions are more pollution more disease and more death he said It s important to point out for an administration that portrays itself as pro life a group within the population that will suffer most seriously from those impacts are pregnant women their infants in the womb and young kids Something that is portrayed as freeing up industry actually ends up killing kids That is the bottom line One action the

chemical industry and every American will suffer for it said Kyla Bennett director of science policy at the watchdog group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility PFAS contamination is already a national health crisis and this will force states to try and fill the regulatory void left by EPA s failure The decision to withdraw the draft rule came as Trump issued an executive order to

PFAS in the environment including drinking water sources according to a 2021 analysis of EPA data by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group EWG And the EPA itself has identified more than 120 000 facility sites around the U S where the agency says people may be exposed to PFAS The proposal s withdrawal is a devastating setback that not only delays establishing critical federal standards but

Gates has used his money strategically to infect the international aid agencies with his distorted self serving priorities The U S historically has been the largest direct donor to WHO However Bill Gates contributes to WHO via multiple avenues including the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation as well as GAVI which was founded by the Gates Foundation in partnership with WHO the World Bank and various vaccine manufacturers As of 2018 the cumulative contributions from the Gates Foundation and GAVI made Gates the unofficial top sponsor of the WHO even before the Trump administration s 2020 move to cut all his support to the organization And in fact Gates gives so much that Politico wrote a highly critical article about his undue financial influence over the WHO s operations in 2017 which Politico said was causing the agency to spend a disproportionate amount of its resources on projects with the measurable outcomes Gates prefers His sway has NGOs and academics worried Some health advocates fear that because the Gates Foundation s money comes from investments in big business it could serve as a Trojan horse for corporate interests to undermine WHO s role in setting standards and shaping health policies Plus Gates also routes funding to WHO through SAGE Strategic Advisory Group of Experts and UNICEF and Rotary International bringing his total contributions to over 1 billion Kennedy explains in the book adding that these tax deductible donations give Gates both leverage and control over international health policy which he largely directs to serve the profit interest of his pharma partners As noted in the featured film when it was founded WHO could decide how to distribute its contributions Now 70 of its budget is tied to specific projects countries or regions which are dictated by the funders As such Gates priorities are the backbone of WHO and it wasn t a coincidence when he said of WHO Our priorities are your priorities Gates vaccine obsession

H1N1 swine flu pandemic secret agreements were made between Germany Great Britain Italy and France with the pharmaceutical industry before the H1N1 pandemic began which stated that they would purchase H1N1 flu vaccinations but only if a pandemic level 6 was declared by WHO The TrustWHO documentary shows how six weeks before the pandemic was declared no one at WHO was worried about the virus but the media was nonetheless exaggerating the dangers Then in the month leading up to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic WHO changed the official definition of pandemic removing the severity and high mortality criteria and leaving the definition of a pandemic as a worldwide epidemic of a disease This switch in definition allowed WHO to declare swine flu a pandemic after only 144 people had died from the infection worldwide In 2010 Dr Wolfgang Wodarg then head of health at the Council of Europe accused pharmaceutical companies of influencing WHO s pandemic declaration calling swine flu a false pandemic that was driven by Big Pharma which cashed in on the health scare According to Wodarg the swine flu pandemic was one of the greatest medicine scandals of the century In the investigation into WHO and Big Pharma s falsification of a pandemic an inquiry stated in order to promote their patented drugs and vaccines against flu pharmaceutical companies influenced scientists and official agencies responsible for public health standards to alarm governments worldwide and make them squander tight health resources for inefficient vaccines strategies and needlessly expose millions of healthy people to the risk of an unknown amount of side effects of insufficiently tested vaccines While governments ended up with stockpiles of vaccines they would never use many of those who received the

leadership prioritized China s economic interests over halting the spread of the virus when Covid 19 first emerged China exerted ultimate control over the WHO investigation into the origins of Covid

medical or policy justification for the stance that the WHO took in January and February 2020 That was entirely premised on maintaining satisfactory ties to the Chinese government So at every step of the way the WHO promoted the position that was sought by the Chinese government the WHO actively resisted and obstructed efforts by other nations to implement effective border controls that could have limited the spread or even contained the spread of the outbreak It is impossible for me to believe that the officials in Geneva who were making those statements believed those statements accorded with the facts that were available to them at the time the statements were made It s hard not to see that the direct origin of that is the support of the Chinese government for Tedros s election as director general This was a remarkably high return on China s investment with the relatively small sums that were invested in supporting his election It paid off on a grand scale for the Chinese government WHO corruption runs deep Even prior to the pandemic WHO had released a statement that it had been in discussions with Facebook to ensure people can access authoritative information on vaccines and reduce the spread of inaccuracies At WHO s first Global Vaccination Summit held in Brussels in September 2019 Jason Hirsch Facebook s public policy manager alluded to the censorship and

as Good for the Environment Industrial beef production which includes cattle raised on antibiotics drugs and genetically engineered grains grown with pesticides is unhealthy for the environment and

the biggest sources of climate warming gases and beef is the worst of the bunch data shows To clean up their image leading meat producers including Tyson one of the largest meat companies in the U S have hired public relations and advertising firms mirroring a strategy used by fossil fuel companies Now U S Right to Know has new details of the PR campaign behind a key part of Tyson s green strategy its so called climate smart beef product branded Brazen Beef In early 2023 Tyson unveiled its climate smart beef which it claimed is produced with 10 fewer greenhouse gases than regular beef It was the first U S produced beef to receive approval from the U S Department of Agriculture for its climate friendly claim Later that year the product was available for purchase from Schweid Sons a burger and ground beef company which had plans to sell it in supermarkets nationwide But shortly after the product s launch environmental groups and media reports called Tyson out for obfuscating how it calculated the cut in climate warming gases to achieve a low emissions beef product And researchers cast doubt on Tyson s ability to measure such slim emissions cuts Other researchers also argued that emissions from beef are so high that even with a 10 cut it could still not be considered climate smart Tyson is also now being sued for making false and misleading claims to consumers regarding its green goals and climate smart beef program from which the Brazen Beef product is produced Tyson s Brazen Beef website has now been taken down and the product appears no longer for sale But the PR and marketing strategy behind the product s promotion provides insight into how the meat industry is trying to appear more sustainable and to capitalize on consumers willingness to pay around 10 but up to 50 more for sustainable products PR and advertising are so important to the company that in 2023 the year it launched Brazen Beef Tyson spent 339 million on it nearly three times as much as it

Crafting a climate conscious brand The PR company behind Tyson s Brazen Beef is Midan Marketing a private company with offices in Chicago Illinois and Mooresville North Carolina that specializes in promoting meat Midan s campaign to promote Tyson s beef paints a rosy picture of the product s environmental footprint With the tagline Better Beef Better Planet the company crafts an image that suggests climate conscious consumers can have their beef and eat it too They tell consumers to do the climate solid by choosing Tyson s product Midan writes on its website that it created Brazen Beef from the ground up crafting everything from the tagline look and feel logo target persona and even the brand name itself all backed by strategy research and testing But the company s work for Tyson appears to contradict its own advice in which Midan suggests the meat industry should be transparent authentic and verifiable when making sustainability claims if they want to capitalize on the growing demand for sustainable food Adding consumers are paying attention Midan is a small company currently with 29 employees at the time of writing according to its website It is led by Michael Uetz and Danette Amstein who both previously worked at the National Cattlemen s Beef Association a trade group The company says its goal is to tell the story of how meat is raised processed promoted sold and enjoyed from farm to fork Its other clients have included the National Cattlemen s Beef Association and the Meat Institute a trade association In a statement to U S Right to Know Andrea Schepke a spokesperson for Midan wrote Midan Marketing worked with Tyson to do initial development on the Brazen Beef brand However we have not been involved with or supported the brand in well over a year

contribution is very high considering that it makes up only between 5 20 of all the calories and protein in the average U S diet explains Eshel Even grass fed beef cattle are not climate friendly he says Some research has suggested that grazing beef cattle release fewer climate warming gases compared to industrial beef production where animals are kept in confined spaces and fed on grains such as corn For example grazing cattle on land that is unsuitable for human use and rotating cattle on plots with crops or other livestock can sequester carbon in the soil reducing the grazed cattle s carbon footprint But in research published in March Eshel and his colleagues re evaluated the amount of soil carbon sequestration that can be reasonably attributed to grass fed cattle Previous studies had overestimated this amount With the new approximation the study shows that grass fed cattle release at least as much greenhouse gas as industrial produced beef By promoting its so called climate smart beef Midan is aiding Tyson to position itself as an honest company with green credentials and alternative environmentally friendly products says Jennifer Jacquet who researches the meat industry s influence on climate change politics and policy at the University of Miami They are involved in enabling it she says False and misleading claims Tyson is also criticized for another aspect of its sustainability strategy which includes a pledge to achieve net zero climate emissions by 2050 To reach this goal Tyson would need to cut or capture as many emissions as it releases which estimates suggest are more than those released by the entire nation of Greece But researchers lawyers and environmental groups say that Tyson s net zero pledge and its climate smart beef claims are deceptive and misleading In September 2024 the Environmental Working Group EWG filed a lawsuit against Tyson for making false and misleading claims to consumers about its net zero emission target and its low emissions beef program The idea that they will get to net neutrality is absurd it s a contradiction in terms says Eshel And even with a 10 reduction in emissions Tyson would still be producing one of

meaningful steps to do so says the lawsuit Tyson did not respond to requests for comment In November 2024 Tyson filed a motion to dismiss the complaint The company argued that EWG s claims are barred by the First Amendment Imposing liability for pursuing a net zero ambition and for making truthful statements about its program to reduce GHG emissions generated from cattle production in Tyson s supply chain goes right to the heart of what the First Amendment protects says a document supporting Tyson s motion to dismiss Tyson also rejects EWG s claim that it has not taken steps to achieve its net zero emissions target Tyson points for example to its participation in the Science Based Targets Initiative an international collaboration to help businesses set goals to reduce emissions and its partnership with a feedlot to collect and assess emissions data In February Superior Court Judge Julie Becker for the District of Columbia denied Tyson s motion to dismiss the case Becker found that EWG s arguments were strong enough for the case to proceed In the order Becker writes that EWG s allegations are sufficient to support its claim that Tyson s climate smart beef statements give consumers a misleading impression The lawsuit against Tyson follows a similar one against JBS USA the American subsidiary of the world s largest beef producer In February 2024 New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit alleging JBS USA misled consumers when it stated it would achieve net zero greenhouse gases by 2040 It says JBS targeted consumers with fake sustainability claims

marketing and research program funded by beef producers which belittles meat s contribution to greenhouse gases Companies make true statements about science and can let the trade groups make bolder claims and disinformation campaigns says Jacquet PR and marketing firms like Midan play a crucial role in this misdirection she says Academic research and media investigations have shown that public relations and marketing firms influence climate change politics and discussion For example in a study published in March Jacquet and a coauthor found that PR campaigns paid for by the meat industry effectively countered efforts from civil society groups that were aimed at encouraging people to eat less meat Companies wouldn t spend money on PR if it didn t help them sell more products or secure the market adds Jacquet In addition to Midan Tyson has also hired other PR firms including Ogilvy an international PR powerhouse that has long worked for the oil and gas sector Ogilvy promoted Tyson s

nonprofit is working with C O nxt a firm based in Hartland Wisconsin that specializes in agriculture The AAA downplays the benefits that eating less meat would have on the climate and inflates the

cows milk as the industry faced increasing competition from non dairy alternatives according to a report by the Changing Markets Foundation a think tank based in the Netherlands Edelman has worked on campaigns for oil and gas companies such as Exxon and Shell and for the tobacco industry the report says And a firm called Red Flag Consulting has advised the Meat Institute on an initiative called the Protein Pact through which the institute is encouraging food companies and producers to set targets to reduce their environmental impact But setting targets such as Tyson s goal to reach net zero emissions isn t enough Companies must act on those targets and cut emissions says Jacquet A media investigation by DeSmog also found that Red Flag was behind a campaign to disparage an expert report that suggested consumers cut in half the amount of red meat they eat to make diets more sustainable Media reports say that Red Flag was previously involved with a campaign for Monsanto an agrochemical company bought by Bayer in 2018 to defend glyphosate a weedkiller that is linked to cancer Red Flag did not respond to a request for comment It s unfortunate that companies like Midan proliferate

Rice Healthy Babies Bright Futures HBBF tested 211 samples of rice and other grains sold in U S stores to determine levels of four toxic heavy metals arsenic cadmium lead and mercury The goal was to identify which rice types were most contaminated and whether common rice substitutes offered safer options The findings reveal how specific grains cooking methods and sourcing decisions directly influence your exposure Heavy metal content varied dramatically by grain type On average rice contained three times more total heavy metals than the other grains tested Arsenic was the most abundant contaminant in rice averaging 84 8 parts per billion ppb while alternative grains averaged just 3 1 ppb 28 times less While cadmium levels were slightly higher in some substitutes the overall toxic burden from non rice grains was far lower On average rice contained three times more total heavy metals than the other grains tested Arsenic was the most abundant contaminant in rice averaging 84 8 parts per billion ppb while alternative grains averaged just 3 1 ppb 28 times less While cadmium levels were slightly higher in some substitutes the overall toxic burden from non rice grains was far lower A few simple actions cut arsenic exposure by 69 HBBF identified three strategies that when used together reduced heavy metal intake from rice significantly These included cooking rice in extra water and draining it like pasta choosing lower contamination rice varieties and rotating in grain alternatives like barley farro or quinoa This empowers you to take control without needing to

your health but you do need to be smart about which types you eat and how you prepare them The idea that brown rice is always healthier doesn t hold up if you re dealing with mitochondrial stress or gut issues In fact for many people especially those struggling with inflammation or metabolic dysfunction white rice is the better option It s easier to digest far less likely to feed harmful gut bacteria and lower in both problematic fibers and omega 6 fats that disrupt cellular energy Here s how to keep rice in your diet while reducing your exposure to harmful contaminants and protecting your metabolic health 1 Choose white rice over brown and go for lower risk varieties White basmati rice from India Thai jasmine rice and California grown white rice are consistently lower in both arsenic and cadmium Brown rice retains its outer layers which are high in heavy metals and contain linoleic acid Linoleic acid impairs mitochondria makes inflammation worse and slows down your energy production White rice strips these out and gives you a clean starchy fuel without the added baggage 2 Cook it like this to reduce the toxic load Soak white rice for at least 30 minutes before cooking then boil it in a large amount of water 6 to 10 cups per 1 cup of rice and drain it like pasta This simple method removes up to 60 of the arsenic Rinsing alone won t cut it The key is flushing the water and the toxins away before you eat it 3 Avoid parboiled instant and prepackaged rice products These processed options are convenient but they come with a tradeoff more contamination and fewer

little ones avoid rice cereal or porridge from brown rice even if it s homemade Absolutely nothing compares to breast milk in terms of nutrition for infants so if you are a new mother and still lactating breastfeeding is the best choice for both you and your child However I understand that not all moms can breastfeed In this case I recommend making your own infant formula using this recipe based on nutrient rich animal foods like raw grass fed cow s milk organic raw cream and grass fed beef gelatin For children who are unable to tolerate milk proteins I recommend trying this hypoallergenic meat based formula instead FAQs about arsenic in rice Q What s the biggest health concern with rice sold in the U S A The primary concern is arsenic a toxic heavy metal found in more than 1 in 4 rice products sold in U S stores at levels that exceed the FDA s safety limit for infant rice cereal Cadmium lead and mercury were also detected with arsenic being the most abundant and dangerous due to its strong links to cognitive impairment cancer and kidney damage Q Is brown rice healthier than white rice A Not necessarily While brown rice retains more nutrients it also holds higher concentrations of arsenic and polyunsaturated fats like linoleic acid which worsen inflammation mitochondrial function and insulin resistance White rice is often safer and easier to digest especially for individuals with gut issues or chronic disease Q What kind of rice is safest to eat A The lowest contamination varieties are white basmati rice from India Thai jasmine rice and California grown white rice These types consistently test lower in arsenic and cadmium than brown rice and rice grown in the southeastern U S Q Can I reduce arsenic by cooking rice differently A Yes

resilience academy to train over 4 000 people from public and private sectors annually in emergency roles Minister for Intergovernmental Relations Pat McFadden told Parliament on July 8 The response plan also includes developing a national vulnerability map to highlight populations most at risk in a crisis The tool which uses data on age disability ethnicity and whether the person is receiving care can share that data instantly across government departments Comedian and political commentator Russell Brand quoting Jon Fleetwood on Substack pointed out that news on the U K government tracking tool comes as in the U S the Department of Defense prepares AI driven simulations for pandemics caused by natural or man made infectious agents while funding researchers who want to infect humans with aerosolized influenza under the guise of improving disease models Britain s Exercise Pegasus was developed in response to the July 2024 recommendations made by the UK Covid 19 Inquiry an ongoing

they exert disproportionate power on global food policy and nutrition policy according to a new paper in Agriculture and Human Values Calls for transforming global food governance from a corporate dominated model to a multi stakeholder model led by organizations like the World Economic Forum WEF has led to the proliferation of multi stakeholder institution initiatives partnerships platforms and roundtables largely responsible for instituting new global solutions to agricultural problems These multi stakeholder initiatives are based on a vision promoted by Klaus Schwab that private corporations are key stakeholders that should play a leading role in sustainable development and be positioned as trustees of society the authors wrote As a result most prominent and powerful multi stakeholder institutions are largely led by board members from ultra processed food producers retailers and business associations the study found Our results suggest that we now have a corporate

processed foods They also found that the ultra processed food corporations that held the most power within the food policy institutions like PepsiCo Unilever Nestlé and Coca Cola also held the most

the evidence shows that ultra processed food executives are in the driver s seat Small farmers and whole food producers cut out of the process Although many actors are included in the multi stakeholder institutions the authors said a critical point is that farmers and businesses that produce whole minimally processed foods are excluded from most of the institutions they analyzed and the multi stakeholder model generally In other words whole food producers the ranchers and non commodity crop farmers have virtually no seat at the table at the many conferences meetings and roundtables that collectively determine food policy Teicholz wrote in her commentary on the paper This major shift in food policy she wrote began around the year 2000 when the focus of global food policy shifted from food security to the environment and the countries of the global north started to boost industrial farming and eliminate small farmers from the conversation Today she wrote that extends to

your health and longevity Consider making a goal of 90 real food and 10 or less processed food to make a significant difference in weight management and overall health It likely comes as no surprise that eating a diet filled with ultraprocessed foods is unhealthy Research has demonstrated ultraprocessed foods can increase your caloric intake and weight gain Data gathered from 2009 to 2010 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed ultraprocessed foods made up 57 9 of the energy intake of Americans and sugar contributed 89 7 of the energy intake By 2019 a study published in the journal Nutrients found 71 of packaged products in the grocery store were ultraprocessed Researchers from Northwestern Medicine estimated nearly 80 of the total calories consumed by Americans is from store bought food and beverages The researchers also compared the food supply in the U S against other western countries like Australia finding packaged foods Americans were eating had higher median amounts of sugar and salt These foods contribute to the rising level of obesity across the world The World Health Organization reported worldwide obesity tripled since 1975 The rate of overweight and obesity are rising rapidly in the U S as well Data gathered from 1999 to 2000 and then again from 2017 to 2018 show the prevalence of obesity rose from 30 5 to 42 4 During the same

curious about how ultraprocessed foods affect our bodies The BBC reports that in the U K as in the U S over half the energy from food in the average diet comes from ultraprocessed products Over one month 42 year old Tulleken increased his daily intake of ultraprocessed products from 30 to 80 mimicking how 20 of the U K population eats At the end of four weeks Tulleken experienced a myriad of changes to his health including Poor sleep Heartburn Anxiety Sluggishness Low libido Unhappy feelings Hemorrhoids from constipation Weight gain of 7 kilograms 15 4 pounds I felt ten years older but I didn t realize it was all because of the food until I stopped eating the diet Tulleken told the BBC This is telling since the physician purposefully changed his diet and yet did not recognize feeling 10 years older in one month was associated with the food he was eating How much more difficult might it be to convince others that the way they are feeling is related to the chemicals they are consuming At the rate he gained weight he believed if he d continued for six months he would have gained 6 stone 84 pounds These were the health effects Tulleken could identify without testing He also underwent several measurements of health biomarkers which demonstrated significant changes from only four weeks of eating ultraprocessed foods Brain scans showed that the diet had created new links in his brain from areas responsible for reward to areas that drive automatic and repetitive behavior This is a similar response to taking classically addictive substances such as tobacco alcohol and drugs The brain changes that occurred in the short time that Tulleken had consumed high amounts of processed products were not permanent However it isn t possible to make the same assumption if the diet is followed for months or years Additionally Tulleken points out if it can do that in four weeks to my 42 year old brain what is it doing to the fragile developing brains of our children You eat

Intramural Research Program In Hall s research he compared two diets that were matched for macronutrients sugar salt and fiber content One diet was about 80 ultraprocessed products and the other was an unprocessed diet The group consumed the ultraprocessed diet for two weeks and then was switched to the unprocessed diet while admitted and monitored at the NIH Clinical Center The participants were encouraged to eat as much or as little as they wanted The scientists found that when the participants ate the ultraprocessed diet they consumed more carbohydrates but not protein During the two week

his ghrelin level increased by 30 during the four weeks that he ate ultraprocessed products In that month he found himself craving food more often and eating more quickly which likely contributed to

during which the researchers found intake of ultraprocessed foods was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease The results were statistically significant even after adjusting for markers of nutritional quality and after a large range of sensitivity analysis As Tulleken experienced and many studies have reported eating a diet high in ultraprocessed foods increases your risk of

designed to be appealing hyperpalatable and habit forming This is all thanks to additives crafty packaging and marketing and convenience Unfortunately these ultraprocessed products are filled with empty calories and devoid of vitamins minerals liver enzymes micronutrients high quality fats and protein Dr Aseem Malhotra is an honorary consultant cardiologist at Lister Hospital in Stevenage England According to an article he wrote in European Scientist ultraprocessed foods cause chronic metabolic disease which can affect many of normal weight Furthermore sarcopenic obesity may misclassify many elderly patients to having a normal BMI on hospital admission with COVID 19 There s no such thing as a healthy weight only a healthy person A recent commentary in Nature states that Patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome might have up to 10 times greater risk of death when they contract COVID 19 and has called for mandatory glucose and metabolic control of type 2 diabetes patients to improve outcomes Since Malhotra s assertion in early 2020 multiple studies have been published that showed comorbidities such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes increase the risk of severe COVID 19 and worse outcomes This has suggested to scientists that metabolic syndrome and the consequences from it may be a better prognostic indicator for severe outcomes than the individual components of the syndrome Your diet is a key factor in health and longevity As decades of data have demonstrated the foods you eat are a key factor and a prognostic indicator of your overall health and expected longevity Undoubtedly there is a serious health epidemic across the world and it is not COVID 19 The obesity epidemic has no quick and easy answer and much of it is linked to diet The

mouvement populiste réactionnaire dans le domaine de la santé En se concentrant sur la chaîne Telegram du CHD Mme O Meara a noté qu elle avait été lancée en mars 2021 le même mois où cette organisation a été désignée comme faisant partie de la Douzaine de désinformation et qu elle comptait plus de 63 000 abonnés au moment de l analyse Les chercheurs ont analysé 6 654 messages postés entre mars 2021 et septembre 2023 O Meara a cherché à examiner comment la déplatformisation de la CHD et le tournant réglementaire des médias sociaux sont compris et discutés par la CHD elle même et comment le statut marginal de cette organisation is s articule et s opérationnalise Nous avons d abord effectué une analyse thématique pour identifier les principaux points de discussion thématiques et c est en quelque sorte là que nous avons identifié la censure des médias sociaux et Big Tech comme une sorte de point de discussion significatif en interne pour ce compte particulier a déclaré M O Meara en faisant référence au canal Telegram du CHD C est de cela que découle le reste de l étude Mme O Meara a indiqué que son analyse a permis d identifier cinq thèmes clés que la CHD est censée diffuser dans les communications via sa chaîne Telegram l un d entre eux étant que la censure à laquelle la CHD a été confrontée est utilisée comme un titre de compétence par l organisation La déplatformisation et la censure are sont perçues comme une raison d écouter to CHD un badge d honneur une déclaration de crédibilité peut on lire dans la présentation de M O Meara La déplatformisation de CHD est en quelque sorte plus largement comprise comme une raison pour les membres du public d écouter ce qu ils ont à dire Dans cet espace la censure est en quelque sorte brandie comme un titre de compétence qui confère à l organisation légitimité ou autorité a ajouté M O Meara Mme O Meara a également identifié un thème qu elle a qualifié de politique de crise qu elle a décrit comme un

il s agit de cultiver l idée qu il existe une menace imminente pour la démocratie la liberté d expression et les valeurs fondamentales et que la dépravation de cette organisation en est la preuve a déclaré Mme O Meara Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Leur censure leur modération ou leur retrait de la plateforme centrée sur les affirmations qu ils formulent de manière plus générale est la preuve du déclin de la démocratie de la suppression des droits fondamentaux des citoyens Le troisième thème identifié par Mme O Meara est la collusion et la corruption des élites qui selon elle décrit les efforts déployés par le CHD pour mettre en évidence les liens entre le gouvernement et les entreprises technologiques et les acteurs puissants qui servent les intérêts de l élite et censurent la vérité Selon Mme O Meara ce thème revient sans cesse dans les communications de la CHD Un autre thème identifié par M O Meara porte moins sur la censure des Big Tech que sur l insistance répétitive sur les menaces générales des Big Tech pour l autonomie personnelle la vie privée et ce genre de choses y compris la surveillance la saisie de données et les méfaits des médias sociaux sur la santé des enfants Mme O Meara a également évoqué ce qu elle a décrit comme l expression d un sentiment communautaire et des appels à l action Mme O Meara a déclaré que les menaces contre CHD sont mobilisées par l organisation en tant qu appels à l action de la part des sympathisants et du public Selon M O Meara les messages de la CHD sur ces cinq thèmes s appuient fréquemment

Meara Selon M O Meara cela a des conséquences intéressantes sur la façon dont nous combattons des problèmes tels que la désinformation médicale Répondant à la question d un membre du public elle a déclaré qu il n est pas facile de dire que toutes les informations diffusées par le CHD sont de la désinformation mais que c est précisément cela qui rend l organisation très dangereuse Répondant à une autre question M O Meara a reconnu que la modération du contenu des médias sociaux est un outil brutal qui est toujours intégré socialement et culturellement d une manière qui peut être volatile Cependant il s agit également d un outil nécessaire qui devrait faire partie d une boîte à outils plus large qui doit impliquer la politique qui doit impliquer les éducateurs a t elle déclaré Je pense que la modération a un rôle à jouer mais les choses deviennent très obscures lorsque nous ne parlons plus de faits objectifs a déclaré Mme O Meara Nous avons besoin d une approche à multiples facettes

problématiques telles que les fake news et la désinformation a suscité de vives inquiétudes et les théories du complot ont été omniprésentes tout au long de l histoire en raison de leur simplicité L omniprésence ne signifie pas qu elle est inoffensive a déclaré M Kwon affirmant qu elle peut entraîner des risques pour la santé publique comme l augmentation de l hésitation à l égard des vaccins ou le rejet du consensus scientifique Mettant l accent sur M Gates en tant que cible des super diffuseurs de théories du complot M Kwon a présenté les résultats d une analyse de milliers de tweets datant de 2020 L analyse a révélé que les tweets conspirationnistes faisant référence à M Gates ont atteint des sommets à plusieurs occasions telles que lamise en garde du Dr Anthony Fauci contre la

inquiétudes concernant le vaccin d AstraZeneca et ont demandé une alternative Cependant le personnel du centre de vaccination a refusé leur disant que le vaccin de Pfizer n était pas disponible et

de très rares caillots sanguins mais ont conclu que les avantages du vaccin l emportaient toujours sur les risques Cette annonce est intervenue après que l Agence européenne des médicaments EMA a examiné 62 cas signalés de thrombose du sinus veineux cérébral et 24 cas de thrombose de la veine splanchnique dans la base de données de l UE sur la sécurité des médicaments EudraVigilance au 22 mars

Unis Brianne Dressen une participante à l essai clinique américain du vaccin qui a subi de graves blessures en 2020 a poursuivi le fabricant du vaccin en mai pour rupture de contrat Selon l action en justice intentée par Dressen AstraZeneca a accepté de couvrir les frais médicaux pour toute blessure liée à un vaccin en vertu d un contrat entre AstraZeneca et les participants aux essais cliniques Dans le cadre de l action collective en cours au Royaume Uni AstraZeneca a admis dans des documents juridiques soumis à la Haute Cour du Royaume Uni que le médicament peut dans de très rares cas provoquer un TTS également appelé thrombocytopénie thrombotique induite par le vaccin Le TTS est lié aux vaccins COVID 19 d AstraZeneca et de Johnson Johnson Cette maladie provoque la formation de caillots sanguins dans l organisme ce qui peut mettre la vie en danger D autres études ont également établi un lien entre le vaccin COVID 19 d AstraZeneca et plusieurs vaccins COVID 19 autorisés aux États Unis et des troubles de la coagulation En mai AstraZeneca a annoncé le retrait mondial de son vaccin COVID 19 Le retrait a commencé en mars lorsqu AstraZeneca a volontairement retiré l autorisation de mise sur le marché requise pour la commercialisation d un médicament dans l UE L EMA a ensuite publié un avis indiquant que l utilisation du vaccin n était plus autorisée AstraZeneca a

on Future Generations alongside policy proposals on Information Integrity on Digital Platforms and Transforming Education We are here to bring multilateralism back from the brink U N Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the Summit of the Future held during the 79th U N General Assembly in New York The final version of the pact excludes a proposal that would have granted the secretary general emergency powers to respond to global shocks Writing on Substack Dr Meryl Nass founder of Door to Freedom said the exclusion of emergency powers for the secretary general is a positive development They added a lot of useless verbiage to confuse the unwary But in the end the secretary general is only asked to use whatever powers he already has However according to critics the pact still

Children s Health Defense Africa Refusing to accept this common sense amendment sends a clear message The days of national sovereignty are running out fast Still not all U N member states appear to fully support the pact Nass noted that 22 countries are on record as not being overwhelmingly happy with it Argentina for instance decided to dissociate itself from the pact Argentina Foreign Minister Diana Mondino said Many points in this pact go against or would hold back Argentina s new agenda referring to the country s new government Nonbinding pact may carry same weight as an international treaty According to Al Jazeera the pact is nonbinding raising concerns about implementation However Boyle told The Defender the pact will carry more weight once nation states begin signing off on it Under Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties the pact will actually be a treaty that will be binding on all the states that sign it Boyle said All signatories will be obliged to act in a manner so as not to defeat the object and purpose of the convention According to Bell the pact allows bureaucrats drafting future mandatory agreements to claim there is already agreement Nass told The Defender the pact contains no new mandates but seeks to gain consensus for nations carrying out prior commitments adding that multilateralism is a euphemism for global governance She highlighted paragraph 17 which states We will advance implementation of these actions through relevant mandated intergovernmental processes where they exist Bell also questioned the term

for the WHO s pandemic treaty are still ongoing with the goal of passing the treaty by the time of the next World Health Assembly in May 2025 The pact contains several goals related to vaccination including ensuring that all young people enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health including immunizations and vaccinations The pact s Global Digital Compact calls for Novel platform based vaccine technologies and smart vaccine manufacturing techniques According to Nass while The Pact specifically desires to ensure universal access for sexual and reproductive health and for vaccinations it fails to make similar assurances for access to primary health care Pact for the Future digital compact may deliver censorship surveillance The pact and digital compact frequently address misinformation and the need to combat it Some experts warned this may lead to a global censorship apparatus According to the pact paragraph 34 nations will cooperate to address the challenge of misinformation and disinformation and hate speech online and mitigate the risks of information manipulation in a manner consistent with international law The pact also calls for the provision of independent fact based timely targeted clear accessible multilingual and science based information to counter misinformation and disinformation and of relevant reliable and accurate information in crisis situations to protect and empower those in vulnerable situations The policy brief on Information Integrity on Digital Platforms calls for empirically backed consensus around facts science and knowledge but does not clarify how this consensus would be determined The digital compact sets a comprehensive global framework for digital cooperation and AI artificial intelligence governance and calls for the use of technology for the benefit of all Its passage was accompanied by pledges of 1 05 billion to advance digital inclusion and by calls to bridge digital divides globally Some experts said bridging the digital divide is a veiled attempt to introduce global digital ID The major concern over the Digital Compact is its potential overreach such as increased censorship or surveillance

she called outlandish This objective is aligned with the WHO s One Health agenda which equates human health with that of animals and the environment but which some experts have argued promotes a biosecurity and surveillance agenda Expanding health measures into areas like free speech or travel under a One Health banner raises alarms about the potential suppression of rights and freedoms

millions d enfants n ont pas reçu toutes les doses de vaccins DTC de routine l année dernière contre 13 9 millions en 2022 Le rapport déplore également les lacunes dans la vaccination contre la rougeole notant que des épidémies ont touché 103 pays Le Dr Paul Thomas pédiatre et co auteur du livre à paraître Vax Facts What to Consider Before Vaccinating at All Ages All Stages of Life a déclaré au Défenseur que les programmes de vaccination mondiaux continuent d utiliser la dangereuse formulation DTC à cellules entières au lieu de la version acellulaire moins risquée Le vaccin à germes entiers qui contient l ensemble de l organisme Bordetella pertussis plutôt que des composants purifiés a donné lieu depuis les années 1930 à de nombreux rapports faisant état de lésions neurologiques Il a été progressivement éliminé aux États Unis en 1997 mais la formulation a continué à être utilisée dans les pays à revenu faible et intermédiaire tuant potentiellement des millions d enfants L ironie c est que le succès lorsqu il est mesuré à l aune de la vaccination d un pays d une région ou d un médecin récompense en réalité l industrie pharmaceutique et tous ceux qui profitent des ventes de vaccins au détriment de la santé de l individu et de la communauté a déclaré M Thomas Thomas auteur d une étude comparant les résultats sanitaires d enfants vaccinés et non vaccinés estime que le succès devrait être mesuré en fonction de la santé globale de la population et non en fonction des taux de vaccination Moins nous vaccinons plus la population est en bonne santé a t il déclaré Nous avons besoin de nouvelles mesures Le rapport est publié alors que Gavi l Alliance du vaccin a dévoilé un plan ambitieux de 11 9 milliards de dollars dont 9 milliards de dollars de nouveaux fonds pour

existants et de nouveaux vaccins Principales conclusions du rapport OMS UNICEF Le rapport de l OMS et de l UNICEF indique que la stagnation des taux de vaccination dans le monde met en évidence les problèmes qui subsistent à la suite de la pandémie de COVID 19 et suscite des inquiétudes quant aux flambées de maladies en particulier la rougeole et à l impact du changement climatique sur les maladies évitables par la vaccination Le rapport se concentre sur le nombre d enfants ayant reçu trois doses du vaccin DTP un indicateur clé de la couverture vaccinale mondiale qui s établit à 84 108 millions en 2023 un chiffre que l OMS qualifie néanmoins d impressionnant L agence mondiale de la santé a attribué ces tendances aux difficultés d accès aux services de santé pendant la pandémie qui persistent ainsi qu aux zones fragiles et en proie à des conflits L augmentation de 600 000 enfants zéro dose était particulièrement préoccupante pour l OMS au regard de ses objectifs du Programme de vaccination 2030 IA2030 IA2030 vise à ne laisser personne de côté en réduisant de 50 le nombre d enfants n ayant reçu aucune dose de vaccin et en introduisant 500 vaccins nouveaux ou sous utilisés dans les pays à revenu faible ou intermédiaire d ici à 2030 Les taux de vaccination contre la rougeole restent également une préoccupation majeure pour l OMS En 2023 seuls 83 des enfants dans le monde auront reçu leur première dose de vaccin contre la rougeole dans le cadre des services de santé de routine et 74 seulement auront reçu leur deuxième dose Selon le communiqué de presse de l OMS et de l UNICEF ces chiffres sont inférieurs à la couverture de 95 qui selon l OMS est nécessaire pour prévenir les épidémies éviter les maladies et les décès inutiles et atteindre les objectifs d élimination

responsabilité juridique pour toutes les demandes d indemnisation liées à l administration ou à l utilisation de contre mesures telles que les médicaments les produits biologiques les dispositifs médicaux et les vaccins Avant COVID a déclaré M Childers elle était à peine utilisé Kim Mack Rosenberg conseillère générale de Children s Health Defense a déclaré au Defender que la pandémie de COVID 19 avait mis en lumière la loi PREP Je pense que l on peut affirmer sans risque de se tromper que la plupart des Américains n avaient aucune idée qu à mesure que les vaccins COVID étaient mis au point

une augmentation de la mortalité toutes causes confondues dans une nouvelle étude évaluée par des pairs qui a analysé les données du système national de santé italien Sur la base de leur analyse une équipe de chercheurs italiens a vérifié ce qu elle a appelé l impact réel de la campagne de vaccination en comparant le risque de décès toutes causes confondues chez les habitants vaccinés et non vaccinés de la province italienne de Pescara Dans leur analyse univariée les chercheurs ont constaté que le risque de décès toutes causes confondues était supérieur de plus de 20 chez les personnes ayant reçu deux doses ou plus du vaccin COVID 19 par rapport aux personnes non vaccinées En revanche des recherches antérieures menées dans la même région suggéraient que les personnes ayant reçu trois ou quatre doses présentaient un risque plus faible de décès toutes causes confondues Nous avons également constaté une perte légère mais statistiquement significative de l espérance de vie pour les personnes vaccinées avec 2 ou 3 4 doses ont ils déclaré dans le rapport publié le 30 juin dans la revue Microorganisms Le Dr Peter McCullough a déclaré au Défenseur Ces conclusions appellent à l arrêt immédiat de la vaccination par le COVID 19 dans le monde entier et à une enquête approfondie sur ce qui a mal tourné pendant la campagne de vaccination par le COVID 19 M McCullough a écrit sur Substack que le point principal de l article est que la vaccination COVID 19 n a pas sauvé des vies comme tant de personnes à Washington l ont proclamé sans preuve Alberto Donzelli l un des auteurs de l étude italienne a déclaré au Defender que l étude constituait une avancée importante parce qu elle examine la mortalité toutes causes confondues ventilée par statut vaccinal et qu elle tient compte des variables confusionnelles qui ont pu affecter les rapports antérieurs sur la vaccination COVID 19 et la mortalité toutes causes confondues Très peu d études dans le monde ont réussi à le faire a t

une étude pour corriger les biais Pour leur étude Donzelli et ses coauteurs ont utilisé les mêmes données que celles analysées par d autres chercheurs dans une étude italienne antérieure sur l efficacité du vaccin COVID 19 L étude précédente qui a suivi les personnes deux ans après le début de la campagne de vaccination COVID 19 a révélé que les personnes ayant reçu une ou deux doses présentaient un risque significativement plus élevé de décès toutes causes confondues tandis que celles qui avaient reçu trois doses de vaccin ou plus présentaient un risque de décès plus faible Toutefois ces résultats ont probablement été faussés par le biais du temps immortel ont déclaré Donzelli et ses coauteurs Selon le Catalogue of Bias de l Université d Oxford le biais du temps immortel est un défaut courant dans la conception des études qui peut fausser les estimations statistiques entre une exposition telle qu une injection de COVID 19 et un résultat tel qu un risque accru de décès Donzelli a déclaré que ce biais affecte la plupart des études observationnelles sur la mortalité de COVID 19 Le chercheur et ses coauteurs ont donc pris les mesures nécessaires pour corriger le biais et ont réanalysé les mêmes données Ils ont examiné les carnets de vaccination du 1er janvier 2021 au 31 décembre 2022 pour les personnes âgées de 10 ans et plus Ils ont également examiné les données de suivi recueillies entre le 1er janvier 2021 et le 15 février 2023 pour ces personnes à condition qu elles n aient pas été testées positives au COVID 19 à la date du suivi Ils ont également examiné d autres variables telles que des pathologies autres que COVID 19 susceptibles d avoir affecté la santé des personnes Les résultats sont surprenants écrit M McCullough après avoir effectué des calculs

said the U N is attempting to attain more executive power Francis Boyle J D Ph D professor of international law at the University of Illinois told The Defender What the secretary general is trying to do is an end run around the United Nations charter and delegate to himself all the powers he can possibly assume The lack of checks and balances is very worrying The member states will have very little or no power Terhorst said noting that these proposals are drawing increasing opposition as they threaten national sovereignty The emergency powers and other proposals contained in the pact may

fully transparent about the process leading up to the Summit of the Future At this time a consensus agreement has not been reached and the status of the three documents has not been honestly presented to the general public Roguski noted that a fourth revision of the Global Digital Compact was drafted Aug 27 but has not been made publicly available on the U N website And according to Dr Meryl Nass founder of Door to Freedom the pact puts the U N at the center of international affairs giving the U N unspecified powers It contains no definitions for the terms used allowing it to be interpreted later in ways citizens may not like A means of turbocharging the Great Reset Critics also connected the U N s proposals to the agendas of other international organizations such as the World Economic Forum WEF which promoted the Great Reset and Fourth Industrial Revolution In spirit the Summit and Pact for the Future is a relaunch of the Great Reset said Tim Hinchliffe publisher of The Sociable Both talk about reshaping our world which includes a desire to transform the financial system and to implement global governance surrounding issues such as climate change healthcare and all things related to the SDGs Sustainable Development Goals While the WEF has no direct authoritative or legislative power to carry out its agendas the Pact for the Future would be signed by member states whose governments wield actual executive and legislative powers Hinchliffe said What they are trying to do is to take the WEF agenda and turn it into solid international law and from there into solid domestic law Boyle said According to Michael Rectenwald Ph D author of The Great Reset and the Struggle for Liberty Unraveling the Global Agenda the U N s proposals have been written in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the global governance regime that it aims to establish Rectenwald said the proposals involve accelerating the achievement of the SDGs and represent the U N

in universal human rights and that enables the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals However the compact contains proposals for the introduction of digital ID digital public goods and digital product passports and calls for addressing disinformation and preventing the misuse of online tools With digital ID it is easier for governments to censor and threaten voices with a different

groups requiring risk benefit assessments and mitigation plans for both with an additional layer of review for research involving pathogens with enhanced pandemic potential The move aims to address concerns about lax oversight and ambiguous guidelines while ensuring that critical research on pandemic preparedness and medical advancements can continue according to Nature In a seemingly contradictory move U S government officials on May 14 temporarily relaxed regulations on how public health laboratories and healthcare facilities handle store and transport H5N1 bird flu samples according to Reuters This 180 day change comes in response to the recent spread of the virus to dairy cattle in nine U S states The revised guidance requested by the Association of Public Health

In her book Unshrunk A Story of Psychiatric Treatment Resistance Laura Delano traces her long journey in the mental health system Delano exposes a culture that medicalizes distress favors long term

This was the message Laura Delano wrote when she signed my copy of Unshrunk A Story of Psychiatric Treatment Resistance at the Brownstone Institute event in Connecticut on April 23 As a physician I have spent years helping patients discontinue medication particularly psychiatric drugs The process is far more difficult than it should be I ve encountered significant barriers gaps in medical training institutional resistance and a clinical culture that rewards prescribing but offers little guidance on how to stop This void in psychiatric care is not just a clinical inconvenience it s a public health issue After reading compelling articles by Jeffrey Tucker and Maryanne Demasi Ph D I was eager to explore Delano s perspective as someone who has lived inside the system My intuition was right what she describes in Unshrunk resonated deeply with what I have witnessed both personally and professionally a system that locks physicians and psychiatrists into rigid protocols favoring long term medication while neglecting adverse effects and failing to offer a viable path to true recovery Delano s memoir is both deeply personal and widely relevant She traces her journey through over a decade of psychiatric treatment beginning at age 13 highlighting not just her experience but a system that medicalizes distress pathologizes adolescence and discourages critical inquiry Her eventual path to healing takes place outside the medical establishment a decision I understand well from my own experience There are few roadmaps for those seeking alternatives and Delano s story powerfully illustrates both the risks and possibilities of forging one s own way Unshrunk is also a broader indictment of modern psychiatry and raises uncomfortable but necessary questions Why are so many young people being placed on psychiatric drugs What constitutes informed consent when patients are rarely told how difficult it can be to stop These questions are especially urgent in light of the findings from the recent Make America Healthy Again MAHA report which details the scale and consequences of overmedication in psychiatry Delano does more than tell her story She compels us to reconsider the assumptions underpinning psychiatric care today Unshrunk challenges the medicalization of normal life experiences and makes a compelling case for transparency education and patient empowerment Most

practice A story that resonates Jeffrey Tucker chairman of Brownstone Institute opened the evening with a compelling introduction Reading eloquently from the first chapter of Unshrunk he set the tone for what was to come a powerful narrative about distorted self perception ego doubt and the fundamental question of how we come to know what is true Delano s story takes readers deep into the internal world of a teenage girl navigating adolescence in the privileged yet often stifling culture of America s upper class When Delano took the stage she spoke with conviction and clarity Her voice carried the weight of experience The story she told was gripping raw vulnerable and unflinchingly honest I found myself holding my breath at times struck by how deeply her journey echoed my own thoughts and observations as a physician But her story is not just her own It reflects the lived experiences of countless others who have suffered under the weight of psychiatric labels and medications many of whom never find the words or the audience to share what they ve endured What makes Delano s account so powerful is not only the depth of her suffering but her ability to look back with honesty insight and compassion She examines her years as a psychiatric patient with a clarity that gives voice to many who have remained unheard Her journey begins like so many others the existential doubts emotional turbulence and identity struggles of adolescence But unlike most teens whose crises resolve with time Laura was swept into the psychiatric system What began as therapy sessions soon escalated into psychiatric evaluations a cascade of diagnoses and countless prescriptions of psychiatric drugs often one used to balance the other in a never ending spiral ushering in a decade defined by chemical interventions and diagnostic labels This isn t a story of neglect or malpractice Quite the opposite Delano received treatment from top tier psychiatrists at elite institutions including McLean Hospital the prestigious teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School She was prescribed the newest medications and followed every medical recommendation She was the model patient Yet instead of improving her symptoms worsened After years of playing the role of the good patient enduring more therapy more diagnoses more medications something finally shifted She began to question the narrative

something finally shifted She began to question the narrative she had been taught Was her brain truly affected by a chemical imbalance or had she been misled Could it be that the very drugs she believed would save her were not the solution but part of the problem This question goes to the core of a long standing and controversial assumption in psychiatry British psychiatrist Joanna Moncrieff a leading critic of the chemical imbalance theory co authored a major 2022 review that found no convincing evidence supporting the idea that depression is caused by low serotonin While many clinicians are aware of this the public conversation has lagged behind In her 2025 book Chemically Imbalanced The Making and Unmaking of the Serotonin Myth Moncrieff explores how the idea of depression as a brain disease became accepted dogma despite the lack of robust scientific support Her work is a sobering reminder of how medical myths can become deeply embedded persisting long after their scientific foundations have eroded Seeing it in practice As a physician specializing in elderly care I found Laura Delano s descriptions uncomfortably familiar During my residency in old age psychiatry I became acutely aware of the devastating effects of long term psychiatric drug use I witnessed the blank stares the tremors the restless pacing and I began to question What symptoms were attributable to the original psychiatric condition and what had emerged as a result of years of medication Could the two even be disentangled Driven by these questions I began reviewing old paper medical charts of patients who had been institutionalized for decades I traced their histories back to their first admissions searching for clues What had triggered that initial diagnosis and prescription To my surprise the presenting issues were often relatively mild certainly not what one would expect given the severity of their condition years later This left me with an unsettling thought Had we actually helped these patients or had we done harm in the name of treatment When I began working in nursing homes in 2013 I was immediately struck by the sheer number of residents on long term psychiatric medications and by how profoundly these drugs affected their daily functioning Often neither the patients nor their families and sometimes not even the physicians recognized the side effects as drug related My clinical instincts shaped by prior experience made me question whether medication was contributing to their physical decline I saw elderly individuals on antidepressants for years after the

years I struggled with severe back pain Alongside the usual painkillers and opioids I was prescribed various combinations of antidepressants anti seizure medications and other drugs often for extended periods As a teenager and later as a medical student I pursued any intervention that promised relief trusting that my doctors knew what they were doing The side effects of both opioids and psychiatric medications were intense and difficult to manage Finding a workable balance became a constant struggle Even when I took lower doses than prescribed I found it nearly impossible to concentrate reading even a few pages of a book was a challenge Over the course of a decade while completing my medical education I underwent three back surgeries During that time I experienced many of the same symptoms I would later recognize in my patients cognitive fog emotional blunting and physical dependency That experience fundamentally shaped how I practiced medicine Eventually I found lasting relief but not

not in more treatment but in stepping back asking different questions and giving the body and mind space to heal The downward spiral In Unshrunk Laura Delano vividly illustrates how despite receiving care from top psychiatrists being prescribed the most advanced medications and engaging fully in therapy she slowly drifted further away from herself from the intelligent athletic young woman she once was Over the years as she dutifully followed their advice her sense of agency and vitality eroded She was first prescribed antidepressants and antipsychotics which soon disrupted her sleep To address the insomnia she was given sleeping pills which left her groggy during the day To maintain her academic performance she had been accepted to Harvard she was prescribed stimulants Her eating patterns became chaotic She developed uncontrollable nighttime binges and experienced significant weight swings In response her doctors increased her antidepressant dosage to smooth things out For a time she managed to keep up appearances She excelled academically competed at a high level in squash and threw herself into college life She faithfully discussed her emotional and physical ups and downs with therapists who offered empathic ears and more pills Each psychiatrist genuinely believed they were helping her They had her best interests at heart and followed established protocols However no one connected her physical symptoms to the medications they were prescribing There was minimal discussion of effects and side effects and no attempts at tapering or stopping Whatever symptoms she reported were simply interpreted as evidence that her psychiatric condition was worsening Delano s experience is a stark example of how a system despite good intentions and expert credentials can fail the very

interaction with doctors every decision about treatment and every assumption about her future After that first diagnosis bipolar disorder a cascade of additional labels followed depression borderline personality disorder eating disorder and alcohol dependence With each new label came a narrowing of possibilities Delano and her family were encouraged to adjust their expectations accordingly A long term psychiatric prognosis was presented as inevitable chronic illness lifelong medication and a managed existence rather than a hopeful recovery Medication they were told would make it manageable Right around the time Laura met her first psychiatrist in the late 90s influential child psychiatrist Joseph Biederman a Harvard Medical School professor and lead researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital was publishing papers about what he considered a common but underdiagnosed condition childhood bipolar disorder This became the label attached to her teenage struggles His research helped popularize the idea that many children s behavioral struggles once seen as developmental or situational were actually signs of a severe chronic mental illness This became the frame through which Delano s adolescent experiences were interpreted In Unshrunk she cites one of Biederman s key articles Unlike adult bipolar patients manic children are seldom characterized by euphoric mood The most common mood disturbance is irritability with affective storms or prolonged and aggressive temper outbursts In this context what might have once been seen as emotional volatility during a turbulent adolescence was now viewed as pathological The implications were enormous Between 1994 and 2003 diagnoses of childhood bipolar disorder increased fortyfold Delano became one of the many swept up in this wave given a serious psychiatric label during a formative period of life and handed a treatment plan that revolved around lifelong pharmacological management What s most disturbing in retrospect

diagnoses also rose dramatically This disturbing trend raises a critical question if these medications are truly effective why are we seeing a proportional increase in long term disability This paradox became the driving force behind journalist Robert Whitaker s groundbreaking book Anatomy of an Epidemic Magic Bullets Psychiatric Drugs and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America Whitaker began to ask what few in the field were willing to Could the treatment itself be contributing to the worsening of outcomes Through extensive interviews and data analysis Whitaker uncovered a troubling pattern Individuals who initially sought help for emotional distress were often diagnosed prescribed psychiatric medications and then found themselves unable to work study or function as they once had Instead of regaining stability many experienced worsening emotional symptoms increasing apathy deteriorating physical health and diminishing life prospects Each new difficulty was met with escalated treatment more medications more diagnoses and often lifelong dependency Whitaker s careful documentation and sharp analysis led him to propose that we may be witnessing an iatrogenic epidemic a situation in which the treatment intended to help is in some cases perpetuating or even causing the illness This idea resonates strongly with Delano s story in Unshrunk and with the experiences of many patients and clinicians who have begun to question the long term impact of psychiatric drug treatment Are we unintentionally creating a system that disables rather than heals And if so what must change The turning point Robert Whitaker s Anatomy of an Epidemic marked a watershed moment for Laura Delano For the first time she allowed herself to ask a question that had long lingered unspoken What would my life have looked like without that first psychiatrist Without all those pills Delano also confronted another reality her alcohol use had become problematic Seeking help she began attending Alcoholics Anonymous AA There she found something she hadn t experienced in the psychiatric system mutual support a sense of equality and stories of personal transformation that gave her hope AA s structure helped her get sober and in that clarity she began to consider an even more daunting step stopping the pills too The challenges of discontinuation What followed was a

years of medication She began tapering step by step decreasing doses over the course of a couple of weeks to months But without understanding the risks of rapid discontinuation she experienced a tidal wave of withdrawal symptoms Delano describes it with haunting precision on page 240 So much of the withdrawal experience is unspeakable there are simply no words in the English language that come close to capturing its otherworldly nature The experience infused not just my every square inch but all that I could see hear taste smell touch all that I believed and valued and thought about Withdrawal hijacked my reality without my realizing it it had to after all as these drugs altered not just the entire landscape of my brain and body but also my consciousness my seat of self Despite the intensity of her suffering she endured Through sheer determination she pieced herself back together finding support outside of psychiatry and holding on to the hope of living a normal life Only later did she fully realize that what she had experienced wasn t a relapse of a psychiatric condition but the physiological consequences of withdrawal It hadn t been the illness returning it was the body and brain adjusting to the absence of powerful drugs I have seen this same pattern repeatedly in my own practice Many medical professionals still lack awareness of what psychiatric withdrawal actually looks like The symptoms often extreme prolonged and debilitating are frequently misinterpreted as signs of mental illness returning rather than as the body s response to chemical disruption As a result patients are often remedicated reinforcing the belief that they cannot function without drugs Fortunately communities of lived experience particularly online peer support groups have developed nuanced knowledge about safe slow tapering These groups often recommend an approach known as hyperbolic tapering where medication is reduced in extremely small increments over long periods allowing the nervous system time to stabilize at each step This patient centred method is beginning to reach medical professionals but the gap between clinical practice and lived experience remains

Morning Consult in July indicated that Democrats are more likely to have positive perceptions of lab grown meat particularly because of its perceived environmental benefits However federal lawmakers

formerly Twitter The HB4 wheat crop has reached the US HB4 technology is the only drought tolerant technology in the world and this new approval shows that Argentine science continues to lead the way in finding solutions to major global challenges However Infobae based on information from Reuters points out According to the industry group US Wheat Associates before drought tolerant HB4 wheat can be marketed in the United States additional measures including field trials are still needed It will take years for Bioceres to complete the additional steps the organisation said The world s first GM wheat is a big step for agribusiness and a step backwards for the world s population For the moment only the population of Argentina is the guinea pig with which GM flour consumed in such products as bread pastries noodles and empanadas is being tested The move to deregulation in the U S is a warning sign for other countries and markets where the grain is exported There are many reasons to reject or at least question GM wheat There is no publicly available evidence of its harmlessness to the health of the population and the environment The supposed studies of the company Bioceres Florimond

initiative from the WHO I am deeply concerned said Nicolas Hulscher an epidemiologist and fellow at the McCullough Foundation They appear to be seeking domain over plants animals and humans globalized central control over public health policies in all participating countries The WHO defines One Health as an integrated unifying approach to balance and optimize the health of people animals and the environment Public Health Canada says One Health considers the relationships between the health of humans animals and the environment suggesting future pandemics or public health threats may cross from animals to humans Hulscher suggested bird flu could become the source of the next pandemic and the basis for imposing global control He said The biopharmaceutical complex wishes for H5N1 bird flu to become a human pandemic as it will give them another opportunity to implement draconian control measures and mandate mRNA injections Their obsession with zoonotic diseases may be due to their

Hulscher accused the public health agencies behind the North American initiative of being captured by Big Pharma He said Pandemic preparedness is only a good thing when the agencies involved lack a nefarious agenda Investigation into safe and effective treatments is critical in combating pandemics Unfortunately our public health agencies are compromised by the biopharmaceutical complex and thus seek to prioritize experimental injections over other medical countermeasures regardless of their safety and efficacy COVID response paved way for vaccine passports The HHS report also suggests that border health measures including vaccine passports could be implemented during a future pandemic or public health emergency The report states The implementation of border health measures at airports seaports and land borders such as screening of passengers vaccination requirements quarantine and entry restrictions etc should be evidence based and aimed to slow the introduction or spread of a pathogen in the region Hulscher claimed the initiative would officially enshrine public health measures first introduced during the COVID 19 pandemic Since the COVID 19 pandemic began the necessary constructs have been created to facilitate vaccine passports They will be able to quickly enact these measures for the next pandemic using the same systems Hulscher said The HHS report also suggests the new initiative should adopt a more systematic approach to tackle the infodemic referring to purported misinformation and disinformation on health related topics The WHO defines the infodemic as too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak According to the WHO the infodemic causes confusion and risk taking behaviours that can harm health and foster mistrust in health authorities This means they will try to prebunk misinformation Hulscher said It appears they wish to abolish free speech to protect public health Hulscher also suggested the North American initiative might become a surrogate for the pandemic treaty if ongoing negotiations fail The WHO is struggling to get member states to agree on their

by James Lyons Weiler Ph D on the autism epidemic The series will dismantle the denialist narratives that have dominated public discourse replacing them with a rigorous testable and biologically

Flanked by researchers parents and reporters Kennedy declared that the United States is facing a public health crisis of staggering proportions the autism epidemic The numbers he cited were not projections or hypothetical models They were hard government issued statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC as of 2022 1 in 31 American 8 year olds more than 3 2 carry a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder ASD a sharp rise from 1 in 36 just two years prior Among boys the rate is even more harrowing 1 in 20 nationally and in California where tracking systems are most sophisticated a staggering 1 in 12 5 This is not just a public health issue Kennedy stated It is a national emergency These numbers are not outliers or isolated spikes They reflect a long standing uninterrupted upward trajectory that began in the early 1990s and has continued through every revision of diagnostic criteria every public awareness campaign and every wave of technological advancement in health surveillance In 2000 the CDC estimated that 1 in 150 children had autism In the 1970s the rate was 1 in 10 000 This means the current figure represents more than a 300 fold increase over historical estimates a climb far too steep to attribute to mere improvements in detection When challenged by a reporter if he denied that efforts to bring healthcare to underserved populations were contributing to the rise in autism cases Kennedy estimated at least 85 of the increase is real And yet that is precisely the line many public health officials and media outlets continue to promote In a coordinated media response following the CDC s 2025 report major outlets such as The Washington Post NPR and The Hill characterized the rise as slight and credited the

he said but better awareness cannot be driving a disability like autism to increase by 300 in 20 years This moment marks a historic inflection point what public philosophers of science might call an epistemic break For the first time in modern history a sitting HHS secretary is rejecting the dogmatic notion that autism s explosive rise is an artifact of increased awareness Instead Kennedy is calling it what the data clearly show it to be a genuine epidemic of neurological and immunological injury in children one that demands immediate rigorous investigation To that end Kennedy announced that HHS in coordination with the CDC and independent global researchers has launched a sweeping agnostic inquiry into the environmental causes of autism This effort involving hundreds of scientists will not be limited to politically safe topics or agency approved hypotheses It will include the examination of pesticides food additives water and air pollution pharmaceuticals and yes vaccines and

decision to stop studying the biological effects of wireless RFR He told The Defender on Wednesday We were having technical problems there was really no interest on the part of the regulatory agencies for us to continue these studies the technical expertise and the drivers behind getting the work done were retired and there s competing priorities always competing priorities in a program like that

Food and Drug Administration s FDA National Center for Toxicological Research the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and NIH s NIEHS After the results from NTP s two year study were published in 2018 NIEHS scientists undertook more research to better understand some of the findings from the 2018 study according to NTP s cellphone radiation website which stated The goals of this new research were to determine the impact of RFR exposure on behavior and stress conduct real time physiological monitoring including evaluation of heart rate investigate whether RFR exposure induces heating and evaluate further whether RFR exposure causes DNA damage However in January 2024 NTP announced it was abandoning the research because it was technically challenging and more resource intensive than expected In April 2024 Children s Health Defense CHD filed requests under the Freedom of Information Act FOIA with NIH to obtain records and communications related to the halted studies to find out why the government shut the studies down and what results if any the studies had generated FDA FCC were uninterested in NTP s results Bucher said he did not know who exactly made the decision to stop the research However both he and former NTP Associate Director Brian Berridge told The Defender that NTP s research portfolio was under the governance of the NTP Executive Committee so the decision may have involved that committee According to the committee s website its members are the heads or their designees of federal

detailed information about the headwinds that go into making a decision like this starting with why NTP began studying RFR in the first place Most of the studies NTP conducted while Bucher was NTP s day to day operations director were undertaken because another federal agency asked NTP to do so he said We operated pretty much on a basis of receiving nominations from other agencies for the work that we ended up doing he said The original radiofrequency radiation nomination came from the Food and Drug Administration which has jurisdiction over the biological aspects of harms from radiofrequency radiation Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us The FDA nominated RFR as an NTP study topic in 1999 NTP soon after began designing its 30 million study that would finally be published in 2018 Bucher said studying RFR was kind of a departure for NTP because we were primarily a chemical oriented cancer and toxicology organization We had done some studies with things other than chemicals but to move into an area that was sort of at the intersection of physics and biology was new for us and it required a fair amount of convincing of staff that we could actually take this on NTP worked with the absolute top engineering firms in the world to design and monitor the RFR exposure chambers used in the study Bucher said We had an exposure facility built in a laboratory in Chicago where we performed these studies He added All the government people involved in setting up those studies are now fully retired The one person that s left following up on any

guidelines adequately protect humans and the environment against the harmful effects of exposure to wireless radiation Smaller exposure chambers were problematic Bucher confirmed that when he was in charge of the NTP division of NIEHS he funded the facilities for subsequent studies The goal of those studies wasn t to fully replicate the 2018 study Instead the follow up studies were smaller mechanistic studies to understand biological changes related to RFR that could be causing cancer By mechanistic Bucher meant the researchers would look for activation of or mutations in genes known to be involved in cancer or the genetic toxicity effects the researchers saw in the 2018 study We would be looking primarily at changes in gene expression in the brain or other target organs and then relate those to what we know about processes involved in cancer So they designed new RFR exposure chambers because the old chambers from the 2018 study were located in a lab that NTP no longer had a contract with and the chambers electrical parts were wearing out and needed to be replaced They were just dismantled because they were taking up space and we were paying for it So we created smaller chambers in a contract laboratory where we had an active contract Bucher said Unfortunately the researchers encountered technical difficulties in getting small exposure chambers to work Building them was not a problem Bucher said but getting them to actually work in a way that would reproduce what was done in the larger chambers in the earlier study was challenging more challenging than we expected The researchers made some progress but then COVID hit and things just became difficult so that project sort of languished for a long time By the time we would come out with the next generation of studies industry would be on to something else The research faced other challenges too Bucher said The government has always been way behind the technologies that are being developed in

other high income countries according to a research letter published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics Researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University calculated the median mortality rates among children ages 0 19 with rates in Canada Australia Japan and several European countries from 1999 to 2019 They compared those rates to median mortality rates among the same age groups in the U S to identify excess deaths the number above and beyond those median rates in the U S and found that in the U S there were 413 948 excess deaths among young people during that time Each year nearly 20 000 deaths among youths ages 0 to 19 years would not have occurred had US youths experienced the median mortality rates of 16 comparison countries the authors wrote More than half of these deaths involved infants reflecting disproportionately high US infant mortality rates As young people in the U S died at higher rates the median mortality rates in other countries dropped widening the gap The chances of a child surviving to age 20 are now decreasing Dr Steven Woolf the study s co author told NBC News Where data were available researchers also examined trends through 2022 That data shows a stepwise increase in deaths among children ages 10 and up starting in 2020 and continuing through 2022 Beginning in 2010 youths ages 10 19 accounted for an increasing proportion of the deaths according to the authors Suicide rates among that age group started rising in 2007 homicides began rising in 2013 and fatal drug overdoses in 2014 U S infant mortality rates trends and possible causes Infant mortality rates in the U S as of 2022 are 5 6 infant deaths per 1 000 live births according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC The rate rose 3 in 2022 the first increase since 2001 according to a National Center for Health Statistics report The trend represents a sharp reversal as between 2000 and 2020 infant deaths had decreased by 21 Overall the U S infant death rate has consistently

along with accidental suffocation in a sleeping environment and other deaths from unknown causes as manifestations of the broader phenomenon of sudden unexpected infant death SUID The agency attributes three fourths 75 of the approximately 3 400 annual SUID deaths to SIDS and unknown causes Dr Paul Thomas pediatrician and author of the forthcoming book Vax Facts What to Consider Before Vaccinating at All Ages Stages of Life told The Defender that those unknown causes are likely also SIDS and that extensive evidence links SIDS to vaccination He said Nearly 20 000 infants died in the USA in 2021 for an overall infant mortality rate of 5 4 deaths per 1 000 live births The CDC lists SIDS as the number three cause of death following birth defects and preterm birth with 1 389 cases But deaths that used to be classified as SIDS are often classified as suffocation or simply unknown these days There were 1 062 deaths attributed to unknown causes and 905 attributed to accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed for a total of 3 356 When an infant dies no matter how soon after vaccination coroners and pathologists do not have any codes for vaccine related death available as options so these deaths are generally coded as SIDS unknown or suffocation Thomas said pediatricians are not educated about the link so even when it clearly occurs they don t recognize it I was taught that SIDS was due to parents smoking in the room the room being too hot babies co sleeping or sleeping on surfaces that were too soft or moms smothering their babies while nursing he wrote

Sayer Ji founder of GreenMedInfo told The Defender the framework does not address upstream health determinants like poor diet exposure to industrial toxicants and chronic stress that adversely impact human health He also suggested that the crisis oriented approach to One Health threatens democratic governance By focusing on zoonotic diseases the framework risks amplifying crisis driven health governance further entrenching centralized global systems that bypass democratic oversight Ji said Promoting vaccine development biosecurity driven health model The One Health framework contains seven goals including a focus on pathogen surveillance pandemic preparedness vaccine development and the operation and safety of biolabs The framework s surveillance strategy includes tracking the effects of social economic and environmental determinants of health and upstream drivers such as climate change and land use on priority endemic emerging and reemerging zoonotic diseases and other priority

diseases and pandemic preparedness It will inform One Health collaboration across the U S government over the next five years Dr Meryl Nass founder of Door to Freedom told The Defender the framework seeks to bypass existing public health policymaking processes The plan is aimed at further embedding the extremely fuzzy concept of One Health into all government agencies creating new interagency structures and mechanisms for decision making outside the usual chain of command structures Nass said Ji connected the framework to globalist efforts to usurp national policymaking related to public health He said it aligns with globalist efforts such as the proposed World Health Organization s WHO Pandemic Treaty which seeks to centralize health decision making under non democratically elected bodies The WHO has argued that a global pandemic treaty is necessary to respond to future public health threats including the next pandemic Critics have argued the treaty would undermine national sovereignty The WHO tried to enact the pandemic treaty in time for last year s World Health Assembly but failed to do so Negotiations on the treaty have since continued Nass said the framework would help international organizations like the WHO attain unprecedented power over national governments I strongly suspect One Health has been positioned to redefine almost everything in the world as being related to health and therefore under the jurisdiction of the WHO U N Emergency Platform or some other entity that will take over global management when emergencies are declared Nass said Nass cited the U N s recently adopted Pact for the Future as one such entity This concentration of power may also limit the autonomy of nations and individuals in choosing health policies tailored to their unique needs Ji said Agencies like the CDC USDA and DOI have institutionalized these priorities and their alignment with global initiatives like the WHO Pandemic Treaty ensures their persistence Ji

According to the Pandemic Fund s Strategic Plan for 2024 2029 the fund will do more than fund projects in developing countries it proposes to expand the global digital health infrastructure The plan calls for the development of digital infrastructure within public institutions to conduct simulation exercises and real time outbreak data collection and analysis and the development of digital

und dem medizinischen Establishment trotz seiner nachgewiesenen Wirksamkeit gegen COVID 19 grundlos schlecht gemacht wurde Die Autoren wiesen darauf hin dass der ehemalige CNN Moderator Chris Cuomo vor kurzem bekannt gab dass er Ivermectin gegen Long COVID einnimmt oder gegen seinen COVID 19 Impfschaden welchen er andeutete aber nicht bestätigte Cuomo gab zu Wir wurden schlecht über Ivermectin

asked to stay home for an unspecified reason The U S service members who became sick recovered from their symptoms within 6 days according to the report adding that they were not tested for COVID 19 Ebright said a lab leak most likely occurred in Wuhan in August or September 2019 Jeffrey Tucker president and founder of the Brownstone Institute said he has sensed for a long time now that COVID 19 was already spreading in North America from late 2019 This new report seems to confirm that What we still do not know is when precisely the military authorities knew about the lab leak and the spread of a novel virus Tucker said This report is instructive but hardly complete Tucker said that in communications he had at the time with attendees at the games in Wuhan he learned that an unusual illness was spreading at the event From late 2020 I was on the phone with people who were in Wuhan at those Olympics who became ill with something they perceived as extremely strange Tucker said They were also hushed by their superiors which they also found to be very odd Why should getting sick be a national security issue According to the December 2022 report though the U S did not inform other countries of a possible lab leak or viral spread in Wuhan DoD has not engaged in any discussions with allied or partner militaries about illness associated with participation in the 2019 Military

the report doesn t definitively prove an early COVID 19 outbreak Wade said The infected people were not tested for COVID 19 as there was no available test at the time they all quickly recovered and

week decided against hearing a lawsuit against Apple that sought to determine whether the Federal Communication Commission s radiofrequency radiation guidelines preempt state safety and health law You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The U S Supreme Court this week decided against hearing a lawsuit against Apple that sought to determine whether the Federal Communication Commission s FCC radiofrequency RF radiation guidelines preempt state safety and health laws The plaintiffs in the lawsuit nearly 30 iPhone users allege that Apple s iPhone emitted RF radiation that regularly exceeded the federal exposure limit and that Apple violated California state health and safety laws by failing to warn consumers about the health and safety risks of holding the device close to the body The plaintiffs on Jan 23 filed a petition for a writ of certiorari or cert request asking the Supreme Court to hear the case after the U S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled on Aug 26 2022 that the plaintiffs claims were invalid because the FCC s federal guidance impliedly preempted state health and safety law Commenting on the U S Supreme Court s decision W Scott McCollough Children s Health Defense s CHD lead litigator for electromagnetic radiation cases said the Supreme Court s denial of the plaintiffs request was disappointing but there is still hope that the question of federal preemption of state health and safety law will be addressed McCollough who in March co authored an amicus brief submitted by CHD and eight nonprofits in support of the plaintiffs request said We wish the court would ve taken it up but it s not over There will be another chance McCollough told The Defender there is still a significant circuit split meaning that different U S Circuit courts have rendered differing decisions on the issue of whether FCC guidelines on human exposure limits on RF radiation preempt state health and safety law and typically that is something the Supreme Court will resolve at some time An amicus brief is filed by non parties to litigation to provide information that has bearing on the issues and to assist the court in reaching the correct decision It comes from the Latin words amicus curiae which means friend of the court If we can ever get the FCC to change the rules then we don t have to worry about state court law The Supreme Court s decision is a blow to individuals in the Western U S seeking to sue telecommunication companies under state laws because it means the 9th Circuit s August ruling remains unchallenged and will probably be precedent setting in the 9th Circuit said McCollough who is a former Texas assistant attorney general and telecom and administrative law attorney", "chunk_id":

the 9th Circuit no ability to obtain any kind of state law and specifically tort remedies McCollough added The 9th Circuit is the largest judicial circuit in the U S and covers California Oregon Washington Nevada Idaho Montana Arizona Alaska Hawaii Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands However there are other potential remedies McCollough said For instance there are other available remedies under federal statutes and an FCC regulation cannot preempt a federal statute established by Congress so there can be no preemption question We might have what we call a conflict of laws question in which you have two statutes that don t fit well together McCollough said In that situation the federal statute established by Congress should take priority over the FCC guidelines but that s not fully determinative he added There are many reasons why the Supreme Court may choose to not hear a case even if they are interested in the issue at hand McCollough told The Defender For instance the Supreme Court receives approximately 7 000 8 000 requests per annual term to hear cases and only hears arguments in about 80 cases Additionally the court may have thought the case was not a good vehicle for addressing the question of federal preemption said McCollough McCollough pointed out that by the time the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Apple had reached the 9th Circuit they had dropped all personal injury claims and narrowed their case to focus on how Apple had failed to disclose the health risks of its devices McCollough said it s possible the Supreme Court wanted to wait until it had a case seeking state law remedies for actual personal injuries rather than a claimed failure to disclose potential risks Finally what the Supreme Court s decision really does McCollough said is make ever more important the win we CHD had in 2021 in the District of Columbia Circuit where that court told the FCC to re evaluate the RF emission rules the very rules whose operation were held to be

on Facebook The company deplatformed CHD from Facebook and Instagram in August 2022 and still has not reinstated the accounts You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The U S Supreme Court today denied Children s Health Defense s CHD petition to hear its censorship case against Meta the parent company of Facebook CHD sued Meta in August 2020 and filed an amended complaint in November 2020 alleging that government actors partnered with Facebook to censor CHD s speech particularly speech related to vaccines and COVID 19 that should have been protected under the First Amendment The company deplatformed CHD from Facebook and Instagram in August 2022 and has not reinstated the accounts The 9th Circuit U S Court of Appeals in August 2024 sided with Facebook ruling that Meta s censorship was the result of the company s policy rather than government coercion On Jan 6 CHD petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case Less than 24 hours later Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the company was ending its third party fact checking program a program it had used to censor and later deplatform CHD and others CHD CEO Mary Holland who said CHD is deeply disappointed that the Supreme Court declined to hear the case told The Defender It has been obvious since the time the case was filed in August 2020 that Facebook and its allied media worked hand in glove with the federal public health authorities to censor CHD and to promote government sponsored false information on COVID and other vaccine issues CHD General Counsel Kim Mack Rosenberg echoed Holland s disappointment She said We at CHD believe strongly that consumers of media have a right to hear a variety of viewpoints and sources and that those like CHD that communicate information that may challenge the prevailing narrative have a right to be heard These are fundamental hallmarks of democracy and it is deeply disheartening that the Supreme Court chose not to address this critical issue National healthcare and constitutional practice attorney Rick Jaffe who is not involved in the case but represents CHD in other cases said In my view the First Amendment cannot be so easily evaded by outsourcing censorship but that fight will have to continue in another case Attorney Roger Teich who is representing CHD in its case against Meta declined to immediately comment on the

Mack Rosenberg said Very occasionally you see a more detailed response to a petition but that s the exception not the rule Each year the U S Supreme Court hears about 80 of the roughly 7 000 to 8 000 cases it s petitioned to hear according to its website The court did not say whether any justices dissented in the CHD case against Meta No justice wrote a dissenting opinion but that doesn t mean no one dissented Such a written dissent would be rare but not without precedent Holland said Mack Rosenberg said the Supreme Court denies a petition if fewer than four of the nine justices vote to grant it based on the Rule of Four The decision to deny is not a ruling on the merits of the case and does not require a unanimous vote among the justices she said In other words it is unknown whether all or simply the majority of the Supreme Court justices supported the decision to reject CHD s case Holland said that although she believes the Supreme Court did not get this right the problem the case sought to address has lessened The censorship industrial complex agreements of the past seem to have gone by the wayside at least for now and for that I am grateful she said Meta has not reinstated CHD s Facebook and Instagram accounts which combined reached millions of readers In January following Zuckerberg s announcement that Facebook was discontinuing its fact checking program CHD launched a petition asking him to restore its Facebook and Instagram accounts The petition still active has 22 462 signatures Meta did not immediately respond when The Defender asked if and when the company

Supreme Court suggests the court has questions that it believes Meta should address Jaffe also noted that although the Supreme Court declined to hear CHD s case against Meta it has shown increased concern about viewpoint based censorship in other cases including the recent Chiles v Salazar case about whether a law that censors conversations between counselors and their clients based on the viewpoints expressed violates the First Amendment I think the legal tide is turning he said So this is not the end of the road but one step in a long campaign to restore First Amendment protections in the digital age According to Mack Rosenberg there s an urgent need to do so since censorship causes widespread and insidious damage She said Without outlets for a variety of viewpoints to share information people don t even know what they are not hearing and this impacts their ability to think critically and determine their own opinions If all one hears is the prevailing narrative that may

In interviews with the Times current and former USAID officials members of health organizations and experts in infectious diseases described a world made more perilous following the Trump administration s recent cuts to the agency However biosafety expert Richard H Ebright Ph D professor of chemistry and chemical biology and lab director at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University said the Times got it backwards In an exclusive interview today with The Defender Ebright shared facts not mentioned in the Times article that he said contradicts the Times reporting The facts of the matter are that USAID s and other agencies support for overseas labs and reckless overseas research has been setting the stage for disease outbreaks Ending this insanity will set the stage for reducing disease outbreaks Ebright is on the leadership team of Biosafety Now a nongovernmental organization NGO that advocates for reducing numbers of high level biocontainment laboratories and for strengthening biosafety biosecurity and biorisk management for research on pathogens He has testified at U S House and Senate hearings on biosafety biosecurity and biorisk management according to Rutgers University Children s Health Defense CEO Mary Holland said Dr Ebright is spot on lessening the U S role in funding pandemic preparedness will reduce outbreaks not increase them Holland who receives the print version of the Times said the March 7 article appeared on today s front page under the headline Deepening Peril of Disease As Trump Cuts Foreign Aid According to Holland the Times core message to readers was be afraid The article assumes that cuts to USAID funding means that disease outbreaks will increase while the reality is likely the opposite

particularly USAID DTRA BTRP NIH Fogarty Center and NIH NIAID have spent billions of dollars over the last two decades to construct unneeded and unsafe labs overseas and to fund unneeded and reckless research on discovering and enhancing new dangerous pathogens in labs overseas According to Ebright USAID gave 60 million to the now debarred criminal NGO EcoHealth Alliance to discover new dangerous pathogens according to USAspending gov EcoHealth used those funds to conduct the wantonly reckless research in Wuhan on SARS coronaviruses that caused COVID 19 killing 20 million and costing 25 trillion Ebright said Ebright also said that USAID gave over 200 million to EcoHealth and its partners in Project PREDICT to discover new bioweapons agents overseas according to USAspending gov Prior to the emergence of COVID 19 Ebright said USAID was planning to launch a 6 fold expanded 1 2 billion megaproject the Global Virome Project for EcoHealth and its partners to discover even more new

financial relief for farmers actions to reduce regulatory burdens and increase egg imports and 100 million for vaccine research In a Wall Street Journal op ed published the same day Rollins said the USDA is working with the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE to cut hundreds of millions of dollars of wasteful spending that will pay for the strategy s 1 billion price tag According to the op ed the average price of a dozen eggs increased 237 in the last four years Rollins said the increase is due in part to continuing outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza which has devastated American poultry farmers and slashed the egg supply The USDA did not respond to requests for comment by press time Chicken culls have had disastrous consequences Some farmers and medical experts questioned the USDA s plan under which chicken culls will continue Vermont attorney and farmer John Klar said Economic relief for poultry farmers is appropriate as is monitoring flocks and supporting improved biosecurity measures However Klar said he is dismayed by the fearmongering about bird flu and fears that a silver bullet to tackle the crisis may not be available According to Rollins about 166 million laying hens have been culled since 2022 Culling can be an effective way to stop an outbreak CNN reported But according to epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher of the McCullough Foundation bird

contributed to higher egg prices due to a reduced egg supply and because taxpayers are footing the bill for the dead birds Over the past three years the U S government has issued 1 25 billion in compensation to farmers who have had their chickens culled Approximately 20 of those payouts have gone to farms that have become infected multiple times CNN reported Hulscher said these payments have

said culling mostly healthy birds doesn t stop bird to animal transmission of the next index case coming into farms by migratory birds mainly mallard ducks Instead he said Culling causes the spread of H5N1 from birds to mankind and puts the workers at unnecessary risk Iowa farmer Howard Vlieger said that during a 2016 bird flu outbreak in his area USDA officials stacked culled chickens in compost piles Within days infected flies made their way to nearby farms leading to the death of a laying hen They notified USDA and USDA subsequently euthanized every bird on their farm even though the broilers were not exhibiting any sign of sickness Vlieger said Vlieger also questioned the accuracy of tests used to determine whether birds are infected He cited the example of a neighboring farm where a chicken initially tested positive to a USDA test but a second test was negative We know the tests they use have very low reliability Vlieger said Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Natural immunity more effective than vaccination in birds Klar suggested that better policy would be to let the birds develop flock immunity which would be better for humans as well

the development of cancer like or mutated cells in the lab meat that could be absorbed into the human bloodstream after digestion In an interview with The Defender Hanson said The company also notes that it is using genetic engineering to promote continuous growth of the cells This is disturbing in that it is likely that the genes being manipulated can promote cancers He added that cancer causing genes should not be used in food production Food additives that cause cancer are illegal Unfortunately the company does not list exactly which genes it is using for genetically engineered cells

orders of magnitude worse than animal production Proponents of lab grown meat the companies developing it nonprofits created to promote it and media organizations and researchers funded by industry investors say growing meat in bioreactors is key to reducing the environmental impact of industrial meat production and to ending animal suffering But the environmental benefits are largely assumed based on the known impacts of the existing industrial meat system rather than actually measured Or they are estimated based on narrow and potentially misleading metrics Recent research from the University of California Davis made headlines when it reported that lab grown meat s environmental impact is likely to be orders of magnitude higher than that of regular animal grown meat based on current and near term future production methods The research based on lab grown beef production assessed energy needed and greenhouse gas emissions in all stages of production and found the global warming potential of lab based meat was 25 times greater than that of animal meat Similar research by investigators in the LEAP Livestock Environment and People program at the Oxford Martin School

has cut over 1 billion dollars to support local food to schools and food banks The organization has tested school lunches across the country and found the presence of heavy metals pesticides and other toxins that are being served to children daily That makes it particularly important that school lunch programs focus on providing access to healthy foods Honeycutt said She added Our children s health

administration to re fund the USDA program for local organic food in schools and food banks supporting our local farmers children and the future of America Honeycutt said they suspected that one of the reasons for the cancellation was the misuse of funds It has been reported to us that the funds for local foods in one school district funneled money to a local soda company and flooded the school

according to researchers at the University of California Davis Current guidelines don t prohibit ultraprocessed foods and often allow for unhealthy foods as long as certain nutritional guidelines are met regarding calories sugar and fat content according to The Lancet Regional Health Americas School lunch testing by several organizations that advocate for healthy school lunches found that school lunches often contain a high number of toxins For example food items served to school kids in Virginia Maryland and Washington D C contained heavy metals including lead and roughly 50 pesticides according to testing commissioned by Spotlight on America and reported in October 2024 The Health Research Institute HRI an accredited independent lab in Iowa conducted the testing and identified 49 pesticides with 38 different pesticides detected in just one elementary school lunch Among them was carbendazim a fungicide banned in most European countries that can cause infertility and endocrine

analyze the contents of 43 school lunches gathered from public schools in 15 U S states HRI Co founder CEO and Chief Scientist John Fagan said Spotlight on America s 2024 testing produced comparable results to the 2022 testing However he said the 2022 testing also looked at nutritional value an area that needs more attention Many U S school kids come from low income families Fagan said in an earlier interview with The Defender They re food insecure School lunch is probably the best meal many of those kids have during the day And yet it doesn t give them the essential nutrients they need for their brain to grow and be healthy and strong According to Fagan fast food companies including Subway Pizza Hut McDonald s Taco Bell and Chick fil A commonly supply school lunches Other suppliers

take effect on May 7 Rep Stephanie Gricius who sponsored the bill said in an email to The Defender that she was thrilled the governor signed it She said The proper role of government is to provide safe clean drinking water not mass medicate the public While we have banned it from being added to our water systems we have also increased access to fluoride tablets through the pharmacies so any Utahn who wishes to take it may But it will now be a decision each individual can make for themselves The new law bans water fluoridation but also gives pharmacists new authority to prescribe fluoride

milestone for public health in the country and part of a nationwide trend toward removing this toxin from our water Cox signed the bill amid growing opposition to water fluoridation across the country

recommended by the public health agencies The research also indicates that water fluoridation has little to no effect on dental health Utah provided a working scientific study Dentist Griffin Cole

fluoride lawsuit said she was glad to see states making moves to protect their citizens particularly the most vulnerable groups developing fetuses and bottle fed infants who are at greatest risk of fluoride neurotoxicity Staudenmaier said that focusing on fluoride for 80 years had created blind spots with unintended consequences and she hopes that now dental associations will use their large membership to focus on increasing Medicaid reimbursements ensuring that low income individuals have access to dental care Staudenmaier added They should advocate for reducing sugar in public school

times the load of COVID 19 viruses in their nostrils compared to the unvaccinated You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A groundbreaking preprint paper by the prestigious Oxford University Clinical Research Group published Aug 10 in The Lancet includes alarming findings devastating to the COVID vaccine rollout The study found vaccinated individuals carry 251 times the load of COVID 19 viruses in their nostrils compared to the unvaccinated While moderating the symptoms of infection the jab allows vaccinated individuals to carry unusually high viral loads without becoming ill at first potentially transforming them into presymptomatic superspreaders This phenomenon may be the source of the shocking post vaccination surges in heavily vaccinated populations globally The paper s authors Chau et al demonstrated widespread vaccine failure and transmission under tightly controlled circumstances in a hospital lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City Viet Nam The scientists studied healthcare workers who were unable to leave the hospital for two weeks The data showed that fully vaccinated workers about two months after injection with the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccine AZD1222 acquired carried and presumably transmitted the Delta variant to their vaccinated colleagues They almost certainly also passed the Delta infection to susceptible unvaccinated people including their patients Sequencing of strains confirmed the workers transmitted SARS CoV 2 to one another This is consistent with the observations in the U S from Farinholt and colleagues and congruent with comments by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conceding COVID 19 vaccines have failed to stop transmission of SARS CoV 2 On Feb 11 the World Health Organization indicated the AZD1222 vaccine efficacy of 63 09 against the development of symptomatic SARS CoV 2 infection The conclusions of the Chau paper support the warnings by leading medical experts that the partial non sterilizing immunity from the three notoriously leaky COVID 19 vaccines allow carriage of 251 times the viral load of SARS CoV 2 as compared to samples from the pre vaccination era in 2020 Thus we have a key piece to the puzzle explaining why the Delta outbreak is so formidable fully vaccinated are participating as COVID 19 patients and acting as powerful Typhoid Mary style super spreaders of the infection Vaccinated individuals are blasting out concentrated viral explosions into their communities and fueling new COVID surges Vaccinated healthcare workers are almost certainly infecting

current vaccinated healthcare workers as potential threats to high risk patients and coworkers CLARIFICATION The comparison of viral load between vaccinated and unvaccinated pre vaccine era as reported in the Chau et al 2021 Lancet preprint is between two different variants of SARS CoV 2 Dr McCullough states directly that samples were compared to those from the pre vaccination era of 2020 Thus differences between these two groups aren t a result of vaccination status alone The authors of the Chau et al 2021 study in their rebuttal to our piece point out another preprint Li et al 2021 which reported a difference in viral load of 1000 between patients infected with the Delta variant and patients infected with A B However the vaccination status of the Delta variant patients in this preprint is not reported Thus no one here has done a direct comparison between unvaccinated Delta patients and unvaccinated A B patients to determine the true difference in viral load In two additional preprint scientific publications Riemersma et al 2021 Chia et al 2021 comparable viral loads of the Delta variant of SARS CoV 2 are reported among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients However this itself is an indictment of vaccine efficacy as both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals possess the ability to spread the Delta variant Simply stated COVID vaccines have failed to

percentage of kindergartners with religious exemptions increased in 36 states and the District of Columbia and exceeds 5 in 17 states led by Idaho 15 4 Utah 10 3 Oregon 9 8 Alaska 9 4 and Arizona 9 1 The AP attributed rising exemption rates to local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated and online misinformation and the political divide that emerged around COVID 19 vaccines But according to John Gilmore executive director of the Autism Action Network Parents are being far more judicious about vaccines now Everybody knows someone who was injured by the COVID 19 shot COVID 19 taught everybody that the vaccine industry will blatantly lie to persuade people to use their products and if they can t persuade you they will use coercion Children s Health Defense is a plaintiff in an antitrust lawsuit against the Trusted News Initiative a partnership formed by the AP Reuters The Washington Post BBC and other legacy media alleging it engaged in anticompetitive practices and colluded with tech platforms to censor alternative viewpoints on COVID 19 Last month the U S Department of Justice filed a statement of interest backing the plaintiffs in the case Gilmore said the growing popularity of alternative media helps spread information about vaccine risks and exemptions leading more parents to opt out of vaccinating their children There has also been enormous growth in media that do not accept advertising from the vaccine cartel that will publish vaccine critical information unlike the legacy media he said Gilmore also said the expansion of the childhood immunization schedule which has added 26 doses since 2015 has led more parents to question the recommendations CDC figures don t include kids who are unvaccinated because they re homeschooled The true percentage of unvaccinated children may be higher than the CDC data shows in part because of the growing number of homeschooled children in the U S Gilmore said These numbers only include a very small portion of homeschoolers who are now after explosive growth during COVID about 7 of all school age children and credible sources estimate about half of these children are not compliant with the CDC schedule he said Gilmore also said the influx of undocumented immigrant children in recent years has likely increased the total number of unvaccinated students He said Beginning

outbreak The AP reported that the CDC traditionally publishes kindergarten vaccination and vaccine exemption figures alongside a write up stressing the importance of vaccinations and analyzing the past year s vaccination trends That write up was not included this year The AP said of the CDC report The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past That is in keeping with communications from U S Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr a leading voice in the anti vaccine movement before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies According to the AP the lower vaccination rates for kindergarteners and higher rate of religious exemptions come as the U S experiences its worst year for measles spread in more than three decades with more than 1 300 cases so far But for research scientist and author James Lyons Weiler Ph D this narrative is based on a dangerously outdated and scientifically inaccurate portrayal of measles transmission by framing the unvaccinated as the sole source of outbreaks Measles outbreaks have occurred in populations with 90 95 coverage repeatedly in recent history due to clustering waning immunity and birth cohort dynamics Lyons Weiler said In truth outbreaks today are complex phenomena driven by multiple factors including under diagnosis waning immunity and a failure to update the MMR

Interview With Tucker Carlson Sparks New Debate The American Academy of Pediatrics and The New York Times say there are no perverse incentives for doctors to push vaccines as U S Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr recently claimed But data from insurance incentive structures and an analysis of a pediatric practice s income show that high vaccination rates are key to a profitable practice You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Do pediatricians generate a significant portion of their profits by pushing vaccines If so what role do insurance companies play in that scheme Or as The New York Times recently reported is the opposite true are vaccines a money pit for doctors In a July 15 article the Times took issue with a comment made by U S Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr during a June 30 interview with Tucker Carlson Kennedy told Carlson that there are perverse incentives for pediatricians to push vaccines The Times article featured a doctor who couldn t afford to offer vaccines and comments from leadership at the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP who said statements like the one Kennedy made during his interview with Carlson are misleading and dangerous The AAP also responded on X linking to the Times article with a picture of Kennedy and the comment Pediatricians do not profit off vaccines In a Facebook post the AAP said As The New York Times explains most pediatricians either break even or even lose money when they offer vaccines Ryan Champlin who coordinates vaccine purchasing contracts for doctors at Cook Children s Health Care System in Texas told The Defender that incentives for vaccination are typically linked to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC childhood immunization schedule Champlin said doctors get the extra payments when a certain percentage of their patients typically 80 or more take all of the vaccines on the schedule The Times article despite its criticism of Kennedy s perverse incentives comment acknowledged that about half of pediatricians have value based contracts with insurers an insurance reimbursement model that rewards providers with extra payments for hitting specific metrics that are considered markers for quality of care According to Children s Health Defense CEO Mary Holland these types of incentives have completely distorted pediatric care in America In an interview with OAN

doctors have violated one of the central tenets of the patient doctor relationship In other instances of a preferred product leading to greater profits such as doctors prescribing higher cost drugs that net more money for them and drugmakers Lyons Weiler said everyone knows it s a problem and we talk about it However when it comes to vaccines The entire system presumes that increased vaccination is in and of itself always a good thing for every patient which isn t the case he said Incentivizing doctors to vaccinate every child doesn t take the individual medical needs of each patient into account and creates an unnecessary tension between provider and patient Lyons Weiler said It is increasingly common today for pediatricians to drop families who don t want their children to take some or all of the recommended vaccines according to a 2020 article in Human Vaccine Immunotherapy Until 2016 the AAP recommended against pediatricians refusing to treat children whose parents didn t want them immunized However that year the AAP changed its policy stating instead that dismissing such families is an acceptable option Financial incentives to vaccinate now a matter of survival for pediatric practices Champlin who runs a vaccine buying group that offers doctors a small discount on vaccine purchases told The Defender that immunization is not particularly profitable for practices because there is a cost to purchasing and storing the vaccines a small administration fee and losses when people refuse vaccines that doctors have already purchased However Dr Paul Thomas who ran general pediatrics practice has shown that it is very difficult for pediatricians to maintain a viable practice if they don t administer vaccines according to or close to the CDC schedule But for pediatricians who follow the CDC recommendations their practice can be quite profitable Thomas author of Vax Facts What to Consider Before Vaccinating at All Ages Stages of Life said pediatric practices have high overhead costs typically 60 80 of gross income and most would not survive without the income from vaccines and well baby visits during which the vaccines are often administered In

schedule could affect the bottom line Thomas and his administrative team analyzed his practice s financial and visit data for a month They identified the administration fee lost for each vaccine recommended by the CDC but refused by parents He explained the analysis in this short video The results published in a 2021 peer reviewed paper in the International Journal of Vaccine Theory Practice and Research co authored with Lyons Weiler showed that when patients deviate from the schedule losses exceed 1 million for a practice that bills approximately 3 million per year It becomes clear that the financial incentives to vaccinate are now a matter of survival for pediatric practices Thomas concluded A big hidden thank you for vaccinating income Thomas explained that excluding bonuses income from vaccines is derived in two ways First pediatricians get a small administration fee for each shot The fees vary but are typically around 40 for the first antigen and 20 for each subsequent antigen For example the measles mumps and rubella or MMR vaccine has three antigens which add up to an 80 administration fee Thomas called the administration fee the big hidden thank you for vaccinating income He said It would be justified if pediatricians were spending 15 20 minutes providing informed consent each visit going over the real risks and the often marginal to non existent benefits of each of the vaccines being recommended The reality is that doctors providers typically hand the parent the CDC produced propaganda piece called the VIS Vaccine Information Statement as they walk out the door saying something like Look this over and the nurse will be in to give the vaccines It often is the nurse or MA medical assistant who gives the VIS so the provider does nothing related to informed consent Physicians also apply a small upcharge on the price of the vaccine itself which is typically about 5 and not a significant source of income Thomas said The most substantial financial incentive comes from the value based care incentives which tie payments to meeting benchmarks These benchmarks vary by insurance provider but Thomas said a typical requirement would be 80 of patients being fully vaccinated by age 2 He estimated that bonuses typically add up to 100 000 or more per year per physician A large practice that does a good job vaccinating and following the CDC schedule",

this that mainstream media won t write Please Donate Today How do the incentive programs work The value based care incentive model also called pay for performance as opposed to the fee for service model has expanded in recent years particularly after government insurers like Medicaid and Medicare began implementing it Today most major insurance providers offer incentives for various procedures and drugs from the number of children vaccinated to the number of patients taking statins undergoing breast or colorectal cancer screenings or having their eyes dilated The metrics vary by insurer and some vaccine incentives kick in even at low rates In the case of pediatric practices and vaccines insurers typically pay incentives based on the percentage of children in a practice that receive all of the Combo 10 vaccines which are 24 or 25 shots of 10 vaccines recommended for children by age 2 Meridian a health insurance vendor that administers Medicaid Medicare and Health Insurance Marketplace in Michigan increases its incentives based on the percentage of children in a practice who get the shots In its program providers serving Medicaid recipients get a 50 per child incentive if they reach the 50th percentile for vaccination in their practice where 27 49 of the children in their care receive Combo 10 shots on time Doctors are paid another 50 incentive for every 13 year old who gets one Tdap meningococcal and HPV shot if they meet the 50th percentile target or 34 3 in that group If providers hit the 75th percentile for Combo 10 and adolescent vaccines the payment goes up

175 per child for hitting the Combo 10 benchmark 75 for the childhood flu shot 150 for the adolescent Combo 2 and 75 for the adolescent HPV vaccine That s a flat rate incentive of 475 for every 13 year old child if all of the shots are given According to the AAP an average pediatric practitioner treats approximately 1 546 children which means a bonus of 660 915 if 90 of those children take all of the shots The number of patients seen by practitioners working in HMOs is even higher Those bonuses don t include incentives for other things such as wellness visits and prescriptions for asthma medication which have their own incentive structures The AAP s Dr James Perrin told the Times that the payments are modest accounting for just a small share of what insurers pay to a given clinic Another pediatrician Dr David Higgins told the Times that calling the incentives perverse misrepresents the motivations of pediatricians who had willingly gone into one of the lowest paid medical specialties The average pediatrician earns 260 000 per year Lyons Weiler said he was curious how they would define the threshold at which an incentive becomes perverse It would be a really distasteful conversation to have because then we re trying to say OK how much is the violation of someone s informed consent worth How much is it worth to put children at risk who might have had serious adverse events or even moderate adverse events for vaccines so that they make their quota He argued that such incentives don t belong in medicine because they inhibit doctors ability to see every patient s well being as their number one priority Otherwise the accountants are running medicine not ethical doctors Lyons Weiler said We need to free physicians from the shackles of profit incentivized

to Shore Up U S Vaccination Policy Former FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg and Dr Harvey Fineberg former president of the Institute of Medicine will lead the eight member steering committee for the new Vaccine Integrity Project They said the project will use the best available evidence to safeguard vaccine policy information and utilization You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A group of public health figures has launched a new project they hope will shore up U S vaccination policy which they believe is under threat from U S Health and Human Services HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr The Vaccine Integrity Project launched Thursday is funded by iAlumbra a nonprofit founded by Walmart heiress and philanthropist Christy Walton It will be based at the University of Minnesota s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy CIDRAP Michael Osterholm Ph D CIDRAP director and a member of the COVID 19 Advisory Board under the Biden administration said the project acknowledges the unfortunate reality that the system that we ve relied on to make vaccine recommendations and to review safety and effectiveness data faces threats Former U S Food and Drug Administration FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg and Dr Harvey Fineberg former president of the Institute of Medicine and current president of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation will co chair an eight member steering committee leading the initiative The group behind the project cited a growing chorus of voices in the U S questioning the safety and efficacy of vaccines as one of the inspirations for launching the project Fierce Biotech reported In an op ed published in STAT News Hamburg and Fineberg said the project will use the best available evidence to safeguard vaccine policy information and utilization The project will hold information gathering sessions with public health stakeholders and share its recommendations with nongovernment entities that are free of outside influence and focus on protecting Americans from vaccine preventable diseases According to a press release the project s recommendations will be grounded in the best available science Nebraska chiropractor Ben Tapper said statements like best available science are code for whatever aligns with current Pharma backed consensus It doesn t mean objective or independent science it means the curated sanitized data that serves their interests Real science welcomes dissent and scrutiny this initiative clearly does not Tapper said Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist for Children

Kennedy s CDC Osterholm said the Vaccine Integrity Project may launch a committee that will evaluate the scientific evidence supporting individual vaccines a task currently performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP Yet according to Osterholm the Vaccine Integrity Project is not intended to serve as a shadow or parallel version of the ACIP Let me be clear there is no alternative to the ACIP Osterholm said However in their op ed Hamburg and Fineberg described the Vaccine Integrity Project as a form of insurance The U S needs an alternative organization to protect vaccine guidance from political interference Should ACIP or FDA processes or scientific evaluation become compromised America cannot afford to be left without any organized systems to ensure that evidence grounded in science continues to guide decisions about the use of vaccines Hamburg and Fineberg wrote But according to Jablonowski Given the political polarization on vaccines this is the creation of a committee that may replace ACIP when the administration changes in a few short years Tapper said the Vaccine Integrity Project seeks to undercut the Kennedy led HHS which oversees the FDA and CDC It s unaccountable HHS a government body can t technically block it but this effort undercuts HHS authority and makes it harder for the public to discern where official health guidance ends and elite backed narratives begin It s private influence wearing a lab coat Tapper said Ji agreed He said the Vaccine Integrity Project while

as a surprise to many people in public health It also was a stark contrast with the views of a large majority of epidemiologists surveyed in the last two weeks by The New York Times In the informal survey 80 said they thought Americans would need to wear masks in public indoor places for at least another year Just 5 said people would no longer need to wear masks indoors by this summer How Apple s Airtag Turns Us Into Unwitting Spies in a Vast Surveillance Network The Guardian reported Apple has launched the latest version of its operating system iOS 14 5 which features the much anticipated app tracking transparency function bolstering the tech giant s privacy credentials But iOS 14 5 also introduced support for the new Apple AirTag which risks doing the opposite For the uninitiated an AirTag is a small device similar to a Tile that can be attached to personal items such as keys wallets or luggage The tag periodically sends messages that can be used to track its location letting you find any lost or missing items with the help of an app While clearly useful AirTags can also potentially be misused Concerns have been raised that they might facilitate stalking for example",

legal precedent Aug 17 George Mason University caved before the case went to trial and granted Zywicki a medical exemption to the vaccine requirement Unfortunately and irrationally the school did not revise its general policy As reported by Citizens Journal The school s acknowledgment of natural immunity is significant given the serial case of amnesia that seems to have overtaken the world on this basic point of biology However the school still maintains the vaccination requirement for all other members of the GMU community regardless of naturally acquired immunity At the time of this writing the same medical exemption has not been offered on a broader scale Furthermore the lawsuit would have served as an interesting test case for vaccine mandate related litigation which will become more prevalent as time goes on Regardless the victory still serves as a sliver of hope that some universities will entertain reasonable arguments and that individuals can fight back with litigation With the GMU case resolved without trial many critical legal arguments went untested For example does the 14th Amendment s Due Process Clause apply to vaccine mandates or does the state have the ability to suspend such rights when responding to a public health emergency How does the reliability of natural immunity affect the constitutionality of policies that fail to recognize it Can the government simply cherry pick whatever science it wants to justify its policies According to the court filing The Supreme Court has recognized that the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual s right to privacy A forcible injection into a nonconsenting person s body represents a substantial interference with that person s liberty Washington v Harper 494 U S 210 229 1990 Given this precedent

lead counsel Jenin Younes with the New Civil Liberties Alliance said NCLA is pleased that GMU granted Professor Zywicki s medical exemption which we believe it only did because he filed this lawsuit

burden Nevertheless NCLA remains dismayed by GMU s refusal along with many other public and private universities and other employers to recognize that the science establishes beyond any doubt that natural immunity is as robust or more so than vaccine immunity Other lawsuits challenging schools vaccine mandates While not specifically centered around the validity of natural immunity a lawsuit filed by more than a dozen students and Children s Health Defense against Rutgers University in New Jersey does include this aspect as some of the plaintiffs object to the mandate on the basis that they have natural immunity This lawsuit was filed in mid August 2021 and is still pending Earlier this year in April the Los Angeles Unified School District was sued over its vaccine requirement by California Educators for Medical Freedom and the Health Freedom Defense Fund July 27 a California court dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice as it concluded the LAUSD had voluntarily abandoned its mandatory vaccine requirement As reported by Health Freedom Defense This is a BIG win because of the lawsuit LAUSD represented to the court on the record that it does not have a policy requiring vaccination with EUA products Since the court has now confirmed the absence of any policy requiring vaccination at LAUSD all teachers and staff are safe to return to work without vaccination or furnishing proof of vaccination in the fall Time will tell if the Children s Health Defense case against Rutgers University will bring the legal precedent needed to more effectively thwart this

cresting right around the time when the debate should be moot for a lot of people Among the most fraudulent messages of the CDC s campaign of deceit is to force the vaccine on those with prior infection who have a greater degree of protection against all version of the virus than those with any of the vaccines It s time to set the record straight once and for all that natural immunity to SARS CoV 2 is broader more durable and longer lasting than any of the shots on the market today Our policies must reflect that reality We now have data showing vaccine immunity rapidly wanes regardless of variants but especially when a new variant becomes predominant According to the Mayo Clinic as of July Pfizer s COVID injection was only 42 effective against infection which doesn t even meet the U S Food and Drug Administration s requirement of 50 efficacy14 for COVID vaccines This matches Israeli data which show Pfizer s shot went from a 95 effectiveness at the outset to 64 in early July 2021 and 39 by late July when the Delta strain became predominant Pfizer s own trial data also demonstrate rapidly waning effectiveness BMJ associate editor Peter Doshi discussed this in an Aug 23 blog By the fifth month into the trial efficacy had dropped from 96 to 84 and this drop could not be due to the emergence of the Delta variant since 77 of trial participants were in the U S where the Delta variant didn t emerge until months later So even without a predominance of a new variant effectiveness drops off In an Aug 20 report BPR noted The data we will publish today and next week demonstrate the vaccine effectiveness against SARS COVID 2 infection is waning the CDC director Rochelle Walensky began She cited reports of international colleagues including Israel suggest increased

jabbed individuals carry the same viral load when symptomatic as unvaccinated individuals and the whole argument that vaccine passports will identify and separate public health threats from those who are safe to be around simply fails miserably As noted by Horowitz anyone capable of rational thought understands that a person with natural immunity from a previous infection is exponentially safer to be around than someone who had the vaccines but not prior infection As for the unvaccinated who do not have natural immunity from prior infection well their status poses no increased risk to anyone but themselves Conversely since the COVID shot cannot prevent infection or transmission and only promises to reduce your risk of serious illness the only one who can benefit from the shot is the one who got it It protects no one else In fact you may actually pose an increased risk to others because if your symptoms are mild or nonexistent but your viral load high you re more likely to walk around as usual Rather than staying home because you suspect you re infected and infectious you re out spreading the virus around to others vaccinated and unvaccinated alike What does the research say In his article Horowitz reviews 15 studies that should once and for all settle the debate about whether people who have had COVID are now immune and whether that immunity is comparable to that of the COVID

their paychecks provided they re allowed to work at all Charging them nonrefundable quarantine fees Denying them medical care at hospitals and private medical offices Canceling their private insurance or raising premiums by thousands of dollars a year Suspending their gun permits Suspending their driver s licenses Denying access to loans Withholding government assistance Withholding federal benefits like Social Security VA benefits subsidized housing and pensions Barring them from bars and restaurants Barring them from exercise facilities and hotels Barring them from buying food in grocery stores Barring them from using public transportation and traveling on airplanes The way we re going it s not hard to imagine a near future in which unvaccinated people aren t allowed to hold a job get an education travel or even have access to basic financial services Taken at face value the rhetoric thrown around right now indicates the plan is to basically destroy the life of anyone who refuses to consent to be a part of this medical experiment This is as coercive as it can possibly get and coercing volunteers to participate in human medical trials is strictly forbidden by both national and international bioethics laws Yet it s happening at scale that is nothing short of mind boggling and with full support of the U S government It s not just a vaccine passport For years

virus it s about your data Once this rolls out you don t have a choice about being part of the system What people have to understand is that any other functionality can be loaded onto that platform It can be merged with your Paypal account with your digital currency Microsoft is already talking about merging it with payment plans Your network can be sucked up It geolocates you everywhere you go Your credit history can be included All of your medical and health history can be included It is absolutely so much more than a vaccine pass I cannot stress enough that it has the power to turn off

digital signatures thereby enabling the execution of contracts remotely If you look at the list of suggested punishments for lack of COVID injection you can see how this technology could make all those processes more or less automatic The vaccine passport simply becomes a digital ID wallet and without a digital ID wallet you simply cannot do anything or go anywhere If you re upset that PayPal

There are few legal limits to what data a vaccine passport app could collect and things get complicated if people feel forced to use the apps to re enter society Of course there are ways to solve

article titled Technocrats Embrace a New COVID Policy Vaccine Passports Mitchell Nemeth noted that For now the concept of a vaccine passport is only an idea in the abstract Fast forward a mere seven months and we re already in the thick of it with state and national governments around the world rolling out health passports and mandates to match At the time Nemeth pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party was embracing the idea and urged countries to harmonize their policies with that of China where QR codes are used to designate who may or may not enter public spaces based on their infection status using a test now known to produce mostly false positives China s surveillance system is such they can track to the minute an infected person s journey through the city automatically tagging each and every person they came within 6 feet of along the way so they can then get a no go QR code and have to quarantine at home Subscribe to The Defender It s Free Name First Last Email

minutes including the revelation that the CDC lied when it claimed outdoor transmission accounted for less than 10 of COVID cases a statistic that led to the recommendation to wear a mask when walking or exercising outdoors As it turns out the 10 statistic was based partly on a misclassification of some COVID transmission that actually took place in enclosed spaces according to The New York Times which broke the story in early May 2021 Saying that less than 10 of COVID transmission occurs outdoors is akin to saying that sharks attack fewer than 20 000 swimmers a year The actual worldwide number is around 150 It s both true and deceiving The New York Times said What s more even indoors the transmission rate is exceedingly low likely below 1 and possibly as low as 0 1 Carlson reports So even indoors your risk of getting infected is low with or without a mask Certainly you accomplish nothing good by wearing it outdoors particularly if you re exercising Passports don t prove immunity only compliance Getting back to the passport issue in a mid August 2021 blog post independent journalist Sharyl Attkisson pointed out what should be obvious to everyone yet for some reason still isn t Vaccine passports don t prove immunity only compliance The reason is simple The COVID shots don t prevent infection or transmission This is admitted by all COVID shot developers the CDC and real world infection data Since the shots cannot prevent infection or transmission those who have gotten the jab are no less of a risk to other people than an unvaccinated person So what public health benefit exactly does the vaccine passport offer The only sure thing a vaccine passport or verification proves is that somebody complied with advice or mandates Attkisson writes It does not guarantee that the person has any level of immunity The person could be infected with COVID 19 and could be spreading it to others Meantime absent from much public discussion is the broader and longer lasting immunity scientists believe is enjoyed by the 120 million Americans who have recovered with COVID or been infected without showing any symptoms This group according to the bulk of scientific data generally has better protection than the group of vaccinated patients particularly among the vaccinated for whom the vaccines are no longer proving as effective as the early months after the shots What do you think

overwhelmingly thought the intention behind vaccine passports is power grabbing population control and increasing the Big Pharma revenue stream What s your take How might vaccine passports affect our economy In closing a blog post by the Birch Gold Group a precious metal IRA specialist delves into how vaccine passports might affect the financial realm and reshape the economic landscape Yes it s an official concern now A mandatory vaccine passport Should a mandatory vaccine passport system be implemented life will never be normal again Such a program would mean that around half the country could be put in the position of hearing they have no right to employment or possibly even general interaction in trade because they won t take the experimental jab Second we have to consider what the immediate economic and financial effects will be in light of this conflict For example look at the amount of relocation and migration that has happened in the U S in the past year alone As has been well documented blue states are much slower in recovering economically when compared to red states with less restrictions Not only that but money moves with people This is a hard reality But let s say for a moment that vaccine passports were somehow implemented everywhere in the country at the same exact time What would happen then Well the amount of bureaucracy that would be added between the average consumer and everyday trade would be immense and with red tape comes a slowdown in business Whole new wings of the government would have to be created to track and enforce vaccine passports rules Regular inspections of businesses would have to be enacted and new taxes would have to be created to pay for the system The end result would be the complete disintegration of the small business sector and of course many millions of jobs would be lost in the process Less competition means ever increasing prices and a lower quality of goods and services Then again w hen governments restrict domestic trade and limit consumer participation based on frivolous requirements people find other ways to get the things they need more freely This means black market trade or barter markets

providing services for each other common people would be opening the door to survival outside of the system and if survival is possible then non vaccination is possible Therefore the argument will be made by the establishment that alternative economies need to be eliminated for the good of society as a whole There is always an excuse for totalitarianism With a large portion of the population seeking a means to live without oppression alternative markets will thrive and the government will make war on them Which means the people will be forced to make war on the government It s inevitable under every scenario Straight barter will be useful but so will precious metals especially gold and silver along with other hard commodities with intrinsic value and utility What I see in the near future is economic disaster in the wake of any attempt at a vaccine passport system Millions will lose their jobs or quit their jobs in protest Small businesses will disappear under the weight of bureaucracy and constant scrutiny The quality of goods and services will suffer as competition shrivels But I also see the birth of a whole new economic system outside of the mainstream control grid I see true free markets returning and eventually I see full blown rebellion What I suggest is that people get ready for this eventuality We need to become producers again rather than mere consumers In order to position ourselves for success in the new trade environment we have to be able to make necessities repair necessities or teach necessary skills Those that are able to do this will do very well within alternative markets Reject vaccine passports Like the author of that Birch Gold piece I see nothing positive coming from mandatory COVID injections and vaccine passports only the destruction of lives and livelihoods And that s not even taking into account the potential destruction of people s health Already roughly half of the American population has put themselves at risk for serious health problems in the future the full extent of which remains to be seen Can the health care system survive such an onslaught Will the medical system even survive in the long term if worst

might not be able to fly on certain airlines for the time being or go on a cruise this summer This is about the long game Any freedom you re willing to give up today you won t get back tomorrow

this topic is not easy to find The U S Department of Agriculture USDA and drug developers aren t required to release any information on veterinary drugs in the development pipeline so independent

license for an mRNA vaccine for use in pigs for the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus This is equivalent to emergency use authorization and gets around the USDA s vaccine licensing and authorization process In 2015 Merck bought Harrisvaccines to acquire their RNA platform Merck s 2015 press release stated that this RNA Particle technology represents a breakthrough in vaccine development It also has a highly versatile production platform able to target a wide range of viruses and bacteria Pathogens are collected from a farm and specific genes are sequenced and inserted into RNA particles

already in use in pigs They are customized for different viruses and each customized injection undergoes no new safety testing new formulations are deployed immediately The pork you are eating from

novel mRNA vaccine against RSV infections in cows in the form of a subcutaneous implant that continuously releases mRNA into the cow The anticipated completion date for the study is 2026 If you think mRNA vaccines are the only problem think again according to a 2021 paper published in Frontiers in Veterinary Science DNA RNA and recombinant viral vector vaccines are all in development They are touted as capable of quick deployment no time for pesky safety testing let alone time to see if humans who consume meat from these animals suffer any long term health effects The paper also points out that farmed salmon are already receiving multiple DNA injections for various diseases According to Merck s Veterinary Manual experimental DNA vaccines have been produced against avian influenza rabies bovine viral diarrhea virus porcine herpesvirus bovine herpesvirus 1 foot and mouth disease and other veterinary viruses All this begs the question can DNA vaccines change the genetic code of an animal or human According to a 2017 Moderna white paper titled mRNA Vaccines Disruptive Innovation in Vaccination The key challenge associated with DNA vaccines is that they must penetrate the cell nucleus Once inside the nucleus DNA vaccines have a risk of permanently changing a person s DNA Can genetic injections given to animals affect the person who consumes the animal product Chinese scientists have published a study where mRNA laced milk was injected into the intestines of mice The mRNA was successfully absorbed through the digestive tract and became active in their bodies The researchers plan to follow up with a version where the mice are fed the mRNA rather than being injected and in their paper s conclusion they opine that In the near future an mRNA delivery system based on milk derived exosomes will serve as a platform for mRNA therapeutics development We know that human breast milk was contaminated with mRNA lipid nanoparticles after COVID 19 injections This raises

in which food molecules are taken into the body by many routes It has been demonstrated in mammals that some of these pathways allow limited entry into the bloodstream of macromolecules such as DNA and intact proteins Thus absorbed macromolecules may enter internal organs muscle tissue and even embryos At least in some tissues foreign DNA enters the nuclei of individual cells The authors also

Tell a Different Story The reality is that waves of infection and excess mortality continued after the deployment of the COVID 19 vaccines during 2021 continuing with two severe waves in the U S and peaking again at the end of January the following year You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Michael Tomlinson In the ongoing struggle to write the history of the pandemic years nothing is more important than mortality did the world s governments save us from mass mortality or not The grand strategy which as I have said before was neither grand nor strategic was to lock down the population of whole countries as an interim measure until a vaccine becomes available This was a novel and completely unproven strategy to defeat a supposedly completely novel virus on the grounds that no human had ever encountered anything like SARS CoV 2 before so no one would have any preexisting immunity to it But the clue is in the name SARS CoV 2 was named after SARS to which it was closely related sharing approximately 79 of its genome sequence according to this paper in Nature It is situated within a cluster of coronaviruses and another Nature paper discussed the extent of cross reactivity with these including the common cold viruses and even with other families of viruses altogether It was somewhat novel but not unique So policymakers should have been skeptical about the claims made early in 2020 that SARS CoV 2 would produce extreme levels of mortality This has consequential implications for the claims that the grand strategy was a success because these levels of mortality did not eventuate If they were never going to happen then we did not need to be saved from them The deployment of vaccines was supposed to bring about the end of the pandemic The clinical trials of the vaccines purportedly showed they could reduce symptomatic infections by over 90 At the population level this does not add up If over 90 of infections were supposed to be prevented by vaccination and 270 million people in the U S population had been vaccinated by the end of May 2023 out of a total population of around 340 million then how come there were over 100 million confirmed cases by then according to Our World in Data It defies belief that nearly 100 million of the unvaccinated 170 million were the ones infected Particularly as a study by the Cleveland Clinic showed that on average the more vaccinations people had the more likely they were to be infected It was assumed there would be a consequential reduction in mortality from reducing infections which in any case

mortality between the groups exposed to the vaccines and the placebo groups The orthodox defense is that they were not powered sufficiently to detect any differences as the trial populations were not large enough But by the same token we are entitled to draw the following conclusion the clinical trials did not demonstrate the vaccines ability to reduce mortality In the quality assurance business we evaluate the success of an intervention or program by comparing the actual outcomes with the claims made The reality is that waves of infection and excess mortality continued after the deployment of the vaccines during 2021 continuing with two severe waves in the U S and peaking again at the end of January the following year There was a trend of declining peaks but it is not evident that this trend changed as a result of the vaccination campaign as would be expected over the course of any pandemic Conventional wisdom would have us believe that the vaccines while they may not have reduced overall levels of infection somehow reduced levels of hospitalization and mortality from COVID 19 Again it defies belief that vaccination could be deficient in preventing infection and still be successful in reducing illness These claims of success do not rest on hard evidence A number of recent papers are smoking guns that show us that the grand strategy did not work We need to look beneath the hood however to switch metaphors because the narrative usually concludes that the strategy was a success The data however sometimes tell a different story This shows that the authors are biased and their data can be more reliable than their narratives Take for example a study by Bajema et al based on patients of the U S Veterans Health Administration They concluded This cohort study showed that during the 2022 to 2023 season infection with SARS CoV 2 was associated with more severe disease outcomes than influenza or RSV whereas differences were less pronounced during the 2023 to 2024 season During both seasons RSV remained a milder illness whereas COVID 19 was associated with higher long term mortality Vaccination attenuated differences in disease severity and long term mortality

more severe over 180 days but by less than 1 This was meant to be the once in a 100 year pandemic that would cut a swathe through the population and was dramatically more dangerous than influenza necessitating throwing the whole world into a state of emergency Was this justifiable for a disease that had less than 1 higher mortality than influenza Many media articles have derided claims that COVID 19 posed a similar burden of disease to influenza but over time it has proved to be comparable How much did vaccination help Figure 2 gives us these comparisons for the COVID 19 patients So in a paper based on a carefully selected and processed sub population of a sub population the vaccinated were ahead by half of 1 over 180 days Is this the best they can do Is it statistically significant Papers based on the excess mortality in the whole population of a country can avoid the methodological issues caused by variability in the attribution of mortality to COVID 19 and the selectivity of

reach the obligatory conclusion Vaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all cause death during 2021 2023 in Norway But again how does the data support this conclusion If we focus on the data for both sexes and read from right to left deaths per 100 000 py increase steadily for each age group except for the youngest where deaths would have been rare By contrast for the oldest age group 65 plus they increase from 3 40 with no doses to 7 25 with one to two doses to 19 21 with three plus doses What obscure statistical magic did they deploy to arrive at incident rate ratios that go in the

by confirmation bias The strength of the authors belief in vaccination is such that all data is usually interpreted as supporting vaccination even when it is contrary Another broad study was undertaken of all patients diagnosed with COVID 19 in Brazil over the period 2020 to 2023 by Pinheiro Rodrigues and Andrade Their conclusion was summed up in the abstract The protective effect of COVID 19 immunization was observed up to one year after the first symptoms After one year the effect was reversed showing an increased risk of death for those vaccinated This is illustrated in Figure 1 with the number of days of survival along the X axis We must congratulate these authors for reaching conclusions that accurately reflect their data which is unusual in this context This has naturally led to the paper being investigated by the journal post publication which never happens for papers that reach orthodox conclusions on vaccination which are normally accepted at face value Publication bias is rife how will the distinguished peer reviewers handle the Dahl paper The fate of these two papers will be a key test In its current form you would expect the Brazil study to be retracted and the Dahl paper to be accepted The studies that reach positive conclusions are either based on selected periods of time variations on what is known as case counting window bias or on modeling Take for example Christopher Ruhm s cross sectional study of U S states which aimed to ascertain whether state COVID 19 related restrictions nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccine mandates affected the number of pandemic deaths in the U S The study was based on data from the entire U S population so it was inclusive in that sense Ruhm concludes This cross sectional study indicates that stringent COVID 19 restrictions as a group were associated with substantial decreases in pandemic mortality with behavior changes plausibly serving as an important explanatory mechanism

non pharmaceutical interventions above median the orange line having much higher mortality than those that did not The states with less severe interventions had higher mortality for a month or so

Brazilian study which found that the protective effect of COVID 19 immunization was observed up to one year after the first symptoms but after one year the effect was reversed Consider also the Estimation of Excess Mortality in Germany During 2020 2022 by Kuhbandner and Reitzner The authors rightly acknowledge that when interpreting estimates of the increase in mortality one has to be aware of the model and parameter choices In the later parts of their paper they map excess mortality since March 2020 against vaccinations in a timeline It is evident that there are peaks of excess mortality both before and after the vaccination campaign rising greatly toward the end of the study period They conclude In 2020 the observed number of deaths was extremely close to the expected number but in 2021 the observed number of deaths was far above the expected number in the order of twice the empirical standard deviation and in 2022 above the expected number even more than four times the empirical standard deviation This cannot be interpreted as a triumph for the vaccination campaign It was supposed to prevent excess deaths but did not Alessandria et al published A Critical

Alessandria et al finished their report by examining various types of bias that can affect vaccination studies including a particular type of case counting window bias in which results from the first 10 14 days post vaccination are excluded from the vaccine group in observational studies with no equivalent for the control group According to Fung et al on this basis a completely ineffective vaccine can appear substantially effective 48 effective in the example they calculate using data from the Pfizer Phase III randomized trial While putting the finishing touches on my review the Annals of Internal Medicine released Effectiveness of the 2023 to 2024 XBB 1 5 COVID 19 Vaccines Over Long Term Follow up by Ioannou et al This study tries to emulate a controlled clinical trial by matching XBB

appears to be day 10 to day 210 What happens outside the window is not known If poor results are recorded even with case counting window bias the reality must be even worse We have been reviewing a selection of observational studies In the best case example the data show no material advantage for being vaccinated and in the worst case scenario deaths are greater in the vaccinated group There have also been a number of counterfactual studies in which mortality during the pandemic period is compared with expected mortality The first by Watson et al estimated that 14 4 million deaths from

that extremely high levels of deaths would occur without novel countermeasures Pandemania ensued and should never be repeated Retrospectively the orthodox now attempt to show that because these

and causally increased the usage of mental health facilities in regions with lockdowns in comparison to regions without such lockdowns Particularly resource usage increased by 18 in regions with a lockdown compared to 1 decline in regions without a lockdown Also female populations have been exposed to a larger lockdown effect on their mental health Diagnosis of panic disorders and reaction to

in some infants may make it harder for them to process toxic ingredients in vaccines a condition that could lead to sudden infant death syndrome SIDS according to a new study published in the International Journal of Medical Sciences The study reviewed existing scientific literature pharmacogenetic data and epidemiological studies to investigate how infants immature or variable cytochrome P450 CYP450 enzymes affect how they metabolize vaccine excipients or inactive ingredients and the implications for immune response and safety outcomes CYP450 enzymes largely found in the liver are crucial for metabolizing drugs The authors note that it is generally believed that excipients inactive ingredients used as preservatives or to enhance a vaccine s efficacy are present in such trace amounts that they don t affect how the body metabolizes a vaccine However they argue that the increasing complexity of vaccine formulations and the large number of shots given to infants raise concerns about how excipients may affect vulnerable people Studies of infants who die from SIDS have noted brainstem and medulla abnormalities in most cases Either of these may be caused by infection or inflammation In the study the authors hypothesize that reduced CYP450 function may make it hard for some children to eliminate toxic vaccine ingredients This may lead to prolonged exposure to inflammation making the children more vulnerable to such abnormalities Those children are unable to safely tolerate the currently recommended vaccines The result is a biologically plausible mechanism linking early life vaccination to sudden infant death particularly in those with genetic or developmental vulnerabilities according to epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher who first reported the study

different expressions of the enzyme system which can make some infants particularly limited in their capacity to eliminate toxins Excipients are generally present in trace levels in any given vaccine but cumulative exposure from multiple vaccines in early infancy can easily exceed safe thresholds particularly in infants with CYP450 polymorphisms the authors said Preterm infants who are more likely to have underdeveloped CYP450 pathways are often given more vaccines than other infants because they have altered immune responses and can t achieve desired immunity markers without additional vaccine doses the authors wrote The human gestation time has grown shorter in modern medicine with cesarean sections scheduled to preempt the onset of labor Jablonowski said It is common medical practice to give vaccines more aggressively to premature infants while their constitution is less capable of dealing with them He added A baby born in the U S today is expected to deal with the toxins contained in the hepatitis B vaccine at birth And two months later what can be described as a toxic onslaught the vaccines for RSV hepatitis B rotavirus diphtheria tetanus pertussis Hib pneumococcal and poliovirus CYP450 isn t responsible for metabolizing all excipients However it does play a role for many of them including adjuvants such as aluminum salts widely used in vaccines and deemed safe by regulatory bodies It also plays a role in metabolizing formaldehyde and polysorbate 80 The authors of the new study also noted that immune activation from vaccination itself can suppress CYP450 enzyme activity This sets off a dangerous feedback loop the very immune activation triggered by vaccination further impairs the infant s ability to detoxify toxic excipients amplifying systemic toxicity Hulscher wrote Jablonowski noted that Tylenol still infuriatingly actively given to infants like the Shaw twins also interacts with the CYP450 pathway The last thing you want to do is clog up the mechanisms for removing toxins when you are inundating infants with toxins CYP450 may be linked to SIDS and other neurodevelopmental disorders Each year the U S records more than five infant deaths per 1 000 live births far exceeding the rates in other high income countries After birth defects and prematurity SIDS is the third leading cause of death among infants VAERS data reveal that more than

two months of vaccination This strongly suggests a biological link to vaccines he wrote Evidence also shows that because there are no consistent postmortem protocols SIDs investigations often fail to capture all cases and possible neuropathological causes which may obscure the link to vaccines the report authors noted The authors found that evidence in the peer reviewed research supports their hypothesis that inflammation induced suppression of the CYP450 enzymes raises questions about metabolic vulnerability among infants and suggests that it may be linked to SIDS and also to other neurodevelopmental disorders and infant health issues They argue that limited metabolic capacity in early life increases the effects of toxic exposures and could be linked to conditions including autism spectrum disorder ASD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD epilepsy and learning disabilities This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The Defender is 100 reader supported No corporate sponsors No paywalls Our writers and editors rely on you to fund stories like this that mainstream media won t write Please Donate Today Study raises possibility of therapeutic interventions The authors urge further research into these issues and argue that such research could have major implications for therapeutic interventions Current vaccination schedules don t account for variation in infants ability to metabolize vaccines or for the impact of polymorphisms in key enzymes which may have serious consequences for infants who are poor metabolizers they wrote Their results raise the possibility that infants could be screened for genetic polymorphisms related to CYP450 This could make it possible for clinicians to change drug dosing to minimize adverse effects and save lives It would help to support precision medicine they said adding Understanding the metabolic impact of vaccine excipients and cumulative exposures could inform safer immunization practices Integrating these insights into clinical practice may ultimately improve patient outcomes by aligning therapeutic interventions with individual metabolic profiles Integrating pharmacogenomics the study of how genes affect the way a person responds to medication into vaccine risk assessment could significantly impact vaccine safety and efficacy for all infants Together these findings support the urgent removal of toxic excipients from vaccines and a complete restructuring of the childhood hyper vaccination schedule as necessary steps toward Making America Healthy Again Hulscher said Jablonowski agreed Incorporating pharmacogenomics and metabolomics into an assessment of vaccine risk is a sane idea that stands out in the otherwise reckless immunization practices", "chunk_id":

able to get and spread the virus According to internal documents obtained by The Washington Post the CDC said it s time to Acknowledge the war has changed The document outlined unpublished data showing fully vaccinated people might spread the Delta variant at the same rate as unvaccinated people CNN reported It concludes the delta variant is highly contagious likely to be more severe and that breakthrough infections may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases The Washington Post reported I think the central issue is that vaccinated people are probably involved to a substantial extent in the transmission of delta Jeffrey Shaman a Columbia University epidemiologist wrote in an email after reviewing the CDC slides In some sense vaccination is now about personal protection protecting oneself against severe disease Herd immunity is not relevant as we are seeing plenty of evidence of repeat and breakthrough infections Since January people who got infected after vaccination make up an increasing portion of hospitalizations and in hospital deaths among COVID patients according to the CDC documents That trend coincides with the spread of the Delta variant The Post also reported today on a CDC study revealing three fourths of people infected in a Massachusetts COVID outbreak were vaccinated The report bolsters the hypothesis that vaccinated people can

transmissibility and severity Infections with the Delta variant lead to higher levels of virus in the body even in breakthrough cases in fully vaccinated individuals the document said If vaccinated people get infected anyway they have as much virus in their bodies as unvaccinated people that means they re as likely to infect someone else as unvaccinated people who get infected CNN reported The bottom line was that in contrast to the other variants vaccinated people even if they didn t get sick got infected and shed virus at similar levels as unvaccinated people who got infected Dr Walter

tool to track reports in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS so vaccine injured people can follow what happens to the reports they submit As part of a broader effort to hold public health agencies accountable the tool will also make it possible to audit the VAERS system by identifying what types of reports are deleted insufficiently updated or contain errors The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA which jointly oversee VAERS have refused to do this work despite multiple appeals by advocates for the vaccine injured according to React19 the group leading the initiative React19 founded by a small group of medical professionals injured by COVID 19 vaccines works with institutions and providers to increase understanding and awareness of patients experiencing lasting effects following COVID 19 and or COVID 19 vaccines The group is teaming up with computer programmer Liz Willner founder of OpenVAERS a website that provides tools for more easily accessing and searching VAERS data and Children s Health Defense CHD to develop the tool The idea for developing the automatic VAERS report tracking tool came out of a VAERS audit the group conducted in 2022 to assess how the FDA and CDC were following up on COVID 19 vaccine injury reports React19 worked with outside experts to review a sample of 126 VAERS reports filed by some of its members who wanted to know what happened to their reports After tracking down each person s reports and following them through the VAERS system they were kind of shocked at how bad it is members of React19 told The Defender They found that only 61 of the reports filed were correctly logged and published in VAERS Twenty two percent of the reports were never issued a permanent ID and

public health officials in their meetings sharing examples of reports that had been updated by people s families when they died but didn t show up on the public system They also found that many follow up reports containing updates on worsening symptoms were gone from the system At the time the group was meeting regularly with top officials including Peter Marks M D Ph D director of the FDA s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to discuss vaccine injuries and why the agencies were doing nothing to address them In those meetings according to Dressen and React19 member Dr Joel Wallskog when they raised the issue that the agencies weren t following up on VAERS reports the FDA told them VAERS wasn t a reliable indicator for vaccine injuries because anyone could file an injury complaint including Mickey Mouse or Michael Jackson We told them we know thousands of people that have not had any follow up on their VAERS reports that are not Mickey Mouse and they re suffering it every single day waiting for you guys to get back to them to investigate what happened to them Dressen said And of course then they never did anything So we were like OK fine If they re not going to generate the evidence then we will ourselves The group submitted their findings to Marks during a meeting with him and his team Based on their findings they also requested an external audit of the

injury testimonials Users can share any information they have about their VAERS report their ID number if they have one or if not details about their case Then they will receive a monthly email with the status of their report For example someone who has a user ID and a public facing report will be informed if their report disappears In the case of those people who filed a VAERS complaint but never got an ID number the system will search each month for the record and try to find the ID We ll be able to track these reports through the system and figure out what happens to them Willner said

VAERS analyst Albert Benavides joined The Defender In Depth this week to discuss evidence he s gathered suggesting VAERS is undercounting COVID 19 related deaths and injuries among people of all ages You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up VAERS the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is undercounting child deaths following COVID 19 vaccination and also the total number of reports of deaths and injuries among people of all ages following the vaccines according to VAERS analyst and expert Albert Benavides Benavides founder of VAERSAware com joined The Defender In Depth this week to discuss these and other statistical anomalies in VAERS and why the undercount may be occurring According to Benavides VAERS which is administered by the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has access to more detailed and updated information than what is visible publicly and is throttling many reports More than double children s deaths are hiding in VAERS Benavides told The Defender In Depth that according to official VAERS figures as of May 31 you ll get 197 deaths officially for people under age 18 following COVID 19 vaccination However he said his research shows that when looking at VAERS reports where the age is officially listed as unknown child deaths total 538 So more than double the kid deaths are actually hiding in the unknown age bucket Benavides said According to Benavides 3 000 5 000 reports relating to COVID 19 vaccines are added to VAERS monthly He said he isolates the unknown age reports from each new monthly batch into a spreadsheet and then from there I ll go right to the deaths He then reads the written summaries accompanying the reports where the patient s age is often listed even if the age field indicates unknown I m a one horse pony show myself and I m here running circles around this data Benavides said This is not difficult He noted that most VAERS reports are submitted electronically and the metadata should be easy to review and process You could easily go through there and find the missing stuff to populate he said You would think that somebody within the VAERS system would ethically populate the field And they re not Benavides noted that VAERS maintains two versions of its database but only one is public facing However reports where the data are cleaned up or updates were submitted are not included in the public facing data The public one is the initial reports and only the initial report is made public Benavides said Whatever additional information

submitting VAERS reports for family members said follow up emails are sent regularly requesting updated information from reporters They have that information they use it to append initial reports with follow up data which are not made public Benavides said They merge the data internally for them But we only see the initial report that will be petrified in time 30 of VAERS COVID vaccine reports list unknown age Benavides referred to a paper he co authored with evolutionary biologist Herve Seligmann Ph D showing child reports have more missing ages in the VAERS age field by proportion or percentage compared to older cohorts particularly reports involving children age 5 and younger They have the highest percentage of missing ages that were actually there in the summary narrative and it s almost on a perfect curve on a perfect slope as you go into the cohorts for the adolescents and into the adults and to the older people Benavides said Unknown age reports are not just found among children Benavides said noting that 30 of all COVID reports of the 1 6 million COVID reports that we have in there 30 have unknown age So it s not just kids it s everybody It s everywhere Benavides said he s identified over 360 000 unknown age reports where the patient s age was documented in the narrative accompanying the report This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The Defender

publishing all legitimate reports received At a congressional hearing in February FDA and CDC officials claimed VAERS is not a fully trustworthy indicator of vaccine injuries and deaths because numerous false reports are submitted However according to Benavides most of the unknown age reports use professional language an indication that they were submitted by a hospital or an institution of some sort or were initially filed with vaccine manufacturers I think it s difficult to file a false report Benavides said noting there is a 4 to 6 week adjudication process following the submission of

VAERS is likely not publishing all legitimate reports received Benavides said he s identified at least 32 000 deleted COVID 19 vaccine reports after initial publication 1 100 of which involved deaths He said this is a disproportionate figure compared to the 2 of overall reports that involve deaths If only 2 of the reports are deaths organically it should be the same type of proportion he said Benavides said he s observed other anomalies in VAERS involving COVID 19 reports noting that while 16 of overall COVID 19 reports do not list a U S state 32 of COVID 19 death reports do not have a state listed Benavides also disputed claims included within many VAERS reports stating that follow up with the reporter is not possible to request clarifications or additional information You have all the might of the intelligence of the CDC FDA and in addition the manufacturer Benavides said I believe that you could probably find out who it was that submitted the report or get the information you re seeking He said there are deleted VAERS reports that state This is submitted by a contactable physician Benavides described another practice he s observed throttling the purposeful delay of publishing reports in VAERS He noted one example where a death report was published in the database 927 days after receipt and they conveniently forgot to check the death box Benavides who has recently participated in several live discussions on X Spaces with COVID 19 vaccine injury victims referred to cases where people filed reports and either never had them published or were published and then later deleted unbeknownst to the reporters That s another form of throttling Benavides said Benavides said throttling missing or incomplete reports is no accident because under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 they re obligated entrusted to maintain a pharmacovigilance system These are not just simple oversights It s with design that they re doing this curating the

VAERS on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC Wonder site VAERS was an outgrowth of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 a law that Barbara Loe Fisher co founder of the National Vaccine Information Center NVIC helped fight for As you likely know this site and many of you have supported NVIC with donations which allows them to carry on their terrific work including their MedAlerts VAERS database query tool Between 1990 and 2001 VAERS data were accessible only by filing a Freedom of Information Act request In 2001 a VAERS website was created and in 2006 the database was moved to CDC Wonder The MedAlerts VAERS interface was created by the NVIC which is the reason why fact checkers attack it It went online April 9 2003 In response to Settles question Kirsch explained that MedAlerts simply has a more user friendly interface while providing the same exact data as VAERS and OpenVAERS Are VAERS data valid Settles then moved on to question the validity of VAERS data in general She pointed out that raw VAERS reports are not vetted and verified for accuracy and that they cannot be used to prove causation In other words the fact that there are more than 24 400 deaths reported post jab does not automatically mean that the shot was the cause of all those deaths Kirsch countered by pointing out that what makes VAERS so valuable is the fact that you can find important safety signals that would otherwise be missed This is its intended function and it works quite well for that For example looking at the dosing data for myocarditis you find that after the first dose there are relatively few myocarditis cases reported but after the second dose reports explode This kind of consistency in the data is very telling and not easily dismissed Fact checkers are now trying to dismiss VAERS data as unreliable at best and useless at worst But they have a serious problem because the U S government had a clear duty enshrined in law to create a system to detect potential vaccine injuries If they now want to throw VAERS out then the government is in a real pickle because that means they did not create a functional and useful system If VAERS is so

piece tries to salvage the narrative PolitiFact published its NVIC MedAlerts article Feb 28 under the title How an Alternative Gateway to VAERS Data Helps Fuel Vaccine Misinformation While clearly meant as a hit piece it actually provides NVIC some much needed publicity even giving links to both its About Us and Reporting Options pages The main point of contention however is so weak it smacks of desperation According to Settles the government s disclaimer which states that VAERS reports can include information that is incomplete or inaccurate and doesn t provide enough information to determine causation isn t prominent enough on the MedAlert s website Users who go to MedAlerts can search through VAERS reports without ever reading a government disclaimer Settles contends adding that unlike the CDC s Wonder database users on MedAlerts who don t notice or click on the links won t see the warnings about what they read Without a clear understanding of the limitations of VAERS MedAlert s search results are vulnerable to misinterpretation by members of the public who are not trained to evaluate the information Settles insists She goes on When government researchers use and interpret VAERS reports they are not drawing conclusions based on the numbers alone but rather looking for patterns that warrant further study The irony is that this is precisely what Kirsch and many others have been doing VAERS is a tool that can help identify potential safety issues by looking at patterns and trends but the total number of reports of a specific problem cannot be discounted because it s part of the signal The fact of the matter is that there are many safety signals in the VAERS data but those tasked with investigating them are refusing to do it At this point one wonders whether any U S agency can actually be trusted to conduct an unbiased investigation even if they decided to do one Settles also attacks Kirsch personally dismissing his safety concerns by stating that the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA has chalked his claims up as being not based in science Essentially Settles article can be summed up as a desperate attempt to redirect people back to the CDC

with top researchers and government officials turned to disappointment and frustration when repeated queries yielded few signs of progress on research into post vaccination problems The Epoch Times writes Woodcock and Marks would often only provide updates after being prodded Nath and Safavi also grew distant as 2021 wore on They eventually stopped examining patients Brianne Dressen who had been examined by Nath and given a diagnosis of post vaccine neuropathy suddenly hit a dead end as 2021 drew to a close Nath would do no more for her and also told her to stop referring patients to him saying they did not have any clinical trial for vaccine related complications Epoch Times writes Dressen responded in January that she will always be indebted to you and what you did for me crediting Nath with keeping her alive However she added her heart is shattered I am more confused now than ever about what my active and willing engagement in the scientific process actually meant or has led to

immunity against liability The only way they can be held responsible for damages is if they re found guilty of willful misconduct or fraud Unfortunately the FDA CDC and NIH aren t looking for misconduct or fraud They re covering it up And mainstream media including so called fact checkers have been bought wholesale by an industry that has every intention of obfuscating and hiding the truth about their products Why media have embraced censorship As noted by independent journalist Paul Thacker mainstream media are refusing to call Big Tech censorship for what it is in large part because they support and indeed need fake fact checks Disinformation doesn t have to be sophisticated when people believe what they read Once this belief is established censors ensure that disinformation remains strong followed by denial that there is censoring That way inconvenient facts do not mar the chosen story In the COVID era the chosen story includes the fantasy that the COVID jabs are safe and effective and have harmed no one and there s simply no way to prop up that story without fake fact checks Who funds the fake fact checkers It should come as no surprise then that fact checking organizations are funded by Big Pharma and Big Pharma PR companies like the Publicis Groupe which also happens to be a partner of both Google and the World Economic Forum WEF Pfizer for example funds Facebook s fact checking operation Is it any wonder then that Facebook rejects anything that criticizes the COVID jabs Pfizer also has significant conflicts of interest with Reuters Reuters chairman and former CEO James Smith is both a top investor and board member of Pfizer Might he have a vested interest in keeping Pfizer s media record clear of incriminating details Many fact checking

remove the recording He refused In a Feb 25 Substack post Kirsch wrote Gabrielle asked if she could record the call and I consented so that entitles all parties to record the call PolitiFact did not deny that we both consented She wrote I am not in the least embarrassed by how she conducted the interview I m asking that you remove the video as a professional courtesy because the reporter did not consent to be recorded First of all she should be embarrassed by the interview The interviewer was clearly focused on proving an agenda and showed no interest in exploring evidence that was counter her agenda I gave her the story of the century if she would just follow up on what I suggested she do Secondly with respect to permission by asking me if it was OK to record the call she is giving implied consent for the call to be recorded since she is doing the asking All parties on the call consented to being recorded meaning the conversation is no longer private and all parties can record the call I then raised the stakes I challenged PolitiFact to a debate to settle the matter once and for all in front of a live Internet audience as to who are the liars and who are the truth tellers Of course the problem with a debate is that usually one side wins If it is the misinformation spreaders the narrative is crushed This is why nobody wants a debate they can t take the risk PolitiFact can t win a fair debate There is way too much information out now on how dangerous the vaccines are that is impossible for them to explain This is why I don t think that there is a snowball s chance

programas de eugenesia y las instituciones modernas de salud pública y sus prácticas Las políticas los orígenes y las vacunas contra la pandemia de COVID 19 siguen sometiéndose al escrutinio de cargos electos y de expertos poniendo al descubierto lo que Russell Brand denominó un grado de corrupción que es realmente institucional tanto en la industria farmacéutica como en los organismos reguladores En una serie de conversaciones en el episodio del martes de Stay Free with Russell Brand el senador Rand Paul republicano de Kentucky el doctor David Martin el representante Jim Jordan republicano de Ohio y el senador Ron Johnson republicano de Wisconsin compartieron sus puntos de vista sobre las políticas de la pandemia COVID 19 desafiando las narrativas dominantes y planteando preocupaciones sobre la transparencia y la responsabilidad Los invitados de Brand pintaron el panorama de una respuesta a la pandemia marcada por la extralimitación institucional la represión de puntos de vista alternativos y una interacción compleja y a menudo destructiva entre organismos gubernamentales medios de comunicación y empresas farmacéuticas Brand resumió la situación como la explotación de una crisis para legitimar una incursión que de otro modo habría sido inmediatamente rechazada por una población exigente Rand Paul El feudo de Fauci creció en dólares Paul habló de la erosión de la confianza pública durante la pandemia señalando la gestión de la teoría de las fugas de laboratorio como ejemplo paradigmático de deshonestidad institucional Nunca hemos tenido un encubrimiento en el que la prueba de la mentira sea tan evidente dijo Paul Señaló lo que los funcionarios del gobierno dijeron públicamente sobre los orígenes de COVID 19 mientras que en privado decían explícitamente lo contrario El senador estableció un paralelismo entre la influencia del Dr Anthony Fauci y la del ex director del FBI J Edgar Hoover sugiriendo que ambos acumularon un poder excesivo durante sus 40 y pico años en el cargo El feudo de Fauci creció en dólares hasta llegar a dominar todo el NIH los Institutos Nacionales de Salud explicó Paul Su presupuesto empequeñecía a todos los demás presupuestos

carácter obligatorio de algunas políticas de vacunación Muchas personas pierden su trabajo si no se vacunan pero si resultan perjudicadas por la vacuna no tienen dónde recurrir dijo David Martin COVID una prueba de mercado Martin experto en patentes proporcionó un amplio contexto histórico para la respuesta a la pandemia Remontó los orígenes de las actuales instituciones sanitarias a la Compañía de las Indias Orientales para la que el 86 de su comercio era opio Afirmó que el Wellcome Trust al que describió como la expresión moderna del comercio del opio constituyó la base de organizaciones como la Organización Mundial de la Salud e influyó en la creación de agencias reguladoras farmacéuticas en el Reino Unido y Estados Unidos Martin también destacó lo que considera una conexión preocupante entre las iniciativas de salud pública y los programas históricos de eugenesia vinculando las políticas pandémicas con experimentos médicos poco éticos del pasado Entre varios ejemplos que compartió estaba el envenenamiento a mediados del siglo pasado de niños con avena radiactiva en orfanatos de Estados Unidos para que pudiéramos observar cómo morían Dados estos precedentes históricos Brand se preguntó si la COVID 19 y la forma en que dio paso a la vigilancia masiva los pasaportes de vacunación y la promesa de monedas digitales centralizadas formaba parte de un intento de gestionar la población mundial mediante una dictadura tecnológica Sin duda no es por accidente dijo Martin argumentando que la pandemia fue esencialmente una prueba de mercado para ver exactamente hasta dónde

errors made by the Biden administration according to Vinay Prasad M D MPH Prasad hematologist oncologist professor and director of a medical policy lab at the University of California San Francisco said his lab has submitted hundreds of papers to preprint servers but only those that deviate from the official COVID 19 narrative have been rejected The basis for rejecting those papers is inconsistent with standards applied for other topics or with the fundamental rules of the servers Prasad explained in a recent Substack post and YouTube video on the topic All rejected papers are consistent with scientific practices and norms and similar papers not critical of the CDC or Biden administration have been accepted Prasad wrote If only papers that praise the CDC are acceptable by preprint servers he added then the role of science as a check and balance on incorrect policy is subverted Preprint servers were established to address inefficiencies in academic publishing The peer review process typically takes months or more delaying the real time sharing of scientific findings with the public Also many journals are proprietary and can only be accessed through expensive personal or institutional subscriptions Preprint servers offer a location for scientific reports and papers to be available to the public while the paper goes through peer review making scientific findings available immediately and for free and opening them up to broader public debate There is no peer review process for preprints although there is a vetting process Prasad said preprint servers are supposed to be neutral and supposed to post all research conducted with a clearly explained and reproducible methodology The goal Prasad said is to be inclusive and make scientific debate possible But instead Prasad said several of the preprint servers have become gatekeepers for what science gets published When the people who work there are rabid politicized and biased he said I think that s a problem The preprint servers are really a disgrace To test the bias of preprint servers Prasad s lab did a comprehensive analysis of its own preprints Lab staff analyzed outcomes for all preprints

transmission in some Massachusetts schools Prasad s lab found that by simply lengthening the timeframe of the data analyzed in the observational analysis the paper s conclusion was invalidated The data showed instead that masks did not slow the spread The servers didn t post their paper he said citing the need to be cautious about posting medical content Prasad said the article was censored because it calls into question something that frankly speaking is pretty stupid which is masking children with cloth masks a stupid intervention derived by someone who cannot read randomized controlled trials and then pushed with the full force of the federal government with no credible evidence and no randomized data The servers censored Prasad s lab s comprehensive analysis of preprint bias using the same justification the need to be cautious about medical content He said No one could possibly believe that this paper would require the need to be cautious it merely documents your preprint server s prior screw ups Another censored preprint reported on the lab s systematic review and meta analysis of Pfizer BioNTech vaccination in 5 to 11 year olds The paper critiqued the U S Food and Drug Administration s FDA approval of the drug for that age group The SSRN also removed that preprint citing again the need to be cautious about medical content SSRN used the same boilerplate

he said Their analysis found that overall Zenodo does not censor articles but SSRN and medRxiv do So he said these organizations established to make science transparent and uncensored have become gatekeepers for their friends for the views that they like He also said their policies were inconsistent with no clear scientific principles guiding rejection They re rejecting 38 of our articles because these are critical of establishment COVID 19 policies he said adding The COVID 19 pandemic is in fact a great example of how people in power suppress minority views even when those views are

sugars and refined carbohydrates you re not solving the health crisis by eliminating these things However I recently looked at a bag of bread that was sold at the store and the list of ingredients was a mile long I think we truly don t know what would happen if you started to reduce that list of ingredients While there are other policies Kennedy should pursue that would help ensure healthier food banning toxic ingredients that are already prohibited in other countries would be a way for Kennedy to ease into such reforms Prasad said Referencing opposition toward Kennedy from Democratic Party

better vaccine safety surveillance Characterizing the calls as a core truth about vaccine safety Prasad said The current system has no incentive to actually identify all of the adverse events that vaccines cause There s no mechanism in place Prasad said the current system is so weak that in the pandemic this country did not detect the myocarditis safety signal from mRNA vaccines nor did we detect the vaccine induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia signal from the Johnson Johnson or Janssen COVID 19 vaccine Kennedy is in a position to oversee the development of a new surveillance system and Prasad suggested that it should be active not passive It s got to link people at the moment in which they decide to get the vaccine or not and follow them out in the future Prasad said If Kennedy does this this will be the greatest achievement Prasad said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC recommendations that all children aged 6 months and older receive the COVID 19 vaccine and boosters are completely bogus and have no randomized data to support them This is another great place to hit Prasad said that by next fall COVID 19 vaccines and boosters should no longer be available for children and teenagers citing the low risk of serious infection among young people Prasad suggested the boosters could still be recommended for those over age 50 or 60 but on the condition that manufacturers perform randomized control trials of these vaccines among this age group Manufacturers can be invited to conduct a randomized control trial to show COVID 19 boosters improved clinical endpoints while they are conducting that trial Prasad said Perhaps you could provisionally allow the vaccine products to be available for nursing home residents or the few people who

expressing certain views He compared this with what he called active academic freedom where universities themselves hold debates on important policy issues Prasad said universities supported the establishment view on COVID 19 vaccines and measures shutting out contrary perspectives He said They should have had debates on masking kids They should have had debates on vaccine mandates

Services HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr continues to come under fire for promoting vitamin A amidst the West Texas measles outbreak Under the headline What to know about vitamin A s toxic risks after RFK Jr promotes it for measles Axios reported that some unvaccinated child measles patients in Texas the state with the most cases have shown signs of vitamin A toxicity including abnormal liver function Axios cited a March 25 New York Times article that broke the news stating that physicians at Covenant Children s Hospital in Lubbock Texas say they ve now treated a handful of unvaccinated children who were given so much vitamin A that they had signs of liver damage According to the Times the doctors observed yellowed skin and high levels of liver enzymes in their bloodwork both signs of a damaged liver CNN on March 26 reported that the same doctors had found abnormal liver function on routine lab tests Those reports are misleading according to Dr Richard Bartlett who told The Defender that abnormal liver function lab work such as elevated liver enzymes doesn t necessarily indicate vitamin A toxicity Bartlett an emergency room ER doctor in West Texas with over 30 years of experience said media claims about vitamin A toxicity are making a leap in logic that is illogical because other factors besides high vitamin A levels can cause liver enzymes to rise According to the Mayo Clinic elevated liver enzymes can be caused by many diseases medications and conditions including mononucleosis the Epstein Barr virus hepatitis A B and C nonprescription pain medicines such as Tylenol some prescription drugs used to control cholesterol such as statins and consuming alcohol The doctors at Covenant Children s Hospital would need to do a vitamin A blood test to accurately conclude that patients had toxic levels of vitamin A The media reports made no mention of vitamin A blood tests Bartlett said I am not aware of one child in West Texas with blood test results showing toxic levels of vitamin A However I treated a child with mononucleosis who had elevated liver enzymes in just the last 48 hours he said The child who lives in the area where the measles outbreak

emphasized that an estimated 10 of respiratory infections are coinfections meaning the patient has more than one type of infection going on The media reports failed to specify the types of infections in the patients who showed signs of abnormal liver function and whether those other infections might be linked to abnormal liver function Meanwhile USA Today on April 1 reiterated the claim stating that doctors at Covenant Children s Hospital reported seeing an uptick in vitamin A toxicity cases as families use the vitamin to help treat measles Dr Lara Johnson the chief medical officer for Covenant Health in Lubbock said in a statement At Covenant Children s we have encountered cases of vitamin A toxicity indicated by abnormal liver function in routine lab tests We ve seen fewer than 10 cases involving unvaccinated pediatric patients all initially hospitalized due to measles complications Some patients reported using vitamin A for both treatment and prevention of measles The statement made no mention of vitamin A blood test results Johnson was unavailable for comment so it remains unclear how many of the cases of vitamin A toxicity involved patients who reported using vitamin A It s also unclear what kinds of infections or coinfections the patients who showed abnormal liver function had The Defender asked Covenant Health s Senior Media Community Relations Manager Meredith Cunningham to clarify Johnson s statement and if the hospital had performed vitamin A blood tests for any of the patients referenced in the statement We have no further comment beyond the statement that you already have Cunningham said When asked to comment on the media reports of vitamin A toxicity in measles patients Dr Bed Edwards who has successfully treated many children in the West Texas measles outbreak using cod liver oil a food based source of vitamin A and vitamin D and budesonide a steroid used to relieve inflammation affecting the airways told The Defender I really

enzymes in children and adults more and more often now and it s due to fatty liver disease Edwards said fatty liver disease was almost unheard of 20 years ago but is now almost the new normal and is directly related to the standard American diet The Defender asked Katherine Wells director of Lubbock Public Health if she was aware of any vitamin A blood test results done for patients related to the measles outbreak Wells said she wasn t familiar with how Covenant Children s Hospital tests for vitamin A How much vitamin A is healthy versus harmful still up for debate According to the Cleveland Clinic the body needs vitamin A for healthy immune function and healthy skin eyes and hair Unlike water soluble vitamins such as vitamin C which can be excreted through urination vitamin A is fat soluble If a person takes in too much of it the body stores vitamin A in fat cells rather than excreting it According to the Mayo Clinic taking too much vitamin A can be harmful and has been linked to birth defects when taken excessively during pregnancy What constitutes optimal versus toxic levels of vitamin A is still debated For instance a 2017 Weston A Price Foundation blog post argues that vitamin A plays an important role in healthy human reproduction and suffers from unfair stigmatization The Weston A Price Foundation is a nonprofit founded in 1999 to disseminate the research of nutrition pioneer Dr Weston Price whose studies of isolated nonindustrialized peoples established the parameters of human health and determined the optimum characteristics of human diets Price who lived from 1870 to 1948 did research suggesting that the diets of healthy indigenous people contained roughly 10 times the amount of food based vitamin A than people he observed in the U S According to the foundation it s generally difficult though not impossible for a person to develop vitamin A toxicity from consuming food based sources such as cod liver oil Vitamin A levels are measured in micrograms of retinol activity equivalents mcg RAE Daily recommended levels vary from 500 mcg RAE and 1 800 mcg RAE depending on one s age sex and whether the person is pregnant or

Academy of Pediatrics vitamin A may be administered to infants and children in the United States with measles as part of supportive management Children with severe measles such as those who are hospitalized should be managed with vitamin A Vitamin A should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare provider and is not a substitute for vaccination Overuse of Vitamin A can lead to

The Washington Post on Tuesday published a preemptive hit piece on David Geier a researcher the Post claims has been tapped by the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS to lead a study of possible links between vaccines and autism The Post reported that Geier was hired to head the study quoting anonymous federal health officials who said that Geier an experienced data analyst would be the one analyzing the data At press time the HHS and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC had not confirmed that Geier was tapped to lead the study or work on it Geier did not respond by deadline to a request by The Defender for confirmation Geier is an expert on thimerosal a mercury based preservative used as an adjuvant in vaccines and on the connections between toxic exposures and autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders He has conducted extensive analysis on the CDC s Vaccine Safety Datalink a nonpublic database with data on more than 10 million patients The CDC uses the database to monitor vaccine adverse events Geier is also the lead or second author of hundreds of peer reviewed articles on these and related topics However the Post and other mainstream news outlets described him solely as a vaccine skeptic who has long promoted false claims about the connection between immunization and autism Commenting on the Post s report Children s Health Defense CHD CEO Mary Holland said I don t know whether The Washington Post account that David Geier will be appointed to analyze vaccine safety data is accurate but I hope it is Geier is a brilliant extremely knowledgeable researcher with deep expertise on mercury Holland said Geier had worked with CHD s predecessor organization the World Mercury Project and with HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr in 2015 on Kennedy s groundbreaking book Thimerosal Let the Science Speak Holland added Despite the hackneyed mantra that vaccines don t cause autism and that this causation theory has been debunked the truth is that only very limited marginal science backs up that dubious claim Officials in the Senate CDC and pharma friendly media like The Washington Post should be gratified that further research on this

Several senators expressed support for examining the link President Donald Trump pulled the nomination for his first choice to lead the CDC Dr David Weldon at the last minute after Weldon failed to secure enough votes reportedly because of comments he made about the link between vaccines and autism The CDC also confirmed earlier this month before Trump withdrew Weldon s nomination for its director that the CDC was planning a large study into potential connections between the vaccines and autism The Post today reported that in recent weeks HHS officials directed the CDC to turn over the vaccine safety data to the National Institutes of Health NIH to conduct the analysis The HHS did not confirm or deny the report by the deadline CHD Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker who has worked extensively with Geier told The Defender that Geier is an absolutely brilliant researcher and one of only a handful of independent scientists to ever work in the Vaccine Safety Datalink He was mentored by his father Mark Geier M D Ph D who was a scientist at the NIH and a medical practitioner during his long and illustrious career The Post said that Dr Mark Geier didn t respond to its

assessment of thimerosal in vaccines and found no evidence of harm Yet despite those findings the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC issued a statement calling for thimerosal to be removed from vaccines as soon as possible By the end of 2001 thimerosal had to be reduced or removed from vaccines administered to children under age 6 except for the flu vaccine although vaccines already produced with thimerosal stayed on the shelves Several flu vaccines continue to contain the ingredient So does MassBiologic s Tetanus and Diphtheria vaccine However none of the preferentially recommended vaccines other than flu vaccines contain thimerosal The Post claimed studies have ruled out the connection between vaccines and autism However only one vaccine the measles mumps rubella or MMR and one ingredient thimerosal have ever been studied for a possible link to autism There are 15 different vaccines on the CDC childhood schedule Studies of the other vaccines have not been conducted either individually in combination or cumulatively As attorney Aaron Siri wrote recently In 1991 the Institute of Medicine IOM issued its report on this question and could not find a single study on the question of whether pertussis vaccine causes autism Meaning the science had not been done In 2012 the IOM was again commissioned to study this question this time by CDC and also the question of whether tetanus and diphtheria vaccines can cause autism DTaP and again the IOM could not find a single study to support the claim that these vaccines do not cause autism Not one But it

ballot proposition number of the state Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act which in 1986 was approved by almost two thirds of California voters The law established a registry that is regularly updated with substances that include hazardous chemicals found in common household products electronics pesticides food drugs dyes additives construction materials and automobiles All must carry warning labels if they contain threshold levels of a listed chemical The law also prohibits the discharge of listed chemicals into sources of drinking water In the most recent update the Prop 65 registry which is maintained by scientists at the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment OEHHA has grown to 874 chemicals and compounds Chemicals are added only after exhaustive

prompted them to reformulate their products and more than 60 said that included products sold outside of California More than 80 said they look to Prop 65 to see which chemicals to avoid in new products or raw materials What we found was that companies rather than consumers may be most affected by the law s warning requirements Silent Spring research scientist Jennifer Ohayon a lead author of the study said in a statement By increasing businesses awareness of chemicals in the supply chain Prop 65 has caused them to shift away from using toxic substances and that s a positive step for public health The reason is simple Companies are incredibly reluctant to put a label on a product that says it contains a chemical that causes cancer said Ohayon The law applies to products sold in California even if they are made elsewhere Companies don t want to make a Prop 65 compliant product to be sold in California the nation s largest market and another version for other places so California s regulations often create a de facto national standard In October another study by researchers from the same institutions showed that Prop 65 is also working to lower concentrations of toxic chemicals in Americans bodies Using biomonitoring data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention they analyzed human blood and urine samples for levels of 26 chemicals before and after they were listed For most of the chemicals levels in people s bodies went down both in California and nationwide in the years following their listing The study also found that on average Californians have lower levels of toxic chemicals than other Americans Our finding that Californians are generally less exposed to toxic chemicals than are other Americans has potentially far reaching implications

prioritizing recommendations from medical associations rather than from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP which makes vaccine recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and

committee seats a few days later Commenting on industry insiders efforts to create a new commission research scientist James Lyons Weiler Ph D told The Defender They want to create and lend authority

overt industry self governance and regulation The Post called the move by the unspecified group of actors extraordinary but conceded that it faces major challenges For example insurance companies typically don t cover shots that aren t recommended by ACIP An ACIP recommendation is also the basis on which the federal Vaccines for Children Program pays for vaccines for minors whose families can t afford them That program covers vaccine costs for about half of U S children Also in many states pharmacists ability to prescribe or administer vaccines is tied to the adult and child immunization schedules recommended by ACIP And state laws for school vaccine requirements as well as requirements for healthcare workers are typically tied to ACIP recommendations Another problem according to the

from this study that the public health intervention of fluoridated water may have traded brain health for tooth health Children s Health Defense Senior Research Scientist Karl Jablonowski said The authors concluded that given both the benefits and harms they determined to be associated with water fluoridation and in the context of growing evidence of fluoride s serious neurodevelopmental risks new risk benefit analyses should be undertaken regarding water fluoridation programs Researchers David and Mark Geier analyzed data from the Independent Healthcare Research Database composed of de identified healthcare records from the Florida Medicaid System from 1990 2012 This allowed them to study a large population across a significant amount of time Because Florida has counties that are fluoridated and others that aren t they were able to compare outcomes among children exposed to water fluoridation for their whole lives 25 662 children to those who weren t 2 509 children Once they determined children s fluoride exposure they identified healthcare claims among those children for dental cavities and neurodevelopmental issues They examined fluoride exposure and outcomes during the first year of life and the first 10 years of life The researchers found that in the first year of life there was a statistically significant slight decrease in the risk of tooth decay with increased

Review published in October 2024 concluded that water fluoridation might lead to a very small reduction about one quarter of one tooth in cavities in children s baby teeth Limeback said Conversely how many IQ points were lost in Medicaid kids living in fluoridated communities How many more autistic kids can be blamed on fluoride exposure from birth to age 10 This study is one of four recently published studies that have looked at postnatal neurological harm from fluoride in drinking water More well done studies are needed to find out the extent of harm that fluoridation has been posing to developing children ever since its inception in 1945 Promoters of dental public health and medical public health must now work together to decide if saving even one cavity in Medicaid children which is repairable using fluoridation is worth irreversibly damaging their brains Jablonowski said the latest research findings raised questions for research and public health interventions The authors present compelling evidence that something widely considered as safe may actually be harmful He added In terms of absolute risk if this study is correct out of every thousand children water fluoridation prevents tooth decay in 58 of them and induces autism in 11 intellectual disability in 5 and specific developmental delay in 49 That is a trade off no parent would make no doctor would

to 0 7 mg L without publicly acknowledging that there are legitimate safety concerns beyond dental fluorosis However emails and other documents show it is precisely the concerns about fluoride s neurotoxic effects driving these changes and moving officials as high up as the U S surgeon general to quietly withdraw their support for the practice Consumer and environmental advocacy groups sued

EPA on Monday took the rare step of issuing a warning about serious permanent and irreversible health risks associated with a chemical used to kill weeds on farms and golf courses and athletic fields Citing significant health risks to pregnant individuals and their developing babies the agency said farmworkers and others handling dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate more commonly known as DCPA were at risk as are people who might play on courses or fields recently sprayed with the pesticide The most serious risks extend to the developing babies of pregnant women especially those handling DCPA products The agency said pregnant women exposed to DCPA could experience changes to fetal thyroid hormone levels which are linked to low birth weight impaired brain development decreased IQ and impaired motor skills later in life Though product labels say people should stay out of fields for 12 hours after they are sprayed with DCPA the EPA said evidence indicates that in many cases sprayed fields would be unsafe for 25 days or more The agency additionally said that mothers and their developing babies could be at risk if they live near areas where DCPA is used because the pesticide can drift EPA has determined that currently registered products containing the herbicide DCPA likely cannot be used under current label directions without posing serious risks of concern in humans Ed Messina director of the Office of Pesticide Programs stated in a letter to AMVAC a California based company that is the sole manufacturer of the pesticide The product is primarily used to control weeds on crops such as broccoli Brussels sprouts cabbage and onions Last year AMVAC agreed to end its use on turf citing health concerns The EPA is currently reviewing whether to reapprove DCPA Though the agency rarely takes the step of canceling a pesticide it is considering that route including suspending DCPA during review process the agency said Due to the serious potential risks posed by DCPA use EPA will be pursuing these regulatory options as soon as practicable Messina wrote in the communication to AMVAC AMVAC proposed mitigations including making DCPA a Restricted Use Pesticide meaning

who are exposed to DCPA Critics noted that the EPA has been pushing AMVAC for more than a decade for scientific evidence of DCPA safety and said it should be banned in the U S as it has been in the European Union since 2009 The EPA s own conclusions and the overwhelming scientific evidence underscore the ongoing risks of the toxic pesticide DCPA said Environmental Working Group Senior Toxicologist Alexis Temkin As long as DCPA continues to be legal the chemical will continue to pose real dangers to farmworkers people who are pregnant and other vulnerable populations exposed to it

According to Hinchliffe though the WEF has a peculiar view of how to accomplish this The way that they go about rebuilding trust is to declare themselves trustees It s incredible he said It s really funny because they keep talking about how they lost trust in different ways There was losing trust in the media losing trust in science in technology companies They also took a big jab at X formerlyTwitter and Elon Musk Hinchliffe said He also referred to remarks made at last week s meeting by Emma Tucker editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal who said We owned the news We were the gatekeepers and we very much owned the facts as well She lamented that nowadays people can go to all kinds of sources and are very much questioning the media Hinchliffe said They re not used to being transparent and now they need to be more transparent They want to make sure that their people are put in power The WEF s Global Risks Report released just before this year s meeting listed misinformation and disinformation as the greatest threats to the world over the next two years The meeting s participants last week appeared to illuminate just why the WEF considers so called

correspondent for Southeast Asia suggested there is a risk the wrong leaders are elected in elections in key countries this year For Hinchliffe references to the wrong leader are euphemisms for a leader that s not a globalist They want to make sure that their people are put in power because if not then their whole world crumbles he said What they don t want is whole sovereign states they want to break down borders they want to tear down sovereignty Hinchliffe connected this to the WEF s warnings about misinformation If you have any information that looks bad for them and good for their opponents they re not going to want to have that According to Hinchliffe efforts at developing global governance an idea promoted by António Guterres the United Nation s secretary general at the WEF meeting last week is a veiled way of articulating the goal of consolidating control They are kind of worried that they re losing their grip on that Hinchliffe said Once they control what you spend your money on it s game over The WEF meeting also included discussions of digital ID but at a subdued level compared to past meetings according to Hinchliffe It s almost like they tried not to talk about that Hinchliffe said digital ID is kind of a misnomer noting that the term is most often used to refer to digital identity which he said includes everything about you which is linked to everything to control basically every aspect of your life They want it to control everything he said Digital ID is for financial services school enrollment vaccination status but it s so much more than that They re going to try to use it for accessing the internet using cybersecurity or even AI Hinchliffe said digital ID also would be linked to programmable CBDCs meaning they can turn it on or off they can set expiry dates they can say that you can only spend this much here that much there only on certain products or services CBDCs and digital ID also would be tied to a purportedly climate related agenda according to Hinchliffe He noted that CBDCs could then be used to limit travel track personal carbon footprints and control and track transactions Once they control what you can spend

necessary for They need that to control your finances We don t need it but they want it Digital ID akin to a digital control system Digital ID also is very necessary for tracking the unvaccinated according to Queen Máxima of the Netherlands at last week s meeting Hinchliffe said the digital inclusion promised by technologies such as digital ID actually means physical exclusion citing vaccine passports and digital health certificates as examples Hinchliffe referred to a recently launched United Nations initiative the 50 in 5 campaign to roll out digital public infrastructure He said this consists of digital ID digital payments which is the CBDC and massive data sharing adding that vaccine passports are part of it as well According to Hinchliffe this amounts to a digital control system Calls for AI regulation by WEF participants an attempt to secure monopoly The WEF meeting s Preparing for Disease X panel last week featured remarks by World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warning that a yet unknown pathogen referred to as Disease X could cause a new pandemic Hinchliffe said the definite language used by the participants when referring to Disease X belies advance knowledge of or preparation for such an occurrence In my opinion they already have Disease X he said It s probably been engineered somewhere and they ve already been working on the cure the vaccine for it Hinchliffe drew parallels with Event 201 a coronavirus pandemic simulation held in October 2019 which appeared to predict the subsequent COVID 19 pandemic and also outlined media censorship and controlling the narrative WEF meeting participants including Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla also touted the benefits of AI in vaccine development and healthcare applications

his wife Hilde Schwab mixed their personal affairs with the Forum s resources The whistleblower also alleged that the Schwabs funded luxury travel and services at the WEF s expense misused WEF property and that Klaus Schwab asked junior employees to withdraw thousands of dollars from ATMs on his behalf Schwab denied the allegations and said he would challenge them in a lawsuit unnamed sources within the WEF told the WSJ He said through a spokesperson that he will also file lawsuits against anybody who spreads these mistruths The board opened its investigation during an emergency meeting on Sunday The 87 year old Schwab decided to resign immediately rather than stay for an extended transition period as originally planned the WSJ reported Whistleblower allegations blew up Schwab s retirement timeline Schwab first announced he was stepping down as the WEF s executive chairman last year but remained nonexecutive chair Last month following a different investigation by the board into Davos workplace culture Schwab announced he would also step down as nonexecutive chair although the process to replace him was set to go through 2027 The workplace culture investigation was prompted by a WSJ report that revealed allegations by employees of discrimination against women and Black employees at the Geneva based WEF Schwab and the WEF refuted those allegations The new whistleblower allegations blew up Schwab s original retirement timeline by prompting the new investigation the WSJ reported A WEF spokesperson said Wednesday in a statement also reported by Politico

its founding in 1971 the WEF namely through its annual meeting at the elite resort town of Davos Switzerland has been a site for the global elite to gather network and lay out their vision for the future which critics have long observed is rooted in hierarchy exploitation and political polarization Michael Rectenwald Ph D author of The Great Reset and the Struggle for Liberty Unraveling the Global Agenda said the WEF was originally founded as the European Management Forum However after two years Schwab cut ties with the European Commission and decided to invite only select politicians to its events By 1974 he said Schwab had shifted the emphasis from corporate management to global governance Rectenwald added The WEF positioned itself as filling gaps between national international and transnational governance organizations which it has deemed incapable of effective global governance due to exclusive membership of state actors The WEF aims to overcome what it considers to be the inertia of such international intergovernmental governance bodies as the United Nations by networking business governmental and civil society leaders Since focusing on global governance the WEF has sought to pontificate on supposed global crises that could only be treated on a global scale with global governance Thus it has focused on climate change the Fourth Industrial Revolution and most recently the COVID crisis The organization drew international ire during the COVID 19 pandemic when one of its videos portending a dystopian future where you will own nothing and you will be happy

pandemic Many WEF critics on X celebrated Schwab s Monday announcement that he was stepping down However when he first floated the idea last year experts who spoke with The Defender cautioned that a change in WEF leadership would not likely bring much change to the WEF s policy agenda Tim Hinchliffe editor of The Sociable said that even with a change of chairmanship The WEF will continue to push for the total technocratic takeover of society through the merger of corporation and state the fusion of humans and machines and the Orwellian use of technologies emerging from the so called Fourth Industrial Revolution that blurs our physical biological and digital identities Rectenwald added Schwab is nothing if not a megalomaniac But his resignation will not change the focus of the WEF which

be a major component of future metaverses but the difference between AR and VR is that the AR headsets actually see the physical world around you which poses privacy concerns for users They have

recognition geolocation tracking or contact tracing when any government or corporation can literally see what you are doing and where you are going in real time Michael Rectenwald Ph D author of Google Archipelago The Digital Gulag and the Simulation of Freedom told The Defender The conception is materialist and mechanistic at base the hallmarks of social engineering It represents the world as consisting of nothing but manipulable matter or rather of digital media mimicking matter It suggests that human beings can be reduced to a material substratum and can be induced to accept a technological reproduction in lieu of reality Further it assumes that those who inhabit this simulacrum can be controlled by technocratic means Rectenwald said this materialist mechanistic techno determinist and reductionist worldview is consistent with the transhumanist belief that humans themselves will soon be succeeded by a new transhuman species or humanity plus h perhaps a genetically and AI enhanced cyborg that will outstrip ordinary humans and make the latter virtually obsolete Bruner said the deeper and more insidious reason the WEF and its partners are obsessed with virtual realities like the metaverse is the opportunity it presents to control massive amounts of people either as a placating tool akin to bread and circuses or even as a brainwashing and propaganda tool An enforcement regime for vaccination The metaverse is part and parcel of the Great Reset Hinchliffe and others said When WEF founder Klaus Schwab officially launched the Great Reset in 2020 he said that the Fourth Industrial Revolution will lead to the fusion of our physical digital and biological identities Hinchliffe said When you combine the Great Reset and the Fourth Industrial Revolution what

means of tracking the unvaccinated Thanks to the reduced satisfactions of the real world because of the Great Reset the metaverse may become preferable to non virtual reality Rectenwald said And given its governance by the same elites that govern the physical world the limitations and threats imposed by authorities in the physical world will be doubled in the metaverse If you are an unelected globalist at the WEF or if you are a big corporation then the idea of ruling over countries that exist only in cyberspace becomes very alluring Hinchliffe said You can invent all the rules and govern

Housing and Urban Development told The Defender One of the WEF s goals is to market the central bankers reset to the general public Metaverse promotion is part of using online entertainment such as video games and multi media combined with mind control entertainment and subliminal programming to distract and manipulate the portion of the population that can be captured to escape the real world part and parcel of lowering cognition and IQs Fitts added For Bruner the endgame for proponents of the metaverse is to build back better by digitalizing everything using Fourth Industrial Revolution

metaverse identity includes data points the report states that also extend into the intricacies of an individual s behaviours actions and choices The report gives an example of such intricacies The way an individual speaks for example with unique tonal inflexions or cultural idioms can offer insights into their background and upbringing Similarly a person s distinctive movements whether it s the fluidity of their dance or the precision of their basketball shots tell tales of their experiences and passions Collectively these attributes can generate insights and inferred data The metaverse enables dynamic verification through real time inferred data For example an individual s behaviors paired with facial scanning can be used as ongoing age estimation or behavioural credentials effectively making verification an ongoing authentication process based on individual user conduct Metaverse identity in turn connects and anchors a person to the physical and virtual world the report

daily nutrition and exercise habits into the doppelganger s simulated environment The report acknowledges that there will be people who by choice or circumstance remain outside the formal bounds of identification i e consciously opting out of participating in the metaverse and that this could negatively influence social mobility in physical worlds given the reliance economies have on digital platforms When implemented together digital currency and digital ID will create a global interoperable system that allows WEF allied central banks to track trace surveil and ultimately control how people spend their money and thus live their lives Bruner said According to Rectenwald the WEF and its corporate partners are interested in developing and promoting the metaverse particularly to create metaverse identities allowing all internet use to be collected in a database connected to individual users He added In this way all internet activity of users will become part of their digital

connect brains to online data networks by 2050 According to the RAND Corporation U K Defence report the metaverse will lead to the creation of a more interconnected global society emerging via virtual reality There may also be not one but multiple metaverses which may come to function almost like new countries that exist in cyberspace rather than in physical locations but have complex economic and political systems that interact with the physical world This may reduce the importance of national and individual identities and change how societies define and shape their cultural identities RAND states If you can t physically invade a country to establish a New World Order or a One World Government why not create a digital one that reduces national individual identities and then install a

period from 59 868 to 125 538 However those numbers do not even include GLP 1 drugs prescribed to children by primary care physicians or family medicine practitioners or at compounding pharmacies MedPage Today said Since the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA approved Wegovy in 2021 the drug and the entire class of drugs has become a sensation promoted by influencers and celebrities helping to fuel a massive new drug market estimated to be worth 100 billion a year for drugmakers About 20 of U S children and adolescents are chronically obese according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC The FDA approved Saxenda to treat obesity in kids 12 and up in December 2020 and Wegovy in December 2022 Weeks later in January 2023 the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP issued new guidelines on childhood obesity at the time it was the first update to the guidelines in 15 years recommending early diagnosis and aggressive treatment The AAP recommendations included weight loss

real risks oversells benefits and ushers in lifelong medicalization for millions under the banner of obesity management You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Rob Verkerk Ph D In less than five years GLP 1 receptor agonist GLP 1 RA drugs like Ozempic Wegovy and Mounjaro have rocketed from niche diabetes treatments to global blockbusters hailed as miracle weight loss jabs With governments celebrities and social media influencers all on board the injectable drugs are now being prescribed at scale including across the U K and European Union with potential expansion into pharmacies and over the counter sales globally with the World Health Organization WHO stamp of approval Last week the Tony Blair Institute advocated that 15 million Brits should receive the jabs in the post over the next two years While it would cost 6 of the National Health Service NHS budget in the first year the think tank s modelers found break even would occur within 10 years with cumulative fiscal benefits estimated at 52 billion by 2050 mainly by keeping people in work longer Yet amid the euphoria questions are growing louder and with good reason Are we witnessing another pharma fuelled bubble one that downplays real risks oversells benefits and ushers in lifelong medicalization for millions under the banner of obesity management At Alliance for Natural Health International we believe in informed health freedom and that means asking critical questions when the mainstream fails to UK drug regulator advice to health professionals U K data reported by The Independent suggests that only around 4 000 people a month get weight loss jabs on the NHS while around 1 million Brits buy them privately including online This might suggest that many who use the jabs are not able to exercise proper informed consent prior to their use As a result we thought it appropriate to start by summarizing the advice given by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency MHRA to health professionals This advice dated Oct 24 2024 at the time of writing warns as follows Common side effects The MHRA notes that gastrointestinal side effects are prevalent especially at the start of treatment or after dose increases These include Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Constipation These symptoms can persist for several days and may affect more than 1 in 10 patients They can lead to dehydration which if severe may result in kidney damage requiring hospitalization Patients are advised to stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids to mitigate this risk Serious

and Unregulated Sources The MHRA warns against obtaining GLP 1 RAs from unauthorized sources such as unregistered online pharmacies due to risks of counterfeit products and misuse Recommendations for healthcare professionals Prescribe GLP 1 RAs only within their licensed indications and under appropriate medical supervision Educate patients on potential side effects and the importance of adhering to prescribed dosages Advise patients to report any adverse effects promptly Encourage reporting of suspected adverse reactions through the Yellow Card scheme to monitor medication safety For comprehensive details please refer to the MHRA s full advisory GLP 1 receptor agonists reminder of the potential side effects and to be aware of the potential for misuse The Tony Blair Institute report released last week was somewhat coy about side effects highlighting primarily the pancreatitis and gallbladder inflammation risks but did point to a study that showed recent data collected through the Yellow Card scheme in England showed higher than expected deaths in patients taking GLP 1s The promise but at what price No one can deny the dramatic weight loss some users experience Social media feeds are full of it For individuals with intractable obesity and associated complications these injections may indeed represent a lifeline But the public is being sold a simplified story

below How unique is Sharon Osborne s case Sharon Osbourne the 71 year old television personality and former host of The Talk and and X Factor judge has openly discussed her challenging experience with the weight loss drug Ozempic semaglutide Osbourne began using Ozempic in late 2022 and reported losing 42 pounds within four months However she soon found herself weighing under 100 pounds a weight she considered too low for her 5 2 frame She expressed concerns about her gaunt appearance and the difficulty she faced in regaining weight after discontinuing the medication In interviews Osbourne described experiencing persistent nausea during the initial weeks of treatment stating You don t throw up physically but you ve got that feeling She also warned about the ease of becoming reliant on the drug for weight loss particularly among teenagers emphasizing the potential dangers of such dependency Reflecting on her journey Osbourne told People magazine she has decided to step away from weight loss medications and cosmetic procedures focusing instead on accepting her natural body She has become an advocate for cautious use of weight loss drugs highlighting the importance of medical supervision and the risks associated with rapid weight loss Osbourne s candid revelations serve as a cautionary tale about the potential side effects of GLP 1 receptor agonists like Ozempic underscoring the need for informed decision making and professional guidance when considering such treatments But let s remind ourselves many health professionals are not aware of the full catalog of issues that can result partially because these are being downplayed and also because it s early days for most of them so their own clinical experience with long term use is limited Expansion plans The

GLP 1 RAs affecting the brain Frank Duca Ph D associate professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson makes the point that GLP 1 medications act directly on the brain whereas natural GLP 1 is broken down within minutes of being produced by the intestines meaning it likely never reaches the brain The muscle problem few are talking about In our view one of the most overlooked dangers of GLP 1 RA drugs is their impact on muscle mass Appetite suppression and energy restriction often lead the body to metabolize lean muscle tissue not just fat Muscle is one of the most important reserves for mitochondria our key energy producing organelles Loss of muscle can Reduce mitochondrial reserves and ATP chemical energy production Weaken the immune system Increase the risk of respiratory complications Impair metabolic flexibility Increase the risk of falls and fractures Reduced bone mass and health exacerbated by a lack of physical activity GLP 1 RA induced muscle loss may be especially concerning in older adults already at risk of sarcopenia age related muscle loss yet this risk remains under communicated to patients and physicians alike But it s not just the older folk who are at risk Those on low protein e g vegan diets and who don t do much in the way of resistance weight training are also likely to be affected more by muscle loss We ve been following the development of powered and passive unpowered exoskeletons or exosuits wearable external robotic devices designed to support or enhance human movement by mimicking augmenting or assisting natural joint and muscle function Could these be the perfect pairing for GLP 1 RA long termers who ve lost too much muscle to be able to function autonomously The erosion of informed consent Perhaps the most urgent issue is ethical The widespread promotion of GLP 1 RAs is not being matched by equal investment in nutrition and lifestyle education or support Nor is it framed as a temporary aid to kick start

chance of using natural GLP 1 to restore blood sugar metabolic flexibility and normal weight while increasing the lean muscle mass to body fat ratio When drugs are pushed as first line interventions without these alternatives being properly explored informed consent is reduced to pharmaceutical consent Better balance better health To be clear the Alliance for Natural Health is not opposed to the use of GLP 1 RAs where they are truly needed But public health policy mustn t be led blindly by pharmaceutical interests and it must strike a balance between short term efficacy and long term well being That means Clearer disclosure of known and emerging risks Better integration with nutrition movement and behavioral therapies Formal recognition and communication of muscle loss and nutrient depletion risks Stronger support for individual led lifestyle first health pathways GLP 1 jabs are most definitely helping some But they should never be prescribed or sold as a substitute for health sovereignty the ability to understand choose and participate in your own wellness journey If you or a loved one is using a GLP 1 RA Consider the following and decide along with the advice from a suitably qualified and experienced health professional Prioritize protein Aim for 1 2 1 6 grams per kilogram of body weight daily to minimize muscle loss Strength train regularly At least three times weekly to retain lean mass and metabolic function Track body composition using body composition scales e g Tanita Omron using weighing scales that also estimate fat muscle water and visceral fat Work

state s schools to follow existing vaccine laws which don t recognize religious exemptions instead of Gov Patrick Morrisey s executive order which allows for the exemptions West Virginia Watch reported Wednesday In January Morrisey signed Executive Order 7 25 allowing religious and conscientious objections to the state s vaccine requirements for schoolchildren To comply with the order parents only need to provide a written statement explaining why they object to the vaccines However on Wednesday the state Department of Education voted unanimously to require State Superintendent of Schools Michelle Blatt to issue guidance to county school systems instructing them to follow the state s current school vaccination law Last month Blatt sent a memo to county school superintendents ordering them to continue following the state s vaccination law and recommending that students not be allowed to attend school during the 2025 26 academic year if they haven t received the required immunizations However on the same day she issued the memo Blatt rescinded it at Morrisey s request NPR affiliate WOUB reported last month West Virginia state law requires children to receive vaccines for chickenpox hepatitis B measles meningitis mumps diphtheria polio rubella tetanus and whooping cough before starting school The state does not require COVID 19 vaccinations for children California Maine New York and Connecticut are the only remaining states that don t allow religious or philosophical exemptions to school vaccine mandates According to West Virginia Watch The difference between the governor s order and state law has led to a fractured response from schools with some private and religious schools opting not to comply with the executive order In a statement Wednesday Alex Lanfranconi a spokesperson for Morrisey said education department officials are trampling on the religious liberties of children ignoring the state s religious freedom law and trying to make the state an extreme outlier on vaccine policy when there isn t a valid public policy reason to do so This decision isn t about public health it s about making West Virginia more like liberal states such as California and New York Lanfranconi said Lanfranconi said the state Department of Health will continue granting religious exemptions As of last month the health department had approved approximately

California based attorney Greg Glaser said an executive order has the power of law Technically executive orders are directives issued by a governor to manage state operations under existing law whereas statutes passed by the legislature create or change existing law Glaser said The current law in West Virginia includes a state based Religious Freedom and Restoration Act RFRA law called the Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023 he said Similar laws exist across the U S and categorically uphold religious exemptions from government mandates Glaser said Writing on his blog California based attorney Rick Jaffe said Morrissey is relying on that law to argue that the vaccine statute as currently enforced is likely unconstitutional unless it allows religious exemptions By contrast the state Department of Education is arguing that it is obliged to enforce the statute as written They put mandates under strict scrutiny by judges and governors Glaser said Hence the RFRA statute in West Virginia provides a strong legal basis for the governor s executive order protecting West Virginians rights to freely exercise their religion According to the Legal Information Institute strict scrutiny is the highest standard of review that a court will use to evaluate the constitutionality of government action and starts from a presumption of unconstitutionality Jaffe said the issue at hand is not just legal it s political and philosophical Who decides what counts as a valid exercise of executive power Can a governor act to protect civil liberties when the legislature fails to do so Or are we bound forever to agency policies that may no longer reflect either current science or constitutional values Jaffe asked Sean Whelan general counsel for Morrisey said the governor isn t defying the law or casting doubt on science In remarks quoted by West Virginia Watch Whelan cited the 2023 law Morrisey is reading that vaccine law together with another law the Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023 which prohibits government action that substantially burdens a person s exercise of religion unless it serves a compelling government interest and is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest That language mirrors the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act which federal courts across the country have described as a super statute displacing the normal operation of otherwise applicable federal laws Whelan said Morrisey is asking for the department s partnership and support in applying the Equal Protection for Religion Act noting that it", "chunk_id":

recognize religious exemptions to vaccination in West Virginia have followed a circuitous path in the last year In March the West Virginia House of Delegates rejected Senate Bill 460 which would have codified religious exemptions into law Despite rejection of the bill Morrisey s executive order remains in effect Last year former Gov Jim Justice vetoed a bill that would have allowed private schools to grant religious exemptions and also exempted virtual only public school students The bill garnered majorities in the state s legislative chambers Morrisey s executive order is facing a legal challenge Last month the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice a legal advocacy organization filed a lawsuit in Kanawha County Circuit Court asking the court to deem the order unlawful or invalid The lawsuit remains pending The challenge comes amid rising public support for religious and medical exemptions A survey conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center in January showed that public support for religious exemptions has nearly doubled in the last six years A July 2024 Gallup poll found that support for mandatory school vaccination has declined in recent years A study funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal Vaccine in February found that 74 of elementary school personnel surveyed in California did not believe their schools had the authority to deny medical exemptions and that a majority opposed COVID 19 mandates Glaser and Jaffe predicted further legal battles ahead for Morrisey s executive order Because

in the state I think that legislation clarifying this is important because when the Equal Protection for Religious Act was passed it didn t amend specific laws So the vaccine laws stand alone Morrisey said Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us News is wonderful and welcome for health freedom Proponents of health freedom celebrated the news I was overwhelmed with emotion because so many families have had hardship and vaccine injuries and have just really been oppressed in our state Chanda Adkins president of West Virginians for Health Freedom told The Defender And so it was humbling People s rights have been violated because we haven t had the ability to choose and now that will happen Mary Holland CEO of Children s Health Defense CHD told The Defender the news was both wonderful and welcome All medical interventions including vaccination must be based on true informed consent with the opportunity to refuse Holland said I hope that this example will influence the states of California Maine New York and Connecticut that espouse liberal credentials while enforcing authoritarian health policies CHD Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker called the news a huge win for medical freedom as West Virginia has never had a religious exemption for school attendance before As more and more families are opting out of vaccination I believe we ll see states start to practice good public health with stronger commitments to medical choice and bodily autonomy Hooker said This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The Defender is 100 reader supported No

decades In the meantime parents with sincere religious beliefs have been left on their own to figure out how to educate their children without being compelled to vaccinate them Marlene Moss another member of West Virginia Parents for Religious Freedom told The Defender Figaretti is one of many parents who have had to send their children across state lines to Ohio so they could attend school with a religious exemption Others moved out of state or are homeschooling their kids Moss said The homeschool movement in West Virginia has just grown tremendously Adkins a former state representative said parents had been advocating for religious exemptions and to end state vaccine mandates at least since the early 2000s They had some success in 2015 she said when they made it legal to not vaccinate your children Prior to 2015 it was a misdemeanor in our state and carried a fine she said Despite that small change there were still very restrictive policies around exemptions Adkins said getting legislation passed has been challenging because house members can change every two years so parents and advocacy groups like West Virginians for Health Freedom have dedicated themselves to educating representatives on the issue Moss said the parents who have been organizing around exemptions knew the new governor supported a religious exemption but they were surprised by the announcement of an executive order on day one It was just amazing she said She is optimistic that the legislature will codify Morrisey s executive order into law because support for exemptions has grown among the public and in the legislature Adkins said she was certain that when the state legislative session begins next month lawmakers will introduce legislation We re waiting to see who s going to get to the finish line first she said anticipating that both the senate and the house will rush to propose a bill She hopes the bills will be even more expansive than the order and provide a clear path to exemptions

this article Sign Up Story at a glance Fertility rates are declining dramatically in Western countries with the U K hitting its lowest rate since 1938 at 1 44 children per woman in 2023 significantly below the replacement level Microplastics particularly those containing phthalates and other xenoestrogens significantly contribute to fertility decline by disrupting the neuroendocrine system and damaging reproductive organs To reduce microplastic exposure use glass containers filter your water avoid products sold in plastic packaging choose natural fibers for your clothing and never microwave food in plastic containers Maintaining the right balance of omega 3 and omega 6 fats is essential for fertility To support reproductive health include omega 3 rich cold water fish in your diet and limit omega 6 fat intake to less than 5 grams per day Additional fertility boosting strategies include minimizing exposure to toxins eating organic foods reducing electromagnetic field EMF exposure and maintaining healthy lifestyle habits like exercising regularly In America couples who are trying to conceive children are currently struggling According to the National Institutes of Health NIH 9 of men and 11 of women are experiencing fertility problems And it s not just America experiencing this public health issue In the U K fertility rates have dropped to their lowest point in decades Fertility rates in the UK are declining In a study published in the British Medical Journal freelance researcher Matthew Limb laid out the current population problems in a paper succinctly titled Fertility Rate in England and Wales Fell to a Record Low in 2023 Limb noted that the current fertility rate is at its lowest since 1938 in the U K Using data from the Office for National Statistics ONS the findings show that 591 072 children were born in 2023 This figure is the lowest number of births recorded since 1977 Placed into another context the average total fertility rate for 2023 was 1 44 children per woman In 2022 the rate was 1 49 down from 1 55 in 2021 Those numbers are not the only concerning findings The average age of new parents has also increased 33 8 years for fathers and 30 9 for mothers respectively The largest childbearing age group in decline was adults in their 20s As summarized by Greg Ceely head of population health monitoring at the ONS Looking in more detail

different ages the decline in fertility rates has been the most dramatic in the 20 to 24 and 25 to 29 age groups Current population replacement rate will be unsustainable What does this mean for the U K as well as other countries that have low birth rates Eventually their economies will suffer Take for example the population decline currently happening in Japan In 2008 their population peaked at 128 million but by 2022 it declined to 125 million If this trend continues they will only have 63 million people by 2100 From an economic perspective the country s gross domestic product will decline as the number of working age citizens decreases Small and medium businesses have already started closing because there are no successors Social and public industries such as education and medicine have also started experiencing shortages in workers The only way to return the population growth to a growing scale is to encourage couples to have children preferably two or more As noted by the ONS In the long term for countries with low mortality to maintain or grow their population without positive net migration the total fertility rate needs to be around the replacement level of 2 1 children per woman or higher While having more children may seem like a simple solution the barriers to growing a family are complex and deeply rooted in socioeconomic challenges These include financial instability skyrocketing housing costs and the high price of childcare For those actively trying to conceive but facing difficulties additional factors come into play One significant yet often overlooked issue is the widespread use of plastics which contain endocrine disrupting chemicals Over time these materials also degrade into microplastics that accumulate in the body and disrupt the reproductive system further complicating the path to parenthood Microplastics are a big factor in infertility Microplastics are small pieces of plastic less than five millimeters long They come from various sources such as plastic bottles and bags synthetic clothing and even personal care products According to a study published in Frontiers in Endocrinology one big contributor to the world s declining infertility problems is the rise of plastic usage It is noteworthy that an exponential rise in global plastic production coincides with a well documented population wide decline in human sperm production which appears to be accelerating since 2000 Reports indicate that microplastics end up everywhere in your body For example a group of University of New Mexico researchers noted that microplastics have been found in organs such the kidneys liver and brain via the intestinal barrier Expectedly microplastics", "chunk_id":

intestinal barrier Expectedly microplastics are now in reproductive organs too In a study published in Science of the Total Environment researchers noted that microplastics embedded into both men s and women s organs produce problems In the reproductive system microplastics interfere with the blood testis barrier impairing spermatogenesis in males and causing placental dysfunction ovarian atrophy endometrial hyperplasia and fibrosis in females Moreover microplastics potentially affect offspring s lipid metabolism and reproductive functions Based on these findings the researchers believe that the chemicals that comprise microplastics are the reason for affecting fertility noting that microplastics disrupt the neuroendocrine system That s because the majority of microplastics contain phthalates that leach out of the material leading to endocrine disrupting problems Other chemicals in microplastics include pesticides forever chemicals and bisphenol A Much of the reason why microplastics affect fertility is because they are xenoestrogens that mimic the effects of estrogen in your body For example phthalates belong to this category and they ve been linked to an increase in various diseases As noted in a study published in Healthcare Human epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between phthalates exposures and adverse reproductive outcomes in both women and men for instance Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance overweight obesity allergy and asthma How to reduce your exposure to microplastics Based on the presented evidence it s clear that minimizing your exposure to plastics will help protect your fertility There are many strategies available that will easily fit into your lifestyle Filter your tap water and avoid water bottled in plastic If you need to buy bottled water opt for glass bottles Also make sure the filter you use to purify your tap water can filter out microplastics Boil hard tap water If you have hard tap water boil it before using it for cooking or drinking as hard water traps more microplastics Research shows boiling hard tap water for five minutes removes up to 90 of the microplastics in the water Avoid plastic packaging Opt for products packaged in glass metal or paper This significantly reduces the amount of plastic that touches your food At home use wax paper parchment paper or paper bags to store

frequently When washing synthetic textiles use a microfiber filter in your washing machine to trap synthetic fibers and prevent them from entering the water system Opt for food grade cosmetics and personal care products Some cosmetics toothpaste and personal care products contain microbeads or other plastic particles Look for products free of these materials Ideally opt for all natural food grade products Pay attention to your omega 6 and omega 3 intake Studies show that omega 3 fats help boost fertility In one meta analysis that reviewed 11 studies researchers noted that omega 3 intake significantly improves women s pregnancy and fertilization rates In another example omega 3 supplementation had a beneficial effect on male fertility Supplementation with omega 3 fatty acid results in improvement of sperm concentration and total motile sperm count in infertile men with oligozoospermia For optimal results focus on increasing your omega 3 intake while reducing omega 6 fats particularly from vegetable oils As I ve noted before excessive consumption of linoleic acid a type of omega 6 polyunsaturated fat or PUFA can harm cellular health and impair energy production To improve your omega 3 to omega 6 ratio aim to keep linoleic acid intake below five grams per day and ideally below two grams Meanwhile include omega 3 rich foods like cold water fish in your diet

Regional Health RRH until she was fired in October 2021 Conrad said she was fired for reporting vaccine related adverse events to the federally run Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS Conrad sued the hospital in May 2023 under the False Claims Act a federal law that allows whistleblowers to file a lawsuit on behalf of the U S government against an entity for allegedly defrauding the government and profiting from taxpayer funds She filed an amended complaint in November 2024 False Claims Act cases are initially sealed while the government investigates the cases and determines if it will intervene In February 2024 the U S government decided not to intervene The lawsuit subsequently survived two motions by the defendants to dismiss the case The complaint alleges that RRH violated the False Claims Act because it knowingly failed to report adverse events to VAERS despite being required to do so and nevertheless submitted claims for payment for COVID 19 vaccine administration to the U S government Conrad also alleged that she saw RRH patients suffer serious adverse events following the COVID 19 vaccine and that she reported them to VAERS because she had concerns about RRH s reporting efforts U S District Judge John L Sinatra Jr of the Western District of New York ruled that Conrad had presented enough evidence to support her claims of fraud under the False Claims Act and of retaliation under both the False Claims Act and New York labor law I m very excited to move forward into discovery Conrad said after the ruling It s been a long time and I m

All institutions in the U S that administered the COVID 19 vaccines including RCC and UMMC signed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC COVID 19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement according to the complaint Under the agreement organizations that administered the shots and received compensation for doing so from the federal government were required to report moderate and severe adverse events following vaccination to VAERS The agreement stated that non compliance would violate the False Claims Act and other related federal laws The RRH COVID 19 Vaccine Clinic Playbook published May 4 2021 also states that COVID vaccine providers were required to report serious adverse events and post vaccination hospitalizations and deaths to VAERS even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event Conrad submitted these documents as part of her complaint along with several emails with supervisors and staff at RRH and UMMC chronicling her communication with her employers about adverse events and deaths she observed and efforts to report those incidents to VAERS I have now reported 2 deaths possibly related to the vaccines Nearly every day I am reporting cases to Vaers with some cases additionally being reported to Pfizer and moderna as well Conrad wrote in a March 23 2021 email In an April 15 2021 email Conrad reported even higher numbers of deaths and injuries We are at 50 cases and 4 possible deaths at UMMC reported to VAERS alone in 4 weeks she wrote It is not our job to determine any possible cause effect that ultimately is the job of the

about the vaccine and I appreciate this is frustrating for you That said we need you to follow the process in place We cannot tell you how to interpret the VAERS guidance on reporting however we do

approximately 170 reports of serious adverse events to VAERS Conrad has also alleged that the two institutions failed to report over 12 000 adverse events The complaint contains an excerpt of another communication from the hospital to Conrad calling her concerns quite almost anti vaxxy Conrad goes public with accusations In the spring and summer of 2021 Conrad took her complaints public first by contacting U S government public health agencies including the CDC and the FDA and later by retaining legal counsel from the Siri Glimstad law firm sharing her experience on The Highwire and in The New York Times and launching a crowdfunding campaign in anticipation of her firing In July 2021 Conrad contacted several key public health officials through her legal counsel including then U S Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra then CDC Director Rochelle Walensky then Interim FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock the FDA s then Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Peter Marks and Dr Tom Shimabukuro a member of the CDC COVID 19 Vaccine Task Force In a response later that month according to the complaint RRH claimed it never discouraged one of its healthcare providers from reporting any adverse events experienced by one of their patients whether related or unrelated to a COVID 19 vaccine But in September 2021 Conrad was interrogated by hospital

Conrad for the 2021 Diane C London Physician Excellence Award Finally in what the complaint alleges was an act of retaliation RRH s human resources director asked Conrad if she would leave quietly or if she needed to be escorted out of the hospital Conrad was escorted out of the hospital the same day I ultimately got audited and then was fired not as a result of the audit but as a result of just

government official to properly fulfill his her official duties Scott alleges the IRS failed to fulfill its obligation to investigate the Gates Foundation In a Dec 20 2024 motion to dismiss Scott s

FDA to change its procedures cut corners and lower agency standards to approve Pfizer s COVID 19 vaccines and authorize boosters according to a congressional report released earlier this week The approval was key to facilitating the Biden administration s rollout of the fall 2021 vaccine mandates despite safety concerns about the shots according to the report During the pandemic politics overruled science at the government institutions entrusted with protecting public health Rep Thomas Massie R Ky said in a press release announcing the report The FDA abandoned its congressional directive to protect citizens from false claims and undisclosed side effects and instead ignored its own rules to pursue a policy of promoting the vaccine while downplaying potential harms he added As a result according to the report countless Americans suffer from vaccine side effects and the FDA has lost credibility with the public Following the report s release a U S House of Representatives Judiciary Subcommittee held a hearing Wednesday Follow the Science Oversight of the Biden Covid 19 Administrative State Response during which Dr Philip Krause former deputy director of the FDA s Office of Vaccines Research and Review OVRR vaccine products provided evidence to support the report s conclusions Krause testified that both he and OVRR Director Marion Gruber were relieved of their

Commissioner Janet Woodcock Documents obtained by Children s Health Defense CHD through a Freedom of Information Act Request also showed that in early 2021 both Marks and Woodcock were aware of injuries linked to the vaccines Krause testified that the original timeline to complete the review process for Pfizer s Biologics License Application BLA for its mRNA COVID 19 product was January 2022

to do it even with their help he said Krause told the committee that on July 19 he and Gruber were taken off the review process and Marks took it over himself He added In this meeting Drs Woodcock and Marks expressed concern about the rising number of COVID cases in the US and globally largely caused by the Delta variant and stated their opinion that absent a license states cannot require mandatory vaccination and that people hesitant to get an EUA authorized vaccine would be more inclined to get immunized if the product were licensed Marks informed staff that the goal was to complete the review as rapidly as possible Krause said Pfizer s Comirnaty COVID 19 vaccine was licensed on Aug 23 2021 As predicted by Drs Woodcock and Marks vaccine mandates followed immediately afterwards and were announced the same day for DoD U S Department of Defense and for New York State Krause said He said that the speed with which the mandates were implemented following authorization suggested that the rapid review of the vaccine was motivated more by a desire to mandate vaccines than by other public health considerations Given that mandates are outside of the FDA s purview he added the fact that Marks and Woodcock cited the need for mandates as a reason to speed the review strongly implies that pressure to complete the review more rapidly than planned came from outside of the FDA he added When Krause and Gruber tried to implement a slower and more deliberative process they were demoted Prasad wrote As a result they both left the agency at the end of 2021 Prasad noted the mandates were

analysis including Nason Maani who works on inequalities and global health policy at the University of Edinburgh Scotland U K dug through funding disclosures from donors on the WHO Foundation website

anonymous donations rose over time In 2023 the foundation did not disclose the source of nearly 80 of contributions up from nearly 40 in its first two years Using a scale to judge transparency in donations developed by Open Democracy an independent international media platform the researchers gave the WHO Foundation a D grade This grade is for organizations that only name a minority of funders and not in a systematic way putting it on par with some dark money think tanks the researchers wrote The foundation s grade fell from a B in its first years of operating when it disclosed at least 85 of funders gave 100 000 or more The researchers also found large inequalities in the initiatives that donors direct their funds towards Donors preferred specific initiatives such as vaccinations or helping Ukraine But donor priorities don t always match national needs plans and priorities the researchers wrote Where disclosures were made public such as by Meta the donations suggest some strategic alignment with their own priorities rather than giving for charitable means the authors wrote For example Meta gave funding for the WHO Department of Communication and Digital Health In both

found in the analysis However she says the publicly anonymous donations are only a minor source of funding for the WHO about 1 of its budget request and she doesn t think they will impinge on the WHO s independence But she adds it is unwise to create poor optics of this kind Lisa Bero professor of medicine and public health at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus who specializes in bioethics and conflict of interest says the WHO depends on external funding because it is unable to function solely based on contributions from the member states But the donations and what they are

suggest that these policies are an essential response by claiming a 50 chance of a COVID 19 like pandemic in the next 25 years or referring to the economic costs of COVID 19 to support claims of

pandemics apart from epidemics in people s minds is a wider geographic spread across national borders Some of the worst pandemics recorded in history followed the European conquest of the Americas bringing new pathogens to an immunologically naïve population Such conditions do not exist in today s globalized world Other devastating pandemics were caused by bacteria like cholera or the plague

fundamentally reduced the threat of bacterial infections once the main driver of pandemics The last major pandemic the world faced before COVID 19 was the Spanish flu of 1918 Accordingly up until the COVID 19 pandemic pandemic preparedness almost universally referred to influenza pandemics The WHO published its first influenza pandemic plan in 1999 motivated by the first recorded human infections with avian flu H5N1 The plan was updated several times the last time in 2009 and defines several pandemic phases These constitute the only pandemic definitions the WHO has published in official guidance and remain specific to influenza The swine flu controversy When the WHO declared the H1N1 Swine flu a pandemic in 2009 despite it being no more severe than normal seasonal influenza a controversy erupted over what defines a pandemic While the WHO s pandemic plan had always focused on the spread of a novel subtype of influenza without requiring it to be extraordinarily severe a definition on the WHO s website read for six years An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza virus appears against which the human population has no immunity resulting in several simultaneous epidemics worldwide with enormous numbers of deaths and illness In response to a query by a CNN journalist questioning the need for a condition of enormous severity the definition of pandemic influenza on the WHO homepage was changed in May 2009 removing the phrase with enormous numbers of deaths and illness Instead the new definition clarified that pandemics can be either mild or severe

resolution on the evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009 2010 in the European Union The resolution urges the WHO to revise the definition of a pandemic taking into consideration not only its geographical spread but also its severity Peter Doshi pointed out in a 2009 article The elusive definition of pandemic influenza that the earlier definition on the WHO website is illustrative of a wider perception of pandemics as catastrophic in nature He points to another text on the WHO website where it was stated that even in a best case scenario of an influenza pandemic it would lead to 4 to 30 times more deaths than seasonal influenza At the same time the WHO also refers to the Asian flu of 1957 1959 and the Hong Kong flu of 1968 1970 as being pandemics although they were not extraordinarily severe Doshi further argued that we must remember the purpose of pandemic preparedness which was fundamentally predicated on the assumption that pandemic influenza requires a different policy response than does annual seasonal influenza As a result Doshi and others argued that the pandemic label must of necessity carry a notion of severity for otherwise the rationale behind the original policy of having pandemic plans distinct from ongoing public health programs would be called into question This tension of definitional appropriateness remains today On the one hand pandemics are portrayed as catastrophic events or even an existential threat On the other Swine flu is mentioned as an example of a pandemic despite causing fewer deaths than a typical influenza season Alongside Swine flu diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS 1 Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS Zika and Ebola are often used as examples to illustrate a perceived increase in pandemic risk although SARS 1 MERS and Zika each have less than 1 000 deaths recorded globally ever and Ebola is zoonotically confined to central and western regions of Africa Pandemic or PHEIC In

require effective national and global collaboration and coordination for its control This definition is more restrictive than most existing definitions of pandemics as it requires a pathogen to cause severe morbidity and mortality and to spread globally This might be widely considered to justify unusual measures of intervention However the INB discarded its pandemic definition in the latest draft of the Pandemic Agreement without replacement The INB s discarded and highly specific definition stood in contrast to the definition used by the World Bank in the establishing document of the Financial Intermediary Fund for PPPR now known as The Pandemic Fund There a pandemic is defined as An epidemic occurring worldwide or over a very wide area crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people The new draft of the Pandemic Agreement now includes the following definition of a pathogen with pandemic potential namely any pathogen that has been identified to infect a human and that is novel not yet characterized or known including a variant of a known pathogen potentially highly transmissible and or highly virulent with the potential to cause a public health emergency of international concern It does not actually have to make anyone sick Unlike the term pandemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern PHEIC is defined in

international response PHEICs are not limited to infectious disease outbreaks but can extend to health risks from chemical or nuclear contamination Member states are required to notify the WHO about events that may result in a PHEIC presumably determining extraordinary and potentially in some generally accepted context Once an alert is made an ad hoc emergency committee is convened at the WHO to

Defining pandemics as potential PHEICs harmonizes the two ongoing negotiations for the Pandemic Agreement and IHR amendments Many critics claim that the IHR amendments would give the WHO director general the power to unilaterally declare a pandemic Yet the director general already has the power to declare a PHEIC under the existing regulations although the IHR amendments may make such a declaration more consequential Currently the proposed amendments do not define pandemics While it seems logical to harmonize both policies it is important to remember that the IHR is broader in scope and not all PHEICs are pandemics The WHO director general declared six PHEICs for infectious disease outbreaks in the last ten years the latest being Mpox monkeypox in 2022 Disease burden of pandemics COVID 19 was the pandemic with the highest recorded death toll since the Spanish flu The official number of 7 million represents the equivalent of around five years of deaths from tuberculosis but occurred in a far older age group Given that the burden of tuberculosis had been stable or decreasing prior to the COVID 19 pandemic as has the burden of HIV AIDS and malaria they are now rising again these diseases are not usually referred to as pandemics However the Global Fund writes that these three diseases shouldn t be labeled as just epidemics or endemic They are pandemics that have been beaten in rich countries This is a critical point The burden of any given pathogen is not exclusively determined by its biology but by the demographic economic and institutional context in which it spreads If these long term diseases are actually the largest current pandemics then is a rushed response in 2024 the best approach to them SARS CoV 2 increased the risk of death and severe disease predominantly for people over 65 who constitute a large and growing fraction of populations in rich countries However the median age in sub Saharan Africa is 18 years and only 3 of the population is 65 or older So tuberculosis malaria and HIV AIDS affecting far younger populations in these countries are their health priorities Cholera was also regarded as a pandemic in the past when affecting

focusing on relatively low burden pandemics that affect the whole planet including wealthy populations we unavoidably shift the focus from high burden diseases afflicting low income populations This raises fairness concerns and contrasts the rhetoric on equity used in the draft Pandemic Agreement It might therefore make sense to shift focus from pandemics to health emergencies of international concern which may be geographically limited as in the case of Ebola Doing so may allow resources to be mobilized proportional to risk and need rather than investing vast amounts of money time and social capital into an obscure pandemic preparedness agenda that struggles to even define its aims Continuously conflating the concept of pandemic preparedness and PHEIC only creates confusion while

of the New Bird Flu and U S Could Vaccinate a Fifth of Americans in a Bird Flu Emergency have asked whether this is the next pandemic News reports are calling for public health agencies to prepare accordingly by ramping up interagency biosurveillance emergency response planning stockpiling personal protective equipment and of course expanding existing stocks of bird flu vaccines and developing better ones The U S government currently has three U S Food and Drug Administration FDA approved H5N1 vaccines stored in the Strategic National Stockpile The vaccines are manufactured by Sanofi GSK and CSL Seqirus According to federal officials if H5N1 were to spread widely among humans the U S government could distribute enough vaccines within four months to inoculate a fifth of the U S population Barrons reported But media reports raised concerns about how effective those vaccines developed as far back as 2007 would be and urged the development and testing of new vaccines Farrar did the same in his statement warning that vaccine development is not where we need to be Bolstering these claims a recent research report posted in an April 20 press release found that an influenza pathogen is most likely to trigger a new pandemic in the near future followed by Disease X However the findings aren t based on a study of any empirical data on actual disease Rather the study reports the results of an online survey that asked global infectious disease experts to rank the diseases on the WHO s R D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics in the order they believed the diseases could cause the next pandemic Alarms sounded as WHO Pandemic Treaty negotiation deadline looms News reports about a next pandemic come just ahead of the WHO Pandemic Agreement meetings scheduled for May Member countries will meet to vote on a new Pandemic Agreement and amendments to the International Health Regulations IHR to grant the WHO wide authority over pandemic management with an annual budget estimated at 31 1 billion The proposed treaty and the IHR would give the WHO unprecedented executive powers to declare an international health emergency at its own discretion and then organize and mandate a response that overrides any response an individual nation might want to deploy instead Many have raised concerns that the proposals compromise national sovereignty normalize dangerous

as Farrar announced last week the WHO broadened its definition of airborne pathogens The new definition is meant to eliminate confusion around how to describe the transmission of pathogens through the air that can potentially cause infection in humans to better prevent transmission according to the WHO The terms airborne transmission and aerosol transmission were often confused during the COVID 19 pandemic To rectify that misuse and confusion the consensus document sets a new standard by which any infectious disease that travels through the air regardless of the size of infectious respiratory particles is considered to be an airborne pathogen The WHO s previous stance was that only a small number of pathogens that traveled in small droplets across large distances like tuberculosis were considered airborne The new classification removes the limit on particle size or the distance a pathogen might spread Agencies have historically required high levels of proof before calling a disease airborne which calls for stringent containment measures CBC reported The new definition will make it easier to mandate containment measures for a wider range of infectious respiratory particles Earlier this month the Biden administration also published its new pandemic strategy aimed at strengthening global biosecurity before the next pandemic Cases spreading among mammals Over the past several years millions of birds have been culled to prevent the spread of bird flu as entire flocks are typically culled when cases are identified Earlier this month the Texas Department of Agriculture announced that one of Texas largest poultry farms planned to kill nearly 2 million chickens after a single bird tested positive for H5N1 Commissioner Sid Miller warned that all producers in the state must practice heightened biosecurity measures Bird flu reports are seasonal typically peaking in February The U S Department of Agriculture USDA said it expects cases to ebb and flow Over

three lab at the University of Wisconsin the hose providing safe clean air to the researchers was disconnected exposing the researchers to the modified virus Another breach occurred in 2013 when a

the top three largest investment firms in the world While Gerberding did not name the World Health Organization WHO in her article we now know that s the organization designated as the top down ruler of all things related to pandemics However some of the statements that have been made suggest that in time the WHO may also seize power over health systems more broadly The globalists next move In a Feb 18 article Dr Peter Breggin author of COVID 19 and the Global Predators We Are the Prey warned that the next move in the globalists war on humanity is to seize control over the health care systems of the entire world We have discovered the next move of the global predators already in progress in their escalating assaults against individual and political freedom The next big assault on human freedom involves a legalized takeover of national healthcare systems by the World Health Organization WHO This stealth attack with its initial plans already backed by many nations will begin full implementation in 2024 if it is not quickly recognized and fought The Chinese Communist influence over WHO has been solid for more than a decade and the party was able to install Tedros without any competition He became the first and only Director General who is not a physician and instead is a communist politician Now the Director General of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus known simply as Tedros has unveiled plans to take charge of all global health While addressing the WHO Executive Committee on January 24 2022 Director General Tedros spelled out his global health plan including his final

Tedros seeks to become super Fauci for the world and like Fauci he will do it on behalf of the global predators The rise of health fascism As explained by Breggin the global health care takeover really began with Gates Decade of Vaccines announced in 2010 at the World Economic Forum s WEF s annual meeting in Davos At that time Gates installed Fauci on his vaccine advisory board thereby guaranteeing his plans would receive support from the NIAID Breggin continues A theme for the Decade of Vaccines was Public Private Partnerships Drive Progress in Vaccine Development Delivery essentially the precursor to the Great Reset establishing a world governance of public and private health united in the spirit of fascism By 2012 Gates achieved official UN approval for his scheme establishing a broad network of global predators aimed at exploiting and dominating humanity through public health Communist China would play a prominent role through its control over the UN and WHO and through its close relationships with global predators like Bill Gates Klaus Schwab Mike Bloomberg Big Tech executives and many other billionaires and world leaders A decade and more later during COVID 19 WHO has proven its usefulness to the predators in orchestrating science medicine and public health in the suppression of human freedom and the generation of wealth and power for the globalists Under the guise of a global pandemic the WHO the WEF and all of its installed leaders in government and private business were able to roll out a plan that has been decades in the making The pandemic was a perfect cover In the name of keeping everyone safe from infection the globalists have justified unprecedented attacks on democracy civil liberties and personal freedoms including the right to choose your own medical treatment Now the WHO is gearing up to make its pandemic leadership permanent and to extend it into the health care systems of every nation The idea is the principle

March 3 the Council authorized the opening of negotiations for an international agreement An infographic sourced from the European Council s website summarizes the process The WHO s World Health Assembly has also established an intergovernmental negotiating body INB for this purpose March 1 the INB held its first meeting to draft and negotiate an international instrument on pandemic prevention preparedness and response under the authority of the WHO If this treaty goes through the WHO would have the power to for example call for mandatory vaccinations and health passports and its decision would supersede national and state laws But considering the WHO changed its definition of pandemic to a worldwide epidemic of a disease without the original specificity of severe illness that causes high morbidity just about anything could be made to fit the pandemic criterion including obesity which was designated as a disease in 2013 and occurs globally Tedros has also gone on record stating that his central priority as director general of the WHO is to push the world toward universal health coverage The world has already seen how any pandemic emergency real or concocted now or in the future could then justify WHO taking over the entirety of government operations of sovereign nations robbing all individuals of their freedoms and fully crushing the democratic republics of the

already spreading across the U S and it looks like it will play some part in any future pandemic treaty too Surgeon General demands hit list from Big Tech U S Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy also appears to be building a narrative to justify an international health authority On March 3 Murthy formally requested that all major tech platforms submit data on the scale of COVID 19 misinformation This includes social networks search engines crowdsource platforms e commerce platforms and instant messaging systems Thankfully his request is not legally enforceable As reported by The New York Times A request for information from the surgeon general s office demanded that tech platforms send data and analysis on the prevalence of COVID 19 misinformation on their sites starting with common examples of vaccine misinformation documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The notice asks the companies to submit exactly how many users saw or may have been exposed to instances of Covid 19 misinformation as well as aggregate data on demographics that may have been disproportionately exposed to or affected by the misinformation The surgeon general Dr Vivek Murthy also demanded information from the platforms about the major sources of Covid 19 misinformation including those that engaged in the sale of unproven Covid 19 products services and treatments The request for information is part of President Biden s COVID National Preparedness Plan In addition to demanding misinformation data from the tech platforms the surgeon general called on health care providers and the public to submit information about how COVID 19 misinformation has negatively influenced patients and communities As noted by Dr Meryl Nass This is truly frightening Misinformation to be controlled via tech companies is being treated as a crime though never defined Nass also highlights a new bill introduced by two Democrat senators March 2 that would give tech companies cover to censor and turn over private data to government In other words Congress may legalize censorship and criminalize First Amendment rights to freedom of speech Nass says CDC has created loads of

introduced by two Democrat senators March 2 that would give tech companies cover to censor and turn over private data to government In other words Congress may legalize censorship and criminalize First Amendment rights to freedom of speech Nass says CDC has created loads of misinformation The irony here is that the most of the CDC s answers to COVID myths are themselves misinformation For example the CDC claims it s a myth that natural immunity is better than the immunity you get from the COVID shot Yet you d be hard pressed to find scientific backing for that statement They basically just made that up It s a long standing scientific fact that natural immunity is more robust and longer lasting than vaccine induced immunity The CDC also claims it s a myth that mRNA shots are not vaccines They say mRNA injections are vaccines because they trigger an immune response What they don t admit is that they changed the definition of vaccine in the middle of the pandemic Before the pandemic a vaccine was a product that stimulates a person s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease In the latter half of 2021 as the mRNA shots were nearing distribution the CDC changed that definition to a preparation that is used to stimulate the body s immune response against diseases effectively removing the need for a vaccine to produce immunity the key thing a vaccine is supposed to do Incidentally the CDC s answer to this myth basically refutes its answer to the myth that vaccine immunity is better than natural immunity since the COVID shots don t provide immunity at all They only stimulate an immune response which by the way can be either beneficial or detrimental depending on how your immune system is stimulated The CDC also still insists that the COVID jabs cannot change or interact with your DNA in any way yet published research shows otherwise Swedish research actually shows the Pfizer shot s mRNA incorporates into human DNA in as little as six hours

left many thousands injured the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly PACE concluded that the handling of the pandemic by the WHO EU health agencies and national governments led to a waste of large sums of public money and unjustified scares and fears about the health risks faced by the European public Specifically PACE concluded there was overwhelming evidence that the seriousness of the pandemic was vastly overrated by WHO and that the drug industry had influenced the organization s decision making A joint investigation by the British Medical Journal and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism also uncovered serious conflicts of interest between the WHO which promoted the global vaccination agenda and the drug companies that created those vaccines The WHO has also been accused of massive money mismanagement spending more on travel expenses each year some 200 million in 2017 than it does on some of the biggest public health problems including AIDS tuberculosis and malaria combined By now most people also know that the WHO has been bought and paid for by Bill Gates He contributes more to the WHO s 4 84 billion biennial budget than every member state government The U S has historically been the top funder but the combined contributions from the Gates Foundation and GAVI made Gates the unofficial top sponsor of the WHO as of 2018 In the documentary TrustWHO above Lilian Franck reveals this and other clandestine influences that control the WHO to the peril of public health For example we ve seen that the WHO has strong allegiance to China and shares China s ruthless suppression of counternarratives The WHO s investigation into COVID 19 s origin was a fake from start to finish and even before the COVID pandemic the WHO had been in discussions with Facebook to ensure people can access authoritative information on vaccines and reduce the spread of inaccuracies Given the strong and ongoing evidence that WHO is heavily conflicted and controlled by

transition out of the pandemic it seems more like a plan for a never ending pandemic As reported by STAT News The report plots a course to what its authors call the next normal living with the SARS CoV 2 virus as a continuing threat that needs to be managed Doing so will require improvements on a number of fronts from better surveillance for COVID and other pathogens to keeping tabs on how taxed hospitals are and from efforts to address the air quality in buildings to continued investment in antiviral drugs and better vaccines The authors also call for offering people sick with respiratory symptoms easy access to testing and if they are positive for COVID or influenza a quick prescription for the relevant antiviral drug The report suggests the U S response to Covid 19 should transition from one directed solely at this single disease to one where prevention mitigation and treatment efforts are focused on COVID as one of a number of respiratory viruses including influenza Part of the plan is to create a new post deputy Assistant to the president for biosecurity within the National Security Council The deputy assistant for biosecurity would be responsible for monitoring addressing and coordinating responses to and communications about any biosecurity and pandemic threats Importantly this post would also be responsible for coordinating efforts to counter foreign and domestic sources of anti science misinformation on vaccines and drugs The COVID Roadmap also details strategies to improve documentation monitoring and accountability for communication goals This includes monitoring health iniquities to increase public accountability and support values that promote social well being and health equity in infectious diseases It sounds to me like a plan to promote propaganda that shames people who don t want to sacrifice their own health for the greater good It also includes the establishment of standards for streamlined clearance of health messages without political interference Will the WHO be responsible for such standards Probably The roadmap also specifies that tech platforms and legacy media are to be urged to design mechanisms to detect deflect and deny the posting of harmful and false advice that hurts public health In other words across the board censorship If the WHO is given complete authority over health censorship will be a given and

the proposals a global power grab that threatened national sovereignty health freedom personal liberties and free speech while promoting risky gain of function research and health passports Sticking points according to The Times included equitable access to vaccines and financing to set up surveillance systems Instead of considering a full set of proposals from both documents a more modest

negotiations don t appear to be in the cards Speaking to The Defender after Saturday s press conference Kruse said The mandate for providing these two legal instruments for a vote to the World Health

in February 2023 noting that references to gene therapy have been removed while language protecting human rights and dignity and affirming the non binding nature of the amendments was reinstated One bad thing remained in the IHR and that was addressing misinformation and disinformation but the IHR did not tell nations how to address it Nass said She also noted that with or without these amendments most governments are proceeding with their own plans to combat misinformation and disinformation In another Substack post Nass wrote that people are unhappy with various provisions of the document without realizing that most of the issues they dislike are in the existing IHR and have been there for many years For example Nass cited certificates of vaccination which have always been in the IHRs Changes made to this provision in the new amendments are minor compared to what was proposed and are recommendations not orders from the WHO They will not need to be digital which is a crucial point as they were going to be the gateway to digital identity digital money and massively increased surveillance They need to be signed by a doctor which was already true in many countries Nass added Questions remain about the legality of the new IHR amendments as the final version was proposed less than four months before the World Health Assembly in contravention of Article 55 Section 2 of the existing IHR Instead the final text was released on June 1 and the vote took place one hour before the end of the assembly Nass told The Defender that while some countries such as Slovakia

saying about medical freedom for over half a century Durk said in an interview with Life Extension magazine back in 1998 The price of liberty is vigilance While often attributed to Thomas Jefferson it seems this is more likely an abbreviation of a segment from a speech made by Irish orator and politician John Curran delivered in Dublin in July 1790 where he said The condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance Let me stray no further and move our attention to the issue we face today with efforts to centralize control over human health I can t say it any other way but this is stupidity If I tried to be kinder it would come out something like this it is ignorant of the available facts it is misguided simple minded or lacking in judgment But in my view the adjective stupid does the job just fine it s short and to the point However you can only come to this view when you are privy to a wider range of information the kind of information that comes from

governments politicians elected representatives remember them and citizens the people who should actually be in charge in democracies that centralized global power and control over human health and health information is the best thing to ensure our safety wellbeing going forward What did we or didn t we learn The COVID 19 pandemic brought to the forefront critical questions about global health governance You might think this last year or so has offered an opportunity to consider carefully what worked or didn t work Sadly of the big decision makers involved in the globally centralized control of the health agenda these represent precious few Most have been much more interested in learning just how malleable the public might be when exposed to conditions that keep them in an extended state of fear Or how far we go before we break or for that matter refuse to comply While all of this happens we all get surveilled within an inch of our lives so our masters already know what decisions we ll make next time around and who ll be the real troublemakers Count me in One now has to resort to academic publications to see that there is a growing body of research showing that in the face of a global crisis authoritarian approaches are rarely either the most effective or the most equitable ways of improving health outcomes worldwide So please acknowledge the disinformation implicit in the World Health Organization s WHO efforts to justify the so called Pandemic Treaty in the name of equity In the WHO s own words the treaty would usher in a new global system for pathogen access and benefits sharing i e life saving vaccines treatments and diagnostics pandemic prevention and One Health and the financial coordination needed to scale up countries capacities to prepare for and respond to pandemics I want to go on to challenge the notion that this approach is the panacea for global health challenges And I want to look a some of the evidence that shows shifting the loci

doesn t mesh with its plans and please remember we won t get there if we drop our vigilance and sit on our backsides because the globalists mean business Democratic decay and the rise of authoritarianism The COVID 19 pandemic catalyzed authoritarianism in the so called free world under the guise of public health measures Governments and even private corporations stripped millions of their liberties with lockdowns mask wearing social distancing restrictions on movement business and school closures and let s not forget mandatory or coerced vaccinations Individual liberties and the principles of democratic governance were set aside ostensibly for the public good I have recently been educated on the real meaning of public good by Jonathan Emord In Emord s words public good like public health is a fiction of collectivist origin arising from the Progressive Era here and the labor movement in England It s rot pablum an opiate for the masses disguising partisan political moves to benefit those in power So those terms I only use in derision I am now wiser as I hope you are too While these measures were often justified as necessary to control the spread of the virus they also provided a convenient pretext for governments to consolidate power and suppress dissent What made matters worse while governments told the public they were following the science retrospective analysis such as that laid out masterfully by U S journalist Sharyl Attkisson in her new book shows otherwise Or you might like to read the 113 page report just out from the U S House of Representatives Energy Commerce Committee that shows that the Biden Harris Administration wasted 1 billion of taxpayers money on their phony attack on so called misinformation Had this authoritarian approach been a winner

such as one from Oxford University that reviewed responsiveness across over 130 countries suggest that countries with strong democratic institutions and respect for human rights were better equipped to respond to the challenges of COVID 19 This is because open societies are more likely to have a free press independent scientific inquiry and transparent decision making processes all of which are essential for effective public health interventions Less autocratic approaches that called for more personal responsibility as per the Swedish model also had higher rates of compliance Ironically when one continues to hear the justification for centralization of power linked to a need for equity authoritarian crackdowns often have the most devastating consequences on the most marginalized communities Restrictions on movement and economic activity disproportionately impact those already living in poverty while the erosion of civil liberties created a climate of fear and mistrust These experiences underscore the importance of protecting human rights and democratic values even in times of crisis Repressive political regimes whatever the circumstances never had good outcomes for the majority The limitations of a top down approach The COVID 19 pandemic also exposed the limitations of a globalized approach to health governance Yet governments and politicians are busily signing on the dotted line saying they want more of it Despite the WHO s mandate to promote global health it s done very little to help Instead it s morphing increasingly into an unaccountable instrument run by unelected bureaucrats that fast tracks the global distribution of diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines while emerging as the ultimate arbiter of truthful health information in its mission to fight the quaintly named infodemic Do yourself a favor and shudder at the thought Research shows us that a globalized approach to health often fails to consider the social environmental political and economic determinants of health These factors are typically the most influential on health and vary dramatically from country to country region to region and home to home Copious evidence shows that a

Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Rethinking the International Health Regulations There is a whole battery of unproven or disproven assumptions that underpin the cousin of the Pandemic Treaty the International Health Regulations IHR which were amended earlier this year The IHR which governs international responses to public health emergencies has historically focused on the notion of containment aiming to prevent the spread of diseases across borders But this approach has never been shown to work when the transmission potential is high i e in a pandemic and it does the very thing the WHO and its supporters are claiming they want to resolve it exacerbates inequalities between countries and encourages hegemony Everyone is going to be familiar with just how much of a failure a containment centric approach was during the COVID 19 pandemic Despite efforts to restrict travel and impose quarantines the virus quickly spread across the globe highlighting the interconnectedness of our world The focus on containment often led to the stigmatization of certain countries and populations remember and were those stigmatized deserving of their treatment further undermining trust Doctors who tried to save lives were attacked and struck from their medical registers This was never about saving lives It was all about gaining power and control And that desire among the few has only strengthened since the end of the COVID 19 pandemic was declared in May 2023 What to do with what we ve learned Taking into account what we should have learned from the COVID 19 pandemic a more holistic approach to managing human health during times of significant infection pressure should in my view include at least the following 8 things Supporting individuals and communities to build physiological psychological and immunological resilience Ensuring scientific transparency in research Safeguarding the adequate supply of quality foods clean water and health products especially ones that help enhance immunological health Non interference by governments and corporations and the full protection of individual rights and liberties Eliminating government and big corporate coercion Protecting national sovereignty to allow democracy to function and facilitate the required agility and democratically supported response to local conditions Respecting accepted principles of medical ethics notably autonomy beneficence doing good maleficence first do no harm and justice including for those injured by coercive or mandatory government health policies Defend the

Health International takes a deep dive into the possible motives and consequences of the World Health Organization s plan to create an international pandemic treaty You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up You may already have heard the rumor mill working overtime on what appears to be a dastardly plan by the World Health Organization WHO to become the seat of global governance We ve endeavored in this piece to come to a view on this Does a pandemic treaty equate to global governance What is unequivocal is the intention of the WHO to kickstart a global process to draft and negotiate a convention agreement or other international instrument under the Constitution of the World Health Organization to strengthen pandemic prevention preparedness and response The WHO did this by unanimous agreement among its 194 member countries at only its second ever Special Session of the World Health Assembly since the WHO s inception in 1948 on Dec 1 2021 The reality is the precise form of the instrument that will be used is as yet undecided It may be through strengthening the existing International Health Regulations 2005 negotiating a pandemic treaty as an amendment to the WHO Constitution or more likely both Control will be delegated to these instruments in the event that the WHO declares a global pandemic As we ve seen this can be done rather easily even if there appears to be no scientific or medical justification the very situation we find ourselves in now There is broad support from powerful members of the WHO including the U S and the European Commission through president Ursula von der Leyen In fact it is the U S that will lead the negotiations in trying to build consensus on the approach All biding well for a good relationship with Biden whether or not he was the genuine choice of the U S people Flawed doctrine The difficulty for many rational and critical thinkers is that the crisis delivered to the world in the name of COVID 19 is not an adequate precedent for such actions that have the capacity to limit freedoms to an even greater extent than we ve seen during the last two years Especially when the WHO can call a pandemic more or less arbitrarily Let s dissect this manipulation by looking at just a few statements made by WHO s director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the World Health Assembly special session Tedros

thanked for detecting sequencing and reporting this variant not penalized ANH Tedros gives the impression as circulated by the mass media that South Africa and Botswana were the source of Omicron This is likely a ruse to place maximum pressure on jab resistant African nations Detailed phylogenetic analysis has revealed as published in the journal Nature that Omicron is genetically distinct from other South African variants of the shared lineage and was found by retrospective analysis elsewhere England U S in early November about three weeks before the southern African findings hit the airwaves TG Indeed Omicron demonstrates just why the world needs a new accord on pandemics ANH We argue the exact opposite that omicron has acted as a kind of natural vaccine by allowing large numbers of people to gain robust immunity quickly None other than Bill Gates the second biggest funder of the WHO said something not dissimilar Sadly the virus itself particularly the variant called omicron is a type of vaccine that is it creates both B cell and T cell immunity and it s done a better job getting out to the world population than we have with vaccines If natural immunity does better than vaccines and novel vaccines are going to be the primary intervention in responses why would any country want to prioritize pandemic responses that place novel vaccines at the pinnacle of these efforts

This field is hidden when viewing the form Source Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged Δ ANH One can ask who has created the panic and what and who have been neglected We know Tedros is referring to fear over successive waves and variants of SARS CoV 2 but imagine what might have happened had there been no molecular detection of the virus in the first place no whipping up of fear designed by behavioral scientists working with global and national PR agencies and if natural immunity had been allowed to run its course much quicker with a Great

emerging from the crisis that is of your creation because natural immunity is allowed to work because no masking social distancing or isolation let alone any of your therapeutics least of all your fast tracked vaccines have been working to stem transmission Omicron has ripped through the world doing much less harm than its predecessor variants regardless of vaccination status And in its wake left a healthy trail of natural immunity TG More than 80 of the world s vaccines have gone to G20 countries low income countries most of them in Africa have received just 0 6 of all vaccines ANH Dr Tedros blind unscientifically based desire to see most of the less developed countries that have suffered in the main very little in the way of hospitalisations and deaths from SARS CoV 2 makes no sense if the health of the people of the world were the real objective Most of the burden of disease has been in the wealthy countries where people suffer more metabolic diseases and underlying conditions that this particular virus exploits with targeted precision It seems that the puppet masters have determined that many people in the world need to be vaccinated regardless That includes the youngest and most vulnerable in all societies to those in Sub Saharan Africa who have many much greater concerns such as food security and diseases like malaria and tuberculosis And of course AIDS but more on that from us next week TG No country can vaccinate its way out of the pandemic alone ANH It s even simpler than that No country has ever vaccinated its way out of a pandemic before with or without the help of other countries TG The longer vaccine inequity persists the more opportunity this virus has to spread and evolve in ways we cannot predict nor prevent ANH There is no evidence to support this statement There is however ample evidence to support the view that the longer steps are taken to avoid populations developing natural immunity e g lockdowns social isolation social

of this year and 70 by the middle of next year ANH Pray tell us Dr Tedros the scientific basis on which you ve determined these figures Is this based on Omicron and current COVID 19 injections Surely not TG 103 countries still have not reached the 40 target and more than half of them are at risk of missing it by the end of the year mainly because they cannot access the vaccines they need and most of them in Africa ANH Most of the countries that haven t reached this target haven t had a serious problem with COVID 19 Probably more importantly no country currently has a severe COVID 19 problem courtesy of omicron and ever increasing levels of natural immunity TG Vaccines save lives but they do not fully prevent infection or transmission Until we reach high levels of vaccination in every country suppressing transmission remains essential We don t mean lockdowns which are a last resort in the most extreme circumstances We mean a tailored and comprehensive package of measures that strike a balance between protecting the rights freedoms and livelihoods of individuals while protecting the health and safety of the most vulnerable members of communities ANH Well finally there s a single point of agreement these genetic vaccines have certainly not done much to stop transmission and not at all in the case of Omicron But lockdowns were far from the last resort They were the first resort back in early 2020 A top down tailored and comprehensive package of measures seems akin to a surprise package received from a company that s got a reputation for supplying dud goods Are we to seriously believe the pandemic elite in Geneva or their minions like Trudeau Merkel Macron Biden and Morrison understand the meaning of the word balance especially when applied to inalienable human rights and freedoms Believe it or not there s more But the reality is as exemplified by the non sequiturs offered by Dr Tedros there is absolutely no basis on which to use the COVID 19 crisis to

liberties among millions and imposed authoritarian control over populations The fact that pandemic responses and restrictions have not been lifted entirely with the dominance of omicron suggests the agenda is not as proposed Could the plan for a WHO pandemic treaty fail Some who support the vision of a global pandemic treaty built into the WHO Constitution think it might fail They argue current international legal and national enforcement frameworks are inadequate and some countries who don t wish to receive vaccine donations will put their own geopolitical interests ahead of the global interest whatever that might be What if If the pandemic treaty were to come into effect in 2024 you can guarantee even higher global health surveillance using real time sequencing for both diagnostics and epidemiology This would be based on ever more portable technologies with increasingly rapid turnaround times But don t just think mRNA injections or intranasals Or gene editing technologies based on CRISPR for diagnostics Think CRISPR to enhance the immune response will likely see an entry This is a facet of transhumanism as is digital surveillance To put it in the words of Klaus Schwab founder of the World Economic Forum there will be further attempts to fuse the physical digital and biological worlds impacting all disciplines economies and industries and even challenging ideas

molecular tests rather than by cases of severe disease Case definitions for COVID 19 or any other infectious disease should reflect only cases of symptomatic disease not cases of infection By playing with the semantics and context of the word risk the WHO has managed to maintain a false illusion of the risk to health For example Tedros claimed in relation to Omicron the overall global risk is assessed as very high before it knew that its virulence and risk to health was low What can we do You could do nothing and let Klaus Schwab and Trudeau s vision become a reality for future generations Or we can oppose every part of it that works contrary to what we see as the natural essence of humanity and the natural order of nature So here s our top 5 suggestions Avoid participating in mass injection programs see separate piece on potentially undisclosed ingredients that have failed to deliver on their promises and now cause more harm than good This especially applies to the mass injection of children who are much more reliant on innate immunity that is eroded by COVID 19 injections Use your voting rights to elect representatives at local and national level that support fundamental freedoms and oppose unnecessary restriction of liberties Support the efforts of those in other countries that are opposing unnecessary restrictions on liberties such as trucker convoys

reductions in staff and the number of departments and divisions The moves come just months after the Trump administration announced it would withdraw the U S from the WHO and just a week before the

the public and policymakers Following this week s restructuring Farrar has emerged as an even more senior figure in the agency shake up and someone to watch for the future Health Policy Watch reported Before joining the WHO in 2023 Farrar was the director of the Wellcome Trust and the architect of several key COVID 19 pandemic policy directives the WHO adopted including lockdowns masking and mass vaccination Farrar also had a key role in promoting The proximal origin of SARS CoV 2 a paper published in Nature Medicine in March 2020 claiming that COVID 19 emerged from animals Proximal Origin was widely used to rebuff the lab leak theory of COVID 19 s origins and discredit its proponents as conspiracy theorists Farrar worked with the co authors of Proximal Origin and with figures like Dr Anthony Fauci to draft and publish the paper even though Farrar was ultimately not listed as a co author a possible violation of Nature s editorial policy Farrar has collaborated with Peter Daszak Ph

announced efficiency measures aimed at helping it save approximately 165 million this year To be blunt we cannot do everything Tedros said Let s be clear reducing the scale of our workforce means reducing the scale and scope of our work Tedros said adding the organization would close offices in some high income countries In 2023 the WHO approved a 20 budget increase to combat the threat of the next pandemic including a possible outbreak caused by a yet unknown Disease X But the WHO s latest restructuring includes a 21 budget cut for the 2026 2027 fiscal year to 4 2 billion According to

Secretive negotiations took place this week in Geneva Switzerland to discuss proposed amendments to the World Health Organization s WHO International Health Regulations IHR considered a binding instrument of international law Similar negotiations took place last month for drafting a new WHO pandemic treaty While the two are often conflated the proposed IHR amendments and the proposed pandemic treaty represent two separate but related sets of proposals that would fundamentally alter the WHO s ability to respond to public health emergencies throughout the world and critics warn significantly strip nations of their sovereignty According to author and researcher James Roguski these two proposals would transform the WHO from an advisory organization to a global governing body whose policies would be legally binding They also would greatly expand the scope and reach of the IHR institute a system of global health certificates and passports and allow the WHO to mandate medical examinations quarantine and treatment Roguski said the proposed documents would give the WHO power over the means of production during a declared pandemic call for the development of IHR infrastructure at points of entry such as national borders redirect billions of dollars to the Pharmaceutical Hospital Emergency Industrial Complex and remove mention of respect for dignity human rights and fundamental freedoms of people Francis Boyle J D Ph D professor of international law at the University of Illinois said the proposed documents may also contravene international law Boyle author of several international law textbooks and a bioweapons expert who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti Terrorism Act of 1989 recently spoke with The Defender about the dangers and potential

Jan 9 13 the WHO s IHR Review Committee worked to develop technical recommendations to the WHO s Director General on amendments proposed by State Parties to the IHR according to a WHO document The IHR

As previously reported by The Defender the IHR framework already allows the WHO director general to declare a public health emergency in any country without the consent of that country s government

Group on Amendments to the International Health Regulations 2005 WGIHR will be reported to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus by mid January in the leadup to the WHO s 76th World Health Assembly in late May Boyle said he questioned the legality of the above documents citing for instance the fact that the proposed WHO treaty violates the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which was ratified in 1969 and which Boyle described as the international law of treaties for every state in the world Boyle explained the difference between the latest pandemic treaty and IHR proposals The WHO treaty would set up a separate international organization whereas the proposed regulations would work within the context of the WHO we have today However he said Having read through both of them it s a distinction without a difference He explained Either one or both will set up a worldwide totalitarian medical and scientific police state under the control of Tedros and the WHO which are basically a front organization for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Tony Fauci Bill Gates Big Pharma the biowarfare industry and the Chinese Communist government that pays a good chunk of their bills Either they ll get the regulations or they ll get the treaty but both are existentially dangerous These are truly dangerous existentially dangerous and insidious documents Boyle who has written extensively on international law and argued cases on behalf of Palestine and Bosnia in the International Court of Justice told The Defender he has never read treaties and draft international organizations that are so completely totalitarian as the IHR regulations and the WHO treaty adding Either one or both will set up a totalitarian medical and scientific police state that will be beyond the control of national state and local government authorities Both the IHR regulations and the WHO treaty as far as I can tell from reading them are specifically designed to circumvent

adoption by the World Health Assembly in May of 2023 Boyle said That s where we stand right now as I see it According to the WHO the International Negotiating Body INB working on the Pandemic Treaty will present a progress report at the May meeting with a view toward presenting its final outcome to the 77th World Health Assembly in May 2024 Boyle proposed legally binding pandemic treaty violates international law Commenting on the pandemic treaty Tedros said The lessons of the pandemic must not go unlearned He described the current conceptual zero draft of the treaty as a true reflection of the aspirations for a different paradigm for strengthening pandemic prevention preparedness response and recovery Roguski in his analysis of the Pandemic Treaty warned that it will create a legally binding framework convention that would hand over enormous additional legally binding authority to the WHO The WHO s 194 member states would in other words agree to hand over their national sovereignty to the WHO This would dramatically expand the role of the WHO by including an entirely new bureaucracy the Conference of the Parties which would include not just member states but relevant stakeholders This new bureaucracy according to Roguski would be empowered to analyze social media to identify misinformation and disinformation in order to counter it with their own propaganda The WHO currently partners with numerous such organizations such as fact checking firm NewsGuard for these purposes Roguski said the pandemic treaty also would speed up the approval process for drugs and

profit from the declarations of Public Health Emergencies of International Concern pandemics and the fear mongering that naturally follows such emergency declarations Boyle warned that the treaty and proposed IHR regulations go even further The WHO which is a rotten corrupt criminal despicable organization will be able to issue orders going down the pike to your primary care physician on how you should be treated in the event they proclaim a pandemic Moreover Boyle said the pandemic treaty would be unlike many other international agreements in that it would come into immediate effect He told The Defender If you read the WHO Treaty at the very end it says quite clearly that it will come into effect immediately upon signature That violates the normal processes for ratification of treaties internationally under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and also under the United States Constitution requiring the United States Senate to give its advice and consent to the terms of the

an important issue he also thinks it is functioning as a decoy that is designed to distract people from the much larger and more immediate threat to our rights and freedoms which are the proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations The IHR Review Committee working on the proposed amendments began its work on 6 October 2022 according to a WHO document and has convened five times since then including this week s meetings in Geneva Access to the meetings was prohibited for the unvaccinated The final proposals of the IHR Review Committee and the WGIHR will be presented to Tedros in mid January and to the World Health Assembly in May According to Roguski If the proposed amendments are presented to the 76th World Health Assembly they could be adopted by a simple majority of the 194 member nations As a result Roguski said compared to the proposed pandemic treaty The amendments to the International Health Regulations are a much more immediate and direct threat to the sovereignty of every nation and the rights and freedoms of every person on earth According to Roguski The proposed amendments would seek to remove 3 very important aspects of the existing regulations including removing respect for dignity human rights and fundamental freedoms from the text of the IHR changing the IHR from non binding to legally binding and obligating nations to assist other nations Essentially the WHO s Emergency Committee would be given the power to overrule actions taken by sovereign nations Roguski said According to Boyle similarly to the pandemic treaty again Biden can instruct his representative in May assuming they adopt the regulations to sign the regulations And then the Biden administration will treat that as a binding international agreement just like they did with the 2005 regulations referring to the original IHR ratified that year He added Those the 2005 IHR were signed and the U S State Department at that time considered them to be a legally binding international executive agreement that they list in the official State Department publication Treaties in Force In other words they treat the 2005 regulations as if they were a treaty that never

the United States even if they are resisting the IHR regulations or the WHO treaty According to Roguski The proposed amendments would implement a great number of changes that everyone should absolutely disagree with These changes include dramatically expand ing the scope of the International Health Regulations from dealing with actual risks to dealing with anything that had the potential to be a risk to public health which Roguski said would open up the doors wide to massive abuse beyond anything we have seen over the past three years The proposed amendments also would shift the WHO s focus away from the health of real people to place primary preference upon the resilience of health care systems and would establish a National Competent Authority that would be given great power to implement the obligations under these regulations Roguski said If the amendments come to pass Roguski said The WHO will no longer need to consult any sovereign nation in which an event may or may not be occurring within that nation before declaring that there is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern within the borders of that nation Intermediate Public Health Alert s Public Health Emergenc ies of Regional Concern and World Alert and Response Notice s could also be declared by the WHO s director general while the WHO would be recognized as the guidance and coordinating authority during international emergencies During such real or potential emergencies the amendments would empower the WHO to mandate a variety of policies globally which would be legally binding on member nations These policies could include requiring medical examinations or proof of such exams requiring proof of vaccination refusing travel implementing quarantine and contact tracing or requiring travelers to furnish health declarations to fill out passenger locator forms and to carry digital global health certificates Competent health authorities would also be empowered to commandeer aircraft and ships while surveillance networks to quickly detect public health events within member nations would also be set up as per the proposed amendments The WHO would also be empowered to be involved in

any differing opinions under the guise of mis information or dis information Roguski said the proposals are being made despite a lack of input from the general public by unknown and unaccountable delegates using vague and undefined terminology and vague criteria by which to measure preparedness He said the proposals would trample our rights and restrict our freedoms including the right to privacy to choose or refuse treatment to express one s opinions to protect one s children to be with family and friends and to be free from discrimination including discrimination on the basis of one s vaccination status The finality of decisions made by the Emergency Committee foreseen by the amendments would be a direct attack on national sovereignty Roguski said How did we get here According to the WHO the members of the INB during a meeting in Geneva July 18 21 2022 reached a consensus agreeing that any new convention agreement or other international instrument on pandemic prevention preparedness and response would be legally binding on member states For Boyle this is the WHO s response to the enormous opposition to the COVID 19 related restrictions of the past three years He told The Defender As far as I can figure out what happened here was this As you know there has been enormous opposition here in the United States against these totalitarian edicts coming out and this was under both Trump and Biden These totalitarian edicts coming out of the federal government the White House the CDC everyone else on this pandemic and also the vaccine mandates there s enormous grassroots opposition And so as far as I can tell what happened this culminated in Trump pulling us out of the WHO which I think was a correct decision So you know I m a political independent I m just looking at this subjectively Now what happened was then when Biden came to power his top scientific advisor was Tony Fauci So Biden put us back into the WHO and then appointed Fauci as the U S representative on the Executive Committee of the WHO That s where both the IHR regulations and the WHO treaty come from to circumvent the enormous grassroots opposition to the handling of",

government with respect to the pandemic and the vaccine mandates Boyle explained what legally binding would mean in this context if either set of proposals comes to pass What will happen is the WHO will come up with an order this new organization will come up with an order that they will then send to Washington D C whereupon the Biden administration will enforce it as a binding international obligation of the United States of America under Article 6 of the United States Constitution and it will usurp the state and local health authorities who generally have constitutional authority to deal with public health under the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution The Biden administration will then argue that either the regulations or the treaty will usurp the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution and state and local health authorities governors attorney generals public health authorities will have to obey any order coming out of the WHO Referring to his remarks about the illegality of the two proposals under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties Boyle clarified that under Article 18 of the convention a treaty does not come into force when signed When the state has signed the treaty it is only obligated to act in a manner that does not defeat the object and purpose of the treaty Article 18 states A State is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of a treaty when a it has signed the treaty or has exchanged instruments constituting the treaty subject to ratification acceptance or approval until it shall have made its intention clear not to become a party to the treaty According to Boyle a state s signature does not provisionally bring the treaty into force Boyle also described the proposals as a massive power

there was legislation introduced pulling us out of the WHO We need that legislation reintroduced immediately in this new session of Congress I think the House of Representatives has to make it clear that they object that there s no way they are going to go along with any orders coming out of the WHO the World Health Assembly WHA or this new international pandemic organization and that they have the power of the purse and that they will defund anything related to the WHO However for Boyle this is not just a matter for federal lawmakers We need certainly the state governments here in the United States to take the position that they will not comply with any decisions coming out of the WHO the WHA or this new international pandemic organization adding that he recently made such recommendations to Florida Gov Ron DeSantis We need that replicated all over the United States on a state by state basis said Boyle and I think we need it right away because they re trying to rush

save this article Sign Up By Emily Kopp Jeremy Farrar chief scientific officer of the World Health Organization WHO and a central figure in efforts to suppress speculation about a possible lab origin of COVID 19 collaborated on a viral discovery project in Southeast Asia involving Peter Daszak a scientist at the center of that speculation according to grant documents A 2010 National Institutes of Health NIH grant proposal describes Farrar as the primary collaborator in Vietnam of a controversial organization that has come under scrutiny for its work on novel coronaviruses with the Wuhan Institute of Virology The organization was then called the Wildlife Trust but would soon be renamed EcoHealth Alliance At the time of the 2010 grant proposal Daszak was the president of the Wildlife Trust while Farrar helmed the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam where he had worked as a clinician since 1996 The Oxford team was slated to ship its samples to a lab at Columbia University not to Wuhan Still the apparent connection between Farrar and Daszak who faces possible debarment from U S tax dollars could present a previously unknown conflict of interest on the pandemic origins question at the highest levels of the WHO Both Daszak and EcoHealth are under debarment proceedings by the U S Department of Health and Human Services for inadequate oversight of high risk coronavirus research in Wuhan The revelation comes at a time of uncertainty about the future of the U S relationship with the WHO The Financial Times reported that the incoming Trump administration could announce a withdrawal from the organization as early as day one Farrar became the chief scientist at the WHO in May 2023 A second WHO investigation into the origins of the COVID

project was formally initiated in March 2012 Farrar s departure from the Oxford Clinical Research Unit to become the director of the Wellcome Trust was publicly announced in April 2013 While a formal

withdraw American dollars from the organization over concerns about undue Chinese sway on its statements about COVID 19 Chinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world when the virus was first discovered by Chinese authorities Trump said in May 2020 China has total control over the World Health Organization despite only paying 40 million per year compared to what the United States has been paying which is approximately 450 million a year Because they have failed to make the requested

Health Regulations could strip nations and people of their health decision making sovereignty The World Health Organization s WHO World Health Assembly WHA will convene May 21 30 in Geneva Switzerland to discuss the proposed pandemic treaty and amendments to the International Health Regulations IHR Many analysts have warned that the ratification of either or both of these instruments would diminish or completely strip away sovereignty from nation states and place public health decision making power in the hands of the WHO and its director general Details around how this might happen in the U S however are difficult to pinpoint partly because of the secrecy surrounding negotiations and partly because of the complex combination of domestic and international law that would have to come into play in order to strip U S sovereignty If these amendments and if this pandemic treaty are passed then that would basically be the end of our national sovereignty said lawyer Reggie Littlejohn co

going back to the First Hague Peace Conference of 1899 said the pandemic treaty will automatically come into effect immediately upon its signature adding that he knows of no such treaty in existence today that does this You will have a medical global police state issuing orders all the way down here in the United States Boyle said contravening state local health authorities your governor your local attorney general your local surgeon general and contravening all your democratically elected officials to accomplish this The IHR amendments will deliver the same result via different means and will give these totalitarian dictatorial powers to Dr Tedros WHO director general Boyle said Independent journalist and researcher James Roguski said one way this erosion of sovereignty will be accomplished is through the power of the purse He said I have dug up previously in the Foreign Affairs Manual of the United States that any treaty negotiations have to take into account the budgetary requirements of the agreement They re supposed to be consulting with Congress about that And so it has to be implemented into law to fund it And if you re agreeing to spend billions of dollars that s essentially taking away the right of the people to decide through Congress how money is spent That seems to be an attack on sovereignty over how you spend your money According to Littlejohn If you put these two instruments together what you end up with is the establishment of a global biomedical totalitarian surveillance state And it works in a number of ways According to the most recent draft of the IHR amendments Littlejohn said They want to strike the word non binding so that the IHR would become binding and the WHO would go from being an advisory body to a regulatory body The proposal to

to the recognition of a potential pandemic situation as opposed to an actual pandemic Littlejohn also cited provisions of the pandemic treaty page 23 article 17 allowing the WHO to tackle false misleading misinformation or disinformation in the name of strengthening pandemic or public health literacy In subsection B it says that the parties agree to conduct regular social listening and analysis to identify the prevalence and profiles of misinformation So this is surveillance and censorship that s being set up in the treaty she added Writing for The Daily Sceptic Dr David Bell a public health physician and biotech consultant and former director of global health technologies at Intellectual Ventures Global Good Fund said the two proposed WHO instruments aim to undo centuries of democratic reform that based sovereignty with individuals and by extension their state An end run around state and local control It s not clear exactly how the proposed pandemic treaty and IHR amendments will be used to supersede U S domestic law according to Boyle But he said it likely will be accomplished through a combination of several domestic laws documents legal provisions and court rulings The first of these documents is a joint resolution by both houses of Congress authorizing the U S to join the WHO Boyle said explaining that a joint resolution of Congress is just like a statute After the joint resolution was ratified President Truman signed the WHO Constitution and it was sent into the depositary Boyle said What this means according to Boyle is that the WHO Constitution is just like a treaty that has received the advice and consent of two thirds of the Senate and is the supreme law of the land under Article 6 of the U S Constitution so it didn t really matter that the Senate did not give its advice and consent by a two thirds vote Article 19 of the WHO Constitution gives the WHA the authority to adopt conventions or agreements such as the pandemic treaty by a two thirds vote Boyle said Because there isn t a quorum requirement in the WHA It could be a very small number of states that actually show up Boyle said As a result the chair of the WHA

its provision that any treaty can provisionally come into force after approval by the WHA Boyle said According to Boyle the pandemic treaty violates the WHO and U S Constitutions and also normal practice under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties an international agreement governing treaties between states which he said does not provide for treaties to provisionally come into force after they are signed or approved Littlejohn noted that not only can any treaty provisionally come into force after WHA approval but portions of treaties or agreements also can As a result in whole or in part the pandemic treaty can be applied provisionally it s possible that certain parts of the treaty might be passed this month and could be brought to force provisionally Malaysia proposed a change to Article 42 of the IHR amendments saying that recommendations have to be implemented as soon as possible Boyle said As a result If you have to implement recommendations they ve suddenly become binding That gives up sovereignty and freedoms all over the place Another document that can be used to strip the U S of its sovereignty is the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 NDAA Boyle said This law includes language to facilitate national capacity to comply with and adhere to other relevant frameworks that contribute to global health security The Biden administration can take the position that because of the NDAA of 2023 it can simply go right ahead and provisionally adhere to the terms of the pandemic treaty without the advice and consent of the Senate Boyle said The moment it gets reported out of the WHA Biden can say I m invoking the NDAA to comply with and adhere to other relevant frameworks that contribute to global health security According to Littlejohn the language stating that the U S is obligated to comply with and adhere to any relevant framework that contributes to global health security likely includes both WHO instruments They can argue that this passed through Congress we ve already agreed to adhere to and comply with Littlejohn said Boyle added the NDAA also includes the Global Pandemic Prevention and

of the states not the federal government Police powers include public health Boyle said so the Biden administration could take the position immediately upon approving the WHA treaty that we could provisionally bring that whole treaty into force and that circumvents the 10th Amendment under the aegis of the NDAA via the Constitution s Supremacy Clause Boyle cited two Supreme Court decisions U S v Belmont 1937 and U S v Pink 1942 where the Supreme Court upheld executive agreements as the constitutional equivalent of treaties when it comes to circumventing the 10th Amendment to the U S Constitution that s the danger here According to Boyle though the current IHR enacted in 2005 were only recommended the U S government and U S Department of State nevertheless took the position that this was a binding international agreement that they listed in a publication called U S Treaties in Force They re still there today Boyle said which means that even though they have not received the advice and consent of two thirds of the Senate nevertheless they were approved by the executive branch of government in accordance with the WHO Constitution which in turn had been approved by this joint resolution of Congress Boyle argued that this whole process was produced by the fact that there was a lot of domestic opposition here in the U S on a state and local basis to all the orders coming out of Washington D C including the lockdowns and the vaccine mandates As a result said Boyle seeing how much opposition there was to these totalitarian measures under the COVID pandemic they decided to do an end run around all that state and local opposition and the 10th Amendment and state and local governments by going to the WHO and turning all this into an international treaty or agreement They can then come back here and compel state and local governments and democratically elected officials to comply with that international agreement he said The bottom line is the Biden

from wireless radiation You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The International Commission on the Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields ICBE EMF called for the retraction of a new World Health Organization WHO study alleging the authors of the WHO study reached the wrong conclusion about possible health impacts of wireless radiation The ICBE EMF is a consortium of scientists doctors and related professionals who study radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation RF EMF and make recommendations for RF EMF exposure guidelines based on the best peer reviewed scientific research publications The WHO commissioned study published Dec 6 2023 in Environmental International systematically reviewed studies that looked at whether longer term exposure to RF EMF was linked with negative health impacts including migraines tinnitus and sleep disturbances In their July 15 critical appraisal of the study ICBE EMF researchers said the WHO study appears to conclude unequivocally that the best current scientific evidence suggests that current RF EMF guidelines or limits are enough to keep people safe On the contrary the ICBE EMF researchers wrote this body of evidence is not adequate to either support or refute the safety of current exposure limits The ICBE EMF researchers also called for an impartial international investigation by unconflicted experts The WHO study authors led by Martin Röösli Ph D head of the Environmental Exposure and Health Unit at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute only partially disclosed their affiliations and funding sources the ICBE EMF researchers said An earlier report not mentioned in the WHO s study showed the authors had relationships with telecommunications companies These potential conflicts of interest are of great concern the ICBE EMF researchers said Miriam Eckenfels Garcia director of Children s Health Defense s CHD Electromagnetic Radiation EMR Wireless program told The Defender she is well aware of the WHO s bias when it comes to RF EMF research Like our domestic regulatory agencies the WHO has been captured by industry Eckenfels Garcia said CHD urges people to demand that the WHO end its bias in wireless radiation research she said Eckenfels Garcia said it s critically important to consider a study s funding sources when evaluating its conclusions It is no coincidence that roughly

Review included only one study on kids teens In their critique the ICBE EMF explained that Röösli and his co authors study was part of a project WHO initially launched in 2012 to investigate research on the health effects of RF EMF exposure After temporarily abandoning the project the WHO in 2019 restarted it by commissioning 10 systematic reviews of the research on RF EMF exposure and adverse biological and health outcomes in laboratory animals cell cultures and human populations Röösli s study published Dec 6 2023 is the second of the systematic reviews the ICBE EMF said in a press release The first WHO commissioned systematic review published Aug 30 2023 looked at RF EMF s impact on pregnancy and birth outcomes Protocols for some of the other systematic reviews have also been published The ICBE EMF researchers used criteria developed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine to assess the scientific quality of the systematic review The ICBE EMF researchers concluded it was unlikely that Röösli and his co authors missed relevant studies in their review However they wrote we are concerned by the omission of both interrupted time series studies and human experimental provocation studies of RF EMF exposures The ICBE EMF researchers also said they were concerned that only one study mentioned on the WHO study s final analysis list focused on children and adolescents There are published accounts of significant burdens of illness in these age groups such as headaches attributed by study subjects to cellphone use they said This article was funded by

conflicts of interest the ICBE EMR researchers said should review the current scientific literature Those experts also need to develop improved methods of accurately measuring RF EMF exposure that could be used in large human observational studies in the general population That s the Achilles heel of the current literature the ICBE EMR researchers said They wrote We have a specific concern regarding the extrapolation of this SR s systematic review s results to the current challenges of protecting the public from the rapidly evolving RF EMF exposures now occurring in many countries such as those related to the rollout of 5G telecommunications technologies That concern is that all of the specific exposures studied in the literature reviewed by Röösli et al are not representative of the very diverse emerging RF EMF exposures now affecting human populations and the environment more generally in the real world Overcoming the lag between real world technological changes and the

COVID 19 pandemic catalyzed authoritarianism in the so called free world under the guise of public health measures Governments and even private corporations stripped millions of their liberties with lockdowns mask wearing social distancing restrictions on movement business and school closures and let s not forget mandatory or coerced vaccinations Individual liberties and the principles of democratic governance were set aside ostensibly for the public good I have recently been educated on the real meaning of public good by Jonathan Emord In Jonathan s words public good like public health is a fiction of collectivist origin arising from the Progressive Era here and the labor movement in England It s rot pablum an opiate for the masses disguising partisan political moves to benefit those in power So those terms I only use in derision I am now wiser as I hope you are too While these measures were often justified as necessary to control the spread of the virus they also provided a convenient pretext for governments to consolidate power and suppress dissent What made matters worse while governments told the public they were following the science retrospective analysis such as that laid out masterfully by U S journalist Sharyl Attkisson in her new book shows otherwise Or you might like to read the 113 page report just out from the U S House of Representatives Energy

such as one from Oxford University that reviewed responsiveness across more than 130 countries suggest that countries with strong democratic institutions and respect for human rights were better equipped to respond to the challenges of COVID 19 This is because open societies are more likely to have a free press independent scientific inquiry and transparent decision making processes all of which are essential for effective public health interventions Less autocratic approaches that called for more personal responsibility as per the Swedish model also had higher rates of compliance Ironically when one continues to hear justification for centralization of power linked to a need for equity authoritarian crackdowns often have the most devastating consequences on the most marginalized communities Restrictions on movement and economic activity disproportionately impact those already living in poverty while the erosion of civil liberties created a climate of fear and

help Instead it s morphing increasingly into an unaccountable instrument run by unelected bureaucrats that fast tracks the global distribution of diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines while emerging as the ultimate arbiter of truthful health information in its mission to fight the quaintly named infodemic Do yourself a favor and shudder at the thought Research shows us that a globalized approach to health often fails to consider the social environmental political and economic determinants of health These factors are typically the most influential on health and vary dramatically from country to country region to region and home to home Copious evidence shows that a one size fits all solution is not what is warranted should a new highly transmissible and somewhat virulent bug whether

that underpin the cousin of the Pandemic Treaty the International Health Regulations IHR which were amended earlier this year The IHR which governs international responses to public health emergencies has historically focused on the notion of containment aiming to prevent the spread of diseases across borders But this approach has never been shown to work when the transmission potential is high i e in a pandemic and it does the very thing the WHO and its supporters are claiming they want to resolve it exacerbates inequalities between countries and encourages hegemony Everyone is going to be familiar with just how much of a failure a containment centric approach was during the COVID 19 pandemic Despite efforts to restrict travel and impose quarantines the virus quickly spread across the globe highlighting the interconnectedness of our world The focus on containment often led to the stigmatization of certain countries and populations remember and were those stigmatized deserving of their treatment further undermining trust Doctors who tried to save lives were attacked and struck from their medical registers This was never about saving lives It was all about gaining power and control And that desire among the few has only strengthened since the end of the COVID 19 pandemic was declared in May 2023 What to do with what we ve learned Taking into account what we should have learned from the COVID 19 pandemic a more holistic approach to managing human health during times of significant infection pressure should in my view include at least the following eight things Supporting individuals and communities to build physiological psychological and immunological resilience Ensuring scientific transparency in research Safeguarding the adequate supply of quality foods clean water and health products especially ones that help enhance immunological health Non interference by governments and corporations and the full protection of individual rights and liberties

Justified And Worth Expanding A double blind placebo controlled trial is considered the gold standard for clinical trials because it has the best chance of determining whether an active treatment is effective So why are critics assailing HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy s call for such trials before any vaccines are approved Editor s note This article is Part 2 in a series exploring vaccine clinical trials Read Part 1 here As Edward H Kass Harvard physician and founding member and first president of the Infectious Disease Society of America stated in 1971 in an article published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases We had accepted some half truths and had stopped searching for the whole truths The principal half truths were that medical research had stamped out the great killers of the past tuberculosis diphtheria pneumonia puerperal sepsis etc and that medical research and our superior system of medical care were major factors in extending life expectancy The data on deaths from tuberculosis show that the mortality rate from this disease has been declining steadily since the middle of the 19th century and has continued to decline in almost linear fashion during the past 100 years till 1970 There were increases in rates of tuberculosis during wars and under specified adverse local conditions The poor and the crowded always came off worst of all in war and in peace but the overall decline in deaths from tuberculosis was not altered measurably by the discovery of the tuberculosis bacillus the advent of the tuberculin test the appearance of BCG vaccination the widespread use of mass screening the intensive anti tuberculosis campaigns or the discovery of streptomycin It is important that this point be understood in its completeness The point was made years ago by Wade Hampton Frost and more recently by René Dubos and has been repeatedly stressed through the years by many observers of the public health Similar trends in mortality have been reported with respect to diphtheria scarlet fever rheumatic fever pertussis measles and many others Anthony R Mawson Professor of epidemiology and biostatistics took the same line in 2018 when he stated It is well known that deaths from common infectious diseases declined dramatically before the advent of most vaccines due to improved environmental conditions even diseases for which there were no vaccines In this context we would also like to briefly refute Jess Steiner s assertion that Salk s polio vaccine made cases dropping from 58 000 1957 to 161 1961 From 1923 to 1953 long before large scale polio

with permission from the following book Vaccines Are They Really Safe and Effective Neil Z Miller On the one hand this does not invalidate the data presented in Miller s graph see above showing that Salk s polio vaccine has nothing to do with the containment of polio On the other hand it is also important to bear in mind that the standards for defining polio were changed in 1955 causing the number of polio diagnoses to drop noticeably According to scientific journalist Neil Miller The new definition of a polio epidemic required more cases to be reported Paralytic polio was redefined as well making it more difficult to confirm and tally cases Prior the patient only had to exhibit paralytic symptoms for 24 hours Laboratory confirmation and tests to determine residual prolonged paralysis wer not required The new definition required the patient to exhibit paralytic symptoms for at least 60 days and residual paralysis had to be confirmed twice during the course of the disease Also from then on cases of aseptic meningitis and coxsackie virus infections were reported as separate diseases from polio But such cases were counted as polio before In 1976 Dr Jonas Salk creator of the killed virus vaccine used in the 1950s testified that the live virus vaccine used almost exclusively in the United States from the early 1960s to 2000 was the principal if not sole cause of all reported polio cases in the U S since 1961 So what caused the polio epidemic There are many indications that not only are vaccines to blame but especially toxins such as DDT see diagram below In the Philippines only a few years before the Salk vaccine disaster in the U S the first polio epidemic in the tropics occurred spontaneously in fact with the introduction of the insecticide DDT there Around the end of World War II U S troops in the Philippines had sprayed masses of DDT daily to wipe out flies Just two years later the well known Journal of the American Medical Association reported that lameness among soldiers stationed in the Philippines could not be differentiated from polio and it had advanced to become the second most common cause of death Only combat exercises were said to

context it is being claimed also by Steier for example that the aluminum adjuvant system was already proven safe and necessary for the vaccine to work But the opposite is true Gardasil which was designed to prevent cervical cancer and genital warts in sexually active women has not been proven safe and effective in clinical trials In fact the vaccine triggered adverse event reports in 90 of the test subjects within 15 days hardly an indication of safety However the controversial aluminum containing placebo formula triggered 85 of the adverse event reports This raises reasonable concerns about accurately distinguishing vaccine induced side effects from those caused by the adjuvant Without an untreated null group genuine safety profiles remain elusive Moreover the U S Food and Drug Administration doesn t know what long term adverse effects the vaccine might produce In fact Gardasil comes along with heavy side effects ranging from reddening and swelling around the injection site

stated that it is not a classical vaccine the so called mRNA injections penetrate cells and only cause certain cells to produce antibodies are also being named as positive examples of placebo controlled studies However these studies have several fundamental shortcomings COVID 19 trials were only observer blinded meaning healthcare providers administering the vaccines knew who received the vaccine and who received placebo introducing potential biases into data collection and interpretation Additionally the blinding within these studies was lifted after approximately two months

fail to mention crucial placebo studies showing that the vaccines came off badly One of the most famous examples of this is a large scale field trial that the WHO implemented in India at the end of the 1960s on the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis In this trial a large collective was vaccinated with BCG while an equally large one remained unvaccinated The results Not only did the vaccination show no protective effect against tuberculosis but significantly more participants fell ill and died in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group Another rare example of a properly controlled trial stems from 2012 in which an influenza vaccine was compared with a true placebo in children The result was devastating Despite the authors trying to support influenza vaccination they admitted There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of confirmed seasonal influenza infection between the groups Even worse the vaccine group had higher risk of acute respiratory illness with non influenza infections Against this background the question arises why the Trump government indicated its plan to make placebo trials for every new study compulsory wouldn t apply to the flu vaccine which is updated year to year and which according to the HHS has been tried and tested for more than 80 years Flu vaccines are manufactured before the claimed viruses they are supposed to work against even exist And as if that weren t enough on close examination of the flu data upon which the warnings of the epidemic hunters from the CDC RKI or WHO are based the question crops up Are U S flu death figures more PR than science This is precisely the title of a study published in 2005 in the British Medical Journal The author Peter Doshi Ph D associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy and senior editor at The BMJ provided a resoundingly decisive answer US data on influenza deaths are a mess Doshi s main criticism is that the CDC works under the assumption that 36 000 Americans die from viral flu each year but they still owe us proof that an influenza virus really kills these people Doshi s conclusion The CDC s communication strategy is

CDC attributes to the flu Especially worth mentioning is the meta analysis of the published flu vaccine reports by Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Center The findings of these 2006 articles are sobering A major gap exists between evidence and public health policy Antibodies don t reliably predict immunity Steier also cites a placebo trial on the measles vaccine namely a study from Israel published in 1968 and with the title A Comparative Study of Four Live Measles Vaccines in Israel In this trial children in the vaccine group were divided into four subgroups each receiving one of the four different vaccines The remaining children were assigned a saline placebo And according to Steier the result was that the vaccines are safe and effective compared to placebo But how she comes to this conclusion will probably remain her secret In fact in the study we can read Febrile reactions of 37 50 C in the different treatment groups varied from 86 4 in the Enders Edmonston group to 63 1 in the Moraten group and 51 2 after placebo inoculation The incidence of fever was always in the same relative order Enders Edmonston Beckenham Schwarz Moraten Placebo The incidence of rash was greatest in the groups inoculated with Enders Edmonston and Beckenham vaccines 36 4 and 36 9 it was less in the group given Schwarz vaccine 28 4 and lowest 20 2 in those given Moraten vaccine In the placebo group rash was recorded in 11 9 of the children The 4 vaccines can be listed as follows in decreasing order of the fever 37 50 C induced Enders Edmonston 86 4 Beckenham 78 6 Schwarz 66 7 and Moraten 63 1 The same decreasing trend was seen when pyrexias of 38 30C and 40 C were considered It should be noted however that such temperatures were also recorded in the placebo group though to a lesser extent The only possibility that could have led Steier to conclude that the measles vaccine is safe and effective compared to placebo is that she refers to seroconversion This is the phase of a vaccination or infection in which specific antibodies against antigens of a foreign body claimed virus for example are detectable in the blood serum for the first time A high seroconversion is believed to be a

after Beckenham vaccine 97 1 after Schwarz vaccine and 100 after Enders Edmonston and Moraten vaccines In each of the cases of seroconversion a 4 fold or greater rise in antibody titre was observed In addition 3 of the 37 children given placebo reacted with high seroconversion titres Since clinical measles was not observed in these cases and since measles was not prevalent at the time one possible explanation is that these children were inoculated by mistake with vaccine and misrecorded But another explanation for the observation that 3 of the 37 children given placebo reacted with high seroconversion titres would be that so called surrogate markers such as antibody tests are not reliable and react to all kinds of things In fact the magazine Impf report found that even the federal authorities have been unable to provide evidence that there is a health benefit for people who have a high antibody titer And even various orthodox sources confirm that the amount of so called antibodies in the blood does not reliably predict a person s immunity The unbeatable proof that there is no proof that the measles vaccine was useful meanwhile is also evident from the historical data

formation is a measure of immunity was fully demonstrated in a Report issued by the Medical Research Council in May 1950 entitled A Study of Diphtheria in Two Areas of Great Britain In this report by nine doctors Percival Hartley W J Tulloeb M Anderson W A Davidson J Grant W M Jamieson C Kenbarrer R Morton and G H Robertson it was stated that the occurrence of diphtheria in the inoculated led to the investigation into the immunity state and the behaviour of the immunity mechanism The evidence is overwhelming that such surrogate markers do not necessarily translate into meaningful health benefits In the BionTech Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine trial symptomatic cases without positive PCR tests suspected COVID 19 cases were excluded significantly distorting efficacy results Inclusion of these cases could have eliminated observed effectiveness differences between vaccine and placebo groups At this point it should also be emphasized that though the whole world relied on RT PCR to diagnose SARS CoV 2 infection the science is clear These tests are not fit for purpose In fact COVID 19 PCR Tests can be labeled as scientifically meaningless in the context of detecting viruses and viral infections Even Dr Anthony Fauci conceded to MSNBC in late December 2021 PCR doesn t measure replication competent virus The only way you can tell if it s transmissible is if you can show that there really is life replication virus in you and the tests PCR and antigen tests don t measure that As far as the measles vaccine is concerned there is another question that arises Why was it not tested against placebo when it was introduced In other words Why were several measles vaccines only tested against a placebo in Israel in 1968 and not as early as 1960 when John Enders meant to have tested the world s first measles vaccine for its usefulness in his paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine That is to say the ethical argument does not apply here either as it states that if an effective treatment already exists it is unethical to give participants a placebo because they are being deprived of an effective treatment But if Enders did not test his measles injection againsta

absurdity It reads If we re testing a new measles vaccine giving half the children a saline placebo would leave them vulnerable to a potentially deadly disease when a proven vaccine already exists Instead researchers compare the new vaccine to the current standard to prove it s at least as safe and effective By the way it is also important to bear in mind that a proper placebo control scientifically speaking should differ from the vaccine in only one factor the hypothesized active component Using saline solution alone does not fulfill this requirement as it differs from the vaccine in several variables not only in the so called viral component but also in chemical composition biological impact and pharmacological activity Therefore saline is not a 100 valid negative control if the goal is to isolate the effect of the viral component specifically A better approach would be to use a placebo that matches all components of the vaccine formulation except the so called independent variable the viral element thereby fulfilling the definition of a scientific negative control Furthermore an additional untreated null group is essential to assess placebo effects and the natural course of illness without intervention A true placebo control should match all vaccine components except the intended active viral component An additional critical element typically missing from vaccine trials is the inclusion of a null group a cohort receiving no intervention whatsoever This group is essential to accurately assess the natural progression of illnesses and fully account for placebo effects Without a genuine untreated control group interpreting safety and efficacy data remains inherently problematic Lastly rigorous scientific evaluation demands we consider both relative and absolute risk reductions Currently vaccine trials frequently emphasize relative risk reductions misleadingly exaggerating vaccine effectiveness especially when the actual number of cases is small Providing absolute risk figures alongside relative risks would greatly enhance transparency and practical relevance Kennedy s demand for placebo controlled studies represents a valuable step toward more rigorous scientific scrutiny of vaccines And he cannot be given enough credit for having the courage to initiate such a measure in an environment dominated by Big Pharma for many many decades and with mainstream media that often enough come across as the mouthpiece of Big Pharma As the New York Times journalist Natalie Angier put it in 1991 We science journalists perhaps more than

Trials Is Justified And Worth Expanding A double blind placebo controlled trial is considered the gold standard for clinical trials because it has the best chance of determining whether an active treatment is effective So why are critics assailing HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy s call for such trials before any vaccines are approved You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Editor s note This article is Part 1 in a series exploring vaccine clinical trials Read Part 2 here U S Secretary of Health and Human Services HHS Robert F Kennedy Jr recently made headlines by calling for future vaccine studies to employ placebo controlled trials All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo controlled trials prior to licensure a radical departure from past practices an HHS spokesperson told The Washington Post Many hailed the proposal as a courageous move toward transparency and rigorous scientific standards Indeed a double blind placebo controlled trial is considered the gold standard for clinical trials because it has the best chance of determining whether an active treatment is effective What is a placebo controlled trial In a placebo controlled trial there are two or more groups One group gets the active treatment vaccine for example the other gets the placebo an inactive substance that looks and tastes like the drug being tested but has no effect on the disease the new drug is intended to treat Double blinded means that neither the researchers nor the research participants know who is getting active medication and who is getting a placebo Ideally this blinding principle also extends to other parties including researchers technicians data analysts and evaluators Effective blinding experimentally isolates the physiological effects of treatments from various psychological sources of bias In this context Kennedy s spokesperson Andrew Nixon told Forbes Except for the COVID vaccine none of the vaccines on the CDC s childhood recommended schedule were tested against an inert placebo meaning we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products Why wouldn t everyone support Kennedy s plan for placebo controlled trials Because the vaccine debate is one of the media s hottest topics It is argued for example that there have indeed been placebo studies and that these have shown that the vaccines were superior to the placebos Public health scientist Dr Jess Steier recently cited Dr Jonas Salk s polio vaccine trial as an example In Salk s study 623 972 children received vaccine or saline placebo and an additional 1 million plus children served as observed controls Steiner wrote Results Salk s polio vaccine was 80 90 effective against paralytic polio no unexpected side effects Impact Cases dropped from 58 000 1957 to 161

inspection these statements are unsubstantiated Jonas Salk on the Time cover from March 29 1954 Before we start picking apart Steier s claims we should credit her for citing a few placebo vaccine studies Believe it or not this is anything but self evident For example on May 1 NPR quoted Dr Jesse Goodman a former U S Food and Drug Administration FDA vaccine regulator now at Georgetown University who claimed The blanket statement that none of the routine vaccines were ever tested against a placebo is incorrect Placebo trials have been done However NPR mentions only one such study That includes the original COVID vaccines which were evaluated in large well designed placebo controlled trials Even though the subhead reads Placebo controlled vaccine trials have been common not a single other placebo vaccination study is mentioned in the NPR article Goodman can then also claim that the COVID vaccine trials have clearly shown that these injections are safe and effective an assertion that has no factual basis as we will show later What about Salk s polio vaccine trial It should be noted that early electron microscopy studies such as the 1949 work by Rhian Lensen and Williams found that so called viral particles claimed to be from poliomyelitic tissue were indistinguishable from those in healthy controls casting doubt on the specificity of the virus identification itself The researchers concluded that there was no definitive proof that a poliovirus had ever been visualized or isolated by the standards of electron microscopy Similarly Joseph L Melnick wrote in 1951 that despite numerous attempts there was still no clear evidence the poliovirus had ever been obtained in purified form or seen directly under the electron microscope when proper controls were used These early insights suggest that even foundational assumptions about the polio virus itself and thereby the rationale for the vaccine deserve renewed scientific scrutiny Even if we assume that the calculated relative risk reduction of approximately 72 for paralytic polio is correct the absolute risk reduction was modest at 0 041 meaning 2 439 vaccinations were required to prevent a single case of paralytic polio Furthermore there has been a lack of complete randomization and blinding in observational and null groups and potential biases and statistical manipulations due to health

the data was wrong not that the average person on the street knows that but such was the aura of the man at the time the magnificence of the project the years of research and the vast amount of money poured into the vaccine and so great was the need for it to succeed that cognitive dissonance and the fallacy of authority got in the way and the mistake in the data was ignored Salk s polio trial classic example of data being both wrong and ignored The Butlers state that the Salk polio trial data are a classic example of data being wrong and ignored at the same time Dr Paul Meier sat in on the meeting where Jonas Salk explained the safety testing procedures for the early Salk polio vaccine As Meier looked at the data he realized the data didn t say what Salk said it said so he wrote an analysis showing the flaws the Butlers wrote We also have to consider that only a statistical expert could evaluate the results of the Francis report Thomas Francis Jr was the author of the 1954 study not Jonas Salk because Francis was appointed as the independent lead evaluator of the clinical trial not as the developer of the vaccine In other words to avoid conflicts of interest Salk did not himself evaluate the huge clinical trial The tests whose results were presented at a meeting of 500 doctors and scientists in Ann Arbor Michigan were conducted in 44 states and involved nearly 2 million children As statisticians of the calibre of Bradford Hill and the late Major Greenwood have pointed out there are many sources of fallacy to be avoided when making comparisons between inoculated and uninoculated groups of people wrote M Beddow Bayly in 1956 in his article The Story of the Salk Anti Poliomyelitis Vaccine Only a close study of all the relevant factors would enable

Medical Journal on April 30 1955 called attention to this doubtful procedure stigmatizing it as open to criticism The BMJ wrote It may not be a fair assumption for instance that the experience of second grade children would be the average of that for the first and third grades in the absence of vaccination A more serious bias lies in the selection of children in the second grade whose parents agreed to have them vaccinated According to Bayly It is recognised among statisticians engaged in similar assessments that the social position and the care lavished upon the children in families of volunteers for inoculation are likely to be superior to that of the controls generally and that this would affect the validity of conclusions Poliomyelitis is not beaten Bayly suggested another source of error not mentioned in the Francis report but recorded in a New York Times page 1 piece from April 13 1955 The article states that it require s two inoculations spaced two to four weeks apart with a third booster shot seven months later to receive 100 percent protection from paralysis as Salk is being quoted According to Bayly This means that a child developing poliomyelitis after the first inoculation and before the second would automatically be placed in the uninoculated class If this is true it is obvious that any conclusions drawn from his figures would be invalidated Bayly also mentions a comment by Dr Anthony M M Payne of the World Health Organization which Bayly said was certainly justified and salutary On April 14 1955 Payne told the Manchester Guardian Poliomyelitis is not beaten We do not know how long the vaccine s effect lasts we do not know if it will work in infants we do not know if it will be effective under other conditions than those in which it was used we do not know how best to use it We do know that there are many intricate problems in the manufacture of this vaccine Indeed only 13 days after the polio vaccine had been acclaimed by the whole of the

vaccinated children had climbed to nearly 200 On May 6 1955 the News Chronicle quoted the U S government s highest authority on viruses Carl Eklund who said that in the U S only vaccinated children had been afflicted by polio And only in areas where no polio cases had been reported during the first three quarters of a year In nine of 10 cases the paralysis appeared in the injected arm This triggered panic in the White House On May 8 the American government completely halted production of the vaccine A short time later another 2 000 polio cases were reported in Boston where thousands had been vaccinated In inoculated New York the number of cases doubled In Rhode Island and Wisconsin they jumped by 500 The lameness appeared in the inoculated arm in many children Statistics show no reason to celebrate Salk s vaccine Apart from that an objective look at statistics would have shown that there was no reason to celebrate Salk s vaccine as the great conqueror of an alleged polio virus According to international mortality statistics from 1923 to 1953 before the Salk killed virus vaccine was introduced the polio death rate in the United States and England had already declined on its own by 47 percent and 55 percent respectively wrote scientific journalist Neil Miller see diagram below From 1923 to 1953 long before large scale polio vaccinations began to be carried out in the mid 1950s mortalities attributed to polio had already decreased substantially In the USA by 47 percent in Great Britain by 55 percent in other European countries the statistics are comparable This

Given the increasing number of studies and reports on the rising death toll that may be causally linked to COVID 19 vaccines it s reasonable to ask Why has there still been no concrete attempt to

save this article Sign Up By Bert Olivier I have previously wondered whether the recent and continuing revelations about the COVID 19 injections death toll would bring any justice Given the rapidly increasing number of studies and reports concerning the rising death toll that may arguably be causally linked to the so called COVID 19 vaccines one can therefore quite reasonably ask Why has there still been no concrete attempt to prosecute the pharmaceutical companies and individuals who were directly involved with the manufacture and promotion of these potentially and in millions of cases actually lethal shots In light of these studies it is hardly surprising that many people are raising critical questions about the perceptible consequences of the jabs Just today I read an article titled Government Admits it Knew Covid Vax Shots were Fraud President Trump Pull Them Off the Market Karen Kingston Greg Hunter who interviewed Kingston writes Karen Kingston is a biotech analyst and former Pfizer employee who is back with some grotesque news about what the US government knew about the CV19 bioweapon vax They knew it was not safe at all and the FDA U S Food and Drug Administration also knew Pfizer committed fraud to get the CV19 injections approved Kingston says This is the government s words exactly The FDA was aware of the protocol violations So the FDA was aware of the fraud that was reported before it granted emergency use authorization EUA for its vaccine They were aware of the fraud The cat is out of the bag as far as the U S government s tacit unacknowledged awareness of the dangers attached to the COVID 19 vaccines is concerned In light of the confirmation of these dangers in numerous studies in retrospect the reports of mortality rates and other indications of injury would appear to provide further confirmation all that should be needed to prosecute those responsible such as Bill Gates on whom I have written here before Dr Joseph Sansone reports as follows

reads In Japan a 26 year old healthcare worker reportedly died of a brain hemorrhage 4 days after receiving a single dose of the mRNA vaccine early in the vaccination campaign This case was potentially linked to vaccine induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia Despite this the vaccination program continued becoming nearly mandatory The publication of an article on the adverse effects of COVID 19 vaccines in the Virology Journal marked a turning point halting further vaccinations worldwide after June 2022 This is because for the first time in the peer reviewed article the cause of the immunodeficiency was clearly presented a request was made to discontinue the booster mRNA vaccination and the information was spread worldwide through social networking sites and other means Although a new type of mRNA vaccine was approved afterward Japan remains the only country actively vaccinating its population This claim is questionable in my view B O Despite the declining number of vaccinators the routine administration of the eighth coronavirus vaccine dose for older adults began in October 2024 It beggars the imagination that in a country where the population seems to have been wide awake regarding the dangers of these jabs the authorities have forged ahead with their vaccination program regardless In this video for example we are informed that Japanese scientists have

numbers said to run into millions of people dying after receiving the COVID 19 vaccination It is puzzling that a country where such a consequential step can be taken can at the same time as stated in the Springer study referenced earlier continue unabated with its mRNA vaccination program despite the most senior oncologist in the country referring to the mRNA vaccinations as evil practices In 2024 already Japanese research connected no fewer than 201 diseases with the COVID 19 injections Add to this that the Pfizer mRNA vaccine has no fewer than 1 291 adverse side effects which Pfizer was forced to publish in 2022 as clinical data and already it would appear that one can start heading to court As may be seen from the examples listed above once one starts looking for studies pertaining to emerging evidence about the consequences of the COVID 19 shots on the part of recipients one s research uncovers numerous relevant instances such as this recent one on cancer causing DNA fragments in mRNA vaccines A major investigation by a group of renowned German researchers has confirmed that Pfizer s Covid mRNA vaccines are laced with dangerous levels of DNA contaminants While the presence of DNA contamination in Covid injections is not a new discovery this latest study uses advanced techniques for more reliable quantification making it the most significant investigation to date As Slay

people The other video discussion between Dr Peter McCullough and Dr Drew Pinsky focuses on a specific study concerning such evidence of turbo cancer manifesting itself among those who have been vaccinated The discussion is summarized as follows below the video In a medical paper coauthored by Dr Peter McCullough researchers reported evidence of turbo cancer an aggressive infiltrating metastatic and ultimately lethal basaloid type of carcinoma appearing soon after mRNA vaccination for COVID 19 The world renowned heart health expert says the mRNA shots should be off the market completely We have a lot of information suggesting these are no good for the heart Dr McCullough told Real America s Voice Now we have data of the heart change in almost everybody who took the shot at least for six months or longer Dr Peter McCullough is an internist cardiologist epidemiologist and the Chief Scientific Officer of The Wellness Company As an expert on cardiovascular medicine with over 30 years of experience Dr McCullough has spoken widely about the heart related risks that he believes could be attributed to mRNA technology One could go on and list many more such reports on studies but I think my point has been made and therefore I shall list only one more by Rhoda Wilson of that intrepid investigative British newspaper The Exposé where she writes Multiple doctors and scientists including Dr David Rasnick Dr Ryan Cole Dr Roger Hodkinson and Scientist Kevin McKernan say that covid injections cause turbo cancers due to immune system suppression The injections contain DNA plasmids with the SV40 promoter sequence which has been associated with oncogenesis and can bind with P53 the guardian of the genome Doctors and experts report a significant increase in aggressive cancers often in younger people with rapid growth to Stage 3 or Stage 4 and link this phenomenon to the covid injections degradation of the immune system Multiple case reports and studies suggest a

responsible for the deaths resulting from the clot shot been initiated I should add yet but given the inexplicable inaction regarding this elephant in the room one is tempted to speculate that some organisation s lurking in the shadows may have a hold over those who are in positions where they can proceed with prosecutions Call it a conspiracy theory if you like but what else could be the explanation To be sure there have been official inquiries such as the one referred to in this report but nothing has been forthcoming which is indicative of suppression of potentially damning information Interestingly when confronted with this silence a people s vaccine inquiry was launched On the first day of the long awaited Module 4 of the UK Covid Inquiry it became clear that the Inquiry was going to do everything it could to bury evidence that does not suit the narrative of vaccines are safe and effective and continue to gaslight the many who have been vaccine injured In response a group of experts held a press conference to set the record straight In their press conference the group called The People s Vaccine Inquiry lays bare the theatre that is known as the UK

COVID 19 vaccines being administered is concerned I have a strong feeling that unless large numbers of citizens start coming forward and insisting on justice being done in light of the burgeoning numbers of studies and reports demonstrating beyond any reasonable doubt that the very composition of these so called vaccines testify to them as dangerous this whole lamentable episode will just be swept under the carpet The obvious person to take the requisite action is Robert F Kennedy Jr of course in his capacity as the U S secretary of HHS Perhaps he will still do so pending the accumulating

nature and is slowly dying of the same diseases of a sedentary lifestyle the obesity that ll eventually kill most of us Animal welfare was the canary in the coal mine When Harris was in his 40s he became increasingly aware of the pitfalls of the industrialized model of farming Animal welfare was the canary in the coal mine he tells Rogan He previously believed that good animal welfare included keeping the animal well fed and watered in a comfortable temperature range and not intentionally inflicting pain and suffering It s the definition of animal welfare that many still use today Harris realized however that true animal welfare involves giving the animal an environment where it can express instinctive behavior He says Chickens are meant to scratch and peck Hogs are meant to root and wallow Cows are meant to graze But in the CAFO confined model those instinctive behaviors are not an option for them He changed his cattle operations after this realization He also quit feeding the cattle chicken litter which is chicken feces a widely used cheap protein source in feedlots Most of my transition from what I did 25 years ago to what I do today involved just giving up products and techniques Harris says adding that it s the misapplication of technology that makes agriculture so destructive today Reductive science technology does not lend itself to living systems In terms of the land agriculture is misusing cultivation chemical fertilizers and chemical pesticides which leads to unintended and unseen changes When chemical fertilizers are applied they lead to noticeable changes in growth but what you don t see Harris explains is that fertilizer oxidized the carbon the organic matter in the ground It killed the microbes in the soil It had other negative chemical impacts but you couldn t see them When chemical fertilizers were first widely used their long term destruction to the environment was largely unknown It s only recently that the importance of soil biology is

implants These technologies result in horrible unintended consequences that adversely affect our land water climate and livestock Harris wrote on his blog Further they ve allowed agriculture to become scalable to the point that a limited number of multinational corporations control most of the food supply A centralized food system benefits no one but those who control it and puts consumers at risk Harris explained The centralization of food production impoverishes our rural communities as it creates an oligopoly This centralization of food production is also bad for consumers This system lacks resilience When mega production facilities that are focused on efficiency break down consumers access to food can become limited which causes panic This state of panic allows multinational companies to increase their profits exponentially When the driving goal of our food production system is efficiency as opposed to resiliency consumers suffer Meanwhile Harris says the way food and fiber are industrially produced causes farming to be wastefully abundant and seemingly cheap Rogan asks Harris if there s a way to produce the massive amounts of corn soy and cotton currently produced regeneratively Harris responds I think it s the wrong question it s a matter of living off of what we can produce How many T shirts from cotton do you have to have Embracing regenerative farming for health Harris farming methods now represent the opposite of the industrialized approach demonstrating how you can convert conventionally farmed land into a healthy thriving farm based on regenerative methods At White Oak Pastures they ve De commoditized Instead of relying on commodities they produce five types of pastured red meats five types of pastured poultry pastured eggs and organic vegetables De industrialized Instead of operating as a monoculture that grows one destructive crop like GE soy they ve created a living ecosystem that includes 10 species of humanely treated animals

is done regeneratively it will help to restore the land and even improve the damage done by industrial methods And animals are an integral and necessary part of the restorative process We are

emitting 3 5 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent In fact Impossible Foods maker of fake meat plant based burgers claimed they have a better carbon footprint than live animal farms and hired Quantis a group of scientists and strategists to prove their point According to the executive summary their product reduced environmental impact between 87 and 96 in the categories studied including land occupation and water consumption This however compares fake meat to meat from concentrated animal feeding operations CAFOs which are notoriously destructive to the environment and nothing like Harris

addition to a focus on animal welfare Harris regenerative farming methods go beyond sustainable farming to land regeneration We believe farming must not only be sustainable it has to be regenerative to rebuild our soil White Oak Pastures website reads At White Oak Pastures Holistic planned grazing methods naturally sequester carbon control erosion and increase organic matter in soil A life cycle assessment found that their farm is storing more carbon in the soil than their grass fed cows emit during their lifetime Former commodity cropland is acquired and regenerated into perennial pasture every year They ve partnered with a nearby 2 400 acre solar farm to provide planned livestock grazing and regenerative land management Where to find grass fed foods The majority of meat products sold in the U S come from CAFOs not grass fed farms To protect the environment and your health as well as support animal welfare seek out foods from small farmers using regenerative agriculture practices One useful option is to look for the American Grassfed Association logo on meat and dairy which ensures the animals were born and raised on American family farms fed only grass and forage from weaning until harvest and raised on pasture without confinement to feedlots You can also get to know a local farmer using regenerative methods near you Regenerative International incorporated in 2014 built a

Project brought together people living with wireless radiation sickness leading wireless radiation experts safe technology advocates and medical professionals to choose a single unifying non

universally acceptable name Electromagnetic Radiation Syndrome or EMR Syndrome according to a press release issued by the OneName Project EMR Syndrome is a new unifying name for a 21st century health crisis the press release said Millions of people experience physical symptoms including headaches insomnia heart palpitations and more when exposed to electromagnetic radiation EMR according to the press release But until now it s been difficult for these individuals to advocate for themselves and educate others because there s been no single easily understandable term for the condition Instead there were multiple names including electromagnetic sensitivity electrohypersensitivity microwave syndrome Havana syndrome and others Some of these names stigmatized the people by labeling them as sensitive instead of placing the blame on the radiation that was causing their illness Other names confused the public such as microwave and Havana syndrome because they sounded like references to microwave ovens and the capital of Cuba rather than wireless radiation from cellphones Wi Fi routers and smart devices That s why the OneName Project was created Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us The project brought together people living with EMR related disabilities leading wireless radiation experts safe technology advocates and medical professionals to choose one term a simple non stigmatizing term to label illness from exposure to wireless radiation and electromagnetic fields This decision was the result of a truly collaborative process said organizing committee member Kent Chamberlin Ph D We ve not only created a unified identity for this condition but also a renewed sense of hope for those living with it Chamberlin is past chair and professor emeritus of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of New Hampshire He served on the New Hampshire Commission to Study The Environmental and Health Effects of Evolving 5G Technology a team of independent experts convened by the state to answer questions about the impacts and safety of cell towers and wireless radiation He is now president of the Environmental Health Trust EHT People who

Organizing committee member Ruth F Moss who directs SafeTech Westchester in New York and has EMR Syndrome said her first question after being diagnosed with EMR related illness in 2015 was What do you call this Over several months I got five different answers Moss said She had worked for years in marketing so she knew that having five different terms for EMR related illness was a problem in building public awareness I assumed someone in the movement must be trying to coalesce the names she recalled But over the next year she realized that wasn t the case She also realized there weren t just five names for EMR related illness but 10 names 15 names It was clear that she and others with EMR related illness needed one term as they advocated for themselves and safe technology rather than diluting their efforts with multiple terms No one is going to remember a health condition if it s called 10 different things People need one name that they can recognize and remember Moss said It s the way our brains work Project was thorough independent and not swayed by bias It was a daunting task to decide on one name for electrosensitivity members of the project s organizing committee said We took many months thinking through the best way to do this said Andrew Molnar who helped lead the organizing committee Molnar directs Ithacans for Responsible Technology and has EMR Syndrome Moss agreed No decision was made swiftly she said Team members were willing to talk everything through to its fairest conclusion Chamberlin said it was important to the committee members that the process of selecting a name was thorough independent and not swayed by bias The organizing committee developed a series of steps they committed to follow using a transparent process he said beginning with an online public forum that ran for four months The forum elicited input from people who have EMR Syndrome safe tech advocates and the general public about what criteria were important to them in selecting a new name It also collected ideas for the new name Initially the organizing committee members thought that consensus on a new name might emerge from the public forum But although the criteria for a new name became clear no one term rose to the surface as everyone s first choice As time went on Molnar said we realized we needed to pull", "chunk_id":

of experts to look at the data So the organizing committee convened a decision making committee of 11 international medical professionals research scientists and leading advocates for those with EMR Syndrome who had name recognition in the EMR and safe technology field Their participation boosted the credibility of OneName Project s process Chamberlin said The organizing committee handed over the public comments to the decision making committee members along with a list of suggested criteria derived from the comments The two most important criteria for the new name were that it would be easily understandable by the public and wouldn t stigmatize or blame those with the condition The decision making committee s job was to select a name based on their analysis and discussion of the data The handover posed a challenge for some members of the organizing committee We knew a name could be chosen that we didn t like Moss said but this was bigger than personal preferences The decision making committee met twice in September 2024 Molnar moderated their discussions They decided on EMR Syndrome because it achieved the delicate balance between what was medically and scientifically credible and what the public said they wanted in a new name This balance was paramount to the process said organizing committee member Pam Wallace who directs SafeTech Forward in Michigan and has EMR Syndrome It s the reason we had professionals from the medical scientific legal and educational communities on the Decision Making Committee Dr Sharon Goldberg an integrative and functional medicine doctor with experience treating patients with EMR Syndrome was on the decision making committee She shared reasons why the committee chose EMR Syndrome The previous names like electrohypersensitivity were a problem when the person went to the doctor she said Such terms labeled the person as too sensitive That needed to change EMR Syndrome s etiology is clear It focuses on EMR as the cause of the person s symptoms without stigmatizing the person reporting the symptoms Goldberg said Also people are used to hearing the word syndrome to describe medical conditions Sometimes the pharmaceutical industry

committees acknowledged that public acceptance of the new name may take time and that some countries may prefer to stick with an old name For instance the U K has used electrohypersensitivity for a long time said organizing committee member Nicholas Martin chairs a U K organization focused on EMR disability Molnar agreed There are a number of medical systems especially in Europe where electrohypersensitivity is the technical term that might still choose to keep that as their technical term and that s fine It s common for a condition to have both a technical term and a vernacular term For example conjunctivitis is the technical scientific term for pink eye Molnar said The U S Access Board uses the term electromagnetic sensitivity for EMR related disability Molnar said Though it would be ideal we may not ultimately convince every single scientific or governmental entity to change its official name That s not what we re trying to do here We re trying to get one name for the public that really helps focus our efforts and starts getting the public to rally around us Are FCC wireless radiation limits good enough The new name comes at a time of growing doubt that the Federal Communications Commission s FCC exposure limits for wireless radiation adequately protect people s health The limits haven t been updated since 1996 In 2021 Children s Health Defense EHT and other groups won a lawsuit challenging the FCC s exposure limits The groups filed 11 000 pages of evidence of harm from 5G and wireless technology which they alleged the FCC ignored when it decided to keep its 1996 guidelines The pages included evidence of widespread sickness due to wireless radiation exposure The FCC has yet to comply with a court ordered mandate to explain how the agency determined that its current guidelines adequately protect humans and the environment against the harmful effects of exposure to wireless radiation Meanwhile scientists and safe tech advocates say there are

admitted for a COVID 19 infection Grace s sister and expert witnesses testified that doctors violated the standard of care and principles of informed consent Grace s family sued Ascension St Elizabeth Hospital in April 2023 and filed an amended complaint in July 2023 alleging the hospital s COVID 19 treatment protocols directly resulted in Grace s death in October 2021 a week after admission The trial began last week at the State of Wisconsin Circuit Court for Outagamie County The lawsuit names several defendants including some Ascension doctors and nurses and the Wisconsin Injured Patients and Family Compensation Fund Grace s older sister Jessica Vander Heiden testified Tuesday that she was unaware that the hospital had placed a do not resuscitate DNR order in Grace s chart until shortly before her death and that in Grace s final moments hospital staff refused to intervene and did not honor her family s repeated requests to revoke the DNR Expert witnesses for the plaintiffs testified that there were multiple violations of the standard of care by Ascension doctors and nurses Dr Gilbert Berdine an associate professor of medicine at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center said that this was the first malpractice case where he testified as an expert witness for plaintiffs and explained why he chose to do so The breaches of the standard of care were egregious and I could not live with myself without answering the call to review and give advice on this case Berdine said Hospital staff ignored family s pleading screaming yelling During her testimony Vander

and they claimed they could not do anything about it Vander Heiden said As Grace s condition declined shortly before her death Vander Heiden said she and Grace s parents who were connected on FaceTime were pleading screaming yelling for hospital staff to revoke the DNR It actually went on for almost 10 full minutes trying to get someone to help save her and no one stepped in that room Vander Heiden testified They literally stood outside Grace s room stationary They would not move This was despite the presence of roughly 30 plus nurses in the hallway outside Grace s room Vander Heiden said During this time and up to Grace s death Vander Heiden said McInnis was nowhere to be found nor was Dr Gavin Shokar a defendant who was the primary physician in charge of Grace s care Last week McInnis testified that she was treating no other patients at the time During last week s proceedings Grace s parents testified that they never agreed to a DNR while witnesses for the hospital including Shokar and McInnis provided conflicting testimony on this point On Thursday Dr David Fisk an infectious disease doctor and witness for the defense acknowledged that DNRs are typically signed by the overseeing physician and co signed by the patient or a representative He said there are instances where two doctors can place a DNR order but that s very unusual The worst kind of breach of the standard of care Vander Heiden testified that during her stay with Grace at the hospital she was not told about the benefits or risks of the medication being administered to her sister and did not provide informed consent for the drugs which included the sedatives Precedex lorazepam and morphine I wasn t told about anything Vander Heiden testified including alternative courses of treatment

situation didn t seem like it was an emergency or urgent in any way and Shokar and McInnis did not indicate that Grace required emergency treatment The previous evening Grace s oxygen levels were in the high 90s and Grace appeared to be in good spirits But on Oct 13 doctors placed Grace on a feeding tube Once the feeding tube was placed Vander Heiden recalled that Grace appeared very wiped out Later that day Grace was given morphine and according to Vander Heiden she began showing signs of distress including feeling cold to the touch They were starting to drop Vander Heiden testified referring to Grace s oxygen levels This all happened after the morphine However three oximeters in Grace s room provided conflicting readings According to Vander Heiden McInnis did not intervene and suggested covering Grace with a blanket which she did not provide According to Vander Heiden Grace s pulse was soon so low that a phlebotomist who came to draw blood was unsuccessful She had a hard time even finding a vein Vander Heiden testified Witnesses for the Schara family corroborated Vander Heiden s testimony Berdine testified on Friday that the breaches of the standard of care he identified when reviewing the case are too numerous to count Berdine said several of these breaches related to the lack of informed consent including for the DNR order on Grace s chart Well that s the worst kind of breach of the standard of care because you re supposed to be delivering medical care and now you re entering an order to not deliver medical care Berdine said Berdine said that a DNR order can be revoked at any time by the patient the patient s family or a power of attorney for the patient as soon as it escapes the person s mouth He said doctors and medical staff are obligated to err on the side of saving the patient when there s confusion Registered nurse Susan Eichinger another witness for the plaintiffs agreed She testified on Monday that the placement of a DNR without informed consent was a principal breach that indicated the lack of communication by the hospital with the Schara family There s nothing in the medical record that indicates these conversations took

patient was given medications very dangerous medications not theoretically dangerous medications but medications proved by the medical record to be dangerous to this patient without informed consent Berdine testified He said he hadn t seen a similar case in his years of practice The administration of morphine to a patient who was unconscious unresponsive had lost her blood pressure had no palpable pulse and whose respiratory pattern was screaming to anybody who would look is or was the worst clinical decision I have ever witnessed in over 46 years of medical practice Berdine testified Berdine said that even after they gave Grace morphine there were treatment options available that could have reversed her condition For example they could have given her Naloxone a medication used to reverse the effects of opioids Witnesses for the defense testified that Grace was not oversedated to a life threatening extent at any point during her stay But according to Berdine Grace was oversedated three times during her hospital stay and even though her first oversedation event involving Precedex was a near death experience Ascension doctors and nurses continued to administer the drug and increased its dosage According to Berdine the sedatives administered to Grace had a synergistic effect where the total effect is greater than the sum of the parts He said the repeated oversedation with these drugs led to metabolic acidosis a potentially life threatening condition where the blood is too acidic and hypotension or low blood pressure Berdine said the administration of lorazepam was wrong as it slowed her breathing at a time when Grace needed all the ventilation she could muster as it was the only thing keeping her alive He added that Grace s rapid breathing rate was helping to keep her alive but that the morphine further slowed her breathing In the face of metabolic acidosis and somebody whose body is screaming at you that they re desperately compensating for

provide comfort and assist with tasks such as adjusting her mask or feeding her Particularly after the father Scott was evicted feeding became impractical because there was nobody who had the time to do it Berdine testified According to Berdine Scott s eviction also had a tangible negative impact on her health Statistically Grace s oxygen levels dropped three times as fast after he was evicted than prior to his eviction Berdine testified For Eichinger Scott s eviction was one of several breaches indicative of a broader pattern of poor communication by Ascension Based on the evaluation of the record and the depositions and that this was a persistent attitude of dismissal and he was marginalized as far as I can see because he wasn t mentioned in any capacity as a helpful way Eichinger

raise critical issues of concern and cause for urgent action to phase out petrochemicals The Report of the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes by Marcos Orellana was delivered to the 79th Session of the U N General Assembly in July 2024 Excerpts from the report follow Women make up roughly 60 to 70 per cent of the agricultural labour force in developing countries where pesticides and pesticide handling are especially poorly regulated In Zambia for example two thirds of the labour force is engaged in agriculture and 78 per cent are women farmers and peasants Women there play a significant role in pesticide application often without any or adequate personal protective equipment especially during activities such as weeding harvesting and washing pesticide laden clothes In higher income countries women who do agricultural work are often poor and or migrants pesticides are one of many dimensions of marginalization and damage to their well being The European agriculture sector uses many seasonal and migrant women from Northern Africa for example Strawberries have some of the highest pesticide residues in the European Union and women working with strawberries have also reported trafficking and sexual abuse Some of the most serious impacts of exposure to pesticides concern female reproductive health damage Exposures to hazardous pesticides during pregnancy can cause miscarriages premature births birth anomalies and low birthweight In one study in Argentina women exposed to chlorpyrifos experienced miscarriage at 4 7 times the rate of other women Men also face reproductive damage from pesticides for example reductions in sperm quality A recent Brazilian study found that pesticides generated a wide spectrum of reproductive health problems such as male and female infertility endocrine disruption some types of cancer germ cell

is the data collected by the American Cancer Society which establishes that breast cancer is the most common cancer in the U S We know from the large number of studies that toxic chemicals and pesticides in particular contribute significantly to this tragic reality Genetic factors play only a minor role in breast cancer incidences while exposure to external environmental factors i e chemical exposure may play a more notable role For breast cancer one in 10 women will receive a diagnosis and genetics can only account for 5 to 10 of cases Therefore it is essential to understand how external stimuli like environmental pollution from pesticides can drive breast cancer development Most types of breast cancers are hormonally responsive and thus dependent on the synthesis of either estrogen or progesterone Hormones generated by the endocrine system and the synthetic chemicals that mimic them greatly influence breast cancer incidents among humans Several studies and reports including U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA data identify hundreds of chemicals as influential factors associated with breast cancer risk Pesticides disproportionately affect women s health in many ways including ovarian and breast cancer spontaneous abortion stillbirths and other negative birth outcomes developmental effects and adverse neurodevelopment brain function and development among infants Notably many of these health effects are hormonally responsive Chemicals that act like hormones endocrine disruptors EDC may cause or contribute to these problems EDCs are chemicals that can even at low exposure levels disrupt normal hormonal endocrine function EDCs function by 1 mimicking the action of a naturally produced hormone such as estrogen or testosterone thereby setting off similar chemical reactions in the body 2 blocking hormone receptors in cells thereby preventing the action of natural hormones or 3 affecting the synthesis transport metabolism and excretion of hormones thus altering the concentrations of natural hormones EDCs include many pesticides exposures to which have been linked to infertility and other reproductive disorders diabetes cardiovascular

Disruptor Screening Program On Oct 11 2024 the EPA published a notice of a proposed partial settlement agreement and consent decree in response to a suit by the Center for Food Safety on behalf of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas et al challenging the agency s failure to test and regulate endocrine disrupting pesticides EPA s proposal was an abrogation of EPA s responsibilities under the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act as well as the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act Limiting the scope of the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program to humans certain pesticide active ingredients only and limiting the types of data to assess EDC effects is contrary to the congressional intent and requirements in these statutes It is also a reversal of the Endocrine Disruptor Screening and Testing Advisory Committee s advice and the agency s original Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program implementation policy and science decisions While the consent decree does commit EPA to test for estrogenic effects in conventional pesticide active ingredients it falls far short of addressing the full range of endocrine disrupting effects of all pesticide ingredients as is required to protect human health and the environment The February 2024 comments of Beyond Pesticides detail these requirements Under the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act a pesticide is presumed to pose an unreasonable risk until reliable data demonstrate otherwise If the EPA lacks the data and or resources to fully evaluate endocrine risks to human health and wildlife then it is obliged to suspend or deny any pesticide registration until it has sufficient data to demonstrate no unreasonable adverse endocrine risk The history and status of endocrine disruption research are summarized in Beyond Pesticides comments and the Oct 29 2024 Daily News post Evidence that synthetic chemicals can mimic or otherwise interfere

the thyroid gland through regulation of the HPT axis which is controlled through a complex mechanism of positive and negative feedback regulation Multiple pathways contribute to the synthesis of thyroid releasing hormone including thyroid hormone signaling through feedback mechanisms leptin and melanocortin signaling body temperature regulation and cardiovascular physiology Each pathway directly targets thyroid releasing hormone neurons Based on the conservation of endocrine pathways it is well understood that the ecological assays the frog assay in particular are often more

management capacity are outpaced by rising plastic production making progress almost invisible Earth Action co CEO Sarah Perreard said in a statement on April 11 criticizing the assumption that recycling and waste management capacity will solve the plastics crisis That assumption has been peddled for decades by the fossil fuel industry which has a major interest in thwarting attempts to curb the production use and waste of plastics Nearly all plastic is made from chemicals sourced from fossil fuels Sian Sutherland co founder of A Plastic Planet said the new report underscores that plastic

when fat builds up in the liver It can eventually lead to inflammation in the liver hepatitis and has also been shown to increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer and diabetes in those who don t already have the disease a recent study shows People with MASLD are also at higher risk of cardiovascular disease advanced scarring cirrhosis and liver failure Glyphosate now manufactured and sold in hundreds of products is a broad spectrum herbicide that was patented by Monsanto now owned by Bayer Recent studies suggest its association with cancer metabolic disorders endocrine disruption and infertility Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease and psychological disorders Rates of MASLD and glyphosate use have surged in parallel with each other over the past three decades statistics show More than one third of people worldwide have MASLD whose prevalence has increased by 50 In that same time total herbicide use increased by roughly 280 largely driven by crops genetically modified GM to tolerate glyphosate resulting in continuous human exposure Current exposure estimates suggest that glyphosate deemed a probable human carcinogen in 2015 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer is present in about 60 of U S vegetables and in the urine of people worldwide including those with no work related exposure In addition areas of high pesticide use also tend to correlate with high rates of MASLD in people studies have shown though most research is centered on U S populations In Latin America for instance where the disease is more prevalent than anywhere else in the world pesticide use per capita is also the highest globally the reviewers say This trend underscores the urgent need for further investigation into the relationship between

effectiveness of COVID 19 immunizations in preventing severe disease or hospitalization The researchers concluded that together the five studies failed to adequately assess differences in underlying health between vaccination groups For example raw data from the five studies suggested a 92 increase in adverse events compared with the unvaccinated The researchers attributed this to healthy vaccinee bias HVB the idea that individuals interested in vaccination might be healthier to begin with than individuals who are not so inclined HVB had been reported previously for the mRNA shots The

social media Social media platforms are designed to maximize engagement a form of compulsive addictive behavior that encompasses time spent in front of devices and the number and type of online interactions Barriers to balancing social media s potential benefits against possible harms are formidable however due to the varied nature of social media engagement and the fact that social media is only about 20 years old Dr Sandro Galea a professor and dean of Boston University School of Public Health said in an interview with JAMA that the relatively limited time social media has been around complicates the ability to determine causality between social media use and health outcomes It s difficult to draw generalizable inference about platform modifications that could make across the board benefits or could limit across the board harms Galea said The JAMA editorial followed an earlier advisory from the U S surgeon general calling for immediate actions to make social media safer for

follow up study in the Netherlands and the UK The Lancet Child Adolescent Health Feb 20 2024 The bad news A greater interest in food at ages 4 5 predicts eating disorders at ages 12 14 and genes are likely involved The good news is that much of the harm is preventable through appropriate parental feeding strategies Using the parent reported Children s Eating Behaviour Questionnaire researchers queried 2 801 Dutch and 869 British families on the eating habits of 2 to 4 year olds They were looking for specific behaviors associated with appetite avidity a greater interest in food characterized by overeating Higher avidity in early childhood increased the odds of adolescent binge eating by 47 uncontrolled eating by 33 emotional eating by 26 restrained eating by 16 and compensatory behaviors such as extreme dieting misuse of diet products and bulimia by 18 By contrast greater satiety responsiveness appropriate feelings of fullness lowered risks for maladaptive eating The authors stressed parenting s role in not using food for any purpose other than nutrition for example as a reward and in teaching children to recognize when they are full and to eat more slowly Genes also affect eating behavior A genetic predisposition to higher body mass index BMI was associated with binge eating while low BMI genes are linked to anorexia However according to the behavioral susceptibility theory the extent to which genes matter depends on the child s early relationship to food This finding confirms earlier research on how parenting affects children s eating habits Preventive antibiotics

Epstein Barr virus EBV infection is a leading cause of adult and pediatric multiple sclerosis MS but the mechanism is unclear Researchers affiliated with the Network of Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Centers sought to explain how a viral infection nearly every human gets affects only 0 3 of the population in that manner Investigators examined data from 473 pediatric MS cases and 702 controls from the Environmental and Genetic Risk Factors for Pediatric MS study Although their study failed to answer the question of causation it uncovered new additive relationships between prior EBV infection type of anti EBV response and two genetic risk factors associated with susceptibility to MS First individuals with MS were more than 50 more likely 94 6 vs 60 7 to have antibodies to the virus capsid antigen which is normally a sign of a new or active infection Second previously infected subjects whose immune cells carry one specific gene family DRB1 15 were 10 times as likely to develop MS as individuals with prior infection or the DRB1 15 gene alone Having multiple DRB1 genes multiplied the effect One form of DRB1 15 DRB1 15 01 has a strong association with MS and may be considered a genetic predisposition for the disease For example DRB1 15 01 was found in all MS affected members of one Italian family and 4 of 5 unaffected family members Finally prior infection plus one specific mutation in the CD86 gene which regulates antibody production results in a 30 increased risk for pediatric MS So while genes play a role EBV infection appears to be a necessary precondition for

average age was 5 8 years Of those 47 45 6 were classified as food sensitive Parents rated their child s mealtime behavior through the Brief Autism Mealtime Behavior Inventory and disruptive behavior through the Aberrant Behavior Checklist The Aberrant Behavior Checklist consists of 58 questions related to a child s irritability hyperactivity lethargy speech and stereotypic behavior The Brief Autism Mealtime Behavior Inventory consists of 18 questions focused on disruptive behaviors such as screaming and spitting out food during meals Investigators found a strong association between

March 1 2024 A Spanish study found that a child s body mass index BMI determines how they process bisphenol A BPA which in turn affects their gut microbiome composition in ways that drive further weight gain In other words it s a vicious cycle BPA is a component of food packaging plastics that leaches into foods and drinks so diet is the principal source of human exposure Researchers cultured stool samples from 106 children to determine their bacterial microbiome composition Cultured bacteria were then exposed to various concentrations of BPA for 3 days The median age of the children was 7 7 Sixty of the children were normal weight and the remainder were overweight or obese Fifty five were boys The researchers found several correlations between BPA exposure and bacterial composition For example normal weight children had greater microbiome species diversity and more inter species interactions These more enriched structured and connected bacterial networks represented microbiomes that

support proposals aimed at modifying Section 230 for platforms like Facebook but social media giants are dominating public discourse acting like publishers removing articles adding phony fact checks and censoring other reputable publishers that would not be allowed without the protections of Section 230 the WSJ editorial board wrote On Aug 18 2020 Children s Health Defense CHD filed a lawsuit against Facebook Mark Zuckerberg and several third party fact checkers for illegal censorship and fraudulently misrepresenting and defaming CHD The complaint alleges the Centers for Disease Control

who are neither independent nor unbiased to suppress information and the deceptive technology Facebook uses to minimize reach and visibility of content On Feb 10 CHD Chairman Robert F Kennedy Jr s

predecessor President Dwight Eisenhower appeared on national television to deliver his farewell address which history increasingly regards as one of the most important and prophetic speeches in American history In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes President Eisenhower took special care to include an expanded definition of his term military industrial complex that would include the top bureaucrats at the National Institutes of Health NIH Eisenhower warned that the federal government s rising medical and scientific technocracy posed its own unique threats toward our democracy and freedom In this revolution scientific medical research has become central it also becomes more formalized complex and costly A steadily increasing share is conducted for by or at the direction of the Federal government Partly because of the huge costs involved a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity The prospect of domination of the nation s scholars by Federal employment project allocations and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded W e must also be alert to the danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite Eisenhower ended his speech with an admonition that echoes now in rebuke as we emerge from the COVID era that trampled the core principles that had for 240 years maintained America as the global exemplar for democracy constitutional government and personal freedom It is the task of statesmanship to mold to balance and to integrate these and other forces new and old within the principles of our democratic system ever aiming toward the supreme goals of

summit of the nation s scientific and technological elite an apex that he would use to militarize and monetize medical research and to consolidate the seamless alliance between government science the military and intelligence agencies and private contractors in ways that would consummate President Eisenhower s worst nightmares about the threat this cartel posed to democracy The cartel would reach its apogee in 2022 As the COVID pandemic commenced the rising medical technocracy with Anthony Fauci at the helm took on all the menacing features President Eisenhower warned against A powerful syndicate composed of government public health technocrats a rapacious pharmaceutical industry military and intelligence officials and media and social media titans appropriated awesome new powers to override constitutional and civil rights censor information suppress dissent and engineer compliance with arbitrary diktats These mandates culminated in mass submission to inoculation with risky ineffective shoddily tested and unlicensed vaccines And no one is liable for any damage they cause Claiming unprecedented new powers as necessary to fight the war against germs government and industry officials predictably abused them dealing blows to democracy with no discernible benefits to public health Just as the CIA and military apparatus paradoxically profit from war not peace the medical

the incoming president John F Kennedy take the oath of office In his own inaugural in 1933 at the height of a terrifying global depression JFK s idol Franklin Delano Roosevelt FDR had warned the nation that fear was the most potent tool of totalitarians In Europe despots from the left and right had wielded public fear of the same depression to transform Russia into a communist nation and Italy Germany and Spain into fascist totalitarian states FDR had preserved both capitalism and democracy by a steady hand and confidence that kept fear at bay My uncle s truncated administration would be a three year battle to secede from the reign of fear His first bitter battle with his security apparatus occurred three months later during the failed Bay of Pigs invasion Even as he took public blame for the calamity he realized that his military brass and CIA panjandrums had lied to him to trick him into allowing an invasion they knew would fail Their plan was to trap a young president faced with this humiliating failure three months into a presidency into complying with the demands of his Joint Chiefs for a full US invasion of Cuba something that JFK had vowed never to do I chronicled this struggle in my 2018 book American Values JFK recognized that the CIA s function was no longer securing US interests It had devolved into a rogue agency taking on the implicit ambition of US multinational corporations including oil companies and Big Agriculture In this case CIA s partners were Texaco United Fruit Company and the American mafia JFK recognized that the CIA s essential function was no longer national security but providing the Pentagon and its military contractors a steady pipeline of continuous wars In May 1961 now only four months into his presidency my uncle

vaccine showed elevated spike protein production a year or more after vaccination that s significantly longer than the spike protein was expected to remain in the body a peer reviewed study showed The study published last week in Immunity Inflammation and Disease found that participants exhibited elevated levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines proteins that help regulate the immune system signifying the persistence of the humoral immune response to messenger RNA mRNA vaccines According to the study the persistent production of spike protein and highly inflammatory nature of mRNA lipid nanoparticle may account for the elevated cytokine levels Lipid nanoparticles are intended to deliver mRNA to human cells But they ve also been found to deliver DNA contaminants contained within mRNA

COVID 19 vaccines in healthy young adults TrialSite News reported TrialSite News founder and CEO Daniel O Connor said the study s findings highlight the urgent need for spike protein clearance and biodistribution studies especially in young males and older adults whose immune responses appear disproportionately affected Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist for Children s Health Defense CHD said that while the study design a longitudinal study of 84 people without a control group is not the strongest of designs he said the study nevertheless presents evidence with strong implications Months or even years long production of spike protein has some really scary prospects one of which is T cell exhaustion Jablonowski said This can result in a situation where the body cannot effectively fight viruses or cancer Persistent exposure to antigens will exhaust the T cells and inhibit their natural function Epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher said the study s findings are not unexpected citing 130 peer reviewed studies that have identified the persistent presence of spike protein in the human body Hulscher said long term exposure to spike proteins may result in symptoms similar to those experienced by people diagnosed with long COVID A preprint by Yale University researchers published in February found that people thought to be experiencing long COVID may be suffering from post vaccination syndrome The study also showed that the spike protein from the COVID 19 vaccine persisted in the blood of at least one person 709 days after vaccination a significantly

S government databases It warrants a larger retrospective controlled study the data for which is mothballed by government or healthcare institutions Jablonowski said This kind of data is not kept forever The window to preserve information on the harms of the COVID 19 injections is quickly closing In an interview last month U S Secretary of Health and Human Services HHS Robert F Kennedy Jr said that HHS sub agencies were selling patient information presumably including vaccine injury information to each other instead of making the information freely accessible During the same interview Kennedy announced the launch of a new agency within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC that will specialize in vaccine injuries Significant increase in cytokines linked to autoimmune disorders According to the new study a significant increase in weight and body mass index was observed overall among study participants as were significant increases in several cytokines In an analysis published on Substack Hulscher noted that the presence of the TNF α IL 1β IL 6 IL 4 IL 7 and IL 17E cytokines increased in study participants These cytokines are associated with chronic inflammation immune dysregulation and autoimmune activation These increases were significantly greater in males the study authors said Increases were also observed in the VEGFA angiogenesis FGF2 and IFN γ cytokines linked to vascular remodeling tissue repair and persistent immune activation and the MCP 1 and MCP 3 cytokines associated with chronic inflammation vascular remodeling and autoimmunity The study showed that the presence of the macrophage colony stimulating factor cytokine decreased This could be a sign of immune system dysregulation Hulscher wrote Brian Hooker Ph D chief scientific officer for CHD said It is a little difficult to tell regarding the increase in cytokines in young adults because they also experienced the greatest increase in overall weight and BMI within the study Obesity goes hand in hand with inflammation However even the increases in the cohort of older adults considered alone is concerning and this needs a larger more comprehensive study using retrospective

long term prospective cohort study that associates environmental chemical exposure during pregnancy and childhood with negative health effects This data addresses combined pesticide exposures in young children with neurobehavior analyses at the age of 10 to determine any correlation Within the Sheyang Mini Birth Cohort Study a total of 1303 pregnant women are enrolled When the children reached ages

ranged from 95 2 to 100 and were significantly positively correlated in each childhood phase The most significantly elevated scores were identified for the group with higher levels of metabolites occurring during infancy and toddlerhood These results reveal significant positive associations between pesticide exposure during early life 1 2 years and hyperactivity inattention symptom in 10 year old children the researchers report They continue I ndividuals with higher urinary concentrations of the three pesticide metabolites during infancy and toddlerhood 1 2 years had elevated hyperactivity inattention scores compared to those with continuously low exposures 1 10 years and those with higher exposure levels during pre school age 3 7 years These results highlight that early childhood especially before the age of 2 represents a critical window regarding the neurobehavioral developmental effects of pesticide exposure This is explained by the combination of children s weak pesticide metabolism capabilities and high brain plasticity before 2 years of age Prior research supports that exposure at a young age and even during gestation can cause developmental delays and disorders See here here here and here Since children are rapidly growing and developing they are particularly susceptible to the adverse health effects of pesticides and are disproportionately at risk The timing of pesticide exposure is crucial in determining the neurotic damage inflicted as children s metabolic function and the growth rates of the nervous system change with age the researchers noted In

more than a third 36 don t trust the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA compared with 59 who have full or at least some trust in those public health agencies Only 5 were undecided Children s Health Defense CHD commissioned the online national survey conducted in November 2024 by Zogby Strategies The overall margin of sampling error is 3 2 percentage points with subgroups having higher margins Federal health agencies have long faced a lack of trust from the American public However this distrust goes deeper than simple ideological bias The polarization seen during and after the COVID 19 pandemic has widened the trust gap between the government and the public The survey shows that even among moderates 33 do not trust the CDC and FDA while 60 do trust them leaving 7 undecided In the survey 41 of voters believe the government mishandled or failed to handle the COVID 19 pandemic compared to 52 who think it managed the pandemic well or did the best it could Only 13 of respondents said the government handled the pandemic effectively The poll also showed that fewer than half of the surveyed individuals supported government vaccine mandates The group most opposed to vaccine mandates consisted of 45 to 64 year olds of whom 55 oppose them Additionally more than half 57 of poll respondents believed vaccine makers should lose their immunity from legal action and the public should be able to sue the manufacturer of a vaccine that caused them harm This data highlights a significant loss of trust in our regulatory agencies said CHD CEO Mary Holland Allowing this distrust to persist will further undermine the public s confidence in our healthcare organizations Holland added We must emphasize that if the government wishes to regain credibility it must recognize the realities of vaccines Until that happens Americans are less likely to heed their guidance and the remaining public faith in these institutions will ultimately vanish Voters were asked five questions 1 Do Americans trust government health agencies like the CDC and FDA More than a third 36 of Americans said they have little or no trust in the FDA and CDC vs

has plans to construct a vast network of carbon dioxide pipelines spanning tens of thousands of miles across the U S despite leaks over the past several years including one that sent nearly 50 people in a Mississippi town to the hospital with zombie like symptoms Federal tax incentives under the Biden administration s Inflation Reduction Act are driving the pipeline projects which aim to capture and store carbon emissions from power plants according to Emily Sanders of ExxonKnews The U S has a relatively small network of carbon dioxide pipelines totaling approximately 5 000 miles and primarily located in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions But to transport just 15 of the country s greenhouse gas emissions the U S Department of Energy DOE and financial industry project up to 96 000 miles of new pipelines may be required enough to cross the continental U S 32 times coast to coast 2020 rupture led to mass asphyxiation event In 2020 a rupture in a Denbury Enterprises carbon dioxide pipeline in Satartia Mississippi led to a mass asphyxiation event causing people to become disoriented and unresponsive with some even losing consciousness As hundreds attempted to flee the area vehicles stalled and shut down because internal combustion engines require oxygen On April 3 an ExxonMobil and Denbury owned CO2 pipeline ruptured in Sulphur Louisiana Normal evacuation procedures had to be scrapped due to wind patterns blowing through the escape route forcing residents within a quarter mile radius to shelter in place No injuries were reported When released into the atmosphere carbon dioxide can spread over large distances displacing oxygen and posing serious risks to people and wildlife including sickness suffocation and even coma and death according to Huffpost Mild

eminent domain concerns Landowners like Kenny Davis and Ray Sinclair in Scott County Illinois have experienced long lasting damage to their properties due to the construction of the Spire STL natural gas pipeline They are firmly against plans to add CO2 pipelines to the mix according to St Louis Public Radio station KCUR Davis reported underground debris and erosion problems while Sinclair faced issues with water pooling in low lying areas of his soybean fields due to changes in the land s slope Farmers and landowners are also concerned about their private property being seized under eminent domain arguing the pipelines provide no direct benefit to farmers Numerous communities landowners and environmental and public health organizations have strongly opposed the expansion of these pipelines In some cases they have successfully blocked projects such as the proposed 1 300 mile Navigator CO2 pipeline that would have traversed five Midwestern states In 2022 the California state legislature passed a law that placed a moratorium on most new CO2 pipelines until the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration PHMSA completes its planned rulemaking This law prohibits new pipelines until the federal government finishes writing stronger safety regulations a process that could take years according to The Associated Press Lobbyists trying to expedite construction of new pipelines Major fossil fuel corporations and their trade associations including Chevron ConocoPhillips the American Petroleum Institute and the Liquid Energy Pipeline Association have initiated an intensive lobbying campaign to weaken regulations and influence regulators Their goal is to expedite the construction of new pipelines according to ExxonKnews In May 2022 the PHMSA

Scientists have warned that carbon capture and sequestration may not effectively reduce emissions and is often employed for enhanced oil recovery leading to the extraction of more fossil fuels according to ExxonKnews A study in Nature Reviews Earth Environment suggests that the maximum annual geological carbon storage capacity by 2050 is 16 gigatonnes But this scenario is considered unrealistic as it would require massive and sustained growth over several decades according to New Scientist The study indicates that taking into account U S objectives a more plausible scenario would see global annual geological storage reach around 6 gigatonnes by mid century significantly lower than the levels climate models assume necessary to limit the global temperate increase to the targeted 1 5 C Furthermore critics argue that carbon capture and storage projects are inefficient uses of resources and funding Rep Jared Huffman D Calif who serves on the U S House of Representatives Railroads Pipelines and Hazardous Materials subcommittee questioned the effectiveness of carbon capture and storage projects in addressing climate change according to NPR This entire strategy is being represented as a climate solution when most of the time it s really not Most of the time it s really part of the climate problem he said noting that many projects involve enhanced oil recovery which could lead to increased fossil fuel production In a 2022 New York Times opinion piece Charles Harvey and Kurt House former founders of a carbon capture and storage startup contended that investing in renewable energy would result in far greater carbon emission reductions They highlighted the numerous failed carbon capture and storage demonstration projects that have consumed billions of dollars in

mission to Wuhan that a lab leak was extremely unlikely and may have sought a change in the mission s report but he faced resistance from a collaborator of the Wuhan Institute of Virology in a very ugly Zoom call The Feb 15 2021 call was revealed for the first time in an email obtained through the Freedom of Information Act Tedros took issue with the extremely unlikely ranking and sought to acknowledge as credible the hypothesis that the COVID 19 pandemic began at one of the city s virology labs in the March 2021 WHO convened study of the origins of SARS CoV 2 But EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak perhaps the Wuhan lab s closest American collaborator strongly opposed Tedros openly arguing with the WHO leader on a call with other members of the mission and senior WHO leadership present according to a 2021 email Daszak sent colleagues By the way at one point after we returned from Wuhan the DG Director General openly tried to get us to change the conclusions of our poll that we held in China re lab leak so it would be more likely than extremely unlikely Utterly shameless Daszak wrote in an Aug 19 2021 email This led to us in particular myself and REDACTED arguing with the DG in a very ugly 2 hour zoom call Most of the senior staff around DG are ashamed of his political maneuverings Daszak continued REDACTED and others were very quiet on the zoom call when the DG announced to the team that he d be setting up a new structure and we d have to reapply for membership for Phase 2 through our governments this time The call occurred a few days after the Feb 9 2021 press conference in Wuhan in which the mission announced their conclusions the WHO confirmed As Daszak favored the joint WHO China study published a few weeks later on March 30 2021 reported that introduction through a laboratory incident was considered to be an extremely unlikely pathway A spokesperson for the WHO disputed the characterization that Tedros attempted to alter the language of the report and emphasized that though the team was commissioned by the WHO it worked independently Tedros underscored that the extremely unlikely label had no supporting evidence However

arranged because members of the Wuhan mission were complaining that we didn t support their position Jasarevic continued During the call Dr Tedros shared his surprise at extremely unlikely explained his thinking and listened to the scientists but his position remained consistent They had reached an unsubstantiated position and without access and information from China all hypotheses remain on the table and it is not possible nor scientific to conclude extremely unlikely We did not ask the scientists to change their position which they had already publicly announced on Feb 9 The call focused on the members complaints and requests that we support their position Regardless Daszak expressed negative feelings about Tedros in his email speculating that the director general had voiced openness to the lab leak theory in order to gain support from the Biden administration for his reelection Slick politician awful public health guy Daszak wrote The WHO pushed back on this characterization as well It is inaccurate but also illogical to allege that Dr Tedros s position was a political act aimed at the U S due to the upcoming DG reelection There s ample evidence that Dr Tedros did not take political stands around the pandemic neither during the last year of the previous administration amid threats of U S withdrawal nor during the subsequent administration Jasarevic said Daszak served on the mission to Wuhan to uncover the pandemic s source despite the fact that joint EcoHealth Wuhan Institute of Virology ventures included research to engineer combined coronaviruses more deadly and infectious than their natural backbone viruses The Feb 15 Zoom call underscored the importance of a more credible second phase investigation the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel

the other sectors The month long mission to Wuhan was hamstrung by lengthy negotiations with the Chinese government and a two week quarantine The visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology only lasted a

theories the report reads The international team s visit could help to defuse some of the theories that were circulating In response to criticism of the report for prematurely ruling out a lab leak the international team wrote a commentary in Nature pointing out that a laboratory origin hypothesis schema is presented on page 119 of the 120 page report The report then describes the scenario as extremely unlikely We held frank discussions with key scientists in the relevant Wuhan institutions a line of inquiry that exceeded our original mandate the team wrote When we reviewed the responses

Daszak s influence Daszak has had an extraordinary influence on the public conversation about the pandemic An influential letter in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet in February 2020 cast the

Killed Patients Zowe Smith who left her job as a medical coder in an Arizona hospital joined The Defender In Depth to discuss how the use of ventilators and remdesivir unnecessarily caused the deaths of COVID 19 patients admitted to hospitals You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Zowe Smith had a fairly mundane job As a medical coder at an Arizona hospital her job was to take information from patient records and translate that into diagnosis and procedure codes But when the COVID 19 shots and COVID 19 hospital protocols were introduced Smith began to see things she d never before seen in her career We all believe that this is where people are supposed to go to get better the hospital is supposed to help you Smith told The Defender In Depth this week That s not what was happening Smith resigned and started speaking out about the suffering she saw recorded on patient medical records She is the author of The COVID Code My Life in the Thrill Kill Medical Cult She also writes regularly on Substack Patients were circling the drain soon after administration of COVID protocols Smith said that medical coding aside from being used for insurance purposes is used to track the number of cases of diseases and illnesses regionally and nationwide Her job was to expose the patterns of disease going on in the population and she said what she observed during the pandemic led her to begin questioning Even when I was experiencing what I saw it was almost unbelievable that this could even happen in a hospital said Smith who first noticed abnormalities when the hospital started implementing COVID 19 protocols I started noticing patients trying to escape the hospital like unplugging things pulling out vent tubes and escaping then I started to hear rumors about the ventilators and I knew that there was a bonus for giving remdesivir Smith said Smith said patients coming in with cold and flu symptoms were treated differently than they had been before the COVID 19 outbreak Before COVID a cold flu or pneumonia case you would normally be home within three days maybe a week unless you had other major conditions Before the pandemic patients were rarely placed on ventilators Smith said Before the pandemic and the hospital protocols began we did not connect patients to ventilators right away It wasn t until they were in dire straits and we had tried every other method that they would be put on a ventilator and then they would be coming off those ventilators as soon as possible But under the COVID 19 hospital protocols patients would be on the ventilators for

from the ventilator which should be something they re talking about within 24 hours because the longer you re on the less likely you are to come off the ventilator Under the COVID 19 protocols doctors went straight to the ventilator even if patient oxygen levels had not reached the threshold where we would normally ventilate a person Patients who were given remdesivir developed kidney failure within a few days I could see the lab values they were getting worse almost immediately after the administration of remdesivir she said Smith described the pattern she observed Patient comes in patient gets COVID diagnosis patient is given a dose of remdesivir Smith said Pretty soon they re on vents Pretty soon they have kidney failure and then they re circling the drain and nothing that we could do would save them Visits by loved ones were limited or prohibited due to pandemic restrictions and the hospital protocols and this took a horrific toll on patients Smith said According to Smith patient records showed instances of the police getting called to the hospitals to eject people that were trying to visit dying loved ones or loved ones that were being harmed by the hospital protocols Smith said these patterns were evident to her as a medical coder Every note that happens between a nurse and a patient is documented There s social information that s documented There s information from ambulance documentation that gets added to the medical record Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Huge incentive for financially kneecapped hospitals to implement protocols According to Smith at the start of the pandemic hospitals were placed under financial pressure which later incentivized them to accept payments for implementing the COVID 19 hospital protocols When the world was asked to lock down hospitals were also issued mandates that they needed to shut down their OR operating rooms which is their bread and butter That s where most of their money is made she said Hospitals also had to increase their ICU intensive care unit bed capacity and reduce the number of patients in the ICU beds Smith said This financially kneecapped hospitals for many months from

passed the CARES Act Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act the COVID 19 protocols came down to us from the NIH the National Institutes of Health The protocols prescribed the use of remdesivir and ventilators for suspected COVID 19 patients and financially incentivized struggling hospitals to use them Hospitals got 20 for every single dose of remdesivir they gave to a patient they got the bonus for it being a COVID patient to begin with And then if the patient goes on a ventilator they got the maximum payment she said This article was funded by critical thinkers like you

vaccine injuries by not inquiring about vaccination status Smith said medical records also contained evidence of patient injuries following administration of the COVID 19 vaccines I began seeing some incredibly crazy cases Smith said I began to notice more cases of near instant death like within an hour of multi organ failure Massive inflammation brain death things that we had never ever seen before In my 11 years of medical coding I had never seen a case like that She added Most of those patients that had sepsis and the massive whole body inflammation did not make it There were a lot of cases of seizures that were uncontrollable and then people started to arrive with brain inflammation encephalitis some of them suffering from stroke like symptoms All of a sudden massive blood clots coming in And these were in young people These were not elderly people with comorbidities Yet according to Smith hospitals would not inquire about patients vaccination status making it impossible to diagnose these conditions as vaccine injuries They weren t asking the right questions and weren t writing it in the medical record Smith said she felt the need to turn her experience into something

Facebook s Censorship Caused Tens of millions have been spent to prove what Mark Zuckerberg could have admitted years ago that the government pressured Facebook to censor legitimate content and the social media giant complied You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Joshua Stylman and Jeffrey A Tucker History will remember this era as the moment when America s most sacred principles collided with unprecedented institutional power and lost The systematic dismantling of fundamental rights didn t happen through military force or executive decree but through the quiet cooperation of tech platforms media gatekeepers and government agencies all claiming to protect us from misinformation Meta s sudden dismantling of its fact checking program announced by Mark Zuckerberg as a cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech reads like a quiet footnote to what history may record as one of the most staggering violations of fundamental rights in recent memory After eight years of increasingly aggressive content moderation including nearly 100 fact checking organizations operating in over 60 languages Meta is now pivoting to a community driven system similar to X s model In his announcement Zuckerberg first suggests that the censorship was purely a technical mistake and then changes his tune near the end and admits what has long been litigated The only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government And that s why it s been so difficult over the past 4 years when even the US government has pushed for censorship By going after us and other American companies it has emboldened other governments to go even further In many court cases costing millions involving vast Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests depositions and discoveries the truth of this has been documented in 100 000 pages of evidence The Murthy v Missouri case alone uncovered substantial communications through the Freedom of Information Act and depositions revealing the depth of government coordination with social media platforms The U S Supreme Court considered it all but several justices simply could not comprehend the substance and scale and thus reversed a lower court injunction to stop it all Now we have Zuckerberg openly admitting precisely what was in dispute the U S government s involvement in aggressive violation of the First Amendment This should at least make it easier to find redress as the cases proceed Still it is frustrating Tens of millions have been spent to prove what he could have admitted

preparing to take control But while Zuckerberg frames this as a return to free speech principles the damage of their experiment in mass censorship can t be undone with a simple policy change The irony

power only to have Meta remove it as misinformation This wasn t just censorship it was meta censorship silencing discussion about the very mechanisms of control being deployed While tech platforms maintained the facade of private enterprise their synchronized actions with government agencies revealed a more troubling reality the emergence of exactly the kind of state corporate fusion they were trying to prevent us from discussing As we ve covered before we didn t just cross lines we crossed sacred Rubicons created after humanity s darkest chapters The First Amendment born from the revolution against tyranny and the Nuremberg Code established after World War II s horrors were meant to be unbreakable guardians of human rights Both were systematically dismantled in the name of safety The same tactics of misinformation fear and government overreach that our ancestors warned against were deployed with frightening efficiency This systematic dismantling left no topic untouched from discussions of vaccine effects to debates about virus origins to questions about mandate policies The scientific discourse was replaced with approved narratives Medical researchers couldn t share findings that diverged from institutional positions as seen in the removal of credible discussions of COVID 19 data and policy Even personal experiences were labeled misinformation if they didn t align with official messaging a pattern that reached absurd heights when even discussing the nature of censorship itself became grounds for censorship The damage rippled through every layer of society At the individual level careers were destroyed and professional licenses revoked simply for sharing genuine experiences Scientists and doctors who questioned prevailing narratives found themselves professionally ostracized Many were made to feel isolated or irrational for trusting their own eyes and experiences when platforms labeled their firsthand accounts as misinformation The destruction of

splintered Neighbors turned against neighbors Small businesses faced blacklisting Churches divided School board meetings devolved into battlegrounds The social fabric that enabled civil society began unraveling not because people held different views but because the very possibility of dialogue was deemed dangerous The censors won They showed that with enough institutional power they could break apart the social fabric that makes free discourse possible Now that this infrastructure for suppression exists it stands ready to be deployed again for whatever cause seems urgent enough The absence of a public reckoning sends a chilling message there is no line that cannot be crossed no principle that cannot be ignored True reconciliation demands more than Meta s casual policy reversal We need a full transparent investigation documenting every instance of censorship from suppressed vaccine injury reports to blocked scientific debates about virus origins to silenced voices questioning mandate policies This isn t about vindication it s about creating an unassailable public record ensuring these tactics can never be deployed again Our Constitution s First Amendment wasn t a suggestion it was a sacred covenant written in the blood of those who fought tyranny Its principles aren t outdated relics but vital protections against the very overreach we just witnessed When institutions treat these foundational rights as flexible guidelines rather than inviolable boundaries the damage ripples far beyond any single platform or policy Like many in our circles we witnessed this firsthand But personal vindication isn t the goal Every voice silenced every debate suppressed every relationship fractured in service of approved narratives represents a tear in our social fabric that makes us all poorer Without a full accounting and concrete safeguards against future overreach we re leaving future generations vulnerable to the same autocratic impulses wearing different masks The question isn t

about something important today because it s time to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram I started building social media to give people a voice I gave a speech at Georgetown 5 years ago about the importance of protecting free expression and I still believe this today But a lot has happened over the last several years There s been widespread debate about potential harms from online content governments and legacy media have pushed to censor more and more A lot of this is clearly political but there s also a lot of legitimately bad stuff out there Drugs terrorism child exploitation These are things that we take very seriously and I wanna make sure that we handle responsibly So we built a lot of complex systems to moderate content but the problem with complex systems is they make mistakes Even if they accidentally censor just 1 of posts that s millions of people And we ve reached a point where it s just too many mistakes and too much censorship The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech So we re gonna get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes simplifying our policies and restoring free expression on our platforms More specifically here s what we re gonna do First we re gonna get rid of fact checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X starting in the US After Trump first got elected in 2016 the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth but the fact checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they ve created especially in the US So over the next couple of months we re gonna phase in a more comprehensive community note system Second we re gonna simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with

they ve created especially in the US So over the next couple of months we re gonna phase in a more comprehensive community note system Second we re gonna simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas and it s gone too far So I wanna make sure that people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms Third we re changing how we enforce our policies to reduce the mistakes that account for the vast majority of censorship on our platforms We used to have filters that scanned for any policy violation Now we re gonna focus those filters on tackling illegal and high severity violations And for lower severity violations we re going to rely on someone reporting an issue before we take action The problem is that the filters make mistakes and they take down a lot of content that they shouldn t So by dialing them back we re gonna dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms We re also going to tune our content filters to require much higher confidence before taking down content The reality is that this is a trade off It means we re gonna catch less bad stuff but we ll also reduce the number of innocent people s posts and accounts that we accidentally take down Fourth we re bringing back civic content For a while the community asked to see less politics because it was making people stressed So we stopped recommending these posts but it feels like we re in a new era now and we re starting to get feedback that people want to see this content again So we re gonna start phasing this back into Facebook Instagram and Threads while working to keep the communities friendly and positive Fifth Fifth we re gonna move our trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California and our US based content review is going to be based in Texas As we work to promote free expression I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams Finally we re gonna work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more The US has the strongest constitutional protections for free expression in the world Europe has an ever increasing number of laws institutionalizing censorship and making it difficult to build anything innovative there Latin American countries have secret courts that can order companies", "chunk_id":

countries have secret courts that can order companies to quietly take things down China has censored our apps from even working in the country The only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government And that s why it s been so difficult over the past 4 years when even the US government has pushed for censorship By going after us and other American companies it has emboldened other governments to go even further But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression and I am excited to take it It ll take time to get this right And these are complex systems They re never gonna be perfect There s also a lot of illegal stuff that we still need to work very hard to remove But the bottom line is that after years of having our content moderation work focused primarily on removing content it is time to focus on reducing mistakes simplifying our systems and getting back to our roots about giving people voice I m looking forward to

to Remove COVID Content In a Jan 10 interview on The Joe Rogan Experience Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said communications from the White House included demands to remove social media posts containing true information You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Biden administration officials would scream and curse at Facebook staff and demand they remove COVID 19 related posts that didn t toe the line on the government narrative Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Jan 10 interview on The Joe Rogan Experience The communications from the White House included demands to remove posts containing true information Zuckerberg said He said these actions broke the law and violated the First Amendment Zuckerberg made these revelations during a wide ranging three hour surprise interview on Rogan s podcast that has garnered over 6 5 million views on YouTube Zuckerberg appeared on the podcast days after he announced the end of Facebook s third party fact checking program He told Rogan he would seek to reestablish Facebook as a platform where free speech would be protected Biden wanted Meta to remove posts about vaccine side effects Zuckerberg spent much of the interview recounting the pressures from the White House to censor COVID 19 related content on Meta owned Facebook and Instagram The Biden administration basically pushed us and said anything that says that vaccines might have side effects you basically need to take down And I was just like Well we re not gonna do that Zuckerberg said Zuckerberg recalled that Biden administration officials were calling up the guys on our team and yelling at them and cursing and threatening repercussions if we don t take down things that are true He said Meta has documents containing these threats According to Zuckerberg early in the COVID 19 pandemic Meta deferred to government guidance relating to health measures because he was sympathetic to concerns regarding misinformation He said that this proved to be costly Since then I think generally trust in media has fallen off a cliff Zuckerberg said He blamed the mistrust on mixed messaging by the government and public health authorities regarding COVID 19 In the beginning it was like OK there aren t enough masks masks aren t that important to then Oh no you have to wear a mask everything was shifting around It just became very difficult to kind of follow Zuckerberg said Zuckerberg said demands from the Biden administration to censor posts grew after the COVID 19 vaccines were rolled out after which government officials began pressuring Meta super hard to remove

claiming that Facebook isn t killing people the so called Disinformation Dozen were These 12 people are out there giving misinformation Anyone listening to it is getting hurt by it It s killing people It s bad information Biden said according to Newsweek The Disinformation Dozen is a list of the 12 leading online anti vaxxers authored by the Center for Countering Digital Hate in 2021 Robert F

media won t write Please Donate Today Rogan Zuckerberg hold different views on COVID vaccines Zuckerberg told Rogan that even after Biden walked back his remarks White House officials and government agencies began pursuing Meta with brutal investigations He cited an example of content the White House wanted removed They wanted us to take down this meme of Leonardo DiCaprio looking at a TV talking about how 10 years from now or something you re gonna see an ad that says OK if you took a COVID vaccine you re eligible for this kind of payment this sort of like class action lawsuit type meme The Biden administration was like No you have to take that down And we just said No we re not gonna take down humor and satire Zuckerberg said he felt the Biden administration s goal to get everyone vaccinated was actually a good goal and that he is generally pretty pro rolling out vaccines Rogan said the White House sought to suppress content about COVID 19 vaccine injuries and alternative treatments because they didn t want people to think that you could get away with not taking the vaccine which is really crazy Zuckerberg argued that on balance it s good for more people to get the

can t have that without valid therapeutics being available And so they suppressed valid therapeutics Rogan said Despite his continued support for vaccines Zuckerberg said he felt the government ran afoul of the law and Constitution by attempting to censor online content I don t think that the government pushing for social media companies to censor stuff was legal the First Amendment does apply to the government Massive institutional pressure led Facebook to institute fact checking According to Zuckerberg government pressure on Facebook to censor content began in 2016 following Donald Trump s electoral victory that year and the referendum vote in favor of Brexit in the United Kingdom Zuckerberg said these two events resulted in massive institutional pressure on Facebook to institute fact checking Zuckerberg described the fact checking process as something out of 1984 and said that due to the pressure his platforms faced we made some choices that with the benefit of hindsight and new information we wouldn t make today Last week Zuckerberg announced that Facebook s fact checking program would be replaced with a model akin to X s Community Notes feature a move Biden subsequently criticized Zuckerberg said the previous fact checking model resulted in too many mistakes and too much censorship The announcement that Meta was ending its fact checking program came one day after CHD asked the U S Supreme Court to hear its censorship case against Meta In an op ed published last week by RealClearPolitics and the New York Post CHD CEO Mary Holland said Zuckerberg s admissions are not enough Meta first took action against CHD in May 2019 from takedowns and restrictions to an outright ban in August 2022 that is still in effect Holland said They not only kicked us off the platform but censored our supporters and erased our past posts Meta shut down the free expression they claim to be championing Holland noted that while the Biden administration pressured Meta to censor content the company also voluntarily engaged in such censorship Zuckerberg s WhatsApp messages showed that he conspired with the government and chose to censor because he had bigger fish to fry than protecting free speech Holland said CHD s legal effort against Meta would continue and expressed hope that the Supreme Court would accept the case writing that Meta like the other mega platforms must be held accountable", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:childrenshealthdefense.org_defender_zuckerberg-white-house-facebook-staff-remove-covid-content-joe-rogan.txt:2:33a6e27807c9",

die Anordnug einer Mutter and überstimmen und eine Impfung ihres Kindes anordnen kann fragte der medizinische Kommentator John Campbell Ph D kürzlich in einer Folge seiner YouTube Show Campbell sprach den jüngsten Rechtssieg einer britischen Mutter über den im Telegraph berichtet wurde Ihr behinderter 24 jähriger Sohn hatte eine Chromosomenanomalie die nach Ansicht von Experten ein erhöhtes Risiko für Herzschäden durch den COVID 19 Impfstoff mit sich brachte Im Jahr 2021 wollte die Mutter die unter dem Pseudonym Sarah auftritt nicht dass ihr Sohn Tom gegen COVID 19 geimpft wird da dies für Menschen mit seiner Erkrankung ein hohes Risiko darstellt Dennoch verlangten Ärzte und Sozialarbeiter dass er zum Wohle der Gesellschaft geimpft wird Nach einem dreijährigen Rechtsstreit bei dem Sarah ihre gesamten Ersparnisse in Höhe von 25 000 Pfund ausgab und zusätzlich 65 000 Pfund durch Crowdfunding aufbrachte gewann sie den Fall und konnte ihren Sohn vor der Impfung schützen Campbell sagte Sarah habe Recht als sie die Sache als kafkaesken Alptraum beschrieb denn in Franz Kafkas Romanen sehen sich die isolierten Protagonisten typischerweise mit bizarren oder surrealistischen Zwangslagen und unverständlichen sozio bürokratischen Mächten konfrontiert Als sie sich den staatlichen Anordnungen für ihren Sohn widersetzte wurde Sarah mit Gefängnis Verhaftung Vermögensbeschlagnahme und der Zwangsimpfung ihres Sohnes gedroht In den Augen des Staates sagte Sarah Ich wurde von einer liebevollen Mutter und Toms einziger Bezugsperson zu einer Beinahe Kriminellen Man hat mir das Gefühl gegeben ich sei eine Lügnerin ein schlechter Mensch und ein Fanatiker Ich wurde zu Unrecht beschuldigt eine Impfgegnerin zu sein nur weil ich in Frage stellte ob diese neue Gentherapie für meinen Sohn mit seinen komplexen Erkrankungen das Richtige sei Für mich war es der Staat der seine Politik fanatisch verfolgte indem er seine Macht auf mich ausübte die Macht des Staates gegen Sarah Tom schwer behindert wurde von seiner Mutter gepflegt Er war jedoch 18 Jahre alt als die Regierung beschloss die Schwächsten zu impfen Deshalb wurde ihm ein Anwalt zugewiesen der in seinem besten Interesse handelte und sich für die Impfung einsetzte Sarah kämpfte drei Jahre lang gegen den Fall Zunächst entschied ein Richter dass Tom geimpft werden sollte obwohl er einräumte dass das Gericht nicht in der Lage sei zu beurteilen ob die Impfstoffe sicher seien weil die Impfung altruistisch sei und von allen Bürgern verlangt werde Campbell sagte die Entscheidung ignoriere die spezifischen und persönlichen Risiken für Tom Ich hätte gedacht dass eine alternative Strategie für diesen Richter wäre auf Nummer sicher zu gehen aber was weiß ich schon Campbell", "chunk_id":

eine alternative Strategie für diesen Richter wäre auf Nummer sicher zu gehen aber was weiß ich schon Campbell sagte dass Menschen die von Trisomien wie Tom betroffen sind zu denen auch das Down Syndrom und das Edwards Syndrom gehören darüber informiert werden sollten dass Expertenaussagen während des Prozesses darauf hindeuten dass sie ein erhöhtes Risiko für Herzprobleme durch mRNA Produkte haben könnten Ein Berufungsrichter entschied diesen Monat dass dies angesichts der sich verändernden Landschaft des Virus und der zunehmenden Immunität nicht mehr in Toms bestem Interesse sei Campbell sagte die Schlussfolgerung des Gerichts sei problematisch weil sie die Möglichkeit offen lässt dass es während der Pandemie richtig gewesen wäre Tom zu impfen Das Urteil geht nicht wirklich auf den Kern der Sache ein sagte er Die unangenehme Tatsache dass der Staat eine Mutter zu etwas zwingt was sie ihrem Kind nicht antun will ist für mich das grundlegende Problem sagte er Auch wenn der Fall gut ausgegangen ist ändert das nichts an der Tatsache dass während der COVID 19 Pandemie grundlegende und geschätzte Prinzipien der medizinischen Ethik unter der Prämisse eines Notfalls missachtet

historic win for CHD the D C Court of Appeals found on Aug 13 2021 that the FCC failed to consider the non cancer evidence regarding adverse health effects of wireless technology Even though the current standards remain in place for now the court held that the FCC had failed to consider much less address the vast amount of scientific literature regarding the ubiquitous wireless environment and the cumulative effect of exposure from multiple RF sources the effects of sophisticated modulation and pulsation the particular vulnerabilities of children the negative impacts on nature and wildlife and how RF exposure impacts the brain and nervous system contributes to male infertility and causes Electrosensitivity oxidative stress and DNA damage The court tasked the FCC with providing a reasoned explanation for its determination that its guidelines adequately protect against harmful effects of exposure to radiofrequency radiation In 1996 the Federal Communications Commission FCC set regulatory guidelines not safety limits though they have often been perceived as such for radiofrequency RF emissions Since that time and in spite of five generations of advancement in wireless technology those limits have remained the same for over a quarter of a century These guidelines now apply to devices and facilities that were not even in existence in 1996 wireless devices like smartphones and tablets carrier small cells Wi Fi routers and smart meters The FCC s 1996 guidelines only aim to protect consumers from thermal effects temperature change in living tissue They completely ignore evidence of harms from RF radiation at non thermal levels even though there is a clear biological response In 2012 the federal watchdog Government Accountability Office GAO issued a report suggesting the FCC s RF energy exposure limit may not reflect the latest research and testing requirements may not identify maximum exposure in all possible usage conditions It was because of this report that the FCC published an inquiry in 2013 to decide whether the guidelines should be reviewed It opened Docket 13 84 for the public to file comments Thousands of scientific studies and opinions were submitted over the next nine years On April 24 2019 a letter was written by the U S Food and Drug Administration s FDA Dr Jeffrey Shuren director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health CDRH This letter gave the FCC the green light on its current guidelines by indicating that the present regulatory limits were sufficient to cover health concerns by stating no changes to the current standards are warranted at this time the available scientific evidence to date does not support adverse health effects in humans due to exposures at or under the current limits

historic case was filed by CHD on Feb 2 2020 CHD challenged the agency s decision to retain its 25 year old RF emissions guidelines The lawsuit called a Petition for Review contended the FCC s decision was arbitrary capricious not evidence based an abuse of discretion and in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act APA The Court consolidated cases filed by Environmental Health Trust headed by legal counsel Edward Myers and the Children s Health Defense led by attorneys Robert F Kennedy Jr and W Scott McCollough The organizations filed joint briefs in the case The petitioners in the case filed 11 000 pages of evidence of harm from 5G and wireless technology which the FCC ignored including evidence of already existing widespread sickness The case was argued before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington D C on Jan 25 2021 by CHD lead counsel W Scott McCollough The U S Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit published its decision on Aug 13 2021 The court ruled that the FCC failed to consider the non cancer evidence regarding adverse health effects of wireless technology The court s judgment stated The case is remanded to the commission to provide a reasoned explanation for its determination that its guidelines adequately protect against harmful effects of exposure to radiofrequency radiation CHD Chairman and attorney on the case Robert F Kennedy Jr said The court s decision exposes the FCC and FDA as captive agencies that have abandoned their duty to protect public health in favor of a single minded crusade to increase telecom industry profits CHD s lead attorney for the case Scott McCollough a telecommunication and administrative law attorney who represented the petitioners in the hearing said This is an historic win The FCC will have to re open the proceeding and for the first time meaningfully and responsibly confront the vast amount of scientific and medical evidence showing that current guidelines do not adequately protect health and the

four decades the telecommunications industry has influenced regulatory agencies on a global scale to set regulatory limits which are not necessarily safety limits that favor the advancement of telecom objectives over the safety of the public The Federal Communications Commission FCC and International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection ICNIRP have come under increasing criticism for their ties to the telecommunications industry both in the U S and throughout Europe The FCC is known to have a revolving door where people who have worked within the telecommunications industry and even those who have headed the industry s lobby the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association CTIA have gone over to the FCC as Chairman The FCC openly states they are not a health agency yet they are in charge of regulating radiofrequency RF emissions from cell towers The FCC will state that they rely on the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA yet the FDA does no RF radiation

limits exactly where they are even in the face of the 4G 5G infrastructure buildout which increases the number of towers and shortens the distance between the towers and where people live work and go

smartphones Wi Fi smart meters and likely living near cell towers are probably unaware that the federal government s guidelines are solely based on up to 30 minutes of exposure On paper the FDA serves in an oversight role for the FCC and is responsible for protecting and promoting public health For example the FDA has the authority to take action if they have evidence that a wireless device such as a cell phone emits levels of RF radiation that are hazardous to the user Because cell phones were never premarket tested by the FDA there is justifiable concern regarding their safety The FCC sets limits on the emissions of radiofrequency radiation by cell phones and other wireless technologies including fixed wireless infrastructure such as cell towers which they claim were developed to protect the public from RF related health risks In spite of the ubiquity of wireless devices it seems counterintuitive or perhaps even reckless that the FCC clearly states that they do not have the expertise to set standards In fact they do not refer to the regulatory limits as standards but simply as guidelines There is legitimate concern that the standard setting bodies are closely aligned with the telecommunications industry They have failed to take decades of military and independently funded science regarding the risks of RF radiation into consideration Both the FCC and the FDA supported by the telecommunications industry embrace the regulatory framework that acknowledges only thermal effects Learn more about the relevant acts and zoning laws There are two acts that serve to regulate the telecommunications industry the Communications Act of 1934 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 The 1934 Act created the governing body of the FCC and it is now the FCC that adopts additional rules and regulations The Telecommunications Act of 1996 laid the foundation for the present cell tower infrastructure that has been built out across the U S over the last 25 years Local governments regulate zoning rights of way and wireless tower siting Over the last five years approximately 20 states adopted their own 5G bills and then the FCC covered the remaining 30 states with

imposed on the authority of local and municipal governments over permitting and regulation of wireless facilities Not only are local municipalities forced to lease the public rights of way to wireless carriers the amount of fees that can be charged for placement of small wireless facilities in public rights of way has been capped as well Small wireless facilities also known as small cells are structures either less than 50 feet in height or no more than 10 taller than other nearby structures They support small antennas and related equipment Federal state or local authorities can initiate policy changes When the FCC sets rules it overrides any conflicting state or local laws or requirements The FCC sets rules through a notice and comment process All final FCC rules are subject to review in federal courts of appeal State Public Utilities Commissions adopt rules similarly those processes vary from state to state Ignoring Nonthermal Effects Both bodies ignore the thousands of studies that clearly demonstrate the flaw in relying on the assumption that thermal tissue heating is the only potential mechanism of harm because it ignores fundamental physical interactions and relies on tests that have little resemblance to real world wireless environments While the limits do not acknowledge nonthermal effects the FCC and FDA continue to insist that their guidelines last updated in 1996 are appropriate to follow As a prime example the FCC recently adopted rules that permit the beam power from 5G base stations to be tens to hundreds of times more powerful than the levels permitted for non 5G base stations In reality neither agency wants to enact meaningful biologically based standards since doing so would necessarily slow or impede the rush to ubiquitous wireless So the FCC relies on informal conclusory FDA assertions that current limits are safe and the FDA then points to the FCC s regulations as a justification to not exercise its own regulatory mandate CHD s Historic Win Against the FCC In a lawsuit won by Children s Health Defense the Court of Appeals for the D C Circuit recently concluded that neither the FCC nor the FDA had engaged in

EMFs from power lines Accelerating 5G Deployment In 2018 the FCC adopted rules to accelerate the wireless infrastructure review process to facilitate the deployment of 5G throughout the U S By the time these rules became effective in July 2018 the FCC and the telecommunications industry were experiencing significant pushback from cities counties and citizens That opposition particularly from residents who do not want cell towers in their neighborhoods continues to this day and CHD is committed to supporting these efforts Health concerns about RF radiation have never been legal means for opposing cell towers The telecommunications Act of 1996 specifically Section 704 forbade local zoning authorities from denying a tower based on RF concerns This was not because the FCC had proved that RF radiation was safe at the guidelines they established The truth was quite the opposite in spite of claims on multiple federal agency websites There was heavy telecommunications lobbying in 1996 when the Act was passed Telecommunications carriers knew health concerns would be their biggest obstacle to the infrastructure buildout so they eliminated that obstacle in Section 704 Yet two decades later the deployment of 5G removed even more obstacles to the 5G rollout by forcing cities and counties to lease out their public rights of way to wireless carriers placing some small cells the

finds that 5G networks introduce new modes of cyberattack and expands the potential for points of attack Additionally it finds that 5G does not eliminate existing concerns around supply chains for network hardware Regarding privacy the report finds that 5G networks will exacerbate existing privacy concerns by introducing new kinds of user data including more precise location data European Union Regulatory Framework In the European Union the main regulatory bodies are the European Parliament the Council of the European Union and the European Commission While EU Member States are responsible for protecting the public health of the population from the effects of electromagnetic fields through national regulatory authorities the guidelines adopted by EU Member States regarding exposure to non ionizing EMFs are primarily based on the guidelines of ICNIRP a German based nonprofit comprised largely of telecommunications friendly members The ICNIRP guidelines were updated in 2020 and provide exposure guidelines for RF EMFs between 100 kHz and 300 GHz Since 1998 ICNIRP has maintained its position that There is no evidence of adverse health effects at exposure levels below the restriction levels in the ICNIRP 1998 guidelines and no evidence of an interaction mechanism that would predict that adverse health effects could occur due to radiofrequency EMF exposure below those restriction levels Read More Most European countries and Australia rely on the guidelines formulated by ICNIRP though not exclusively Italy Switzerland and Bulgaria have implemented national standards that are more protective than those promulgated by ICNIRP Regarding 5G while policies and regulations are generally adopted at the national level the EU plays a coordinating role in the deployment of 5G in Europe ICNIRP like the FCC and the FDA protects only from thermal effects of RF radiation thereby excluding a large body of published science that demonstrates non thermal effects In July 2016

reproduction and development may occur upon exposure to 5G MMW or to exclude the possibility of some synergistic interactions between 5G and other frequencies that are already being used This makes the introduction of 5G fraught with uncertainty concerning both health issues and forecasting monitoring the actual exposure of the population these gaps in knowledge are invoked to justify the call for a moratorium on 5G MMW pending adequate research being completed The report s conclusion carries a very clear warning Implementing MMW 5G technology without further preventive studies would mean

5G MMW pending adequate research being completed The report s conclusion carries a very clear warning Implementing MMW 5G technology without further preventive studies would mean conducting an experiment on the human population in complete uncertainty as to the consequences An esteemed fellow at the Ramazzini Institute Belpoggi s call for a moratorium appears grounded in solid research well articulated and yet resoundingly ignored In the worlds of science and medicine scientific studies and investigation are intended to precede policies In the world of telecommunications historically the infrastructure buildout precedes science Policy Recommendations The report makes several important policy recommendations including Adopting stricter RFR limits for mobile phone devices and reducing RFR exposure with devices that emit lower energy and if possible only working when at a certain distance from the body Revisiting RFR exposure limits for the public and the environment in order to reduce RF EMF exposure from cell towers through more stringent limits such as those used in Italy Switzerland China and Russia all of which are significantly lower than those recommended by ICNIRP and the FCC Adopting measures to incentivize the reduction of RF EMF exposure which include using fiber optic cables to connect schools libraries workplaces houses public buildings and all new buildings etc Public gathering places could be no RF EMF areas along the lines of no smoking areas so as to avoid the passive exposure of people not using a mobile phone or long range transmission technology thus protecting many vulnerable elderly or immune compromised people children and those who are electro sensitive Promoting a multidisciplinary scientific research effort to assess the long term health effects of 5G MMW in order to rule out the risk that tumors and adverse effects on reproduction and development may occur upon exposure to 5G MMW and to exclude the possibility of synergistic interactions between 5G MMW networks and other frequencies and networks that are already being used Research is needed on the biological effects of 5G MMW at frequencies between 6 and 300 GHz not only for humans but also for the flora and fauna of the environment e g non human vertebrates plants fungi and invertebrates Promoting research to identify an adequate method of monitoring exposure to 5G because there is currently inadequate monitoring of the actual exposure of the population Promoting a public educational awareness campaign on the potential harms of RFR at all levels beginning with schools This campaign should include the potential health risks opportunities for digital development safer infrastructure alternatives and strategies to reduce exposure to wireless phones European

the 5G buildout started occurring in neighborhoods and towns throughout Europe The general public had no reason to believe that 5G was safe Cell towers in front of their homes and children s schools caused significant backlash in the majority of European countries People took to the streets in countries like Switzerland over fears that radiation from the antennas that carry the next generation mobile technology culminating in a countrywide moratorium in September 2019 By February 2020 Switzerland denied a countrywide moratorium though cantons in many Swiss cities called for local moratoria Read More By October 2020 the growing anti 5G movement was getting in the way of Europe s digital ambitions Some 15 capitals warned the EU Commission of the need for a robust strategy to counter rapidly growing concerns about new technology The promise of 5G remains vague and the benefit to the vast majority of residents remains nebulous However the concern about the health risks of this experimental technology remains extremely high Nonetheless the momentum among European leaders and the telecom industry to build out the 5G infrastructure has continued for the most part undeterred The laws were already in place for the small cell buildout in all EU Member States The 5G Action Plan for Europe was well orchestrated and uniformly applied Yet the glaring omission of any data from any country exonerating the risks from 5G an advanced technology that uses either the microwave or millimeter wave depending upon the carrier and location is an undeniable and deliberate omission 5G Deployment in Europe The European Commission had been playing an active role in developing the EU s overall strategy and designing EU policies regarding 5G These policies have been in the works for many years In 2016 the Commission adopted a 5G Action Plan for Europe to ensure the rapid deployment of 5G infrastructure across Europe The action plan objective was to launch 5G services in all EU Member States by the end of 2020 at the latest Following this the action plan suggested a rapid build up to ensure uninterrupted 5G coverage in urban areas and along main transportation routes by 2025 In 2020 the Commission adopted the Implementing Regulation on small antennas which specifies the physical and technical characteristics of small cells for 5G networks and aims to accelerate 5G network

policymakers may have succumbed in part to a major campaign to convince governments that the economy and jobs will be strongly stimulated by 5G deployment According to an in depth 2019 analysis 5G Deployment prepared at the request of the Committee on Industry Research and Energy a committee of the European Parliament the EU has yet to see a significant demand pull that could assure sales The concept of a race is part of the campaign but it is becoming clear that the technology will take much longer than earlier generations to perfect China according to the report sees 5G as at least a 10 year program to become fully working and nationally implemented This is because the technologies involved with 5G are much more complex than their predecessors 3G and 4G One troubling concern that is not well understood according to the report is the unpredictable propagation patterns that could result in unacceptable levels of human exposure to electromagnetic radiation European Gigabit Society The technological goals for Europe as captured by the European Parliamentary Research Service EPRS are The fifth generation of telecommunications technologies 5G is fundamental to achieving a European gigabit society by 2025 The aim to cover all urban areas railways and major roads with uninterrupted fifth generation wireless communication can only be achieved by creating a very dense network of antennas and transmitters In other words the number of higher frequency base stations and other devices will increase significantly The real substance of what 5G is about in the EU is seen in the Effects of 5G wireless communication on human health It states The Commission has established the following connectivity targets for 2025 Schools universities research centers hospitals main providers of public services and digitally intensive enterprises should have access to internet download upload speeds of one gigabit of data per second Urban and rural households should have access to connectivity of download speed of at least 100 megabits per second Urban areas major roads and railways should have uninterrupted 5G coverage Yet with regards to the same report This raises the

addressed the constant exposure that 5G would introduce Accordingly a section of the scientific community considers that more research on the potential negative biological effects of electromagnetic fields EMF and 5G is needed notably on the incidence of some serious human diseases A further consideration is the need to bring together researchers from different disciplines in particular medicine and physics or engineering to conduct further research into the effects of 5G A call for more research is a common refrain that is frequently issued to allay public concern as telecom proceeds to build out the latest infrastructure with a green light aided by government regulated policies that make it nearly impossible for citizens to object to 5G towers literally being erected in their front yards 5G Public Private Partnership and 1000x Higher Wireless Capacity in 10 Years To really understand 5G in Europe you need to look at the 5G Action Plan as it relates to the following The EU 5G public private partnership 5G PPP offers insight into the connection between government and the telecommunications industry It is a joint initiative between the European Commission and European Information and Communications Technology industry that aims to deliver solutions architectures technologies and standards for the ubiquitous next generation communication infrastructures of the coming decade According to the 5G PPP one of its main objectives is Providing 1000 times higher wireless area capacity and more varied service capabilities compared to 2010 5G and Cybersecurity A 5G network that wirelessly connects billions of Internet of Things devices and critical infrastructure systems both broadens and deepens the potential impact of cyberattacks In a technical report the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity ENISA has identified the major cybersecurity threats targeting new generations of mobile networks such as 5G According to the report these threats include eavesdropping interception hijacking disasters unintentional damages outages failures malfunctions legal threats and physical attacks Additionally in 2019 the European Parliament passed resolutions regarding cybersecurity and in the same year the European Council adopted conclusions on the significance of 5G to the European economy and the need to mitigate security risks linked to 5G Unanswered Questions The public s realization that 5G was actually a 4G 5G infrastructure in some instances literally a few feet from bedroom windows dawned after the public private partnership had been set in
