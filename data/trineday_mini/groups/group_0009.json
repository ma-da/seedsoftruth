And as Ernie considered his options, they looked the other way, and threw him like a piece of meat to Hoover’s dogs.” “Once, when he was drinking,” Dave said, “Gregory started to talk about hating Ernest, accusing him of killing his mother.” Dave at this time was still visiting Dr. Joe Davis, the famous pathologist in Miami who ran Miami’s autopsy center. He said Gregory had attended some of ‘Dr. Joe’s’ casual seminars at the morgue, which were open to anyone who came. Dave had gained expertise in analyzing autopsy reports by visiting Dr. Joe’s morgue whenever he could. Dr. Joe, Dave told me, could figure out most crime scenes. word meant he had to get out. The State Department then pressed for action on his request to re-enter the USA without getting arrested. Lee said he was so low on the totem pole that he’d been left behind when the Kennedy Administration took over. CIA did not want JFK’s people to know all their little secrets. “Studies in Intelligence,” Vol. 56, No. 2 (June, 2012), a CIA publication, stated that though agencies such as the OSS had considered Hemingway’s requests to become a spy, the Bronze Star award winner and intrepid war correspondent had always been turned down. “Ernest Hemingway,” the CIA journal concludes, “may have wanted to be a spy, but he never lived up to his potential.”28 The Guardian, 3 July 2011: “Hemingway’s friend and collaborator over the last 13 years of his life suggests that what was dismissed as a paranoid delusion of the Nobel prize-winning writer was, in fact, true: Hemingway was aware of his long surveillance by J Edgar Hoover’s FBI, who were suspicious of his links with Cuba, and it may have helped push him to the brink.”29 Michael T. Griffith: One of Shaw’s close friends was right-wing extremist Alton Ochsner. Ochsner openly admired the writings of Wilmot Robertson, who called upon citizens of Northern European extraction to take control of America from usurping racial minorities because Northern Europeans were genetically superior to minorities. Ochsner was involved in several radical right-wing organizations.30 In a 1994 interview, Dan Campbell, who worked for right-wing extremist Guy Banister, said Shaw was involved with Banister in a gun running operation to the Alpha 66 Cuban exiles in Miami…. [also] A CIA document reports that Shaw and his ITM associate Mario Bermudez traveled together to Cuba in 1959 on a gun-smuggling operation.”3 Dr. Alton Ochsner Reviews His Tragic Trust in Doctors Dr. Ochsner is a violently anti-Castro conservative with friendshipsextending from Richard Nixon to oil magnate Clint Murchison. He resents the fact that Castro is now sending “his” medical students to the USSR instead of to Ochsner Clinic for training. A number of Ochsner-trained Cuban doctors agree with him.

Since then, Ochsner and Sherman have been on a quest, using radiation to mutate the viruses they’ve found in the polio vaccines, in an attempt to make the vaccine safer. It seems impossible to be certain that the contamination can be stopped any other way. Eventually, they discover a cancer-causing virus of such potency that Ochsner considers its candidacy as a biological weapon. Arcacha Smith: …the FRD … was to front for the effort of the CIA to reinstate democratic government in Cuba. The effort of April 17 failed, as you know. Thereafter, the morale of the Cubans in exile and the Underground within Cuba fell to zero. Then along came Captain Ferrie. He strongly prodded our whole organization until it was revitalized…. Through him we’ve been able to get the best advice in affairs political, economic and mil- Another part of the letter continued: …Since events are approaching a climax we sorely need his advice on a day to day basis. Knowing your own often demonstrated patriotism, we are requesting that Captain Ferrie be given either a 60 or 90 day leave with pay so that the work at hand can be completed…. Dan Campbell, an ex-Marine that worked for Banister infiltrating left-wing groups on college campuses confirmed the gunrunning, recalling that “Banister was a bagman for the CIA and was running guns to Alpha 66 in Miami.” Campbell also assisted Banister in small arms training for the Cubans and received $50 per week for his services. Campbell’s recollection of Banister is telling. He describes Banister as “one of the most frighteningly violent persons I have ever known.” Dave’s Anti-Kennedy Speech: “He Ought to Be Shot”On Monday, July 24 at 7:00 pm, David lectures the newly formed first meeting. “Captain D.

In [this] speech, Ferrie attacked President Kennedy for refusing to provide air support to the Bay of Pigs invasion force of Cuban exiles…. Ferrie admitted to the [FBI] after the assassination, that when speaking about Kennedy, he might have used the expression: “He ought to be shot.” Ferrie insisted, however, that these words were just “an off-hand or colloquial expression.” 1.

DAVID ATLEE PHILLIPS: WH/C 67-336 MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI/R & A SUBJECT: Garrison Investigation: Belle Chasse Training Camp REFERENCE: CI/ R & A Memorandum Dated October 26, 1967 (emphasis by author) 1. Listed below is the information pertaining to the Belle Chasse training camp which was requested in reference memorandum. a. The training site was activated on February 18, 1961 and the first group of trainees arrived on February 18, 1961. b. The site was located eight miles from New Orleans at the U.S. Naval Ammunition Depot which had been inactive for five years. c. The site covered 3,500 acres of marshlands adjoining the Mississippi River. The depot consisted of ammunition magazines storage areas, warehouses, various frame and brick buildings, many miles of interlocking railroad tracks and both hard surface and improved roads and the entire site was enclosed by a chain link fence. Since much of the terrain was inaccessible and unsuitable for training purposes, due to the marshy ground and poi- sonous reptiles, a limited area was used for actual training purposes. This area was located where the activity could neither be heard no observed. The base closed on April 21, 1961, and the training site was completely sterilized", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:62:5b33a43cffc2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5412, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "miles of interlocking railroad tracks and both hard surface and improved roads and the entire site was enclosed by a chain link fence. Since much of the terrain was inaccessible and unsuitable for training purposes, due to the marshy ground and poi- sonous reptiles, a limited area was used for actual training purposes. This area was located where the activity could neither be heard no observed. The base closed on April 21, 1961, and the training site was completely sterilized by Base and cleared Navy personnel after all demolition, ammunition, ordnance items, and field equipment was sterilized and air-lifted to a Midwest depot. Material on loan from the military was restored to original condition and returned to the appropriate military component. e. Approximately 300 Cubans were trained at the site over a six week period. The only known list of trainees which was available at Headquarters has not been located to date. A search has been initiated for this list. f. The training consisted of weapons firing, demolition, guerrilla warfare, communications, UDT, etc. One group was trained as a strike force assault battalion and was sent to Guatemala on March 22, 1961, to join the Bay of Pigs invasion strike force. g. The training camp location never came to public knowledge through press media. However, the New York Times and New Orleans radio and television stations reported that a Cuban training camp was located outside of New Orleans… high level military and Louisiana officials… denied knowledge of such a camp and the site was not identified… [a] representative of a leading T.V. station appeared at the main gate of the installation and requested permission to enter and take pictures. Naval authorities denied permission and there were no further inquiries. The actual training site was quite some distance from the main gates… h. The training camp was entirely Agency controlled and the training was conducted by Agency personnel. 2. During the initial phase of activation, the depot was sterilized to avoid any indication of government interest and to prevent disclosure of actual physical location of training camp to newly assigned trainees. For example, all U.S. Navy references on boxcars, buildings, etc. were painted out or destroyed. Although the first group of trainees transferred to the base from Florida knew they were going to an abandoned ammunition depot located near New Orleans, maximum precautions were taken to insure that the site location could not be pinpointed while the trainees were being transported from the airport to the camp. Despite all precautions, one incident occurred that is significant in view of the recent publication naming the Belle Chasse camp. One night, a group of trainees arriving at the Moisant Airport from Miami, were observed by Orlando Piedra, the former Chief of the Bureau of Investigation during the Batista regime.

One night, a group of trainees arriving at the Moisant Airport from Miami, were observed by Orlando Piedra, the former Chief of the Bureau of Investigation during the Batista regime. Piedra obtained the license numbers of the rental vehicles used for transporting the trainees to the camp. His license number was likewise observed by our security officer at the scene. Piedra, who is one of the individuals included in the CI R&A memorandum dated September 15, 1967 (page 3-item 21), and memorandum #5 (paragraph 4-J) may be the individual who provided the information contained in the recent publication. In any event, it would be surprising indeed of some of the 300 trainees involved have not discussed their training activities in detail over the past six years. With the clue that the camp was located at an abandoned Navy ammunition depot outside New Orleans, a long-time resident such as Piedra, Arcacha Smith, Fowler, or LaBorde, would eventually be able to narrow down the location despite the extreme security precautions that were in effect during the training period. Although only the commanding officers of the ammunition depot and Naval Air Station were knowledgeable of the activities on the grounds, an enterprising reporter or investigator could probably surface other corroborating bits of information which would help identify the training site. For example, despite the fact the majority of supplies and equipment was procured through Navy facilities, certain items were necessarily purchased on the local market, thereby producing a sudden influx of cash in an area that had been dormant for five years. In any event, although the Garrison investigation may eventually lead to identifying the site as a government installation, there has never been any evidence or publicity identifying the Agency as the actual operators of the training camp. 3.

Sheehan continues, in his deposition: “The supervisor of ‘Operation Mongoose’ was, then 34-year-old, Theodore Shackley.

Here is a truncated record from Eastern Air Lines files of the “Minutes of The New Orleans Chapter of the Military Order of the World Wars:” “The Chapter held its regular meeting at Lenfant’s Boulevard Room, 5236 Canal Boulevard, on 24 July 1961.” (This is a Monday, at 7 : 00 PM .) “The meeting was called to order at 1900 hours. PRESIDING: Rear Adm. T. J. Ryan, Jr. PLEDGE: Capt. Gayle Schneidau, Jr. PREAMBLE: Capt. Francis Grevemberg. INVOCA-TION: Col. Lansing L. Mitchell…. There were 70 members and 5 guests present.” [Minutes were read and business conducted, including a Flag project and incorporation protocol, all of this taking an estimated one hour] “…The speaker of the evening, Captain D. W. Ferrie, Senior Pilot, Eastern Airlines, spoke on Cuba, April 1961, Present, Future. At the opening of his presentation, he indicated his talk would be controversial. When partly through the presentation, the Commander rose, apologized for interrupting the speaker, and told him the tenor of his remarks, up to that point, were contrary to the preamble and objectives for which the Military Order…stands and that if he wished he could speak not as our guest speaker, but as a private citizen and to the members Perry Russo reports in the Kirkwood’s transcript, about David’s weekly Black Masses: “The chalice featured animal blood, the wafer consisted of some kind of raw flesh, instead of cake or bread. He wore a little black toga, solid black. He wore nothing underneath it…. he called it the American Eastern Catholic Orthodox Church … the ritual … it’s a brutal thing, a sadistic quality to it – bloodletting, chicken killing, stuff like that …” Peter Levenda (author/occult specialist): Russo’s characterization of Ferrie’s Black Mass sounds more like Voudoun or Santeria than it does Satanism, and one wishes that Russo had paid a lot more attention – or [that] Kirkwood had published the transcript of his interview in full – so that we can trace the elements of Ferrie’s ritual to a known progenitor …2 Perry Russo: (from Clay Shaw preliminary hearing, Kemp transcript) “Ferrie had shown me that he had received, I think, a doctorate of Psychology, he had received a medical degree that he could practice, and three other degrees … and in his house … out", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:66:d5d6bae3827c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5416, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "Russo had paid a lot more attention – or [that] Kirkwood had published the transcript of his interview in full – so that we can trace the elements of Ferrie’s ritual to a known progenitor …2 Perry Russo: (from Clay Shaw preliminary hearing, Kemp transcript) “Ferrie had shown me that he had received, I think, a doctorate of Psychology, he had received a medical degree that he could practice, and three other degrees … and in his house … out near the Kenner area or the Metairie area, he had surgery equipment which was kept very clean and things like that … he gave us a demonstration in hypnotism at that time. Now, later on in talking to Al, Al Landry, Al told me that Ferrie had used hypnotism on the members of the Civil Air Patrol when he was making aggressions – sexual aggressions on them.”3 D ne day Dave brought out three rings to show me: an aquamarine ring that he said belonged to his mother, a small ruby ring that glowed purple under ultraviolet light, and one carved with an ugly mythological creature. “This is my priestly ring,” he said. “I use it for black magic. And Satanic rituals.” “Of course not,” Dave replied. “When I say a Mass, and sometimes I do say Mass, it isn’t a Black Mass. I’m not a son of Satan, so I wouldn’t wear that thing. I love God. But I use things like this to penetrate religious cults. I can go into certain places around here with that ring on, and they think I’m one of them.” “You have to believe in God!” he insisted, putting his face close to mine. “Dammit, God’s real! Christ knows, I offered my life up – just like you – and just like you, God turned me down. But unlike you, I kept trying. I went to séances, sat in haunted houses, tried channeling. I did all the hocus-pocus. I got in with priests who said Black Masses. They were heading for hell. This last year or so, I finally gave up. That’s when God proved “He” was real to me.” “It was just God,” Dave replied. “Nothing dramatic. Walking in, like a whisper, when I couldn’t take it anymore. And I realized He was real. That He cared. And I didn’t deserve it.” Dave paused. He was drinking beer and smoking cigarettes. Apparently God didn’t mind what a bad job Dave was doing, taking care of his body. “J,” Dave went on, “You don’t have what I’ve got. You don’t know if you’re going to end up OK. All you have is the emptiness. I know, because I’ve been there.” “I don’t mean I’ve exorcised all my inner demons yet,” Dave admitted. “But at least I know He’s real, and I accept Him – right here.” Dave tapped at his chest.

This emotional argument left me cold, so then Dave began a long harangue based on science and philosophy. He argued that Lee and I should take the route Blaise Pascal took: that it’s better to be a good person and assume God exists, and live a life devoid of evil, than to offend the only hope out there; that the chance, in such a vast universe, of a Super Being out there, was too big to ignore. That evil can’t last, as it is self-destructive, with fatal flaws. Throughout this amazing discourse on God and ethics and morals, Dave sprinkled his argument with words of profanity. Dave said he got involved in the occult while investigating Santeria for an un-named Agency. He showed me his “priestly ring” – given to him, he said, because he was a consecrated Bishop. He said this “priestly ring” was so ugly that some people thought it was Satanic – which helped him get better access to certain religious cults. I saw the ring twice, briefly. Imagine my surprise to find, in 2013, symbols related to Dave’s church that reminded me of that ring. Dave said he almost never wore the ring. I now believe it was a signet ring from the American Orthodox Church, with the double-headed eagle on it. Dave had removed this ring when he conducted a Roman Catholic Mass, a portion of which I witnessed – a standard Low Mass. Dave had explained that the ring was too evil, in his mind, to wear for a Roman Catholic Mass. As for vestments, I saw what Dave had in his bedroom closet, because I kept an emergency yellow dress there, in case of a lab accident. I also saw a dress that did not belong to me. Dave had the usual Roman Catholic Church style priest’s vestments and a black clerical gown, all ordinary.

Then, an authority on the matter, occult expert Peter Levenda, (author of Sinister Forces) answered Perry: “You mention that David Ferrie was not a bishop in the Old Roman Catholic Church, and that there were very few bishops in that organization anyway. That may be true so far as it goes, but … the claim that the Old Roman Catholic Church had few bishops is a bit misleading. “There are several Old Catholic denominations, and others that share an Old Catholic line of succession but which are not, themselves, Old Catholic. Like most churches of the independent movement, many of these had rather more bishops than congregants … in all fairness, bishops of the ORCC did participate in the consecrations of bishops from other denominations, thus giving rise to even further confusion. If a bishop of the ORCC assists in the consecration of a bishop of the AOCC – as happened more than once – then is that newly-consecrated bishop a “member” of the ORCC or the AOCC, or both? Or neither?” I appreciated Levenda’s remarks, which cleared up for me why Dave had a ring I now believe had significance in the American Orthodox Catholic Church. Perhaps Dave mentioned his standing in the Old Roman Catholic Church to me because I had been a Roman Catholic, and because of the name, would not see it as too ‘far out’ – as simple as that. Peter Levenda: His consecration by (Bishop Carl) Stanley – of the American Orthodox Catholic Church … can be in no doubt; that there may have been others, though, is entirely within the realm of possibility. I would have dearly loved to watch “Bishop” Ferrie celebrate the Orthodox Divine Liturgy, though! What a surreal experience that would have been.5 Dave said he and Jack Martin had been involved in investigating weird churches. For $5.00 an applicant could get ordained. But there’s a dark thread of sado-masochism that runs through the lives of Clay Shaw and David Ferrie, perhaps linked to religious beliefs that tormented them. In the 60s, homosexuality still had to be kept in the closet. Dave resented being “terrorized,” as he put it, by local police concerning his being accused of “crimes against nature.” Stephen Roy (2005, Education Forum, to Parker): The group Martin and Ferrie were associated with was the “Byzantine Primitive Catholic Church, Old Catholic Church in N.A., Apostolic, Orthodox, Catholic, Order of Saint John,” according to the consecration certificates. The group Ferrie alone was associated with was the “Society of the Domestic Missionaries of Saint Basil the Great,” according to his membership card.” In 1962-1963", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:69:217c044a2074", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5419, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 70, "text": "“terrorized,” as he put it, by local police concerning his being accused of “crimes against nature.” Stephen Roy (2005, Education Forum, to Parker): The group Martin and Ferrie were associated with was the “Byzantine Primitive Catholic Church, Old Catholic Church in N.A., Apostolic, Orthodox, Catholic, Order of Saint John,” according to the consecration certificates. The group Ferrie alone was associated with was the “Society of the Domestic Missionaries of Saint Basil the Great,” according to his membership card.” In 1962-1963 David Ferrie made seven long distance phone calls from New Orleans to an unlisted number belonging to Earl Anglin Lawrence James, a bishop in the Old Roman Catholic Church of North America. In 1967, when Garrison tracked him down, a frightened Earl Anglin James said he had never been in Louisiana and that he was being smeared because he was a bishop in an unpopular church. July 1961: David is ordained as a Bishop by Bishop Carl Stanley of the America Orthodox Catholic Church. Dave, who had been investigating the various sects springing from the AOCC, along with Jack Martin, became convinced that the AOCC, as an offspring of the old Roman Catholic Church, was not heretical. It was David’s chance to finally hold a “legitimate” priesthood. Peter Levenda: Stanley [was] himself a convicted felon with a long rap … Ferrie’s credentials were vouched for by another bishop, one quite well-known for his support of a ministry outreach to homosexuals…. That he was a priest and a bishop at some point in his life is beyond question. That he was “self-ordained” is, in my view, erroneous. He was definitely ordained and consecrated by others.8 July 25-26: The Cuban government releases the plane’s passengers and five crew-members. They are flown to Miami on a Pan American Airways plane. Oquendo stays in Cuba. On July 26 Castro offers to return the hijacked plane if Cuban planes hijacked to the United States are returned. Secretary of State Rusk rejects the offer on July 27. he name ‘Oswald’ (no ‘Lee’ or ‘Harvey’ is written) – has been used to try to “prove” a “Lee” was in New Orleans while a “Harvey” was in the Marines. Jim Garrison had an interesting theory about that: Kerry Thornley was impersonating Lee Harvey Oswald, using the name “Oswald” at the Bolton Ford Company at the same time he was writing about Lee as the main character in his book Idle Warriors. Garrison wrote that Thornley was “… one of the few men in the world who was in New Orleans around the time, who knew Lee Oswald, and who knew Oswald was in Russia. In addition, Thornley bore a striking resemblance to Oswald. They were of approximately the same height and slight build, both brown-haired and had similar facial features.” Thornley claimed he never saw Lee after 1959, but many witnesses knew otherwise.

Garrison proposed that Thornley had posed as Lee in New Orleans when he lived there. Kerry would later say he had been programmed in a MK-ULTRA mind control project at Atsugi. His character assassination of Lee Oswald was thorough. The Warren Commission got thirty-three pages of testimony from Thornley (Thornley was the only Marine among the many who were interviewed who said Lee had mental problems, and that he claimed to be a Marxist). Lee and I met Kerry Thornley on May 8, 1963, at Lee Circle, when he came loping across the Circle to show off his new Polaroid camera to Lee. He thought I was Lee’s wife because we were strolling arm-in-arm, but Lee set him straight. Kerry and Lee were obviously friends: Lee promised to go play pool with him. Not much later, they had a falling out over Lee thinking Kerry was getting too familiar with his wife (this was never fully able to be verified, because I didn’t want to bring up the subject and upset Lee over it). Kerry soon left for California, swearing he would rewrite his book to blacken Lee’s name “forever.” Dave’s Ferrie’s Relationship with Margaret Martens Margaret Martens, Layton Martens’ mother, fell in love with university student and roller-skating champion. Martens, despite his youth, was closely involved with Dave and Arcacha Smith in anti-Castro activities, including a patriotic raid on a Schlumberger bunker, which he will deny before a Garrison Grand Jury, perjuring himself. In a Facebook post to me on Sept. 17, 2013 by Margaret’s granddaughter: David Ferrie was my grandmother’s boyfriend. They dated for some time. My uncle [Layton Martens] was involved with him as any kid would be with their future stepfather. David Ferrie may have been “bi” but I’m sure he wasn’t gay. My grandmother’s house blew up around 1968. Any significance? She was eventually put in a mental ward by David Ferrie and my uncle…. I’ve read that it was maybe to make her look crazy so no one would believe anything she had to say, or if questioned by Jim Garrison it could be considered as ramblings of someone mentally unstable.

As a witness, I assert that Dr. Mary Sherman was also Dave’s close friend. Edward T. Haslam, who personally knew Dr. Sherman (his father, also a doctor, was Sherman’s associate), has found other witnesses who said David Ferrie knew Dr. Mary Sherman. Mr. Roy ignores me as even an acquaintance of David Ferrie. “None” is an all-inclusive word. How many “acquaintances” did Mr. Roy interview? Three? Fifteen? Will he release their names before they die, so we can independently verify such blanket statements? Or will only his friends such as Reitzes, who say Oswald killed Kennedy, be able to contact these witnesses? When 15-year-old Al Landry runs away from home on August 2, and is found the next day at David Ferrie’s home, it is the beginning of the end. Lawrence “Butch” Marsch, age 18, correctly guessed his location and returned the boy to his parents. Marsch also helped Mrs. Landry, stating he knew “that all boys go to Ferrie when they run away from home.” Influence of David Ferrie on Boys, Using HypnosisLee Oswald and I personally witnessed David Ferrie placing two Cubans in their late teens into a deep hypnotic state almost complained that our resistance to his efforts to hypnotize us was because neither Lee, nor I, trusted him enough, which was true. Stephen Roy: Ferrie was interested in psychology and had been interested in hypnosis since about 1947. He was fairly skilled at it, and he did practice it on his young friends, both inside and outside the CAP. (Like all hypnotists, he would do preliminary screening by giving suggestions to larger groups, watching to see who responded best, then focusing just on those subjects.)15 Daniel Hopsicker: Ferrie was a gifted hypnotist…. After a long search I found and interviewed several of Ferrie’s most prominent Civil Air Patrol acolytes … one of them, Eddie Shearer, who knew and worked with Dave Ferrie, brought the subject of hypnotism up himself … [Shearer said] “One time I remember, we were marching in formation – drilling – out at Lakefront Airport, getting ready to go to the CAP nationals drill competition. And this kid was twirling a ‘guidon’ – a metal thing, a fleur de les on the top of the pole with the units’ colors – and it got away from him and it cut his hand up pretty good.

So it became clear to me that Dave Ferrie had been working hypnosis with that kid for a long time … without anyone knowing it. At least I had never heard of it before, and I spent a lot of time out there, hanging around that airport.”16 (Shearer’s account is on You Tube as of 11/12/2013) Joseph Backes: Ferrie wanted to know what would be done to the boy upon the boy’s return. (What a humanitarian!) Ferrie harped on the idea that he was interested in the boy’s welfare and felt that things were too tough for him at home. Ferrie insisted that he did not know where the boy was staying in Houston, but he was flying to Houston tonight to see if he could find him and return him to New Orleans.18 Aug. 11: Dave is arrested again, after two more boys attest to being sexually molested. Eric Michael Crouchet, “made a typewritten statement that Ferrie, ‘committed acts of crime against nature on him on two separate occasions.’” James J. Landry, age 16, brother of Al, gave a statement that Ferrie performed sex acts on him on several occasions.” Perry Russo said David Ferrie’s mother [Burdette] was present and visible in David’s home during the Alexander Landry runaway scenarios. Russo said he saw Ferrie hypnotize Landry, but was eventually able to influence Landry to stay away from Ferrie, who was training youths dressed paramilitary style and accompanied by one or more Cubans.19 Aug. 17: Al Landry calls his mother from Houston, Texas. He will return only if: 1) she allows the squadron to reform, 2) She contacts Eastern Airlines and explains this matter, as Ferrie is about to lose his job, 3) She contacts the other parents and makes them withdraw their statements about Ferrie.

The Landry’s investigate the Metairie Falcons CAP squadron. It is unknown to the national CAP and to Air Force Headquarters in Washington, D.C. They contact the FBI. They state that David took Al on flights, loaned Al his car while he was at work flying, and tried to rearrange Al’s school schedule (foiled when the school contacted Al’s mother). Jack Martin (to Pershing Gervais, NODA office): [Ferrie] was teaching them judo, close-order drill, extended-order drill, taking them on camping trips … like a scout master. There was a kid involved in this mess by the name of Crouchet. Every time he flunked this kid, Crouchet, Crouchet’s father got mad and came to the New Orleans Police about it.

He was found living with David Ferrie at 704 Airline Park Blvd. Al Cheramie’s passport’s date of issuance was two days before “Dr. Ferrie” visited Cheramie at the Youth Study Center. Questioned, David said he “planned to do some mining in Honduras and was planning to take Cheramie along.” 4. From 2004 email to Dr. Howard Platzman. Mr. Roy has repeated his opinion widely, saying that he only pretended that a couple of people knew about an “unusual ring” that he later described as a “gargoyle ring” – all of which he said, years later, was just a lie he told to entrap me. He had begun this campaign by asking me, via email, to describe a ring he said witnesses said Dave ‘always wore.’ I replied that Dave almost never wore rings.

This was a difficult time, because I was aware Mr. Roy could insist he had witnesses that Dave “always wore rings,” when in fact I knew better. After “Blackburst” (as he described himself at that time) insisted that I examine my memory better, I recalled the ring I’d seen under the black light, along with one of Dave’s mother’s rings (an ultramarine), a fossil horse tooth he found in Florida, and so on. I had also seen it sitting to one side after Dave had been saying a Mass. Blackburst then asked me to describe it, but I was unaware of that, because I was on my way by plane to Sixty Minutes interviews in New York, and at that time (2001) there was no Internet available to me until two days later, as I had no computer. When I was urged at CBS to describe this ring, I did so, telling everyone at Sixty Minutes and also Dr. Platzman that it looked like a griffin or a gargoyle, was a carved “priestly ring.” Blackburst then said that Platzman had to have told me it was a gargoyle ring, even though he did no such thing. Blackburst then called Platzman a liar. However, when I asked who Blackburst’s witnesses were, he refused to answer. Some four years went by, and suddenly Blackburst, now Stephen Roy, announced to everyone that there ‘never was’ any gargoyle ring. It had been all made up. I believe the witness or witnesses were now deceased, and now Mr. Roy could with impunity declare no such ring existed. I was glad to find these symbols of the church that closely resemble what I saw carved on David Ferrie’s priestly ring. For years, until now, I had no way to defend myself against Mr. Roy’s claims, since he insisted that Dr. Platzman would lie in order to gain fame at Sixty Minutes. Since then many evidence files have surfaced since Sixty Minutes tried to film me three times. 9. One line of thought regarding this event: “Jack Martin … was yet another ‘Bishop’ as well as a drunk with, like Stanley, a long arrest record. He consecrated Thomas Jude Baumler. Baumler was a New Orleans politician and associate of Guy Bannister (sic). It was Baumler who told J. Gary Shaw that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for Guy Bannister.

Document # 124−90125−10013 , file #62-117260-1, is Kerry Thornley’s own personal letter as to his residences. It reveals that by 1967 he did not recall ever leaving New Orleans, until after the Kennedy assassination, even though he’d told Garrison and the FBI previously that he had been out of town for five months in 1963 and thus “never” saw Lee Harvey Oswald. He was caught lying about that by several witnesses who saw him with Lee in New Orleans in September. As to his knowing Lee Oswald in New Orleans earlier in 1963, as the author has claimed, researcher Joe G. Biles published a quote in his book, In History’s Shadow: Lee Harvey Oswald, Kerry Thornley (p 59), that soon after the Kennedy Assassination, which Kerry celebrated with joy, he fled to Virginia, settling near CIA headquarters at a classy condo complex in Arlington, the Shirlington House, where he worked as a doorman. That’s where we learn that Thornley’s immediate boss, Mrs. Doris Dowell, told the FBI that about a month before he left for California. 21. When Al Landry was delivered to the Youth Study Center for problem boys, the assistant superintendent there recalled a similar incident involving another runaway boy, Albert Cheramie. The Visitor’s Record Book showed a “Dr. D. Ferrie” came to see Albert Cheramie and wrote in red pencil: “NOT AN OFFICIAL VISIT.” Backes: “Officer Jenau asked Ferrie if he has a Doctor’s degree and was he treating any patients. Ferrie said he had a degree in psychology and that he didn’t treat anyone but he did give advice. When asked about his visit to Albert Cheramie at the Youth Center in 1960 Ferrie admitted he did indeed visit Cheramie and realized he made a mistake after going.” H. P. Albarelli (author/researcher): First, a number of the boys interviewed by New Orleans police stated that they had traveled to Cuba with Ferrie and others a number of times after the island’s takeover by Fidel Castro.

Dave counseled “his boys,” helped them with homework and tests and encouraged them to go on to college or into seminary schools to become priests. He gave them money for college, or seminary school, and let them stay in his house if they were abused by their parents. There was some parental abuse going on, such as happened to Al Landry. But Dave took advantage of the most vulnerable boys. He seduced them. He tried to convince me that he switched to young adults after his arrests. H. P. Albarelli (cont’d): According to a former New Orleans resident, who is closely related to two of the boys sexually molested by Ferrie and today lives in northern New York: “The Youth Study Center has been a hotbed of corruption, sexual abuse, police brutality, and God only knows what else for decades…. Ferrie used to go there posing as a doctor of some sort, some sort of sham, to recruit kids…. He [Ferrie] took a lot of kids to Cuba, Guatemala and Honduras. Why? I don’t know…. He was an amateur hypnotist … he practiced trance stuff on a lot of boys. I understand that, besides Youth Study Center visits he went to the East [Louisiana] State Hospital a lot, where some of his boys were taken for treatment. There were rumors and stories for years before I left [Louisiana] that Ferrie was in bed, no pun intended, with one of the doctors there, who was a drug addict…. Ferrie wanted the doctor to not treat the boys … the crazy rumor was that the hospital was treating the boys with LSD to stop them from becoming homosexuals and Ferrie hated that.”(A Secret Order, pp. 79-80) In 1999, I revealed that David Ferrie interacted with doctors and technicians at the East Louisiana State Hospital in late August 1963, teaching them how to properly inject one or more prisoners with a cancer-causing biological weapon, how and when to administer immune-system destructive x-rays, and how to keep the cancer-causing material alive.

But according to those sons of bitches, you’d think I’d raped, killed and dismembered every boy I ever touched.” Though I nodded my head in sympathy, I wondered why did Dave use the word “touch”? 10) On Aug. 17, Al Landry called his mother from Houston, Texas. He said he would come home only if certain demands were met, such as statements and actions from her and other parents to allow the Squadron to re-form and to convince Eastern Air Lines not to fire David Ferrie. Dave had created a business-type charter for the bogus squadron. 11) On Aug. 18, at about 3 : 30 pM , Arcacha Smith called officer Fournier. He had a notarized statement for the parents to sign. The statement, among other things, said Al Landry feared for his life at the hands of his father and grandfather and that Capt. Ferrie had done nothing wrong. All charges had to be dropped. To get their son back, the Landry’s would have to sign the statement. They signed. 12) When the cover story that the boy had hitch-hiked to Houston when he ran away from home was proven a lie (Al looked too fresh to have been sleeping in ditches, and he couldn’t remember the route he ‘hitch-hiked’ to Houston), Al tried to sue his own parents for removing him from Capt. Ferrie’s possession. David again insisted that Al Landry was being abused and he had only been trying to protect him. 13) Investigators, unhappy with this coercion, found one of David’s CAP members, 16-year-old Eric Michael Crouchet, who signed a typewritten statement that David “committed acts of crime against nature on him on two separate occasions.” He later said Capt. Ferrie masturbated him on four or five occasions while Crouchet was under the influence of alcohol. Crouchet also signed a statement that when Al Cheramie ran away from home, back in 1960, Capt. Ferrie had Crouchet watch Cheramie’s house to see if Al would return. If he did, Crouchet was to send him by cab to David’s house. David would then send Al to Corpus Christi, Texas. When David’s house was raided and Albert’s passport was found, it was returned to his father, Hughes Cheramie.

When David’s house was raided and Albert’s passport was found, it was returned to his father, Hughes Cheramie. Aug. 23, around 2:15 pm, Captain Ferrie said that he was delaying “M-1’s and bazookas” and told him to sign a retraction. A reward was promised, if he signed. If not, Cubans would be coming after Crouchet, and he would get hurt. Crouchet signed, out of fear, and David left. Around 5 : 00 PM , Eric Crouchet saw David and two Cubans parked in a car outside a drug store, at which time David asked what reward he wanted from the Cubans. Crouchet suggested a motorcycle and a hideout in Miami. David said he should meet Arcacha Smith on Thursday, then said he had to rush – he had to pick up things at the “Balter Building.” Crouchet said that one of the Cubans with David was described as a paratrooper who “jumped in the first invasion of Cuba.” Alvin Beauboeuf: Dave … was accused of a crime against nature with … a real scuze-ball named Mike Crouchet. Ferrie asked me to be a character witness against him in court. It never went that far. After Dave lost his job with Eastern Airlines, the judge threw it out. It never went to trial. Dave was bisexual. No other Civil Air Patrol members came forward and said, “He did it to me too.” I was a teenager back then…. My dad died when I was thirteen. Anytime I had a problem in school I went to Dave’s house for some help. He had a blackboard there. He wouldn’t quit until you understood what he was trying to teach you. There wasn’t anything he didn’t know about. He had a lot of radical beliefs. He was involved with the Cuban Revolutionary Front, Arcacha. They talked a lot. I never heard the conversations… Perry Russo said David Ferrie’s mother [Burdette, widowed] was present and visible in David’s home during the Alexander Landry runaway scenarios. Russo said Ferrie would hypnotize Landry, but he was eventually able to influence Landry to stay away from Ferrie, who was training youths dressed paramilitary style and accompanied by one or more Cubans.4 H. P. Albarelli: The investigation into David Ferrie’s unlawful and perverse activities with young boys would quickly become extremely complex, involving well over 20 boys, and Ferrie and Arcacha Smith, as well as several unidentified Cubans, making strong-arm efforts to suppress evidence and threatening bodily harm to several of the young boys interviewed by detectives….

A number of the boys sexually molested by Ferrie were taken by law enforcement authorities to the Youth Study Center in New Orleans … chartered “to provide secure detention to youth, ages 8-16 that have been arrested and are in pre-trial status.’.” … Since some of these boys molested by Ferrie had not been arrested, the reason for taking them to the Center is unclear and unexplained by police reports.5 Aug. 30, 1961: Layton Martens, Melvin Sealey6 and Andrew Blackmon are arrested for vagrancy. They are jailed and interrogated for several days. Martens is also interviewed by the FBI. The real purpose seems to be getting more information about David Ferrie. Martens contends later that the arrest was a blatant attempt to pin a burglary charge on him, due to his association with Ferrie. A. J. Weberman: Layton Martens … was arrested on August 30, 1961, for vagrancy pending investigation of burglary by the New Orleans Police Department. Layton Martens commented, “No for god sakes, I was never Ferrie’s roommate. I did borrow his apartment when he was out of town, for about seven to nine days.” Except for the solitary word “activist,” a multi-page tribute to Martens upon his death March 18, 2000 mentions nothing about his anti-Castro activities, David Ferrie, or the Kennedy assassination.8 Martens played a cameo role as an FBI agent in JFK. He was also the phone voice threatening Garrison’s daughter, and played a man who yells with pleasure in the bar scene when JFK’s death is announced, in the same film. The famous Jack Wasserman served as the attorney for David Ferrie and his young friends. Think about that. Wasserman was no ordinary attorney. Nor did his services come cheaply. Marcello may have had a hand in this, for Arcacha had no money, and neither did Dave or his cadets. Here’s what famed columnist Drew Pearson wrote in a column, in Oct., 1963 about Marcello’s best attorney: Pearson: The secret of his delaying tactics and the fact that he is still in the USA is Jack Wasserman, one of the smartest immigration attorneys in the business. Wasserman has handled the cases of such notorious persons as [gangster] Frankie Costello and Nicholas Malaxa [accused of genocide] … both Costello and Malaxa are still in the United States.9 Memo: SA Fleming, 1/24/62… LAYTON MARTENS at NOFO, 1/24/62, advised he was arrested by NOPD at his residence, 112", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:80:341f660561b1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5430, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 81, "text": "best attorney: Pearson: The secret of his delaying tactics and the fact that he is still in the USA is Jack Wasserman, one of the smartest immigration attorneys in the business.

He said he went to the Records Room of the NOPD and found out that he had been released as “case refused” by District Attorney.10 hy were so many of Dave’s boyfriends called “Al” – or the first two letters of their first or last name began with ‘LA’ [reversal]? Consider Al Beauboeuf, Al Landry, James Landry, Al Cheramie, Lawrence Marsch, Layton Martens. Aleister Crowley is considered to have been the epitome of the Evil Man. Crowley’s Book of the Law was called LIBER AL vel LEGIS. The Paines were into the occult. Arthur Young went to Mexico in search of hallucinogenic drugs. Michael Paine was Young’s stepson. Ruth and Michael Paine, the couple who sheltered Lee Oswald’s family, seemingly out of the goodness of their hearts, also appeared to have helped to frame the innocent Lee Harvey Oswald for Kennedy’s murder. HSCA: An unconfirmed Border Patrol report of February 1962 alleges that Ferrie was the pilot who flew Carlos Marcello back into the United States from Guatemala after he had been deported in April 1961 as part of the U.S. Attorney-General Robert Kennedy’s crackdown on organized crime. This may have helped Ferrie establish an enduring relationship with the Marcello organized crime family. Another indication of any early Ferrie relationship with the Marcello organized crime family may be the legal assistance that Marcello’s lawyer, Jack Wasserman … provided to Ferrie associates, Layton Martens, who identified himself to police as Arcacha Smith’s second-in-command … and Andrew Blackmon. Both had been arrested shortly after Ferrie’s arrest for indecent behavior…. Ferrie’s ties to the Marcello organized crime family continued through his association with G. Wray Gill, Sr., who was also attorney of record for Carlos ‘Marcello. David often went to the four-story Balter Building on St. Charles, where Marcello’s attorney and Dave’s future employer, G. Wray Gill, had an office, and where Arcacha Smith’s anti-Castro FRD was still located. Gill’s most important client, Carlos Marcello, was highly interested in Arcacha’s and David’s anti-Castro affairs. David Ferrie was said to have obtained a loan from Herb Wagner to pay a $5, 000 bribe to Assistant D.A. Graffagnino to defend him in court, a loan likely guaranteed by Carlos Marcello.

Both men, after all, had a common cause – Castro’s overthrow. It seems unlikely that David could have obtained $5, 000 without someone like Marcello behind it. The Pentagon offered President John F. Kennedy an extraordinary variety of dirty tricks intended to sabotage Fidel Castro, newly declassified documents show. These plans ranged from sophomoric pranks, like faking a picture of a fat and debauched Castro to destroy the Cuban leader’s image, to murderous plots, including sinking a boatload of Cuban refugees as a phony pretext for a United States military invasion. The plans were … code-named Operation Mongoose and spurred by the President’s brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, to get rid of Mr. Castro by any means necessary.12 A sample of Mongoose mischief comes from a March 1, 1962, Army memorandum entitled ‘’Possible Actions to Provoke, Harass or Disrupt Cuba,’’ one among some 1,500 pages of once-secret documents made public by the Assassination Records Review Board. “In March 1962, the head of Operation Mongoose, Brig. Gen. Edward G. Lansdale, the Kennedys’ personal choice for the job, asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff for their views on top-secret plans to concoct a pretext for a military invasion of Cuba. Those plans involved staging phony attacks against Americans and anti-Castro Cubans. Herbert R.

Wagner later supplied Garrison with information about ‘Operation Mosquito, [Operation Mongoose] and Dave’s activities with Arcacha Smith without malice or motive. Iprobably got to know DAVE FERRIE at the New Orleans Airport where I have owned several airplanes.I owned these airplanes from 1946 on.Sometime between 1946 and 1956 I definitely got to know him because in 1952 when we opened the Kenner Finance Company,I remember makinig direct loans to DAvE at that time FERRIE came in,we sat down and we talked for a while and he told me,“HERB,you can be real valuable to us.FERRIE looked at me and said,”Did you ever hear of operation..“And he stopped and 1ooked at ARCACHA and ARCACHshook his head in an affirmative manner and then FERRIE saidOperation Mosquito?I made some little funny remark about so many mosquitos in the area and he said,”No,HeRB,with your knowledge of motors,you could be helpful to us.Of course,he then went on to explain to me that they were planning a sabotage campaign to Cuba to sabotage machinery and transportation and so forth,in Cuba.I stopped him at thattime and said,whoa,you’ve got the wrong man.I went on talking to DAvEasa friend and said I was married and have responsibilities and could not become involved in it.He said airection giady.DAvE then contacted me several days later and asked me,“HeRB,did you give it any more thought?”And I told him,\"DAvE,I just borrowed a hell of a lot of money to open this business up and I can’t fool with this kind of stuff.I have to make every minute count.And he told me,If money is the only thing keepina vou from this.well.hal1.wa an natmona He called me on another occasion later on and he came on real friendly this time.He said,“HeRB,have you been getting any flying in lately?” Itold him I couldnt afford to fly.And hesaid,\"You’re a damn fool.With what you know about navigation and flying,you can make money.I told him,How in the heli can you make money，DAVe.Just tell me that.And he said,Were taking people in and out of Cuba at nighttime.I didnt want any partofit. Wagner also told Garrison’s people he approved a loan based Kennedy assassination, a loan which was used to provide David with funds to rent airplanes.

He then approved the loan. Wagner’s reward for his candor and loyalty to David Ferrie resulted in breakins calculated to terrorize him. Wagner, to Garrison’s people: Let me tell you this, five times since the assassination my house has been ransacked and nothing taken. Four different times my office has been ransacked and nothing taken. One time my camp on Blind River was ransacked and nothing taken. These can all be verified by police reports. Dick Russell: [FBI said] Marcello offered Arcacha Smith a deal whereby Marcello would make a substantial donation to the movement in return for concessions in Cuba after Castro’s overthrow. (169) One explanation of Ferrie’s ability to provide funds to Arcacha Smith may be that he acted as Marcello’s financial conduit. (The Man Who Knew Too Much. p. 257.) Before September 1961: At the blimp field in Houma, there were a number of storage sheds for air-freight companies to use. Dave and Guy Banister probably made one or two pick-ups of Schlumberger-marked boxes of seismic dynamite and caps before the famous heist in September. Gerry Hemming told me the pick-ups were staged to look like burglaries, so Schlumberger would get reimbursed through its insurance. I had asked Gerry about the “raids” out at Houma because the name “Schlumberger” stuck out for me. By mid-September, 1961: The famous “Schlumberger Heist” occurred. The participants were Andrew Blackmon, Rancier Blaise Ehlinger, David Ferrie, Layton Martens, Luis Rabel Nunez, Gordon Novel, Novel’s wife Marlene Mancuso, Carlos Quiroga, and Sergio Arcacha Smith. Stephen Roy adds the name of “a boy” – “Woodcock.” Blackmon’s act of throwing an explosive cap out the window of one of the vehicles suggests what kind of material was taken. Arcacha’s emerging rival was Luis Rabel, who lied to researcher A.J. Weberman, claiming that he wasn’t involved in the raid, just as Layton Martens had done. Stephen Roy (posting as David Blackburst): I believe the expedition was on Sunday, September 17, 1961, and that the parties (including a boy named Woodcock) left from Ferrie’s apartment at about 8 : 00pm and broke into the bunkers at about 10:45pm. They departed at about 11pm and arrived back at Ferrie’s after midnight. The next day, Ferrie (who was skittish because his house had been searched by police several times recently) moved them to Banister’s office.

The next day, Ferrie (who was skittish because his house had been searched by police several times recently) moved them to Banister’s office. It appears that the arms only stayed there for a few days, until Quiroga drove them [in a U-Haul] to Miami … Ferrie was also interested in obtaining a Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport (also known as a “Gooney Bird.”) He may also have been interested in narcotics at this time. Ironically, Robert A. Baker, to whom I was married while living in New Orleans, spent the majority of his time out on “Quarterboat Bob” replacing a man who had both his hands blown off by these same seismic charge cartridges. They were made, at that time, of dynamite. Robert wrote letters on Dixie Dynamite Distributors note-paper while out on the quarter boat that used these charges. A local address, as shown, was HOUMA, Louisiana, at the Blimp station.13 Sixteen-year-old Carlos Quiroga (Dallas FBI Informant “NO T-5” in New Orleans) was an anti-Castro Cuban who reported on the doings of Banister, Arcacha Smith, David Ferrie and others. He was not trusted completely because his parents lived in Cuba, and his father was in prison there. Thus, he could have been a double agent. But Quiroga had been introduced to David prior to October, since he participated in the Houma heist along with David Ferrie and Arcacha Smith. Mr. Roy even names Quiroga as a participant, in a different post. Also, Quiroga was around David Ferrie enough to know he handed out $100 bills to Arcacha Smith. And he knew a lot more about the true role of Lee Oswald in New Orleans than he claimed, as DA Jim Garrison reminded Quiroga when he stood before Garrison’s Grand Jury, concerning questions he didn’t pass on a lie detector test. Quiroga took the Fifth. condition then,But certain questions you failed,among them just are the key matters which you/describedas having told the truth.Knowing Oswald,knowing that he was not actually a Communist,knowing that the Fair Play for Cuba wasa cover, in those areas the lie detector test show that you were lying.

I say that because I have seen photos from that period showing Ferrie with Larry DeJoseph – and with him in planes, cars, etc. in New Orleans. Hemming says that Ferrie was helping them with his plane and that certainly appears to be true. Jack Martin: (to Garrison’s investigator, Gervais, 1967) Two Juvenile Police Officers … went with the Jefferson Parish Police to Ferrie’s house and they made a raid and discovered a catch (sic) of arms, chemistry equipment, laboratory equipment, his library and radio equipment and other electronic devices and all this military equipment there. HSCA inspection of police records: Two two-man submarines (made from large plane fuel tanks), a Morse code key, four model 1903 Springfield rifles, two .22 caliber rifles, one rifle, a flare gun, a .38 caliber revolver, a sword, a quantity of ammunition, three maps (of Havana Harbor, the coast of Cuba, West Indies, Cuba and North Coast).15 Gus Russo (Live by the Sword) wrote: Recalling Ferrie’s bravery, Arcacha says, “He wanted to fly into Havana harbor and bomb the refineries. Ferrie had an idea to make two-man submarines, go in and just blow [the refineries] up. We actually made two of them, but we were prevented from using them.” Layton Martens, who came with Ferrie to Arcacha’s volunteer effort, also remembers the submarines. “Dave made them out of B-47 wing tanks,” he recalls. “He kept one on his front lawn for a long time.” A. J. Weberman (nodule 24), relates that an informant described Arcacha Smith’s and David Ferrie’s plans as of September 1961 to the FBI: … he and his partners were taken to the residence of David Ferrie, where they were introduced to two young Cubans, and two young ex-Marines … upon arriving at the house he was taken directly to the attic where there were maps of Cuba displayed on the walls, and a number of different types of firearms sitting in a rack. He stated in the basement of this same house were two roughly assembled two-man submarines. Source stated Smith and others excitedly discussed plans to blow up ships in Havana Harbor, sabotage key installations. He said Ferrie was to be a pilot for the organization, and they mentioned it would be about two weeks before the explosives (which were removed from a munitions bunker in Houma, Louisiana) would arrive in Cuba.

Bill Kelly (researcher): Following standard investigative procedures in the investigation of a conspiracy and homicide, DA Garrison used the Houma caper as a wedge, lever and related crime in order to 1) Convene a grand jury; 2) subpoena witnesses; 3) obtain information about Oswald and the assassination from those who could be convicted and jailed if they didn’t cooperate.16 Herbert Wagner (from his 1967 interview): When Dave became involved in a crime against nature charge in Jefferson parish, I was a character witness for him. He also had a priest from Loyola, several nuns showed up, but they were not brought in, Guy Banister showed up and many other people I didn’t know. I remember talking to Banister personally and I talked to the priest personally. Oct. 16, 1961: Senior Patrol Inspector Windle G. Roach, U.S. Border Patrol, says in September David told Eastern Air Line steward John Harris that he had an arms cache near New Orleans. He also said he was trying to buy “a C-47 airplane for $30, 000 Roach, as a member of the New Orleans Border Patrol, “Worked under Attorney General Bobby Kennedy and deported Carlos Marcello…”18 Oct. 22, 1961: David finds his Stinson, hangared at Lakefront, sabotaged. In 1963, Dave will tell the FBI that his Stinson has not been airworthy since spring, 1962, which his friend Herbert R. Wagner, Jr. will expose as a lie in his 1967 interview with Garrison’s investigators. (Remember Dave took Wagner for a ride in his Stinson to prove its airworthiness in order to qualify the plane as collateral for a loan, just prior to the Kennedy assassination.) Stephen Roy: … about a handful of an abrasive compound had been placed in each wing tank [and] short plastic strips [had been put into] the crankcase of the engine…. He and others say the plane was never flyable after that. His log-book seems to support it. The plane was eventually hauled to a friend’s service station and disassembled. (To Education Forum) From another source, I have the 1960-1962 flight and engine logs…. There is no 1963 log as the plane was not airworthy.19 Oct. 25, 1961: FBI makes a summary statement that David is a “crackpot.” FBI adds that he is “a very active member” of the CRF (Cuban Revolutionary Front), and as such, his anti-Castro activities and possession of firearms to use against Castro do not constitute a violation of the Neutrality Act, since the CRF is a creature of the CIA.21 Stephen Roy (posting as Blackburst):", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:87:a13792203f0e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5437, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 88, "text": "flight and engine logs….

When he ran a training camp for his “Falcon Squadron” in early 1961, he claimed to have the backing of either the CIA or the State Department. And he claimed to Bob Boylston that, in the event of an attack on the US, he would pass along “secret orders” from the government. How much, if any, of this is true and how much might be Walter Mitty-type fantasy is unclear. But it all seems to have ended by late 1961.22 Anthony Marsh, son of a CIA agent/researcher: (responding to Roy/Blackburst’s statement that if David Ferrie “really” was CIA, why didn’t CIA protect him better and pay him better; such as, from financial troubles, the FBI assessment of being a “crackpot” and Garrison’s hounding) “Sometimes the CIA tries to cut off its ties with an agent or asset when morals charges come up. Read Sheehan’s A Bright Shining Lie.”23 Anthony Marsh responds: I didn’t say that CIA cut off ties to Ferrie…. But I think they maintained it to keep a pilot in reserve for Mongoose activities. Failing to help Ferrie does not signify that they cut off ties…. If you think that anyone who ever works for the CIA is automatically guaranteed to make a fortune, you need a reality check. David Ferrie’s “end of the contract” might have been Marcello’s responsibility, through Dave’s association with Arcacha Smith, whose FRD and CRC were connected to the CIA, but who was also promised funds from Marcello. David received a hefty sum equal to $65, 000 in today’s funds, supposedly for just two months of work during Marcello’s trial, plus some flights to Guatemala. That’s a lot, considering it’s on top of Dave’s monthly salary as a legal assistant to Marcello’s attorney, G. Wray Gill. CIA veteran of 14 years, Victor Marchetti, executive assistant A to CIA’s Director, Richard Helms, testified that the CIA, not Lee Oswald, killed John F. Kennedy. Marchetti said Oswald was a contract agent for the CIA and that he’d been told that David Ferrie was a CIA agent at the time of the assassination.

Anthony Summers: (author/researcher, from Not in Your Lifetime) Victor Marchetti [former special assistant to CIA’s Deputy Director] told me that he observed consternation on the part of then CIA Director Richard Helms and other senior officials when Ferrie’s name was first publicly linked with the assassination in 1967. Marchetti claimed he asked a colleague about this and was told that “Ferrie had been a contract agent to the Agency in the early sixties and had been involved in some of the Cuban activities. John Simkin: As a result of obtaining of getting depositions from David Atlee Phillips, Richard Helms, G. Gordon Liddy, Stansfield Turner and Marita Lorenz, plus a skillful cross-examination by [Mark] Lane of E. Howard Hunt, [a] jury decided in January, 1995, that [Victor] Marchetti had not been guilty of libel when he suggested that John F. Kennedy had been assassinated by people working for the CIA. As for who paid David Ferrie his big bonus, we now know the Ma-fia was working with the CIA, so Dave’s impressive bonus pay-CIA. Only after the Kennedy assassination was it impossible for the Mafia to give their pilot full protection, though the Marcello brothers would use Dave for contract work almost to the end of his life. Mr. Roy insists that Dave “almost completely disappeared from anti-Castro activities after late 1961. Period.” He seems to assume that Dave’s near-disappearance from overt anti-Castro activities means that he was no longer involved in any covert anti-Castro activities. That’s not the man I knew. David was not only working for an attorney whose boss, Carlos Marcello, was actively supporting anti-Castro activities, he would soon be working with Dr. Mary Sherman, now on record as an INCA supporter and a medical aide to anti-Castro guerrillas. And Dave became involved in an underground, covert project aimed at killing Castro. That’s why he became so quiet. He could still be useful in efforts to rid the planet of a hated communist without having to work with homophobic anti-Castro Cubans. However, almost to the end of his life, Dave surrounded himself with gay anti-Castro Cubans, as many witnesses mention. Stephen Roy: (Posting as Blackburst, 07/30/2000): The time when Arcacha was at 544 Camp Street/531 Lafayette Street started just as Ferrie was being kicked out of the group, and ended just as Ferrie was beginning a relationship with Banister in that building.

Could Ferrie have been telling the truth when he told the FBI that “he has never known of the [FRD] maintaining an office at 544 Camp Street, nor does he have any knowledge of Sergio Arcacha Smith maintaining an office at that address during the time that he was the head of the organization and later after he was replaced.” M. Bishop (replying to Roy as Blackburst, above, wrote): All of this presupposes that Ferrie was so stung by his excommunication [from the FRD, after Dave’s morals arrests] that he ceased to care about both the people and their cause; that he was so removed he no longer gossiped about either the people or their cause while drinking coffee at Mancuso’s; that Gill, Banister, Gatlin, et al, failed to mention any further CRC/FRD/Arcacha developments to him, etc.26 Remember, Arcacha Smith had to move the entire FRD office contents from his home to the new office.. David Ferrie was still a close friend of Arcacha’s, and Dave, a frequent visitor, probably even helped in the move. Remember that fear played a role in what the FBI would be told. Example: According to Arcacha, when speaking to the Washington Post on Feb. 27, 1967, five days after David Ferrie was found dead, Smith couldn’t quite recall if he had ever met Dave: “I just don’t know anything,” Smith told a reporter over the phone. Clearly nervous and upset, Arcacha Smith refused to admit knowing Ferrie. “I can’t recall,” he said. “I studied the name in the papers the other day. I just can’t recall him.”27 (The good news is that later Arcacha’s memory improved dramatically as witnesses came forward with stories linking him to his old friend.) Rudolph Richard Davis: …had known Sergio ARCACHA for several years … ARCACHA who introduced him to David Ferrie … at ARCACHA’S home … DAVIS stated he saw FERRIE three or four times, once in ARCACHA’S office at 544 Camp Street.” REFER-ENCE: MEMORANDUM, March 22, 1967, Gurvich to Garrison, 28 Feb. 1967, interview of Rudolph Richard Davis, Jr. by Gurvich and Alcock, Houston, TX. Oct. 30, 1961: David wrote a threatening and somewhat incoherent letter in his defense, with the assistance of his now-faithful Mafia-attorney, “Mr. [A. J.] Graffagnino,” to Eastern Air Lines. The ever-faithful Arcacha Smith is also mentioned as being present at a “discussion.”His letter is threaded with paranoia and threats against Eastern Airlines.

Important parts of this long letter are shown here.28 Some readers will find the letter fascinating. Others may wish they had never bothered to try to wade through it all. Enter at your own risk! You require “a plausible explanation of the incidents that lead to the filing of serious criminal charges” against me…. We have in hand indisputable proof for the facts cited herein. For the composition of this letter, reports of reputable detectives have been employed. Since your letter infers you require a chronological sequence, I shall list these events chronologically. I must add one caution, however. The very nature of some of the information contained herein has given me considerable pause in whether I should respond to your request for information. First of all, I know of no “crime,” violation of working agreement, or company rule which is violated when one individual makes a charge against another. Proven charges are another thing. It is my opinion that it is not the business of Eastern Air Lines that someone should make charges against me. It is another thing if these charges are proven to be true in a court of law. In the second place, the revelation of this information to you contains a serious potential threat to my safety, as a subsequent paragraph will reveal. I shall, therefore, hold you personally responsible if some of this information is divulged since my personal safety is involved. It is my belief that the chronology begins in 1959. During the summer of 1959 I received my first anonymous threatening telephone call. At this time positive information had come into my hands that Fidel Castro was a Communist, and that this was known in the State Department prior to the action of the U.S. Government forcing Batista out of office. Also at this time I was laboring to prevent the admission in the U.S. Air Force Academy of a candidate whose views, as well as those of his family, were anti-American, since he indicated he has no intention of supporting Amendment XIV, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution. From that day until the present [page 2]… (at 2:15 P.M. this date) these telephone calls have continued. In some of these telephone calls I have been addressed obscenely, on some occasions as a “[…]-lover,” a “Radical,” a “Communist,” an “Atheist,” a “Religious fanatic” and so on. On other occasions polite, well-modulated voices have try [sic] to dissuade me from my activities and in particular my speeches against those persons and forces I deem subversive.

On other occasions polite, well-modulated voices have try [sic] to dissuade me from my activities and in particular my speeches against those persons and forces I deem subversive. Though all of these telephone calls have been anonymous, the identity of one of the voices has been established. On other occasions I receive “silent” phone calls, that in, when we answer a call, no response is made by the caller who, after a short interval, hangs up, or otherwise breaks the connection. It became apparent that acting as a lone individual I could accomplish little, whereas with affiliation with a similar-minded group I might accomplish much more. Therefore, I pursued several related problems: … I have been assisting in bringing Cuban refugees to the United States, and in obtaining necessities including medical care for them. I have likewise, in activities approved of and encouraged by the President of the United States and his Attorney General, – helping to raise arms for the liberation of Cuba… During the month of August three persons associated with this work were arrested by a particular New Orleans policeman. We have been unable to learn what they were charged with. They were held incommunicado for four days. During this time they were also maltreated…. In the course of the interrogations one police official tried to extract a commitment from these individuals that they would desist in their activities to assist the Cubans. One of the officers stated that his objective was “to put Arcacha and Ferrie in jail.” In pursuance of this objective these three were interrogated to produce evidence against me of Subsequent to this the New Orleans Police came to my home to search it, claiming they possessed a valid Search Warrant. They refused to produce this warrant and refused to divulge the quest of the search. These acts are in clear violation of the law. They returned a second time, and did not even claim to possess a warrant, but stated they were searching for narcotics. They returned a third time «to search» but did not search, but engaged in a day-long harassment of my mother, my guests and myself. During this time interval I was taken to the East Bank Jail, Jefferson Parish, and interrogated relative to harboring a run-away New Orleans juvenile. Since it developed I had nothing to do with it I was released. Then I was arrested for a “crime against nature,” allegedly committed with a New Orleans minor. I was held incommunicado until a friendly bondsman learned of my plight and bailed me out and summoned Mr. Graffagnino, whom I had not known prior to this time.

I was held incommunicado until a friendly bondsman learned of my plight and bailed me out and summoned Mr. Graffagnino, whom I had not known prior to this time. At the time of the arrest the police refused to divulge the charge. When I finally learned of the charge and the person allegedly making it, I took two witnesses and confronted the said New Orleans minor. He admitted that he made the charges. But, he insisted to myself and witnesses that he had been compelled to sign the charges or face a jail term. Thereafter, he signed a statement exonerating me, and indicating how he came to sign them. The following day he came, of his own volition, and signed a second statement. The New Orleans authorities were apprised of this. On October 24, my brother, who lives and works in the North, had pressure applied to him. One of the officials of his company summoned him and threatened his job unless it could be ascertained that our family had no further connection with any activity involving the liberation of Cuba, or other activities resisting Communist take-over in the Caribbean area. … We are wondering about the legality of my suspension from flying. We are curious about your statement (to Mr. Graffagnino, Senor Arcacha and myself) that someone in authority over you has indicated that my activities regarding Cuba be stopped. We are curious about your implication that Eastern has piled up other things against me. (I understand from ALPA that it is an Eastern practice to try to accumulate a file to be used against an individual as it suits the company.) Likewise, we are wondering whether the public interest would be better served if we released names of Communists and Fellow-Travelers employed by Eastern Air Lines. HSCA: Attorney G. Wray Gill notified Eastern when the last of the charges against Ferrie had been nolle prosequied; Eastern responded with a letter inviting Ferrie to discuss the charges at a meeting in Miami. Ferrie did not go. Instead, several individuals, including one of the boys who had been named in a sex offense charge against him, wrote to Eastern to plead that Ferrie be reinstated.” HSCA: … the most active anti-Castro groups … included Alpha 66, Cuban Revolutionary Junta (JURE), Commandos L, the Directorio Revolutionario Estudiantial (DRE), the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), which includes the Frente Revolucianario Democratico (FRD), the Junta Gobierno de Cuba in Exilo (JGCE), the 30th of November, the International Penetration Forces (InterPen), Revolutionary Recovery Movement (MRR), and Ejercito Invasor Cubano (EIC).32 Calls To & From Dec. 5, 1961 Baton Rouge New", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:93:b49208dd361c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5443, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 94, "text": "him, wrote to Eastern to plead that Ferrie be reinstated.” HSCA: … the most active anti-Castro groups … included Alpha 66, Cuban Revolutionary Junta (JURE), Commandos L, the Directorio Revolutionario Estudiantial (DRE), the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), which includes the Frente Revolucianario Democratico (FRD), the Junta Gobierno de Cuba in Exilo (JGCE), the 30th of November, the International Penetration Forces (InterPen), Revolutionary Recovery Movement (MRR), and Ejercito Invasor Cubano (EIC).32 Calls To & From Dec. 5, 1961 Baton Rouge New Orleans Dec. 11, 1961 Dallas (214-RI2-5178) New Orleans Dec. 12, 1961 Houston New Orleans Dec. 12, 1961 (2) New Orleans Houston Dec. 14, 1961 Guatemala City New Orleans Dec. 16, 1961 Guatemala City New Orleans Dec. 19, 1961 Guatemala City New Orleans Dec. 19, 1961 Brownsville, TX New Orleans Dec. 20, 1961 Guatemala City New Orleans Dec. 21, 1961 Guatemala City New Orleans Dec. 27, 1961 Guatemala City New Orleans Dec. 30, 1961 Bethesda, MD (202-DL2-3528) New Orleans Dec. 31, 1961 Guatemala City New Orleans he CIA did not want President Kennedy to get involved in Gua-Ttemala, even as the CIA interfered with the will of the people, who were in revolt. The CIA supported strong US corporate interests. Carlos Marcello’s influence in Guatemala was also strong. Pro-Castro leftists, who saw their chance, began to pour in, precipitating a long and brutal civil war. Dec. 1961: Civil War in Guatemala: Chaos and destruction will continue for the next three decades. The US will lose diplomats to murder in the coming years in their efforts to keep puppet dictators in power for US corporate purposes, as some 200,000 citizens, mostly poor Indians, will die or go missing. Late December 1961: David claims he had previously helped Jack S. Martin investigate ordination scams, where for $5.00 an applicant could get ordained. This led to meetings with leaders of such sects as the Old Roman Catholic and Old Orthodox Catholic Church, and to David’s eventual interest in getting ordained in one or more of the sects. Peter Levenda: Stanley told the FBI that he consecrated David Ferrie as a bishop in July of 1961, but then removed him from that office the following January when Stanley learned of Ferrie’s homosexuality. When the author first read Stanley’s statement, he burst out laughing. Homosexuality was never a bar to either ordination or consecration at the American Orthodox Catholic Church … the history of the American Orthodox Catholic Church (indeed, of all the “wandering bishop” dioceses) is replete with instances of every form of sexual expression. (It’s not for nothing that Propheta’s headquarters – the Cathedral of the Holy Resurrection – was known as “the Cathedral of the Holy Erection” in wandering bishop circles.) … Ferrie was never defrocked or deposed or in any way removed from office due to homosexuality, and it is doubted that he was ever removed at all, for any reason.

If he was, he would have been the first (and probably only) person ever kicked out of the wandering bishops’ club.33 January 20, 1962: Sergio Arcacha Smith is fired by vote of the CRC, but remains a member of Ronnie Caire’s Crusade to Free Cuba. Since Jack Martin had created a commemorative coin idea that resulted in missing funds, Arcacha’s refusal to sever his friendship with David Ferrie was the last straw. Luis Ravel takes over as the area’s new CRC delegate. Stephen Roy (Feb. 19, 2005 post to Greg Parker, Education Forum): The group Martin and Ferrie were associated with was the “Byzantine Primitive Catholic Church, Old Catholic Church in N.A., Apostolic, Orthodox, Catholic, Order of Saint John,” according to the consecration certificates. The group Ferrie alone was associated with was the ‘Society of the Domestic Missionaries Of Saint Basil the Great’, according to his membership card. Peter Levenda: (doesn’t believe David was removed, but if so) … it may have been more the legal problems Ferrie had with Eastern Airlines over his homosexual conduct that contributed to his ouster from the church, once Stanley – no stranger to the legal system – learned of them and feared that close scrutiny would be paid to his own operation…34 When Melvin Coffey, a former CAP Cadet trained by David Ferrie, is discharged from the Army, he renews his friendship with David. By November 1963, he will be a close friend. Along with Alvin Beauboeuf, Coffey will accompany David Ferrie on the suspicious trip to Houston, Texas through a rainstorm on the night of the Kennedy assassination. Feb. 1962: Layton Martens says David Ferrie was out of town a lot, when interrogated by Assistant D.A. Alvin Oser on Sunday, Mar. 12, 1967. He agrees that Charles Cater, a male nurse, had been living with David. Martens then states, “I think I heard Ferrie mention [Cater] concerning the trial in ‘61. Cater was mixed up in this some way and ap- court Tuesday found David W. Ferrie innocent on one of five charges of indecent behavior with a juvenile. Ferrie, 43, 331 Atherton Dr., Metairie, a former airline pilot, has charges against him in both Jefferson and Orleans parishes in connection with alleged indecent acts with juvenile boys, and has also been charged with extortion, intimidation of a witness and threats against a juvenile in Orleans Parish.” The remaining four charges are dropped", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:95:fb8acaf16162", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5445, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 96, "text": "mixed up in this some way and ap- court Tuesday found David W.

Now that Ferrie is free of most charges, G. Wray Gill hires him cello’s influence. Dave now receives a low but decent annual salary of $3, 600 , which would cover all his needs if he did not pump so much of it into his preferred lifestyle and anti-Castro activities. The poverty level in 1964 for a single male David’s age was $1, 650/yr . (Ref. US Census Bureau). David will eventually receive a $1, 635.90 settlement payment [approx. $14, 000 in today’s funds] from Eastern Air Lines. David Ferrie’s next dwelling at 3330 Louisiana Avenue Parkway was recently re-numbered, but it’s such a distinctive house that it is easily recognized. Dave’s attractive second-floor apartment opened up to a large screened porch at the front, which Dave promptly began to litter. His mother’s furniture and his beloved piano were moved in. A large library, with many medical books, and a host of religious, scientific and unusual items, flowed from one room to the next. 1997 … record[ing] a meeting of senior national security officials in the Oval Office on March 16, 1962 … President Kennedy told the group he would not yet approve any direct US military intervention in Cuba. Next, the conversation turned to another matter. This is how {Brig. Gen. Edward] Lansdale captured it in his memorandum for the record: ‘The Attorney General then mentioned Mary Hemingway [Ernest Hemingway’s widow], commenting on reports that Castro was drinking heavily in disgruntlement over the way things were going, and the opportunities offered by the shrine to Hemingway … we were in agreement that the matter was so delicate and sensitive that it shouldn’t be surfaced to the Special Group [an elite interagency group that reviewed covert actions] until we were ready to go, and then not in detail…” (author emphasis) Lansdale’s description of the Hemingway plan as “so delicate and sensitive” that its specifics should be hidden from the Special Group is another tip-off that the operation involved assassination. “That’s the giveaway,” says Peter Kornbluh, a senior analyst at the National Security Archive and a specialist on US documents regarding Cuba. “This is the closest thing to a smoking gun that has been declassified. Only assassination would be taboo for open discussion at the Special Group, which routinely planned sabotage, violence and chaos to undermine Castro.” Samuel Halpern, who was number two to the officer who ran the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:96:547dc7456845", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5446, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 97, "text": "the Special Group is another tip-off that the operation involved assassination. “That’s the giveaway,” says Peter Kornbluh, a senior analyst at the National Security Archive and a specialist on US documents regarding Cuba. “This is the closest thing to a smoking gun that has been declassified. Only assassination would be taboo for open discussion at the Special Group, which routinely planned sabotage, violence and chaos to undermine Castro.” Samuel Halpern, who was number two to the officer who ran the CIA end of Operation Mongoose calls the document “as close as we’re likely to get” to conclusive proof. The CIA JM/WAVE station in Miami served as operational headquarters for Operation Mongoose, run by CIA’s William Harvey. And as a former CIA director said, “The language of the memo speaks for itself. The only thing Robert Kennedy can be referring to is the assassination of Castro. This paragraph should never have been written.” March 23, 1962: One week after RFK approves of plots to kill Castro, Dr. Alton Ochsner, President of International House, removes Clay Shaw as its Acting Director, where Shaw had held various positions for over nine years (Shaw remains a manager at The New Orleans Trade Mart). Dr. Paul A. Fabry (a Hungarian refugee and former CIA Voice of America, Hungary) takes Shaw’s place at IH.42 2. Was “Mining in the Honduras” for David’s CAP Boys Based on a ‘Nutty’ Idea? Robert E. Lee, Assistant D.A. in Garrison’s office, once worked with David on some Eastern Air Lines round-trip flights as a steward. On July 12, 1967, he revealed the following: “… FERRIE had purchased some stock in a close corporation whose headquarters were located in Honduras., In addition to buying this stock, he had flown down to Honduras to look into a “Kahunie Nut” venture. Simply it was this: “The Kahunie Nut has a juice which when squeezed out an mixed with a certain compound will harden into a mass as strong as iron, and of course, rust proof and will endure for centuries. There are only two machines available built to squeeze the juice from the Kahunie Nut – one is in Chicago and one is in Belize, Honduras. The owner of the machine in Chicago won’t exhibit or sell his machine since he is preparing to move his equipment to Honduras to start production. Incidentally, there is only one area in the world where the Kahunie Nut grows, in the jungles of Honduras. So that if FERRIE acts fast … FERRIE purchased $4, 500 of stock and gave the president) of the corporation $2, 000 for the machine. Neither FERRIE’s money nor the machine ever got together, and FERRIE came to me.” Author: “… David had created an excuse to bring his bogus CAP boys to the Honduras, where they could go “mining” and be trained in jungle warfare, while Ferrie could also have sexual", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:97:a1d791d1278e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5447, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 98, "text": "Kahunie Nut grows, in the jungles of Honduras.

The “Kahunie Nut” is the cahune nut. While it didn’t have the magical properties assigned to it, Dave knew his chemistry and would have studied its properties before making such an investment. It’s likely that the nut might have had oils of interest to NASA. “ From: Black….. at aol.com To: stoves at listserv.repp.org Sent: Friday, October 15, 2004 6:48 pm Subject: Cohune Nut Peter: I am researching a VERY obscure incident from 1960 or so, an apparent con game, where a promoter named Lawrence Taylor and a man named J. “Mac” McHenry took money from an investor to develop what has been described to me as the “Kahunie Nut”, or the “Carosa Nut”, in then-British Honduras. The nut could be crushed in a Jeep-mounted device, and the pulp would be of some value to NASA in the space program(!?!). This was supposedly complicated by the nut being protected as the “national plant”, or some such thing. I did a web search for “Nut British Honduras”, and I came upon your page, which mentions the “cohune nut”. This is so close to “Kahunie” that I wondered if you have any additional info about it. Does any of this ring a bell? Stephen Roy (query directed to this site: http://www.bioenergylists. org/newsgroup-archive/stoves/2004-October.htm). 3. The material about Ochsner and Heath is on record in Bill Davy’s book Let Justice Be Done, of which I knew nothing at the time. My whole family knows I never had any “JFK assassination” books. When I first brought up David’s connections with Ochsner, Heath and East Louisiana State Hospital at Jackson in 1999, nobody at that time knew of any records to back this up. Davy’s book was out, but mention of Heath and Ochsner was just in an obscure footnote. So nobody believed me, except Martin Shackelford, who knew about Davy’s rather obscure book, and likewise knew how ignorant I was of the assassination materials published there. For example, I posted to McAdams’ newsgroup, innocently believing that the hornet’s nest of disinformation artists there would welcome a new witness. Instead, they began attacking me before they knew how to properly spell my name. I was quite shocked at their rudeness to both me and to Shackelford, who defended me. 29.

(Retrieved Jan. 2, 2013). 30. Jack Martin, often reviled as a lying drunkard, actually knew so much that he was allowed inside every agency and police office. This excerpt demonstrates how much Martin knew about David Ferrie. He references the Crouchet case and other incidents with an insider’s knowledge: [corrected for linguistic and spelling errors of the transcriber] MARTIN:…[we met] in the Coffee Shop. So, anyway, Arcacha, tells me -I don’t trust this guy [Carlos Quiroga]. Ferrie speaks a good bit of Spanish. GER-VAIS: Ferrie does? MARTIN: Oh, yeah. He can take the – of the Romans Canons…You would swear he is reading English, but he’s reading Latin. He could cold turkey read Greek and he could cold turkey read Latin. I meant it and you will find out why. Well, anyway, I met Ferrie and he didn’t trust him [Quiroga] after what I knew about him. Arcacha knew him; - I had met Ferrie casually several different times. Then he got up in the St. Charles Hotel and he’d talk about Communists and Castro, Ferrie did. Now there’s a record of this speech he made in … the newspaper…. This is before he got knocked off in the queer operation. He was talking about Communism, and Cuban ideas and this and that and other things. Cubans didn’t like this bastard. I got along with him…. Carlos-Quiroga hated Ferrie with a passion. Arcacha used to accept Ferrie…. Arcacha was formerly with the Diplomatic Department in Cuba. Anyway, about this time, they started to close in on the Sergio Family, which was fouled up. I got hold of a friend of mine, a former FBI. I got hold of an investigator of the Naval O.N.I. (Office of the Naval Intelligence) to get his family down into the Guantanamo Naval Base and have them flown back to New Orleans and seen he got his people back. After that, Sergio trusted me more than he ever did, you know? He told me to lay off Ferrie. In the meantime, Ferrie got in on this deal where he allegedly formed a C.A.P.

When Castro came to power Jan. 1, 1959, Nazario and other independent guerrilla leaders faced execution. They left for Miami in 1961 and joined with other Cuban exiles to form Alpha 66 – named for its 66 original members….” AP obituary for Nazario, view at: http://jacksonville.com/apnews/stories/100804/D85J734G0. shtml (Retrieved July 1, 2013). 36. Of the charges, Stephen Roy (as Blackburst) wrote to Marsh in Sept.1999: “Ferrie was not let-off on morals charges due to some CIA intervention. He was tried on one charge and acquitted due to a technicality about dates. The other charges were nol-prossed when Ferrie convinced witness Mike Crouchet to withdraw the charges.” 42.

March 23, 1962: The New Orleans Project is born one week after US Attorney-General Robert Kennedy gives the green light to assassinate Castro. Drs. Ochsner, Sherman and others acquire the use of a secret linear particle accelerator that has come online at the U.S. Public Health Services Infectious Disease laboratories. Thousands of white mice will be tested for various secret purposes, under the eye of the CIA. The LINAC (linear particle accelerator) is guarded by armed Marines. Edward T.

The linear particle accelerator would be a key to developing a biological weapon on a fast track.1 April 1962: With a reduced income $300 a month from Gill) David falls behind on bills and is living beyond his means. Hence, Dave is helping Arcacha “in his advertising business.” To put Dave’s $300 income into perspective, Lee Harvey Oswald will be paid $230 a month for himself, wife and child at Reilys, in 1963. FBI: [Ferrie] stated that … some months after he ceased his activity with the organization, SERGIO ARCACHA SMITH gave up the leadership of the organization and then went into the advertising business in New Orleans and that he had assisted SMITH in preparing letters in connection with this advertising business.2 For extra income, Dave gives flying lessons and promotes himself as a psychology counselor. He also contacts Dr. Mary Sherman to see if she can arrange any paramedical work for him. When Sherman, who gives Dave some professional instruction, must be out of town, Dave is finally allowed to do some genuine lab work for her. It is just the beginning.3 An HSCA mug shot of Jack Martin identifies him as Suggs. David Lewis was Martin’s close companion for several years. He worked for Guy Banister in 1961 and 1962 as a gofer and investigator. After that, Lewis did occasional work for Banister under the table because his wife, Anna, had asked him to get a better-paying job. June 13, 1962: Lee Harvey Oswald, his Russian-born wife, Marina, and their infant daughter June Lee arrive in the United States. Oswald has spent almost three years in the USSR as a “defector” but inexplicably returns with a loan from the State Department, which he repays quickly. They settle in the Dallas, Texas area near family members, after first living with Lee’s mother, Marguerite, who is a nurse’s aide. July 21, 1962: A New Orleans States-Item article by William Stuckey (he interviews Lee Oswald in 1963): speaks of an anti-Castro training camp that InterPen has established near New Orleans: “Both Fiorini [Frank Sturgis of Watergate fame] and [Gerry] Patrick [Hemming] at one time had connections with Sanchez Arrango, former Minister under President Carlos Prio….

INTERPEN leaves Louisiana and returns to No Name Key, FL by mid-September; they later move to Big Pine Key, FL. On Sept. 18, Customs raids Hemming’s Pine Key camp, confiscating some weapons, but making no arrests. On the 24^(th) , FBI in Miami issues a document titled “INTERPEN.”11 Sept. 21, 1962: Archbishop Joseph F. Rummel, who has been fighting Judge Leander Perez, Banister’s friend, in the press, announces that segregation will end in all parochial schools in New Orleans in the 1962-1963 school year. Trouble is expected. Guy Banister and his mistress Delphine Roberts are furious, but David Ferrie supports the Archbishop wholeheartedly.12 Some say Dave had flown his desperately ill mother there to get her out of the fracas he was going through, while others say he got rid of her and essentially killed her by moving her when she was too ill to fly, and that she was a woman who was devastated by the charges of immorality against her son. Though Dave never told me his mother was dead, I assumed she was because he had her furniture and was saying Masses for her and his father. Oct. 28, 1962: The world sits on the brink of disaster, when secret negotiations suddenly defuse the time bomb. Kennedy’s generals are furious with him for being “soft on Communism.” Neither Kennedy nor Khrushchev will last much longer in their leadership positions. A USSR submarine captain and a US President who defies his generals, with the help of back-channel talks to Khrushchev via Bobby Kennedy, avert the annihilation of millions. “Now they’re going to find out about Cuba, they’re going to find out about the guns, find out about New Orleans, find out about everything.” – Jack Ruby, Lee Oswald’s assassin, HSCA Report, vol.

Reily and Co., one of the city’s largest coffee roasters. H. Eustis Reily was an INCA officer and director.17 Nov. 1962: A Southern Research background report shows two cars belong to David Ferrie. One is a 1960 Ford (to be repossessed in March, 1963). The other, a 1959 Ford, is “found registered to David W. Ferrie, Jr., 11 Prospect St. Alexandria, LA.” David’s friend, Alvin Beauboeuf, has relatives in Alexandria. Stephen Roy (Aug. 1-7, 2013 – comment has since been erased): David W. Ferrie, Jr. was a young Marine whose parents would not allow him to register the car, so David Ferrie registered the car in his name. He also said reporters were told by neighbors in 1963 that David rode his motorcycle all summer, and “none of his friends” saw him driving a car between March and November, 1963. This wasn’t the first time David Ferrie had pulled a stunt like this.18 Dave’s 1960 Ford was repossessed in March, but the 1959 Ford (a rambling wreck) was still available, legally, to him. The young Marine, dubbed “Ferrie, Jr.” was absent months at a time, and wouldn’t keep his “adopted father’s” car at his disapproving parents’ address. It was almost certainly hidden from them, which is why it wouldn’t be openly kept at Dave’s, either. Dave did not use this vehicle regularly: he may have used it occasionally to keep the battery from running down. Perhaps this is why it had so much trouble starting (which I experienced). Of course, motorcycles make a lot of noise when used, and my presence at his apartment was discrete, so Dave would not take me anywhere on his Harley. Nov. 1962: David’s financial situation worsens. He is now being trained by Dr. Sherman for an hour or so a day, probably at the Mouse House or at her private lab on Prytania St. But Dave won’t be paid much until March 1963, when Ochsner’s Clinic at Prytania St. will make its massive move to Ochsner’s Hospital in Jefferson Parish, after which Dave’s work load will increase to a level that will require help to continue, especially as Dave’s work for Marcello also starts to increase.

Nov. 19, 1962: Al Meister, CAP Commander, rips into David’s character to Southern Research investigators for the FAA: “…Meister advised that he had heard through cadet sources ‘that subject is possibly a homosexual,’ and also that Ferrie “hated women.” Meister called him ‘officious and dictatorial’ and added that Ferrie ‘wears a toupee, possibly self-made.’ Meister also said ‘Ferrie was instrumental in persuading him to go into the seminary.’” Also, Southern Research is told that David illegally “[allowed] use of [plane] rider pass to George Piazza, who Ferrie claimed was his “ward.”19 Dec. 31, 1962: David’s Taylorcraft L-2’s certificate expires. It was last flown on Sept. 9, 1962 “apparently in connection with a funeral,” (Blackburst’s observation). Could this be when David was visiting his mother, who was sent away? She died Sept. 26. The Taylorcraft will be taken for engine repairs to a friend’s service station “in early 1963” where it will be dismantled.22 The Atlantic: In 1963 [the CIA] seriously examined “whether an exotic seashell, rigged to explode, could be deposited …where Castro commonly went skin diving.”… a diving suit “dusted … with a fungus that would produce a chronic skin disease (Madura foot), and contaminated the breathing apparatus with a tubercule bacillus.” … “a ball-point pen rigged with a hypodermic needle” filled with Blackleaf-40 poison…. The CIA contact in Cuba who was given the pen, “did not ‘think much of the device,” and complained that CIA could surely “come up with something more sophisticated than that.”23 In fact, CIA did come up with something more sophisticated: a virulent lung cancer, to use as a biological weapon to kill Castro. It was being developed in New Orleans. Plausibly deniable, easily hidden, and injectable, Ochsner’s lung cancer project may never be made public because cancer as an assassination tool might still be in use today. Friends of Democratic Cuba’s William Dalzell, Guy Banister’s former business partner, has been placed in a mental hospital, according to an FBI report dated 6/30/1967. That made sure nobody listened to him. Placing unwanted or inconvenient informants into a mental hospital occurred again and again in this era, in New Orleans. From the beginning, the attorneys for Eastern Air Lines caught Dave in one lie after another; from his very first application form, to having a legitimate PhD, to having a legitimate CAP charter for the Falcons, to his absurd claim that he was so adept at staying out of jail that Eastern should consider that feat as a sufficient qualification to be an Eastern pilot.24 March 1963: Ochsner’s Clinic", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:104:4d8e841cc4e0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5454, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 105, "text": "hospital occurred again and again in this era, in New Orleans.

The move makes the front page due to its colossal size and impact on traffic. A former FBI agent supervises.25 Here’s how the Mouse House got set up: A caravan of trucks went back and forth all day in a procession, moving the Clinic, but one truck was diverted. It delivered equipment, cages, supplies and test animals to Ochsner and Sherman’s clandestine animal testing lab, close to David’s apartment. Thus stocked and equipped, David Ferrie began to supervise cancer injections into weanling mice. He had at least two assistants, both Cuban. tumors) to deliver in minutes to Dave’s nearby apartment, on demand. There, Dave killed the mice, inspected their tumors under a microscope, then created test tube cultures and extracts of a radiation-altered SV40-derived cancer-causing virus. Dr. Sherman got these materials next. Dave broke what would have been a connected chain of related labs, keeping researchers in other labs in the dark, as to what The Project was about. 1963: David Ferrie’s Neighbors: The Franz family told me who was living in David’s immediate neighborhood in 1963. In the house to the right of David’s apartment, Peter and Irma Gentile lived upstairs. Leonard W. Franz and his wife, Irma, lived downstairs with their son, 14-year-old L.J. In the house to the left, Mr. and Mrs. Lupo lived upstairs and Edward and Velda Kalinsky lived downstairs. “He was nothing but a very nice man,” said a Franz family member. “He rode the bus a lot.” Except for his Eastern Air Lines hearings, little has been reported regarding David Ferrie’s activities between March 1963 and the with work for G. Wray Gill and analyzing autopsy and medical reports for Guy Banister, was being trained by Dr. Mary Sherman. By March, he was part of Dr. Sherman’s team. Beyond working part time for both Guy Banister and G. Wray Gill, with an occasional flying lesson and trips out of town, David was as busy as ever.

A very close friend of many years said that Ferrie was given to braggadocio, but was not engaged in any secret activities. Since Ferrie’s death, a few people have come forward to allege various tales of Ferrie’s involvement in such activities, but none of them pan out, none seem consistent with the provable record…. But this is by no means a final verdict … who knows what might pop up someday?26 The CIA abandoned Bob Levinson and lied, saying he was never CIA: After years of secrecy, the family of the former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran seven years ago, Robert Levinson… accused the CIA, FBI and the Obama administration of – “betraying” him by not doing enough to gain his release … David McGee, a family lawyer … told ABC News the CIA and the FBI betrayed Levinson as it tried to hide the fact that he had a longterm relationship with the CIA, spying on Iran’s nuclear program and on the terror group Hezbollah … Levinson disappeared from Iran’s Kish Island in 2007. In testimony before Congress, CIA officials gave testimony, denying any relationship with Levinson. “Absolute, bold faced lie,” said McGee. Only after McGee and his paralegal obtained access to Levinson’s computer files, were they able to prove the secret relationship, said McGee. ‘The CIA issued a formal apology to the family,’ said McGee, who then negotiated a $2.5 million settlement between the government and the Levinson family.27 7. “The first of the three was Judge Leander Perez, 70, a parish judge from St. Bernard Parish, who called on Catholics to withhold donations to the Archdiocese and to boycott Sunday church collections. The second was Jackson G. Ricau, 44, political commentator, segregationist writer, and director of the “Citizens Council of South Louisiana”.

Time magazine, 12/12/1960 offers an example of what angered David about Perez: “…when New Orleans’ Roman Catholic Archbishop Joseph F. Rummel declared that segregation was sinful, Leander Perez breathed defiance.

(Retrieved July 7, 2013). Apr. 15, 1963: Dr. Alton Ochsner phones me, after having trained me to handle cancer-causing viruses by his close friends. I had been researching how to detect cancer with a blood test. Ochsner invites me to a “summer internship” with Dr. Mary Sherman, with a fasttrack entry in the fall to Tulane Medical School, all expenses paid, plus a stipend. I accept. Pre-med friends, such as Kathy Santi (who will become a doctor), hear I’ll soon be leaving University of Florida to go to Tulane. Apr. 17, 1963: I tell my lover, Robert Baker (an English Major I steered into geology and math) that I am leaving UF forever. Robert says he will follow and marry me, if it can be kept secret. Robert’s parents, who are paying for his college education, will disown him if he marries before graduation. Since Robert must return to UF to finish his English degree, I don’t tell him I plan to stay in New Orleans, fearing he won’t marry me if he knows that. Robert, slated for summer work in his parents’ real estate office, will ask permission to go. He soon starts applying for geology jobs in New Orleans. April 18 -19, 1963: I get a pre-paid bus ticket from Dr. Ochsner. Because UF, newly on the trimester system, is shutting down, I decide to leave now, believing Ochsner has pre-arranged housing at the YWCA. Ochsner’s friend, Sen. George Smathers, would have placed me in a summer research program at University of Miami, where I had many anti-Castro friends.

But when I arrive I learn that Ochsner and Sherman are out of town, and no prepaid room exists. I select the cheapest room available, already housing four other girls.

Naïve and vulnerable in rough, tough New Orleans, I’ve already seen and heard almost unbelievable things. I need to be protected until the doctors return and can set things straight. Apr. 25-26, 1963: Lee Oswald arrives in New Orleans after midnight on the 25th. He stores his boxes and luggage in lockers at the bus terminal, then checks into the YMCA. In the morning, he drops some boxes and three sea-bags off with his Aunt Lillian Murret. That night, Lee dines with David Ferrie.3 On the 26^(th) , I meet Lee at the post office at about 10:00 am. I have been told that the Airline Highway Royal Castle was used as a dead drop and meeting place for Bobby Kennedy’s surveillance team that was keeping track of Carlos Marcello. The Town & Country Motel, behind which was Marcello’s office, was visible from the Royal Castle’s parking lot. The Royal Castle was open 24 hours a day. Apr. 27, 1963: Lee Oswald eats breakfast at the Royal Castle, and later that day introduces me to David Ferrie at the Kopper Kitchen on Tulane Ave.4 “Captain Ferrie” wears a pilot’s cap and jacket, but wrinkled trousers. He wears a cheap ring that, later, I learn was made from an Eastern Air Lines pin by one of David’s CAP cadets. I will not see it again. dences and name-dropping combine to convince both him and Lee that I’m the requested tech. I am made aware that “Dr. Ferrie” is conducting some independent cancer research with Dr. Sherman. “Dr.” Ferrie says he’ll order anything I want or need. As for me, I’m confused.

The party is shut down. Mon. Apr. 29, 1963: I needed convincing, after all I’ve seen, that the cancer research project, involving plans to assassinate Fidel Castro, is legitimate and government sanctioned. Posing as Lee’s wife (I spoke some Russian and resembled Marina), I met Guy Banister’s secretaries and a male investigator before Banister welcomed me into his private office (he knew who I really was). I was impressed by the certificates on the wall and Banister’s stern assurance that Lee Oswald and David Ferrie were dedicated patriots who could be trusted. Previously unpublished is a short conversation I had with Guy that Dave Ferrie and his Cuban friends talked about killing both Castro and Kennedy. That made him laugh. “Compared to me,” Banister said, “Ferrie’s JFK’s guardian angel. I’m the one who thinks Kennedy ought to be shot!” Seeing my jaw drop, he quickly added, “But I follow the law of the land. We all do, here. I’m not serious about shooting that SOB. It’s just the way we talk in New Orleans.” Seeing I still wasn’t comfortable with what he’d just said, Banister added, soothingly, “We’re a team, trying to save the country from going down the drain. We’re working together, to save Ferrie, Banister assured me, would often float ideas like that to measure the Cubans’ reactions. It was part of his job as an undercover agent working within the Cuban exile community. As for Ferrie’s cancer research, his reports were photocopied on Banister’s own Xerox machine, in his office, before they were “sent to some big-wig in Georgia.”5 Ferrie’s project was legitimate. Even the CIA was backing it, along with the city’s crime boss, Carlos Marcello. Banister was quite serious. Marcello might have been born foreign, he said, but that Dago was a red-blooded American when it came to kicking out the Communists from Cuba. However, things could get complicated, Banister emphasized. Not for one instant should you trust Marcello. Even so, Banister said, important people were right behind everything they were up to, even their associating with the Mob in order to get useful information. So if I saw Ferrie working with Marcello, said Banister, all I had to do was remember that even Bobby Kennedy was collecting information about Marcello from Ferrie.6 Banister abruptly changed the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:109:a5a2fd3d2cd1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5459, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 110, "text": "to kicking out the Communists from Cuba.

So if I saw Ferrie working with Marcello, said Banister, all I had to do was remember that even Bobby Kennedy was collecting information about Marcello from Ferrie.6 Banister abruptly changed the subject and began talking about his special files. I was even shown where they were stored, accessible only by means of Banister’s private stairs (the stairs were under construction and would soon be hard to see behind a drywall). Banister proudly explained that these were secret files that David Ferrie had been helping him with. “The police are so damned corrupt here,” Banister said, “that the only way we can keep them honest is to accumulate evidence to blackmail them with, when they step out of line.” Atop that, Banister had information “about every nigger and Black Muslim, especially Malcolm X^(′) as well as on every subversive organization and their leaders. It was all handy, with index cards. Information was his business, Banister boasted, and these files were the really important ones. Then Guy Banister told me that Lee Oswald was being groomed to do his part to save Cuba from Communism. With these comments, my concerns about Lee and Ferrie’s loyalties – and Ferrie’s outlandish claims about Kennedy and Castro –were put to rest, though I wasn’t sure what to think about Mr. Banister. After we left the office, I asked Lee to explain why Guy Banister had taken up the job of blackmailing the local police. Lee explained the situation: Banister came from the FBI to be the city’s Deputy Chief of Police, to root out corruption, but his stay was brief. Lee intimated that Banister may have been framed because he found out too much, though Banister’s quick temper could have contributed. Dismissed and disgraced, Banister was determined to get revenge. He started a private investigation agency as a front for his real work, which focused on a variety of anti-Castro activities, but he also hired spies to gather incriminating evidence against the hated New Orleans Police and the city’s corrupt politicians. Ironically, Banister ended up being paid for these efforts by Carlos Marcello’s attorney. But, Lee cautioned, despite Banister’s moralistic veneer, his closeness to the local FBI, and his connections to Bobby Kennedy through a trusted local FBI agent, the old man was vulnerable because he had taken Mrs. Roberts, his secretary, as a mistress, abandoning his wife.

He is now aware that I should never have known about the sinister nature of The Project. I also learn that David Ferrie and Lee Oswald had a rocky start to their friendship. In fact, it was violent. A partial section of a page I wrote while David expounded on his second all-night lecture, based on his knowledge of philosophy. I wrote it with green ink, using a fountain pen and ink Lee Oswald had in his possession. Lee wrote (page below -partial section) in the summer of 1963 also using the same Sanford green ink. It is part of a 9-page essay comparing US and USSR political systems, revealing Lee’s intelligence and his anti-communist beliefs.11 peRsevaLized 6y YneomMuNisrPARry U,s., hAsTUxNCdiiSCIE iNT A\"vALUBIE GoId coiNCFThE KREMLiN.irnASFAIEd TO dENOuCe PnyncTieNs:FTnc sevieroreRmeNTwhenimiLAR nTiiNsC The PnRT SF ThE t.S.GOMBAiN- sicu,prcTe,r.Ex4MrIes: BAiN- sicu,prcTe,r.Ex4MrIes:EENCuNecdi Niioersuvced:lniTed srarrs RUSSiAARmbeBrer Bemb Tesr-VBA MUR'bARYx4,L,mavvvel- WHRSAW PACT MIANUVERL-2 stBELLeni-t E4STeRN SERmeNy 2the individual surpresstion and regimentation under Krushchev.Thedeportations,thepurposefull curtailment of dietintheconsumer slightedpopu-lation of Russia,the murder of history，the prositution of art and culture.Thecomnrunist movement in theU.S.,pergonalized by the,Communist Party U.S.A.has turned itself into a“valublegold coin”of the Kremlin.it has failed to denouceany aetions of the Soviet Goverment when similar actions on the part of the U.S.Goverment bring piousprotest.

Lee shows up again at Royal Castle, and orders breakfast.12 After he eats, he makes a bunch of phone calls, using the restaurant’s popular payphone. Only later will I realize that if I had paid attention, I’d be able to figure out who Bobby Kennedy’s surveillance people were, who were reporting on Carlos Marcello’s activities. And only after that will I realize that Marcello would have had his own spies there, watching who used the payphone. At least today, I know better than to ask Lee what all the phone calls are about. If he’s allowed to tell me, I know he will. We talk easily as we ride the bus back to town together, and finally, Lee tells me he’s also been talking to Dave Ferrie. The good news is that Dave has spoken to Dr. Sherman about her aloofness, and I’m not to worry. Everything is OK. Dr. Sherman will meet me soon, and she still wants me to work with her. Apparently, she did not want to talk at the party because I’d shown too much emotion when I came up so eagerly to meet her. “Nobody would be there until after he’s home from work,” Lee assures me. “By then, you’d be long gone. And every hour spent helping Dave will count toward your internship, so he hopes you’ll do it. He says you’re really the only “untraceable one” we have. That’s exactly how Dave put it. The only one. Untraceable.” I confess to Lee that by “acting out a role” I feel like I’m actually working for the CIA as an untraceable asset, and he smiles, shaking his head. Lee has already explained that some people who work for the CIA never know that they do. They’re “unwitting.” Even in the Company (that’s what Lee calls it) Lee says that the names of the “case officers” are probably fake. When I ask Lee to tell me more, he clams up. I’ve gone too far. The news from Dr. Sherman relieves me immensely, but the internship I’m supposed to fulfill is becoming a complex matter. And how should I explain David Ferrie to Robert Baker? Or will I have to?

By May 3rd, he leaves for the Gulf of Mexico, refusing to give me any contact details because he thinks I might follow. Robert thinks I still have my Royal Castle job, but I was fired. He thinks I still have a roof over my head, but that same night, at 1:00 am, May 4, I am evicted during a raid (my landlady, Mrs.Webber, runs a brothel). When the police raid had carried off a lorry-load full of girls dressed in feathers, handcuffs and nail polish, I was left on the sidewalk with everything I owned, alone, in the darkness, pondering how I never had noticed that the place was a whorehouse. Penniless and abandoned, I find the St. George Episcopal Church, where Father Bill Richardson and wife, Mary, take me in.13 Next day, Lee Oswald comes to rescue me, finding me a new apartment (1032 Marengo) not far from where he will be living a week later (4905 Magazine St). Lee tells me he will soon be living close by. May 6, 1963: Jack Ruby (introduced to me as “Sparky Rubenstein”) arrives at David’s apartment from the airport in Carlos Marcello’s old two-tone Chevy (Carlos’ brother, Sammy, provided the vehicle). Sergio Arcacha Smith, Bill Gaudet and a pockmarked, heavyset Latino (name was not disclosed) arrive by cab. Early that evening, “Sparky”14 brought up some barbells with blue weights for Dave. He was athletic for his fifty-three years, walking on his hands around Dave’s book-cluttered living room to show off in front of me. He then gave me $50 when he heard I had been cheated by my landlady, Mrs. Webber; who he seemed to know. The way he said, “I’ll talk to her,” gave me the chills. Dave and Lee had advised me to act like “a dumb broad,” these gentlemen welcomed my presence as a kind of showpiece for their dinner table, while at the same time, they talked indiscreetly about their plans, as if my IQ matched my bra size. Sparky was both charming and frightening. It was obvious that Sparky and David Ferrie had been friends for a while.

Sparky was both charming and frightening. It was obvious that Sparky and David Ferrie had been friends for a while. As for Sparky and Lee, they had known each other since Lee was a boy, playing at the picnics and parties that Marcello’s family hosted. Lee’s mother had even dated Marcello’s driver. Her lawyer and friend, Clem Sehrt, was one of Marcello’s business attorneys. Sehrt would show up on Aug. 10, 1963 to bail Lee out of jail after he was arrested for handing out pro-Castro “Hands Off Cuba” flyers and leaflets to create his pro-Castro image. Such an image would later be useful to both the CIA and to the Mafia. Lee had volunteered to be sent to Cuba. The rumor at the table was that he’d already been there in the past, and now, thanks to David Ferrie and Marcello’s ever-handy fleet of light planes, he’d been there again for a look-around. Dave even set Lee up for a free flying lesson. Lee was already halfway there, Dave said, as a co-pilot. The passion to murder Castro had created a coalition between the Mafia and the CIA, and Lee stood with a foot in both their houses. Ironically, David Ferrie was now in the same position, in a small way: while working for Carlos Marcello, he was also working for Guy Banister. Dave told me that Banister was in touch with the Attorney General, Bobby Kennedy himself. Dave said Banister was being driven to drink and distraction over how things were turning out. Mostly due to his own bad temper and sense of importance, Banister found himself forced into a position so alien to his nature that it was driving him crazy. The great Red Raider, the mighty anti-Communist, the FBI chieftain over 500 men in Chicago, was now working with Carlos Marcello Just thinking about it, Dave said, was enough to make Banister open another bottle of Scotch. “If he realized that half the people working for him are homosexuals,” Dave finished, ”I think he’d shoot himself.” Dave grinned. “I’m tempted to tell him, if he pisses me off one more time, just to see which blood vessels burst first – the ones on his alcoholic nose, or the ones inside his alcoholic brain.” As for Lee, Dave respected him. To me, that was some kind of triumph on Lee’s part, because Dave respected fewer people than he had fingers.

Weberman: Jack Rubenstein … changed his name to Jack Ruby in 1947…. Ruby was associated with the Marcello family soldiers, or capos, in Dallas. These men included R. D. Matthews … Joe Civello … Joe Campisi … Sam Campisi … and Ralph Paul.15 … In June, 1961, Helen Afanace Ryan told Agents Kenneth Howe and Robert Gemberling that she knows JACK RUBY and that he is ‘no good.’ She stated he will not permit a girl to work for him unless she is intimate with him. [FBI DL-137-976 6.5.61 May 10, 1963: Lee and I are hired at Standard Coffee, a small offshoot of Reily’s, where we will stay for one week while our background checks are laundered and I learn how to function as a secretary for Reily’s Vice President, ex-FBI agent William I. Monaghan. A week later, we both transfer from Standard to Reily with the laundered background reports that do not mention cancer research or years spent in the USSR as a so-called defector.16 When Dr. Sherman shows me a powerful new cancer developed over the past year, I am stunned by its vigor. I agree to do what I can to stabilize the cancer and help transfer it from a mouse cancer to one that will attack human tissues. Only later will I realize that the cancer could be stolen and used to silence political enemies “forever.” I was puzzled that I’d heard Dave tell the Cubans at his party that Kennedy ought to die for what he’d done to them. He’d ranted against JFK, and I was deeply worried about that, until we started talking. “Do you think I’d have any of them coming over to my place, if I sang “Hail to the Chief?” he asked me – more than once. My friends at University of Florida – which at that time specialized in science and engineering – had shaped a lot of my political thinking. Men greatly outnumbered the women there.

Many were anti-Castro Cubans who hated the President passionately. We could not guess what we were about to lose – not yet. To both Dave and Lee, I eventually voiced my displeasure with Kennedy – the coward, the pinko – who kept giving in to Russia’s leader, Nikita Khrushchev. My anti-Castro friends, in particular, believed JFK was a traitor who let hundreds die during the Bay of Pigs debacle. He had looked the other way as they begged for help on their radios. I remember how Lee and Dave just looked at me with pity and shook their heads. “They don’t understand,” Lee said. “He saved millions of lives by refusing to bomb Havana.” “Fact is,” Lee said, “besides missiles, the Soviets could load up over a hundred bombers with atomic bombs, and send them on after the missiles. And then they have at least 50 submarines that could launch atom bombs at us.”18 Lee shook his head. “We of course would launch our own bombers, submarines and missiles. We have many more than they do. Life on the planet would be over.” en the task of learning how to keep marmosets alive. They’re cheaper than regular monkeys because of their tiny size. If the marmosets get cancer fast enough, Dave says, the next rung on the ladder is the African Green Monkey. If that works, one or more human volunteers with terminal diseases will be used to test the bioweapon’s power. Another concern is an upcoming gun-running operation. David likes one of my ideas on how to conceal the rifles that will be coming in from Venezuela. He speculates that they might have been stockpiled there by Cuban guerrillas. He isn’t sure. Before the Venezuela arms shipment arrives, Lee’s job will be to help ferret out pro-Castro stevedores who might be spies, as well as FBI informants. Hoover’s FBI, he says, loves to get the President in trouble by deliberately picking on anti-Castro training camps. Morning, June 4, 1963: David Ferrie and Lee join others at a meeting at Guy Banister’s office, to discuss strategies on protecting the incoming arms shipment from Venezuela. Lee mentions that he could get arrested at the docks. Banister assures him it won’t be like Dallas. The FBI will keep everything about Lee low key in New Orleans.”19 A. J.

Weberman: The Warren Commission found no identifying records to show that RUBY was in a hotel or anywhere else between the nights of June 5, 1963, and June 8, 1963. Was RUBY staying at Churchill Downs [sic], the multi-million dollar estate where CAR-LOS MARCELLO lived? [WC Hearings V14 p150; HSCA V4 p198] By June 9, 1963, RUBY was back in Dallas. I’ve been out there. This was no “lap of luxury” establishment. Churchill Farms was huge. A lot of it was swamp. The big farmhouse was just that – a big farmhouse. The barns were just barns. There was a lot of space for parking. Carlos had some mansions, but not on this property. I wish I hadn’t been so sore-footed that afternoon, or I would have walked around and looked for horses. Only the men were going into the farmhouse, as far as I could tell. David Ferrie would spend a number of days and nights at Churchill Farms, a safe place to meet, as Marcello’s trial date drew closer. June 6, 1963, evening: David Ferrie invites Lee and me, and David Lewis and his wife Anna to the 500 Club, compliments of Jack Ruby. (I know him as “Sparky.”) Ruby greets us when we arrive, but we are seated apart from the main group. Marcello soon appears with brothers Sammy and Pete, and a bodyguard, taking one of three reserved tables. Adjoining tables are occupied by Clay Shaw seated with a married couple, Banister’s pilot-partner Hugh Ward, “Sparky,” an official from Terry Smith Stevedoring, and his wife. I watch Lee briefly go and meet Marcello face to face.20 Sunday, June 16, 1963: Lee Oswald passes out “Hands off Cuba!” flyers stamped with “A.J. Hidell” at the USS Wasp dock site on the Dumaine Wharf to help ferret out those pro-Castro spies. By the time he is told to leave by security authorities, he’s been there several hours.21 The Wasp carries 2,400 men and officers.

It is the first time I’ve heard the voice of any other doctor working in The Project. Dr. Ochsner has let a little bit of the size of the team be known to me. I am surprised when Lee joins me at lunchtime. Instead of going directly to Dave’s apartment to work, we meet Dave for lunch at Katzenjammer’s, a haunt of Guy Banister’s. Dave is seated in the farthest corner, wearing the familiar fatigues and sunglasses. There are several small boxes stacked on the floor beside him. As we sit down, I am told to keep my eyes and voice low. I should pretend that I can speak only Russian when the waiter comes to get our orders. “Gill is a good man,” Dave says. “So let me tell you how he got involved with the Little Man. It begins in 1934. A long time ago for a little chickadee like you. But listen.” Dave tells me. “You might want to hear this, too,” he tells Lee. “It all started when Gill was asked to defend a 28-year-old farmer who didn’t want a livestock inspector to confiscate his mule.” “There is,” Dave says. “The mule had ticks. But the mule belonged to the guy’s dad. He said he didn’t have a right to dip the mule for ticks. He had to wait until his dad came home. The inspector was enraged. He tried to confiscate the mule, on the spot. The young man refused to give up the mule, so the inspector came back with three deputy sheriffs. The mule was yielded up, but the sheriffs decided to arrest the young farmer. When his younger brother protested, a brawl started. They shot the brother in the stomach. He died a bit later.” “Oh!” I managed to say. David hurried on. “The young farmer, himself, was shot in the thigh. He managed to make it into the house, where he got his shotgun. He then killed one of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:118:38bd38d4a493", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5468, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 119, "text": "the mule, so the inspector came back with three deputy sheriffs.

He then killed one of the deputy sheriffs, as they were shooting two more of his brothers. One was just twelve years old. But there’s more.” We are all ears. “The deputies not only arrested the young farmer and the dying brother. They also arrested his mother, his uncle, and his sisters as well. They even arrested his dad, who wasn’t even present at the time.” Dave pauses to let this sink in, then says, “The young man, one of his brothers named Luther, and his mother were all charged with murder. The defense was given only three days to make its case. In the end, the young farmer was sentenced to death by hanging.” Then Dave lets the blow land. “You see, they were niggers; and this was 1934.” “By then it was early 1935. But the same day Wilson’s new trial was to begin, based on the appeal Gill won for him, the jail was stormed by a mob. They weren’t about to let this thing go to trial. Wilson was clubbed to death with a hammer. They threw his body in a ditch. As for the Sheriff, he told the Press, ‘They were just going about their business.’ As for Gill, after that, he couldn’t get much work, unless it was somebody who didn’t know he was a ‘nigger lover.’ He finally found himself defending other victims of Sheriffs and police. More and more, that meant he found himself defending somebody in the Mob. And that’s how he happened to become one of Marcello’s lawyers. That’s what Gill told me.” Changing the subject, Dave reveals that Dr. Ochsner has corralled INCA’s newest advisor, Herbert Philbrick, who will come soon to New Orleans to give a special, private lecture in a Reily boardroom. Lee is excited: this is why he had decided to take the cover job at Reily’s to begin with, rather than work as a photographer. Ochsner has promised to introduce Lee to Philbrick, using a fake name for Lee. In the 1950’s, Philbrick had posed as a die-hard communist, while actually secretly working for the FBI. Later, he wrote the book I Led Three Lives, which was turned into a TV series that mesmerized Lee when he was a young teen in New York. Lee is pleased, but then he says, “I have to get back to Reily’s right away, unless you were able to pick up those ballasts for", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:119:f1a0288ade73", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5469, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 120, "text": "Lee to Philbrick, using a fake name for Lee.

Lee is pleased, but then he says, “I have to get back to Reily’s right away, unless you were able to pick up those ballasts for me.” “Yes, Banister’s project,” says Dave. “The training film. I’m a Commander there, you might say. I’ll be teaching leadership, handto-hand combat. Lee will be teaching stuff, too. CIA is there, too, when we’re ready to film. It’s how we’re proving we still want to help the anti-Castroites; secretly, of course. Since Lee already told you about the training film,” Dave looks disparagingly at Lee, “with that big mouth of his, you might as well hear about the rest of it.” In the following conversation, I am providing the real names in place of false ones that Lee and Dave adopted in this public place when they referred to JFK, RFK, Khrushchev, Castro, etc. Further, I am not as certain about who said what in this conversation, as I have been about the conversations in Me & Lee. However, I feel it’s necessary to tell all I can remember. “Kennedy has his back to the wall about Castro,” Dave says, lighting a cigarette. “And it’s getting worse. We’ve got a group that’s taking things into their own hands. They’re dangerous. The last thing we need, right now, is a second camp that’s training anti-Castro troublemakers. A rogue camp that’s located almost on top of our own.” Dave nods in agreement. “The Russians might try to stay,” he says, “but we would claim the island in the name of ‘Peace.’ Promising to restore order, we’ll put the old regime back in power. All will be hunky-dory. Especially United Fruit, mining interests, casino owners, and drug rings. That’s how you invade without dropping bombs. Unless the Russkies decide to drop them.” “The Kennedy brothers see it,” Lee comments. “They’re playing some poker, too. By cutting off funds to the anti-Castro training camps, and so on, the President is sending a message to Castro that negotiations are possible.” Lee has eaten nothing at all, he’s so worked up. I push half a sandwich toward him. He takes a bite, but keeps on talking. “Also, this way, Castro might let down his guard, making it easier to assassinate him. It could be blamed on some handy lunatic. Second, with Kennedy speaking so softly, the USSR’s generals might not get rid of Khrushchev.” “Yes, my befuddled child,” Dave says. “Ever hear of the Dulles brothers?

Just the two of them ran the coups that overthrew Iran and Guatemala.27 Allen wouldn’t allow Congress to supervise his precious CIA. When he disobeyed JFK, he was fired, but his replacement, John McCone – chosen by JFK – is mostly out of the loop.28 Truth is, Dulles is still in charge of a lot of his troops, behind the scenes. And they like LBJ.”29 Dave makes a fake laugh. “Johnson already has more respect with the military and all the agencies than Kennedy could ever muster. Johnson’s an arm-twister. He has the Senate and the House on their knees, sucking away. They will fall right in line. And because Johnson is corrupt as hell, FBI has a lot of dirt on him. CIA and FBI will ride him like a pony.” Dave points to Lee. “He’ll find out if any pro-Castro spies are hanging around out in the camps – if he can. One spy could do a lot of damage. Find out about our important camp, then tell the FBI. The FBI wants to shut down everything – to make JFK even more hated. So your Lee, here, has gotta be careful. He could get shot out there, if somebody blames him.” “Go get some more,” he says. As Lee heads to the bar, Dave says, “Even Dr. Mary’s doing her bit. She’s gone out to the ‘good’ camp, with some medical supplies. It’s out in no man’s land, other side of the Lake, a hard place to be. So don’t talk to anybody about her, either.” Lee stands up – he has to return to Reily. He reaches down and takes my hand. Dave, all wound up, has a little more to tell us. “Banister says those rich bastards at the right-wingers’ camp have their own swimming pool. They’re sitting right next to a U-Haul full of explosives and war materiel,” Dave says. “Usually, I’d say, let this half-assed camp just fall on its face. But since Hoover wants to break up every damned training camp he can find, and blame it on JFK—”30 In his famous Playboy interview, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison explained what he understood about the anti-Castro/ Radical right situation: “…both of these groups had a vital stake in changing U.S. foreign policy – ideological on the part of the paramilitary rightists and both ideological and personal with the anti-Castro exiles, many of whom felt they would never see their homes again if Kennedy’s policy of detente was allowed to succeed.

The CIA was involved with both of these groups. In the New Orleans area, where the conspiracy was hatched, the CIA was training a mixed bag of Minutemen, Cuban exiles and other anti-Castro adventurers north of Lake Pontchartrain for a foray into Cuba and an assassination attempt on Fidel Castro. David Ferrie, who operated on the “command” level of the ultra-rightists, was deeply involved in this effort.31 Friday July 12, 1963: Dave Ferrie is back in town, and is helping us with the unpleasant task of slaughtering mice. Though we are nearly finished with mice, this last batch involves an astonishing 500 animals to process. Lee comes to Reily a half hour early today so he can get an early start at Dave’s. For the first time in five weeks, I clock him out at 5:00, so we can get the work finished earlier. Even Dr. Sherman has come to help. With the summer heat and the stench of cancer, all of us get nauseated. “You’ll be home in a couple of minutes now, sport,” Dave tells Lee, who has put his head out the window to get some fresh air. But Dave likes to tease. “Those baby mice were the saddest, most tormented little creatures I have ever seen,” Dave says, in a falsetto voice, shaking his head, as we sit there. “To think that they fought so hard for their lousy little shreds of life, only to be gassed to death.” Dave throws his cigarette out the car window and lights another one. “Listen,” he goes on, “…You’d better know what your boy Lee, here, is up against; and, me too. We’re risking our lives to get this stuff [the biological weapon] into Cuba. Yes, we’re saying we want to help them take out JFK, and they believe us. God help us, they still want to see Castro die, too. If that son-of-abitch Castro is eliminated, we might save more than Kennedy. We might save the whole god-damned country from becoming a fascist nation.” I’m angry at Dave, who thinks he knows everything. I think of all I’ve been taught, growing up.

In the lives of my future children. We can be honest. We can protect the land, teach people to care about each other. Can’t we? Without Dave’s help, we are falling behind on finishing up our lab work at Dave’s apartment. The Project has become dangerous, as well, so Dr. Sherman make a rare visit, coming with a portable lab bench. It uses inserted gloves, a filtering system, and keeps conditions sterile. We work hard; Dave is expected to return from Miami late that afternoon, in time to help with the cleanup.32 Wednesday July 17, 1963: A Day of Revelation – At Reily, I receive another complaint that Lee is missing, and I am required to examine his woefully incomplete work log book. I locate Lee by phone at Dave’s. Lee says that Ochsner has insisted he process a final batch of mice. It makes us furious, because it’s actually unnecessary. The marmosets have cancer. We should be handling marmosets. On top of this anticipated afternoon absence, Lee is late again this morning. Knowing he will be working late at Dave’s on the Project tonight, Lee had decided to spend a little extra time with his family, and missed the bus. At about noon, personnel has just about had it with Mr. Lee H. Oswald. We have been instructed to hire a replacement for Lee at once. I help Monaghan go through a list of new applicants for Lee’s job, and we find a man to recommend whose background check is incomplete. That will buy Lee, at most, one more week. We only have to keep Lee employed at Reily’s until next Wednesday, since he has to be in Mobile to speak at Spring Hill seminary that Friday. With Lee preparing for his pro-Castro demonstrations, right in the heart of town, his cover job at Reily’s has to end soon anyway, because such activities would embarrass the company. Mr. William Monaghan, my boss, is quite annoyed that I won’t be returning to Reily this afternoon, but I remind him it might be the last time.

Seeing that, I am concerned. Dr. Mary’s hands are thrust into this “clean box” into which air is pumped in, then out, through high-grade filters to prevent airborne contaminants from floating around the kitchen and into our lungs. Dr. Mary notices that I am staring at the equipment, wondering why she has ratcheted up the precautions so suddenly. It’s because our marmosets are dying. All of them, including the control group. I ponder the implications. Our bioweapon has migrated between both groups of monkeys, unfettered, presenting the terrifying possibility that our mutated cancer is not only transferable, but contagious. From this moment on, we need to be concerned about catching these cancer-causing viruses. For the next hour, I work with the microscopes, until Dave shows up. He’s quite late, but that’s to be expected: Dave has flown in from his Eastern Air Lines hearings in Miami, and the fact that he’s made it home at all tonight is evidence of how much pressure we’re under. Dave is glum and doesn’t want to talk about what happened. Dave hears my question, and whistles like an in-bound missile. “The ding-dong bells are gonna’ ring all over your poor head, boy!” he teases. Lee straightens up, steps back from the clean box, and starts peeling off his apron and lab hat. He throws the mask into the waste-basket, then looks down at his sweaty shirt. “Go, go, go!” Mary calls out, from behind her surgical mask. Dr. Mary and I continue working for the next several hours, and Dave returns as promised. We finally finish around midnight, and Dr. Mary drives me home.33 I carry Profiles in Courage with me to bed, and sleep with it, because Lee gave it to me. I hope it will stop me from having nightmares. July 19, 1963: Lee Oswald is fired from Reily’s a little earlier than planned, when he grabs a green glass for me out of a packing line.

At that time, she invited him to store his things in her garage next to her washing machine. That night, Lee moved a few boxes and three seabags there, emptying one of two lockers he was renting. Several boxes were moved to 4905 Magazine St. on May 10 from the second locker. On May 11, the last of the Oswald possessions still at the bus station were moved to 4905 Magazine (often misreported as 4907) Lee’s uncle Dutz used his car to move them, the same day Marina arrived, via Ruth Paine, with the rest of the Oswald belongings. Back on the 25th, Lee told his aunt Lil he was job hunting. When she saw his clothes, she offered to get him nicer ones for his job interviews. When I met Lee the next day, the 26th, around 10:00 am at the post office, he reluctantly broke off his conversation with me (“to get a shirt”). About one-and-a-half to two hours later, Lee appeared appropriately and neatly dressed for his first job interview. For years, David Lifton reported that I could not have met Lee Oswald on April 26 because she had described him wearing old clothes. Lifton claimed Lee had ‘just arrived’ in New Orleans on the 26th, wearing a suit on his bus ride from Dallas, and that he immediately went to a job interview that afternoon, ignoring the fact that Lee began his trip from Dallas on the 24.th In her Warren Commission testimony, Lilian Murret said: “…all he had on at the time was a T-shirt and pants, and I think he had only about two T-shirts with him. Mr. JENNER. You say he had no suit coat? Mrs. MURRET. No; and only one l pair of shoes.” http:// www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh8/pdf/WH8_LillianMurret.pdf. In fact, many researchers accepted Lifton’s claims for a decade, until I realized what he was saying behind her back. Johnson-McMillan’s anti-Oswald book Marina and Lee, p. 382, and WC testimony indicate Lee left Dallas on the 24th. Most of Lee Oswald’s activities for the two weeks between April 26 and May 10 were unknown until my book, Me & Lee, provided full details. 5.

Today, photocopy machines are in every office, but in 1963 they were both rare and expensive. Virtually all were made by the Xerox Corporation, which held the patents on the technology. The few machines that existed in hospitals and medical schools were closely guarded by the secretarial staffs to make sure each copy was properly logged and accounted for. Many times this had to do with federal grant money connected to research. Personal use was seriously frowned on, and official use left a paper trail. The ability to access a photocopy machine at Banister’s office meant that copies could be made for off-the-books projects without leaving a paper trail. 6. In 1999, I told researchers that Bobby Kennedy knew Lee Oswald was working for the CIA, compliments of the ONI, and that Guy Banister was using Oswald. Banister despised the Kennedys, but he despised Castro more. When Banister helped conduct operations involving CIA and Mob efforts against Castro, Bobby Kennedy’s own network of informants could have been involved. I believe this has led to confusion as to Banister’s relationship to RFK. The stealing of minor munitions from the Schlumberger munitions depot is an example of how Ban- “Both Ferrie and Banister were implicated in a raid in late 1961 against a munitions depot in Houma, Louisiana, in which various weapons, grenades, and ammunition were stolen. Banister’s role may have been limited to storing the materiel which was reportedly seen stacked in Banister’s back room by several witnesses….” [Vol 10, pp 127, 109; the month of August was specified in Garrison’s indictment of Novel]. Researcher Mike Sylwester writes: “Guy Banister’s employees, Jack Martin and David Lewis, explained in their affidavit that this raid was arranged by Robert Kennedy…Martin and Lewis noted in their affidavit that Robert Kennedy had established his own secret channel of communication to communicate with Banister, by-passing J. Edgar Hoover and the local FBI Special Agent in Charge. [wrote Martin and Lewis:] “This FRD group, through Banister, was additionally serviced by an FBI Special Agent, Regis Kennedy, who we often met during this period at Banister’s office. Sometimes, we would run into him several times a day. Banister once told [another of his investigators, Joseph] Newbrough and we that [Regis] Kennedy’s daily reports on these activities were forwarded straight to one Assistant FBI Director Mohr, subservient only to John Edgar Hoover in Washington, always by-passing [Regis] Kennedy’s own local Special Agent in Charge (resident agent) for numerous top-security reasons.

From here [Washington], they were viewed by none other than Philby and RFK, the story goes. Inasmuch as we were for many years associated with Banister, we had upon occasion engaged (independently) in some of these activities, cooperating with FRD and Dalzell operations. From time to time, our code names had been “El Gringo” and “Jauquin” during these periods. Returning to the subject, RFK allegedly tendered several documents in the form of “Letters-Marques” giving “carte-blanche” status to any and all of those about to participate in this pending pseudo-legal hijacking. These were directed to all concerned to “seize munitions or arms, the property of a foreign government, that are illegally located within the US, which might otherwise be used against nations friendly to the US, using any and all means to do so.” They, of course, supposedly bore the signature of none other than RFK himself, because they were issued on Justice Department Attorney General’s letterhead stationery. Later on that following afternoon, we heard Banister talking over the telephone to who we were told was a Mr M.E. Loy, the South-Eastern Manager of Schlumberger in New Orleans. (Loy at this writing is the President of all Schlumberger incorporations here in the US, whose home office is in Houston, Texas.) This conversation was in regard to the pending Schlumberger operation. Banister seemed to be setting the time and date, like H hour and D date. In short, they of the Schlumberger company knew that we were coming in the fake bakery truck … Anyway, the story goes that it was in the dark of night that the very “chosen people” hijacked those munitions at the Houma Schlumberger bunker, transported, and stored them in their designated location, the storage area adjoining Banister’s office. The following day, everyone in the “know” came to look and gloat. Boy, ol’ Castro should sure catch hell now! …. Well, at any rate, it appears that after the Houma bunker haul, Philby and company may have progressed in activity. We say this because later the next evening, apparently some other band of thieves filched those promised arms and munitions from the safety of their hiding place at Banister’s office.However, no robbery report was made, nor search launched for them. Banister was ordered to do nothing about this matter and to remain silent, as were the rest of us so instructed.

So he engineered another hijacking of his own. On this, they only found lowyield projectiles looking like small aerial bombs, but with not much explosive power. However, the Cubans thought they were for real and [set up] … Arcacha to a blow-out in one of the local hotels (St Charles) to celebrate the occasion… a few days later, they (the Cubans) found out that these were oil-well equipment or exploration low-yield explosive units. With this, the Cubans really believed that they’d been crossed, and Arcacha left town immediately in fear of his life. …. Now, what happened, and where did they [the stolen arms] go? It seems that there were some others, a bunch of discontented people, who just wanted to take over Guatemala using these weapons far more than we needed them to give the “works” to Castro. Thus, via Philby and company, General Ydígoras went out of office, and Guatemala had a completely new political administration. Somebody fulfilled the vendetta for the Carlos Marcello caper in spades! JFK had gotten his revenge one way or another. …. This left Dr. Cardona’s Frente under the total command of Arcacha’s former assistant, Carlos Quiroga. He claims to be an avid anti-Communist. We believe he protests far too much upon this subject. Hence, we did some checking. Quiroga says he left Cuba just at the time his father was arrested and imprisoned within the Isle of Pines near Havana. Our sources inform us that Quiroga’s father may have been assisted into confinement by none other than Quiroga himself, just as he is said to have assisted Arcacha to be removed. He is truly an assistant, however, according to our information. Moreover, it is highly speculative that this subject, Quiroga, may well be as Philby, a double agent.

Anna and her husband had double-dated with me and Lee, and she went on film and audiotape saying so. On a 1999 tape, one of two made in 1999, in a public restaurant where we met just once, with every minute captured on the tapes, Anna expressed surprise that researchers were trying to say that Guy Banister had no access to his own upstairs office space (described as ‘upstairs’ by various witnesses). They insisted that he would have had to walk all the way down to the front of the long building to enter by the door on the other street (Camp St) in order to get upstairs to the second floor. “Why would he have to do that?” she commented. We told her that “Oswald-did-it” tale-tellers didn’t want people to know Banister could have ever seen Oswald on the second floor, where Lee had an office for at least a month, an office later described to researcher/author Anthony Summers by Delphine Roberts (‘my’ Mrs. Roberts)as being full of FPCC posters and other pro-Castro materials being used by Oswald. Later, Lee used a small windowless room on the second floor as a darkroom to develop photos for both himself and Banister. 10. G. Wray Gill was an attorney who represented Carlos Marcello. The FBI Interviewed Gill on November 27, 1963. Gill advised the FBI that he had known David W. Ferrie since about 1961 when he represented Ferrie in a criminal matter in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana and in a grievance with Eastern Air Lines following his dismissal from that company. Guy Banister served as a character witness for Ferrie in this latter matter. Following these events, Gill hired Ferrie as an investigator. At the time, Gill’s office was 1705 Pere Marquette Building, named after a famous Jesuit priest. The building was owned by the Jesuits. Gill later moved his office to the Richards building which was also owned by the Jesuits. 12. The Warren Commission … p. 136 MRS. MURRET: “You see, he went out all day.

Only Father Bill Richardson was decent enough to hold a church service for the victims (another occurred later), for which his Bishop castigated him. Father Bill’s wife, Mary, though only middle-aged, died of a sudden heart attack only 18 days after the JFK assassination (information provided by Edward T. Haslam). She was the only person who knew Lee Oswald had found an apartment for myself, who knew Lee Oswald was going to move in nearby, and who knew that I called Lee Oswald to get help (her husband was conducting a funeral service when these events occurred).

B. Reily to help him and Dr. Ochsner protect Lee’s and my cover jobs. At this date, Lee Oswald was investigating the bioweapon project for the CIA, and later posed as pro-Castro for Guy Banister to weed out Castro’s spies. He worked with Banister on local university campuses identifying “communist” pro-integration students (a task Lee Oswald hated), a fact reported by historian and author Dr. Michael Kurtz, an eyewitness. 17. “Air Force General Curtis LeMay presented a pre-invasion bombing plan to Kennedy in September, while spy flights and minor military harassment from US forces at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base were the subject of continual Cuban diplomatic complaints to the US government.” (2011). “John F Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis”.

Her book repeats what Haslam told her and goes into a long description of Lee’s Customs contacts, ignoring the name of his most important Custom contact and erring when she said Lee had a Customs controller. Mellen even told researchers that all I told her was that Jim Garrison had an affair with stripper Sandra Sexton, which she said Sexton denied. Why would I call a pro-Garrison researcher just to tell her of a Garrison sin? One of my witnesses, Mac McCullough, gave me the information on Sexton: he was her bodyguard. I primarily spoke to Mellen about the important matter of Lee’s links to Customs. 24. Besides Alpha-66 and the DRE, The CDP(Christian Democratic Party, also known as Moviemiento Democratica Critiano-MDC) attracted anti-Castro guerrilla forces. After the Bay of Pigs, the CDP split into factions. But HSCA investigator Gaeton Fonzi said the CDP, “…was one of the most active and effective underground groups in Cuba in the early 1960’s.” Richard Billings’ “Garrison notes” mention two camps, one run by the CDP where the spy, Fernando Fernandez, was caught; then exposed (thanks to Lee Oswald). The other camp, which Lee and David Ferrie wanted to break up, was run by ultra-radical right wingers whose friends were known to Ochsner. Their cover organization was the Guatemala Lumber and Mineral Corporation. The CDP camp was located on land owned by Redemptorist Fathers, of interest to David Ferrie. The radical camp used land and housing owned by William J. McLaney and would be shut down by the FBI. Many researchers now know that it was Lee Oswald who located this camp for the FBI. Peter Dale Scott (Deep Politics and the Death of JFK)noted that Carlos Bringuier, head of the DRE in New Orleans, said in August, 1963 (before he revised his statements for the Warren Commission )when Lee visited him, ‘I thought he might be an agent from the FBI or CIA, trying to find out what we might be up to’ (Washington Post, November 23, 1963; cf. 10 H 35; Scott, p.251.). “Bringuier’s logic here is of major importance.

Though DeLaney claimed the Guatemala Lumber and Mineral Co. was just trying to recruit some loggers, his partner in the business, Richard Davis, admitted being the area’s CDP representative to the FBI in a highly redacted report that also released this information: “89-69-1427… N[ew] O[rleans] teletype to Director and Dallas dated 2-20-67.. page 2 XXXX Richard Davis… info that training camps had been established across the lake [near] NO.

This person might have been Michael Riconusciuto, who has stated he was working for Banister, installing bugging devices and electronic surveillance equipment for him in the summer of 1963. Michael also told his relative by marriage, Anita Langley, that he had seen some of my cancer research reports, which we’d Xeroxed at Banister’s office. At this time, Xerox machines were mostly avail- 28. Jim DiEugenio, as quoted on The Education Forum: “What is extraordinary about what Dulles did with the CIA is that it was too much for even certain elements of the Eastern Establishment i.e. the very people who Dulles worked with and for. In 1956, David Bruce and Robert Lovett composed the Bruce-Lovett Report on the CIA for President Eisenhower. That report is almost nowhere to be found today. RFK had access to it during his service on the board of inquiry into the Bay of Pigs debacle…Lovett told the Cuban board that, “I have never felt that the Congress of the United States ever intended to give the United States Intelligence Agency authority to conduct operations all over the earth.” (ibid) Lovett’s report and testimony held great sway with the Kennedys…[Lovett] told the president that the CIA was “badly organized, dangerously amateurish and excessively costly.” It had to be re-organized, which wasn’t possible with Eisenhower as president and Dulles as Director. (ibid p. 478) There can be little doubt that Lovett’s testimony and his relationship with Kennedy’s father helped convince JFK to fire Allen Dulles. How important was it?

(ibid p. 478) There can be little doubt that Lovett’s testimony and his relationship with Kennedy’s father helped convince JFK to fire Allen Dulles. How important was it? Lovett’s influence was so profound that after JFK fired Dulles, Robert Kennedy was determined to find out if any other relative of Dulles was still at the State Department. When he found out that Allen’s sister Eleanor worked there, he ordered Dean Rusk to fire her. Because “he didn’t want any more of the Dulles family around.” (Mosley, p. 473) This is the man LBJ appointed to the Warren Commission. As shown above, he became the most active member of that cover-up. And it started almost immediately. (12/16 transcript, p. 52) Dulles also backed the idea of the Commission not having independent investigators. (DiEugenio, p. 90)” 29. It is still shocking to me that Lyndon Johnson dared – and was successful – in placing Allen Dulles on the Warren Commission, which declared lee Oswald the “Lone assassin” summarily. This, despite Dulles having been fired by Kennedy and removed from his longtime position as head of the CIA. In 2010, on the Education Forum, researcher Jim DiEugenio wrote, concerning Dulles’ meeting with researcher David Lifton : “It later turned out that Dulles had nothing but scorn for both the evidence and critical arguments against the Oswald-did-it hypothesis. In 1965, at UCLA, David Lifton questioned Dulles about the Zapruder film and Harold Feldman’s essay entitled “51 Witnesses” about many witnesses hearing a shot from the grassy knoll. Dulles not only denied that evidence, he ridiculed Lifton for even bringing it up. He said bizarre things like “There is not a single iota of evidence indicating a conspiracy.” When Lifton pointed out testimony, and even pictures, of smoke arising on the grassy knoll, Dulles derisively replied with, “Now what are you saying, someone was smoking up there?” When Lifton showed him frames from the Zapruder film arranged in sequential order to show Kennedy’s head going back toward the seat – the opposite direction of a shot from the Texas School Book Depository – Dulles said: “You have nothing! Absolutely nothing! … I can’t see a blasted thing here. You can’t say the head goes back. I can’t see it going back. It does not go back. You can’t say that.” (Best Evidence, pgs. 34-36) When, of course, the Commission had seen the film dozens of times. They just did not feel that powerful evidence, like Kennedy’s violent reaction backwards, merited mention in the Warren Report.” 30. Some have asked why both Lee and Dave would confide in me.

Second, it was important, if anything bad happened to Lee, that I would understand why I would have to keep silent, no matter what, since by now, Lee and I were lovers. I can recall Dave’s voice and most of what he said, but have added a few extraneous details (such as the “U-Haul”), being unable to remember Dave’s precise words. I assume from other sources that the U-Haul was present at the location indicated. 31. I place the history behind the “radical’s camp” and its raid here, though Dave and Lee’s activities will be described later in the book. These comments come from a variety of sources: “Researcher Dick Russell points out that “[Victor Espinosa] Hernandez identified only as ⋅_(A^(′)) in the congressional investigation’s reports was involved `with anti-Castro exiles and underworld figures who were operating the guerrilla training camp in New Orleans in July, 1963,’ according to CIA files. Then there is: “H.L. Hunt backs anti-Castro Cubans [Hinkle and Turner, The Fish Is Red, P. 202]. Hunt voices his concerns about the threat of a Kennedy dynasty in a July 11, 1963 letter to Senator Harry Byrd: `The stake is the entire future of the nation’ [Letter to Senator Byrd, Box 270, Byrd Papers, University of Virginia Library]. From Jim Garrison’s Playboy interview: “The CIA itself apparently did not take the detente too seriously until the late summer of 1963, because it maintained its financing and training of anti-Castro adventurers. There was, in fact, a triangulation of CIA-supported anti-Castro activity between Dallas where Jack Ruby was involved in collecting guns and ammunition for the underground and Miami and New Orleans, where most of the training was going on. But then, Kennedy, who had signed a secret agreement with Khrushchev after the Missile Crisis pledging not to invade Cuba if Russia would soft-pedal Castro’s subversive activities in the Americas, began to crack down on CIA operations against Cuba. 32. People asked me how many times I met Dr. Sherman, and my thinking literally has got me into trouble over that. I met her only twice: at the party, where she would not speak to me, and again at her nice apartment, where she awaited my coming with David Ferrie.

In this speech Kennedy called on the Soviet Union to work with the United States to achieve a nuclear test ban treaty and help reduce the considerable international tensions and the specter of nuclear war at that time. Stephen Roy (disputes Banister and Ferrie’s anti-Castro activities in the summer of 1963): It is widely believed … that Banister’s office was a hotbed of anti-Castro activity in 1963. That was probably true in 1961, but I can’t find much support for a high level of activity in 1963 (as regards Banister and Ferrie).1 Did we read that correctly? That there was no “high level of anti-Castro activity” regarding Bannister and Ferrie in 1963? I am one of several witnesses to confirm that significant anti-Castro activities, involving Guy Banister, Lee Oswald, and David Ferrie, were conducted in the summer of 1963. But first, we have to connect Lee Oswald to David Ferrie and Guy Banister to explain what kind of anti-Castro activity was going on. Anthony Summers: Re: William Gaudet: …[Gaudet,] a twenty-year CIA veteran who worked out of the International Trade Mart, told Anthony Summers that “I did see Oswald discussing various things with Banister at the time,” and added, “I suppose you are looking into Ferrie. He was with Oswald.” Finally Gaudet said, “Another vital person is Sergio Arcacha Smith. I know he knew Oswald and knows more about the Kennedy affair than he ever admitted.”3 Bill Nitschke (Banister investigator): re Delphine Roberts (Banister’s secretary and mistress): In a 1967 [New Orleans States-Item] interview … Nitschke recalled Delphine Roberts telling him that Banister, Ferrie and sometime Banister operative and pilot, Hugh Ward, were all involved in running guns to Miami and other places. (Also interviewed for Garrison, Jan. 17, 1967).4 Bauer writes. “I am a graduate of Tulane University in 1966. In the fall of 1965 I commenced flight training paid for by the Department of Defense for students enrolled in various ROTC programs. I was a USN scholarship student at Tulane. My instructor was David Ferrie…. I knew Dave from Sept. 1965 until May of 1966. I passed my Private Pilot’s check ride on March 27, 1966.” “I had close contact with Dave for three quarters of a year.

Higginbotham was employed, as was Lee Oswald, to help ferret out leftists at area colleges. Kurtz also interviewed witnesses who saw David Ferrie and Lee Oswald together in such places as the Napoleon House bar (acting critical of JFK and his handling of Cuba allowed both men to compile lists of Kennedy-haters). Dr. Kurtz: Twice [Ferrie and Oswald] were seen conversing in Mancuso’s Restaurant. They were seen at a segregationist meeting in the late spring of that year. In August they were seen at a party in the French Quarter. According to two people who attended the party, Oswald and Ferrie discussed United States foreign policy, especially with regard to Cuba. Both men expressed strong disapproval of the failure to overthrow the Castro regime. (“Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleans,” Louisiana History Vol. 21, No, 1, 16.) Dr. Kurtz: During the summer of 1963, [Kurtz’ friend] Van Burns worked at the Pontchartrain Beach amusement park in New Orleans. One evening, while he attended his booth, Burns saw a friend of his … accompanied by two men, approach the booth. The friend introduced him to Lee Harvey Oswald and David Ferrie. After a few minutes of small talk, Oswald and Ferrie left and strolled down Vernon Gerdes (former Banister investigator who later worked for attorney Stephen Plotkin) “told Plotkin that he had seen Oswald and Ferrie together with Banister. Plotkin would later tell an attorney for Clay Shaw that he considered Gerdes “reliable.” Gerdes signed a statement for Plotkin on Plotkin’s own letterhead stationery, with two witnesses present.8 July, 1963: David Ferrie gives me his medical library card, which allows me to use the medical libraries at Tulane and Loyola Universities. The card, stamped “Ochsner Clinic” gave access to area medical libraries as a courtesy. I can access the latest cancer research articles from around the world. As a speed-reader I can process new information quickly, my reports are saving hundreds of hours of time for the team. July 29, 1963: Lee Oswald tells me about a Jesuit conference he attended at Spring Hill College in Mobile, where he gave a presentation. He says Bobby Kennedy sent a spy there. However, things went badly. He has learned that “Jesus” (CIA’s James Jesus Angleton) distrusts Lee because he “did not come back in a coffin” from the USSR.

However, things went badly. He has learned that “Jesus” (CIA’s James Jesus Angleton) distrusts Lee because he “did not come back in a coffin” from the USSR. This is the second time I hear Lee use the same phrase. Once promised a college education, it’s been denied. His place in “the Company” is “under review.” Lee is trying to prove his loyalty and obedience, but he believes the CIA could murder him – the easiest way to handle an untrusted asset. He is concerned for my safety, and for the safety of his family.9 July-August, 1963: During these months, David Ferrie and Lee Oswald continue to present themselves as anti-JFK to ferret out pro-Castro spies and those offering serious anti-Kennedy threats. David eventually enters Banister’s inner circle, where ideas to assassinate JFK are being broached, with strong links to Texas. Dave deliberately offers assassination plans and ideas to stay credible. He These pro-Castro activities will help Lee enter Cuba without getting him executed, if he’s ordered to do that (now a dimming possibility). He will also look less suspicious to pro-Castro spies when he couriers the biological weapon to Mexico City (this is the current idea). He will hand off the weapon to an anti-Castro medical contact he can trust, which will require secret signs and signals. The contact also has to have some high-class skills. I’ve been teaching Lee how to keep “The Product” alive in the thermos system I’ve created for its delivery. The thermos looks like an ordinary part of a lunch kit. What looks like ordinary packets of sugar will contain the special medium needed, when reconstituted with water boiled and distilled. A sandwich, a banana, a thermos, and a couple bottles of “7- Up” (actually sterile distilled water), along with packets of “sugar” (to make fresh medium) would disguise the bioweapon hidden in a lunch sack in Lee’s blue zippered carry-on. The invisible cancer cells were alive, growing on the clear glass liner in the thermos, which had hidden vents and filters in the cap. If inspected, contents of thermos looked like chicken broth, by using a pH indicator different from the usual phenol red. Lee’s major concern is that Banister has forced him to hand a map over to the FBI – a premature step. It’s led to a problem. Because Lee has helped shoot the training film at the CIA-supported camp the anti-Castroites there realize he can recognize them. Lee thinks a rumor is spreading that he supplied a map to the FBI, and the “real” camp might also have to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:137:8007d68b89a2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5487, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 138, "text": "broth, by using a pH indicator different from the usual phenol red.

Because Lee has helped shoot the training film at the CIA-supported camp the anti-Castroites there realize he can recognize them. Lee thinks a rumor is spreading that he supplied a map to the FBI, and the “real” camp might also have to be shut down. Fortunately for Lee, he and Dave have found a pro-Castro spy who foolishly showed up at both camps. His name is Fernando Fernandez. Lee says they have formulated a plan to “smoke him out.” Lee will go to the bars in town, where word travels fast, and make it known that Guy Banister, convinced that Fernandez was OK, had given him a map to show him how to get to the little camp, which is a private set-up. Lee tells the usual snitches who make their lunch money by informing for the FBI. The map and the upcoming raid will soon be blamed on Fernandez. Once exposed, he’ll be of no use unless he gets radical plastic surgery, because Lee has taken his picture. August 1st was the first day after the raid, when Fernandez was still trying to evade being exposed. August 8th was the last day Lee could get the albatross of that map from off his neck, before his pro-Castro demonstration.11 And he did it! All Fernandez had to do was to stay in town, looking innocent, until Lee held his demonstration, and he would have been off the hook, because the demonstration would help prove that Lee was the rat. That wasn’t good for Lee’s health on “demonstration day.” Instead, Fernandez bolted. By the eighth of August, Dave and Lee had forced him to flee for his life to Miami, quashing the rumor that Lee had provided the map. Fernandez’ flight might have saved Lee from getting hurt in New Orleans. By the fourth of September, the Diario Las Americas newspaper told Miami that Fernandez was a spy for Castro. They printed his picture. The thousands of anti-Castro warriors congregated there will murder him, if they can: his career as a spy is over. But before all that happened, I was frightened for Lee. “It seems your life is getting more complicated and risky all the time,” I tell him. “What if you can’t get Fernandez to leave? What if they decide it’s you who handed over the map, after all?” Seeing my downcast face, Lee said in a cheery voice, “Don’t worry, Juduffki!

After about an hour, Mr. Monaghan shows up and starts teasing me about it. Then, in a loud voice that even the hard-working clerks can hear, Mr. M. says I need to get my lip examined by a doctor. Once he‘s sure everyone within ear shot thinks I’m going to the doctor, Monaghan tells me I have to make a trip – immediately – “to the lab” (Dave’s apartment). take the bus to Dave’s apartment, which is supposed to be empty I during the day, especially since Dave is still at the training camp [or maybe by now, he’s flying somewhere].14 At about 9:30 am, I enter the apartment, and find, in the refrigerator, a Waring Blender jar marked “Murine 1111FN.” Murine means “mouse.” These are mouse tumors! We have plunged down the monkey trail rapidly, but we still must keep the source of the most vicious cancer alive at the ‘mouse level’ to make sure we don’t lose the original cancer source. Since these cells don’t live for too many passages in test tubes, this fresh batch is going to be prepared for deep-freezing in nitrogen. That’s what the “FN” part of the ID label stands for. I will never forget the ‘1111’ – meaning this was the 1, 111^(th) experiment. And it was successful at last. My heart sinks. I understand that the Mouse House can’t risk having such mice there anymore, not with infected monkeys moving in. But deep-freezing this new backup material suggests that we aren’t developing this biological weapon just for Castro. We are about to make this cancer truly immortal. Ochsner won’t live forever. What if ‘Murine 1111FN’ gets into the wrong hands? In this same city, huge rocket parts are being built for the purpose of send- I remember one of Dave’s comments: “Social justice and society exist not to establish an ideal, but to establish a compromise, like it or not. Man can’t fulfill the perfect ideal, because man’s society forces him to be evil.” Dave said these weren’t his original ideas, and that any philosopher who was honest would arrive at the same conclusion.15 Just as I’m about to do", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:139:925664c1ede9", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5489, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 140, "text": "In this same city, huge rocket parts are being built for the purpose of send- I remember one of Dave’s comments: “Social justice and society exist not to establish an ideal, but to establish a compromise, like it or not.

I freeze, and listen. Someone is in the house. The sounds are coming from Dave’s bedroom, where the door is partially open. I tiptoe down the hall and look inside. There, I see a young man sprawled on Dave’s bed amidst a jumble of sheets, magazines, newspapers, clothes, and pillows. He is snoring. I figure it is probably Dave’s new lover, who is spending more and more time here.16 But I am not going to be able to grind up mouse tumors in the kitchen without his hearing it! I need to leave right away, but the tumors in Dave’s refrigerator are too dangerous and important to abandon, so I quietly gather up the things I need to take to Dr. Mary’s, and leave. As I ride the bus down to Dr. Mary’s apartment, my frustrations are percolating. The time I need to do The Project’s work is being whittled away on all fronts. I can no longer read and write reports at my place at 1032 Marengo because Robert is literally underfoot. At home, all I can do are Reily-related tasks. Stretched to the limit, working at two demanding jobs, and trying to deal with the needs of two very different lovers, I can’t handle this emergency work properly because Dave has a young lover (or runaway student) sleeping in his bed! As soon as I arrive at Dr. Mary’s, I write her a note, complaining about the presence of Dave’s lover and why I can’t update reports on time. Then I create the tissue cultures, ready to deep freeze, doubting I’ll finish in time to get back to Reily. But Lee comes to the rescue. He arrives at Mary’s apartment. Now he’s wearing fatigues, with a baseball cap and a white t-shirt. A blue duffel bag is slung over his shoulder. It’s about 1 : 30 PM . Johnson-McMillan writes, “… by late May and early June, he had become alarmingly indifferent to the way he looked.” (p. 425) This period in Lee’s life actually ended with the August 1^(st) raid.

Larry Hancock: The McClaney farm bust was not a training camp, it was a holding area for a parked U-haul and the FBI had full details on what was in it from an informant in Miami before they made the bust … this is often written up in early JFK works as a full-fledged training camp – the local media coverage may have created that impression? AP article out of Mandeville, LA (07/31/1963): FBI agents swooped down on a house … near here today and seized more than a ton of dynamite and 20 bomb casings. An informed source said the explosives were part of a cache to be used in an attack on Cuba. But the FBI would only say that the materials were “seized in connection with an investigation of an effort to carry out a military operation from the United States against a country with which the United States is at peace.”19 Anxious to replace me right away, Monaghan had jumped the gun. Personnel had not changed the salary, which for my inexpert services had been reduced to minimum wage, so nobody with the proper qualifications had applied. Ochsner had also intervened and said I needed to stay longer, after I told him I didn’t know what I’d do for funds if I was forced out too soon. As I am leaving, an attractive woman arrives in Monaghan’s office for training. She seems bright, is a good typist, takes shorthand, and has mature phone skills. A real secretary that he won’t have to cover for! We are in high gear over at the lab, so I will be gone virtually every afternoon. I manage to get to the city library to check on quickie Mexican divorces, remembering that actress Jayne Mansfield got her divorce from her husband in one day.20 It’s just what Lee and I are hoping for!

With the kind of family pressure that could be put on him, he could be forced to spy for Castro. Lee updates me about the raid at this time. A handful of Cubans and a couple of ultra-rightwing gringos were clueless enough to keep to the house near where all the goodies were stored, which got them arrested. Newspapers have already duly reported that the FBI had confiscated arms, ammunition, and over a ton of explosives, but already, most of it is missing, Lee tells me. That’s how fast Banister and his operatives got it back. Lee says he helped stack arms and ammo on Banister’s third floor. As for the detainees, the FBI had already released them. Most fled the state. Outwardly, Banister displays anger over the camp’s raid, but secretly, he’s glad, Lee says, because Kennedy, whom he despises, is hated as never before by the anti-Castro Cubans over the new raid.21 As for Lee, he guesses that the traitors who want JFK dead are toasting each other over the raid. “How easily JFK could be killed now,” Lee says, “with a gun that can be traced to anti-Castro renegades!” Lee then plunges on with his revelations. Fernandez is hiding out somewhere in New Orleans, and has to be found. We start walking toward Acme’s oyster bar, Lee busy teaching me some phrases in Russian. We reach Acme’s, where we order oyster stew (something I can eat with my sore mouth) for lunch. It’s a free lunch because Acme’s is “influenced” by Marcello. It’s also the last time I will pose as Marina, because she’s too advanced, now, in her pregnancy, and my attempt to use padding looks too weird. A few days every month I look pregnant, anyway, due to those long-ago operations and cortisone shots. Lee has written a letter to the FPCC.

Lee is going to mail it early, he says, because the CIA opens all his mail, and it can get delayed. Lee has already written about his membership in the FPCC to the Communist Party.22 It will nicely link the FPCC to the communists, which is what CIA wants on paper to prove their case. Lee will soon publicize himself as a pro-Castro “Marxist.” “Please,” I implore in Russian, “What do you have to do with him again?” Lee looks around, then moves closer to me. “Sometimes I have to do what Little Man wants,” he tells me. “But, my darling wife,” he says softly, playing with a lock of my hair, “…as I’ve told you before, ‘Either the world can be an influence on you, or you can be an influence on the world.’ I decided not to let ‘the world’ influence me. The world I grew up in.” Lee goes on to say how his uncle Dutz, upset because Lee skipped so much school, set him to work in Marcello’s restaurants as a gopher. “To make me appreciate the value of an education,” Lee confides, “he set me to work after school doing menial labor.” There were errands, sweeping and mopping floors, and washing cars and Dr. Michael Kurtz: From a Sept. 9, 1979 interview of George Wilcox of New Orleans, Kurtz says Wilcox saw: Ferrie, Oswald, and numerous Cubans, all dressed in military fatigues and carrying automatic rifles, conducting what appeared to be a “military training maneuver.” This event took place near Bedico Creek, a swampy inland body of water near Lake Pontchartrain, about fifty miles north of New Orleans. This occurred in early September 1963, two months after the final government raid on anti-Castro guerrilla camps in the United States.25 Larry Hancock: … in early JFK literature there was often speculation that it was Oswald, in his infiltrator role, who exposed the supposed camp that was busted in the McClaney raid. Perhaps he did … [but with] the full FBI documentation on it we also have their sources – in reports written in the summer of 1963 – and their informants were exiles and not Oswald.26 But researchers should think twice about trusting what the FBI and CIA has given them about this incident, seeing how many lies have been thrown at them in the past.

Note that the FBI reports identifying the informants were written significantly later, after scapegoats were finally lined up. FBI reports, as we know, identify most informants by code. The very fact that Lee Oswald is mentioned by name as not having been the informant means that somebody was saying that he was, and this had to be refuted. If named, an informant can become useless. A mention of multiple informants – best unnamed, or using just one as a scapegoat – keeps the true informant safer. In this game, revealing the chess piece takes it off the board. Non-participants, looking at FBI official records, can rarely piece together what happened behind the scenes.27 Mr. Roy ignores me as a witness. He basically calls Robert Tanenbaum – who is a credible witness and HSCA member with a sterling reputation to this day – a liar. He dismisses Colonel William Bishop as a liar, too. I suppose he adds me to that list. But Anthony Summers makes a good case for Delphine Roberts’ truthfulness, and Bishop spontaneously brought up the training film, without prompting. Bishop’s was an off-hand remark that meant little at the time, but along with Tanenbaum’s, Delphine’s and my witness statements, should carry some weight. That’s four of us. I never knew if Dave went to the right-wing camp that was raided, but he went to the camp where the film was made. I saw some of the training film at his apartment. The film was silent, but you could see the pinpoints of fire from the rifles and the shimmering gouts of muzzle blast from the machine guns. It cut to a mortar team firing, dropping the shells in odd silence down the tubes and shielding their ears from the blasts … they seemed well drilled…. A white road sign loomed up…. The road sign had the shape of Louisiana and a number. Larry Hancock: … the more I think about it the more likely it seems that a film at least somewhat like Tannenbaum (sic) describes would exist – only from the Summer of 62 not 63. We do know that Hemming and company were in New Orleans that Summer and Fall scouting out a new training camp for the CRC … Arcacha Smith might well have been with them, at least early on.

Lee’s characteristic “smirk” as described by Tanenbaum is one point. More important, he mentioned that Lee’s sideburns had grown longer, in a later part of the film. I also recalled that Lee’s sideburns got longer, which these photos (below) help establish. 1963 arrest photos for Aug. 9, left, and Nov. 22, right, show Lee Oswald’s sideburns longer in August, soon after the training film was shot. Though Lee has a new haircut, the longer sideburns are still visible. By November, they have been cut back again. Tanenbaum noticed Lee’s hair and sideburns had grown longer in the last part of the training film. Robert Tanenbaum describes Lee and David Ferrie: A man in a black T-shirt and ball cap sat at a table loading bullets into pistol magazines. He looked up for an instant, frowned, spoke briefly, and lowered his head again so that the bill of the cap obscured his face. He thought it was probably Oswald, but it had to be some time later than in the first scenes, because his sideburns [had] grown longer…. More shooting, men posing with weapons, then a close-up of a round-faced man with a fright wig and patently phony, impossibly thick eyebrows … David Ferrie … nobody else looked like Ferrie. Dick Russell: Re: Colonel William Bishop: (with J. Gary Shaw present) was asked if he’d ever met Lee Harvey Oswald: Bishop said he had not, but offhandedly volunteered, “I did look into Oswald’s background [in 1963]. I’d never met him, but I’d seen him in a training film in New Orleans the past summer. He just happened to be in the group out there at the Pontchartrain camp. Trying to get in with the anti-Cuban exiles.”34 [Note: Bishop, who could be an unreliable witness, died before Tanenbaum went public, so his comment was independent.] Aug. 4, 1963: Lee Oswald sends his letter to the FPCC, predicting the staged “scuffle” to take place five days later, on Aug. 9 – which will be staged to get him newspaper attention (it will actually get him arrested): “Through the efforts of some Cuban-exile ‘gusanos’ [worms] a street demonstration was attacked, and we were officially cautioned by police.” Dave promises to help.

As I have learned to do ever since I was almost “caught” by a sleeping guest, I very cautiously enter Dave’s apartment.35 David Ferrie: Saint and SinnerUntil now, I usually went to Dave’s apartment on Wednesdays, work at 1032 Marengo with his “idle presence” I could not write lab reports, use the microscope, or read journals there. So it means a lot that on this particular Monday, I’ll be able to leave early in the morning to get in more lab time at Dave’s. Ordinarily, this was impossible, due to the heavy workload on Mondays. But our salesmen took off the entire weekend, just as they had on the 4th of July, as part of their vacation package, so the usual crushing load of their sales and credit problems was delayed by a day. Monaghan, who is taking the day off, himself, has agreed that I can clock in, then go. We now have a stepped-up effort, focused on examining, classifying and propagating the first tumors being harvested from the pain-racked lungs of African Green Monkeys. Ever since finding a snoring sleeper in Dave’s bed, I’ve entered his apartment very quietly. I have just reached the kitchen when I happen to hear something coming from Dave’s bedroom that takes my breath from me. I have just entered the kitchen when I happen to hear new sounds, coming from Dave’s bedroom, of a kind that takes my breath from me. Having been beaten by my own parents, I recognize the sharp crack of a belt, and a half-smothered cry of pain – it’s Dave. Then he groans. It raises the hair on my neck. Is some sick sadist beating Dave? That is my first thought. If I make a sound, will they come after me, too? My mind racing, I pick up a frying pan, then creep toward Dave’s bedroom. I get close enough to see a drop of blood, like a livid punctuation mark, on the smooth surface of the door. I move a little closer and get a glimpse of him. “Dave!” I shout out. He stiffens as if shocked, then staggers and turns to me with a haggard, glazed face. He has stripes of bleeding red on his ribs and shoulders. Tears are coursing down his cheeks. In his lowered hand, dangling almost to the floor, is a thin, black strap. Then, with a scowl, Dave reaches out and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:146:95c9c1761b51", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5496, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 147, "text": "livid punctuation mark, on the smooth surface of the door.

He has stripes of bleeding red on his ribs and shoulders. Tears are coursing down his cheeks. In his lowered hand, dangling almost to the floor, is a thin, black strap. Then, with a scowl, Dave reaches out and slams the door shut. But I can’t. With all my training in medicine, all I can think, in this moment, is that I have to fix the bleeding and the suffering. I think of the mechanical injury to his body first, revealing to myself how technically my mind works, and a part of me is stunned that I think of this, first, instead of what internal agonies have driven Dave to do this to himself. As I search for ointments, bandages, and styptic pencils in our first aid kit, that technical part is still driving me, as I yell out to Dave, “I’ve got to clean your wounds! You can get a cancer virus taking off in those wounds!” Perhaps because I don’t ask him why he’s done this to himself, perhaps because he may suddenly realize that he could become our first “volunteer’ if the virus gets into his bloodstream, Dave opens the door a crack, and asks me for rubbing alcohol. I have visions of more self-torture, if he pours it over himself, so I tell him, “I have to do it. We don’t have enough alcohol to waste.” “What in hell are you doing here, at this time?” he says, as he comes slowly out, a sheet over his body. He’s not naked – he has trousers on – but I ask if he has any wounds below his waist. He answers in the negative, and I begin daubing the contusions on his back with alcohol, then with antibiotic ointment. I use sterile gauze over the worst places, and sterile paper lab tape. There is a small stool in his living room, and I finally get him to sit down. We don’t speak at all as I attend to what he’s done to himself. The telephone rings and we ignore it. Dave is still seated, head down, when I return, but I sense that now he wants to talk to me, as I start working on his shoulders, first the left, then the right, both of which are covered with bleeding welts. I am not facing him: I know he couldn’t bear that. Finally, he says, “You locked the doors. Aren’t you afraid to do that, with somebody like me?” “I know why I had to do it,” I answer. “I was taught that Christ’s incredible sacrifice wasn’t enough to pay for everybody’s sins; that we have", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:147:bce48509b4e6", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5497, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 148, "text": "to talk to me, as I start working on his shoulders, first the left, then the right, both of which are covered with bleeding welts.

Suffer the fires of purgatory, until we’ve suffered enough, or suffered enough for the sins of others. And even after all we can do, if we so much as miss a Mass, to Hell we can go. It took me a long time to get out of that trap.” “Now you don’t even believe in God!” Dave says, defensively. I would again, one day, but that wasn’t the case at this time. “Religion is the chief cause of human suffering,” I declare. “And please don’t argue with me about God existing. You may be right about God, but Jesus said, when he forgave a sinner, ‘Go and sin no more.’ He didn’t say, ‘Beat yourself to a pulp, and then go sin some more.’” I say these things because I was raised Catholic, and I had tried to become a saint. I burned my conscience every minute with a hot iron, forbade myself meat, and was going to wear hair shirts the rest of my life. And chains, too, when I could no longer work as a doctor and scientist. As a contemplative nun, I had planned, basically, to kill myself with penances after retirement. I know that now, and I’m convinced Dave has done this to himself because of how he, too, has been taught. Despite his jokes, I don’t think he’s a sadist, and he’s only shown kindness to me and Lee. “Throw the stuff away that you have used to do penance!” I urge him. “Remember, the more the saints laid sufferings on themselves, the worse their temptations got. You read their lives; they all say their sufferings attracted demons. Think about that. Tell me one saint, if you can, who didn’t have to fight the devil and go through what St. John the Divine called ‘the dark night of the soul.’” I see a rough rope made of harsh fibers, with tacks stuck into it. This is why Dave has small, inflamed red sores all around his waist, which also bears the marks of the roughness of the rope. There is a small Sterno can holder, with four sharp legs, upon which Dave had lain. He has burnt his thigh with a piece of hot screen from the same Sterno holder. He had also been holding a two-pound barbell weight in each hand, trying to keep his arms outstretched as", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:148:af6dceb3c5e2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5498, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 149, "text": "with tacks stuck into it.

He had also been holding a two-pound barbell weight in each hand, trying to keep his arms outstretched as long as possible. And he had eaten spices to burn his mouth and tongue. He has been crueler to himself than I had been to myself. There is a kind of dreadful fellowship that we now share. Dave shakes his head. “I have plenty of straight friends,” he says. “They don’t know what I am. I’m not a limp-wrist. And I used to like women.” Dave puts on a nice shirt. “I’m not supposed to be here,” he says. “I’m supposed to be on my way to Miami right now.” Then he looks at me sharply. “And I can still have sex with a woman. I’m capable. They’re not a turn-off. You’re sure not a turn-off.” He smiles. “Problem is, the way I look now…” his bald head with its patches of dangling hair, his lack of eyebrows and eyelashes, his dry, bugged-out eyes, and now, his reputation, have combined, he says, to ruin all his chances. Dave then says something remarkable. “Maybe I can find a Catholic church congregation where gays are tolerated and forgiven. Or, maybe, I could start a church, and get a couple of gay priests to run it.” Dave tells me that many priests are gay. He had been molested by one when he was in junior high school. “I had a nervous breakdown over it,” he confides. “But I got over that, thanks to a decent priest. So I started trusting them again. Then it happened again. During the time I was trying to become a priest, myself. This time, it was with one of the so-called best of them. They all thought he was very, very holy.” Dave gets up and starts searching through some papers on the piano. “Yes, he was holy, all right. That priest told everybody I was trying to ruin his reputation. When I tried to get help about it, from another priest, it turned out he was gay, too. You can guess what he said to everybody. So I was kicked out of the seminary. They claimed it was I who was acting immoral. My father never got over it. I think it killed him.” Then, because I have no choice, I have to start work on the horrors that await us in the form of monkey tumors, designated, in the end, to kill.

How could I have fallen so low? I almost hate myself, again. It makes it easier for me to understand what has happened to Dave in his life. Dave helps me for a few minutes, then says, “I have a plane to catch.” He goes hunting through papers again and finds what he’s looking for. Picking up his suitcase, he asks me, “Know how this all started?” I shake my head. “That statement,” Dave says, ”was for one of the boys to sign. Saying I’m a good man.” His voice cracks with emotion. “At one time, he really did think I was a good man. I typed this out for him to sign. He refused. I begged him. He wouldn’t.” Dave shakes his head sadly. “Just thinking about it … it made me … do that.” We look at each other helplessly. We are not having a good day, but it could have been worse. Aug. 5, 1963: HSCA: Guy Banister testifies in David’s grievance hearing (Aug. 5-8). “At the Airline Pilots board about his work with “Arcacha Smith and others.” Banister said, “I had high-ranking Cuban refugees in my office asking me how to go underground and I gave them diagrams for that. I have talked to military and political leaders from the various provinces of Cuba that have slipped out and slipped back.”36 Aug. 9, 1963: David Ferrie has returned to New Orleans in time to lead an anti-Castro demonstration a few blocks away from where Lee Oswald is distributing flyers on Canal St, near INCA. By doing so, David lures Cubans who might have potentially done harm to Lee away from the staged scene. Nobody in on the scheme wants Lee to actually get hurt.37 Left: Rare green “Hands off Cuba” flyer, stamped “L. H. Oswald, 544CampSt³ (courtesy, Robert Groden). This flyer appears trimmed at the top – which is what I did. Was it also printed too far to the left? Right: An untrimmed flyer, with too much space at the top. I gave trimmed flyers to Lee and Dean Andrews on Canal St. I left at once, but because I had been seen with Lee, Reily Co. fired me the same day. Aug. 9-10: David Ferrie collects names and snaps photos of several Cubans and students who go to the 544 Camp St. address, but Banister is furious that the address was used.

Now known as a trap, the office must be closed before more damage is done. Later, Lee will use 4907 Magazine St. (next to his apartment) and his post office box for addresses. “This way, you’ll never run out of money,” Dave jokes, “because nobody will ever take this from you.” The comment was made concerning my parsimonious husband who typically kept me on a budget so tight I was unable to get a new pair of shoes (the wornout ones created blisters). Lee sent me by cab to a shoe store to get a new pair, paying for the shoes and cab. Aug. 21, 1963: Lee appears on “Conversation Carte Blanche” radio in a “debate” (four against one) involving Ed Butler of INCA, Carlos Bringuier, Bill Stuckey (host), and WDSU TV reporter, Bill Slatter. Present in the studio was Dr. Alton Ochsner. A record will be cut which later will be used to damn Lee in the public eye. Lee is posing as pro-Cuba and says he is a Marxist (that is, not “communist.”) HUAC supplies information that Lee “defected” to the USSR, startling Lee into a statement that he was protected by the United States government, which he quickly corrects to say that he was not. Aug. 23, 1963: The last of the outsourcing of the cancer project is completed. David’s apartment won’t see many mice again, though some cages remain. He will hold another small party soon. I will still do a little work at Dr. Sherman’s, where backup mice and cancer cell strains are still accessible, in case contamination occurs. I never visit David’s apartment again. 5. Bauer added a bit of movie criticism to his email. “By the way,” he wrote, “the wig that Joe Pesci wore in ‘JFK’ the movie was nowhere near accurate.” [Me: “I have said the same thing.

There they often debated Kennedy’s foreign policy with the students. Accompanied by two ‘Latins,’ Ferrie and Oswald were observed in Baton Rouge, where they openly denounced Kennedy’s foreign and domestic policies.” From Kurtz’ book Crime of the Century. Author: “I, too, have witnesses who wish to remain anonymous. Their information can be used if they have disclosed their identity to a second witness (such as, my publisher is in touch with one of my new witnesses and can vouch for her veracity). 9. Lee told me he finally obtained crucial knowledge that almost certainly saved Kennedy’s life. I and others now believe the informant named “Lee” who saved Kennedy in Chicago by contacting FBI there, was Lee Oswald. The matter is described in detail by former Secret Service agent Abraham Bolden and by James Douglass in his book JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters. 10. The Warren Commission and McMillan’s book Marina and Lee both presented the viewpoint that Lee Oswald was a “failure” regarding his leadership of the FPCC branch he started in New Orleans, avoiding the very obvious question of why Lee would pass out literature advertising its existence three times that summer, yet never hold a single meeting or lecture, despite what the flyers said. To investigate and report the truth behind Lee’s fake FPCC branch would expose Lee’s true identity. 11. Lee originally wanted to hold this demonstration a week later, but Banister told him the staged ‘fight’ had to be scheduled while District Attorney Jim Garrison was out of town, apparently doing his duty with the National Guard. Banister insisted that Lee’s activity, if Garrison were in town, would have incited the D.A. to use the new and untested Communism Control Act against Lee to gain more popularity against a “Communist.” But that could uncover the whole ploy. Instead, Banister – the committed racist – wanted Garrison to test the new law against the Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF) which openly supported local desegregation and Martin Luther King.

Guy Banister’s secretary Delphine Roberts told author Anthony Summers that at least once Oswald and Ferrie went together to a Cuban exile training camp near New Orleans for rifle practice.” http://spot.acorn.net/jfkplace/09/fp.back_issues/05th_issue/ferrie.html. 14. Since I wrote of this matter in Me & Lee, as well as in the manuscripts of 2006 and 1999, I have obtained access to phone records that suggest Dave was in Jackson, Mississippi, where he stayed until at least August 2nd. Due to my own diary and notes, I mentioned that Dave was ‘still out of town” in one of them, which entered the book Me & Lee for August 1st. Dave was not mentioned as being in town in my private notes until August 4th, but I never knew where he had gone. 15. Soon, after watching the film Lawrence of Arabia that summer, a revival of the film after it won Academy Awards, Lee and I read The Seven Pillars of Wisdom together, as much as we were able, at the main public library. This magnificent book by T. E. Lawrence (which he also illustrated) could not be checked out of the library, but what we did read inspired Lee to a higher degree of stoicism. Because Lawrence carried pocket-sized books by Aeschylus, Plato and Aristotle with him on his journeys, Lee asked Dave to find the best translation he could of any of these Greek masterpieces. At the end of August, Dave would have The Pocket Aristotle flown in from New York, along with the usual journal articles Ochsner was always asking me to read and notate. I still have the book, which contains a few short remarks and many underlined passages spontaneously written by Lee, using a small geometry compass pencil. Nov. 22, 1963, the same day JFK was assassinated. They both said Dave was with them. It is certain that Dave was with them at the Winterland ice skating rink in the outskirts of Houston, not far from Hull Field in nearby Sugarland and another small airport at Alief, that both Lee and Dave told me were used by the CIA. 18.

I had an excellent reading memory, and recalled a newspaper article from May 1st, seen in the public library when Robert and I had gone there to look up marriage laws: the glamorous platinum blonde movie star, Jayne Mansfield, divorced weight-lifter Mickey Hargitay overnight in Juarez, Mexico. When Lee and I visited the Tulane library that week, we finally looked up the article. 21. Banister may have hated the Kennedy brothers for their desegregation policy and “softness” on Communism, but he craved Bobby’s secret funds and support against Castro, which Marcello also approved, for Mafia members were raking in money supplied by the CIA to help them “get Castro.” But it was not in their best interests to do much toward ‘getting’ Castro, or else the funding would stop. 22. joanmellen.com/wordpress/literary-matters/who-was-lee-harvey-oswald/ “In the spring of 1960, Oswald’s name appears on a CIA mail opening list, meaning he was one of the two hundred most important people to them.” “This list was part of the CIA’s illegal HT/LINGUAL mail intercept program.” www.ctka. net/reviews/newman.html. 23. “Marcello employed Oswald’s uncle Charles Murret as a bookmaker in the New Orleans gambling world. In the 1970’s the FBI wiretapped many of Marcello’s phone conversations. …161 reels of tape… An FBI informant, Joe Hauser, who claimed he made several of these recordings, told author John H. Davis that Marcello spoke of involvement in the assassination and that he personally knew Oswald.” (Note: John Davis worked in the National Archives, giving him more information and insight as to who was who than the ordinary researcher.

Hence, on Aug. 10, Lee, having been arrested on the 9th for promoting his fake FPCC chapter for Banister, dares tell police to inform Warren DeBreuys that ‘Lee Oswald has been arrested and wants an interview.’ DeBrueys isn’t available – it’s the weekend – but FBI’s S.A. Quigley comes. See Me & Lee for details. 28. LEE HARVEY OSWALD AS AN FBI INFORMANT: Dave Reitzes’ struggle to disconnect Lee Oswald from the training camp is typical of those trying to dissociate Lee Oswald from anything to do with the CIA or the FBI. In an exchange with Robert Harris ( aided by John McAdams) Reitzes tried to avoid revealing that FBI agent Warren DeBrueys, with whom Lee was working had anything to do with informing the FBI about the DeLaney house and explosives cache (remember that New Orleans FBI’s Warren DeBrueys threatened witness Orestes Pena with physical harm if he mentioned that Lee was working with him) . De-Brueys made a point of stressing that Lee Oswald was not the informant for the raid (through the map). His denial and bringing up Lee’s name means, of course, that the rumor existed. And why would such a rumor exist? DeBrueys tried hard to remove Lee’s name from consideration. Somebody brought up the name, so DeBrueys had to insist that Oswald was not the informant. The truth is in Me & Lee and in the main narrative of this book. Reitzes begins his messy attempt at a cover-up with this statement: “As a lengthy paper trail shows, the informant who led the FBI to the cache was a Cuban exile pilot codenamed MM T-1, who reported to the FBI’s Miami office on the activities and plans of the exile community.” However, in the ensuing debate between Reitzes and Robert Harris, it soon became obvious that Reitzes was Reitzes next writes that “… On July 31, 1963, FBI agents raided the house in LaCombe. The search warrant had been based on the affidavit of S.A. DeBRUEYS. The FBI reported: “It is noted that we received information from Miami, Florida, source [MM T-1] on July 18, 1963, that Acelo Pedroso, former Cuban pilot, had", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:155:1f78eb183b79", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5505, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 156, "text": "the activities and plans of the exile community.” However, in the ensuing debate between Reitzes and Robert Harris, it soon became obvious that Reitzes was Reitzes next writes that “… On July 31, 1963, FBI agents raided the house in LaCombe. The search warrant had been based on the affidavit of S.A. DeBRUEYS. The FBI reported: “It is noted that we received information from Miami, Florida, source [MM T-1] on July 18, 1963, that Acelo Pedroso, former Cuban pilot, had gone to New Orleans about July 16, 1963, to check some bombs allegedly to be used on bombing raid over Cuba… Pedroso voluntarily accompanied Miami Agent to New Orleans on July 30, 1963, and identified house which had been pin-pointed by New Orleans Office agents, as house where munitions were stored.” Author: “MM T-1 was only able to locate the house, in other words, because the New Orleans FBI told MM T-1 where it was located. Keep that in mind. With MM T-1 was the Cuban pilot. But how did they find out? The FBI kindly tells us (just in case we might ask – and, by the way, why would we think to ask?) that “There are no references in the OSWALD case to any of the Subjects of the seizure matter. We have no indication that OSWALD had any connection with it.” [FBI 62-109060-4760] Gerry Hemming told A.J. Weberman that MM T-1 was Howard Kenneth Davis. OK, so we know who the guy is. So what? Reitzes then brings up A. J. Weberman’s material in Nodule 12. Carlos Bringuier of the DRE told Weberman that he was upset at Lee Oswald for trying to penetrate his group, and that Lee Oswald had to know about the camp because he volunteered to train Bringuier’s Cuban guerrillas. Bringuier was also aware of the spy Fernando Fernandez, described in this book [David Ferrie-Mafia Pilot] as an infiltrator. Bringuier compared Lee Oswald to such a spy and infiltrator. [A.J. Weberman, Nodule 12] Back in Cuba, Bringuier’s own brother had spied for Castro and ruined the FRD in Cuba thereby.[WCD 1085d9; WCE 1413 p4]. But way back in 1963, Bringuier told a whopper to the FBI, as this record proves: “On December 17, 1963, BRINGUIER told the FBI that he “knew of no connection that OSWALD had with any Cubans, and that OSWALD made no mention of any Cuban training camp, and gave no indication of knowing about a training camp, or of being acquainted with any Cubans.” [FBI NO 100-16601 SA John T. Reynolds]. Reitzes, knowing all of the above, amazingly again focuses on the Miami informant, citing a Weberman footnote that “The FBI informant behind the seizure of the arms cache (whose name is still classified) was himself a member of the DRE, and was reporting to the FBI in Miami, not New Orleans.(8)”. Of course we know he would not", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:156:17f2dc7cc46c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5506, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 157, "text": "no indication of knowing about a training camp, or of being acquainted with any Cubans.” [FBI NO 100-16601 SA John T. Reynolds]. Reitzes, knowing all of the above, amazingly again focuses on the Miami informant, citing a Weberman footnote that “The FBI informant behind the seizure of the arms cache (whose name is still classified) was himself a member of the DRE, and was reporting to the FBI in Miami, not New Orleans.(8)”. Of course we know he would not be reporting TO New Orleans – he’d gotten his information FROM New Orleans. That agent from Miami learned about the cache’s location from the New Orleans FBI, remember? Researcher Robert Harris then wrote, “Reitzes’s argument was that the La Fontaines could not have been correct in their suggestion that Oswald was the informant in the Lake Pontchartrain weapons bust, since the real informant was this unnamed member of the DRE…. the first question that comes to mind, is why he didn’t cite the original source … the affidavit by SA De- Brueys… [where DeBrueys says] ”There are no references in the OSWALD case to any of the Subjects of the seizure matter. We have no indication that OSWALD had any connection with it.” IOW, this affidavit was produced by Mr. DeBrueys… the agent who has always been accused of making Oswald his informant. He physically threatened Orest Pena, another of his informants, to prevent him from telling the Warren Commission about his (DeBrueys’) connection to Oswald. Put another way, a denial by DeBrueys is about as persuasive as Carlos Marcello swearing he is an honest business man :-) Obviously, David could not convince many people, had he [directly] cited one of DeBrueys’ many denials.” John McAdams didn’t like what Harris said, so he made an ad hominem attack (it was all he could do, since Reitzes was exposed). He wrote: “Robert Harris is the Saddam Hussein of this newsgroup. He conceals information. He jerks people around endlessly. He welshes on his deals. Harris has learned from his mentors, the LaFontaines. But happily, he doesn’t have weapons of mass destruction. John” [We do wonder what “deals” Harris “welshes on” and why McAdams complains about his being treacherous.] Amazingly, Reitzes [encouraged by McAdams]then returns to his same error, by rephrasing it: “The error, of course, is immaterial: the McLaney cache informant was a Cuban exile and businessman reporting to the Miami FBI; not Lee Harvey Oswald, as Mary La Fontaine would have us believe.” But MM T-1 (as he had to have read, above!]only advised Miami about the plan to bomb Cuba that he heard from the pilot, and about the cache from the FBI in New Orleans. And of course, since DeBrueys said it wasn’t Lee, it couldn’t have been Lee, so Mary LaFontaine was just plain wrong. Reitzes has gone down a twisted trail that just leads, as usual, back", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:157:e19ca4785c22", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5507, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 158, "text": "not Lee Harvey Oswald, as Mary La Fontaine would have us believe.” But MM T-1 (as he had to have read, above!]only advised Miami about the plan to bomb Cuba that he heard from the pilot, and about the cache from the FBI in New Orleans.

Reitzes has gone down a twisted trail that just leads, as usual, back to the New Orleans FBI officer who would be in deep trouble if he ever admitted that Lee Oswald worked for him, though others there, such as Leake, said Lee did.” 30. When asked what Lee wore, I remembered a striped t-shirt and a cap. So much for accuracy! However, I had seen Lee wearing a striped shirt before, and maybe that influenced my memory. I had no idea that Tanenbaum existed, having kept far away from all of that out of pure fear and the despair that would grip me if I glimpsed anything about the assassination. 35. There is an unusual gap in the book Me & Lee, which has “diary entries” for most days. But there is no entry between the dates of Sunday, August 4, and Friday, August 9th. Information for August 5 was available, but not included in Me & Lee for two reasons: First, the original manuscript was 700 pages long and its focus was on Lee Oswald, not David Ferrie. The incident has been mentioned in live inter- 37. From Mary Ferrell’s Chronology: [Also]”…on August 9, 1963 (Friday) Oswald visits his aunt, Lillian Murrett, in the hospital.” [ Orest Pena says he saw FBI local chief Warren DeBrueys and Lee Oswald together in August: ] “On CBS documentary 11/26/75, Orestes Pena alleges he saw Oswald and FBI agent DeBrueys together at Greek restaurant in the French Quarter. (On or about 12/2/63, Pena claims DeBrueys told Pena to keep quiet about this assassination. DeBrueys denies.)” Note by author: Later, DeBrueys will claim Lee Oswald used the alias “Hidell” and will tell the FBI the day after the assassination to look for records under the name “Hidell.” “Lee used the fake name Hidell” in New Orleans, and DeBrueys knew it. The FBI was shown samples of Lee’s handwriting on post office box application forms, which they say they used to confirm the handwriting found on the mail order rifle they linked to Lee Oswald through “Hidell.” However, the handwriting samples could have been used to create the rifle order, when all other information is assembled that we now have about the order.” 38. An example of researchers misreporting witness statements: Murray wrote to the author August 13, 2013, saying, “Hey Judyth, Joan Mellen interviewed me by phone but made several errors in the paragraph.

Here is what she wrote in Farewell to Justice, p. 56-57: [Referring to how LHO seemed to have no connections to the NO Left, what Leftist would avoid the Left?} “None in history, young Bob Heller and Tulane student Hugh Murray both thought. Heller’s roommate, Oliver St. Pe, took a look at the Fair Play … leaflet, considered replying to the post office box of ‘Hidell,’ stamped on it, then changed his mind. It must be a trap, he decided.” Judyth, There were so many errors in this one paragraph, I decided not to review her book. Even though I look upon Garrison as a hero, I distrusted her research. Let me clarify. I am the one who picked up the FPCC leaflet in the Tulane library. I then went upstairs, behind the public area to where grad students had desks, carrels. I went to Harold Alderman who had been active in the FPCC, I think in Miami or some other city, and asked him, “What are you putting out?” I thought it was his leaflet. He wanted to see the yellow flyer. He knew nothing about it. We discussed what we might do, but were cautious. I joked that if we sent a letter to the PO box, it might be the FBI. A trap. We decided to do nothing until we found out more about the source of the flyer. (This is discussed in vol.. 26 of the Warren material.) Alderman took the leaflet and placed it on the door to his dorm room, until Nov. 22, when he took it down. He was visited by the FBI, I think on Tuesday 26 November, and he told them about me, and I was visited by 2 FBI agents on that Tuesday as well.” n August 29, 1963 the trip to Clinton, Louisiana begins. David Ferrie, Clay Shaw and Lee Oswald leave at dawn, stopping briefly in Hammond, LA, to provide an alibi (Shaw’s sick fa ther lives there). Next, they pick up an aide who works at Jackson’s East Louisiana Hospital, then travel on to Clinton where they wait to join a convoy bringing one or more prisoners from Angola Prison to East Louisiana Hospital in Jackson. Shaw must show his ID to author ities there, as the driver of a black Cadillac registered to the Interna tional Trade Mart, because they are parked near a payphone for hours. They are in full view of what they thought would", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:159:d40de287e717", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5509, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 160, "text": "they pick up an aide who works at Jackson’s East Louisiana Hospital, then travel on to Clinton where they wait to join a convoy bringing one or more prisoners from Angola Prison to East Louisiana Hospital in Jackson.

They are in full view of what they thought would be a nearly deserted courthouse, but it is swarming with blacks trying to register to vote after King’s inspiring speech. Locals think the Cadillac is suspicious. Aug. 29, 1963: A long wait in Clinton. While David Ferrie and Clay Shaw remain in the Cadillac, Lee briefly able to register (winning the bet) but when Lee asks about getting employed at the hospital, since “now I’m a resident,” his name is erased.1 Registrar Henry Earl Palmer (Grand Cyclops, KKK) will not forget the joke played on him.2 Meanwhile, David Ferrie, even under a hat, is recognizable, as is Shaw, as they wait. The answer is that Lee, not wishing to be stared at, left the Cadillac and soon decided to stand in line to register to vote after an educated black woman had been turned away as being illiterate. He “made a bet,” with Shaw, Ferrie, and the hospital employee, “that he could register without the correct ID just because he was white.”3 The registrar, Palmer, said Oswald signed his name, but it was erased when he could not produce any East Feliciana resident ID’s.4 Sometime after the registration attempt, the Cadillac drove away. The driver of the Cadillac was identified as Clay Shaw “of the International Trade Mart” by Clinton Deputy Sheriff, John Manchester. The white man’s testimony was backed up by a black man – Corrie Collins – then a local C.O.R.E. member, who by 1969 had moved to Michigan. Collins also identified Ferrie with Shaw, as well as Lee Harvey Oswald. C.O.R.E. was sponsoring a voter registration drive for black residents at the time, overlooked warily by local police and town officials, some of whom were affiliated with the racist, often violent Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Garrison’s Grand Jury Court records show that Henry Earl Palmer, the Registrar, had noticed C.O.R.E. member Collins standing by the black Cadillac and had asked Manchester to investigate.

Ferrie (who had expertise with cancer research) was there to advise technicians at the hospital how to handle and keep alive a dangerous cancer-causing material to be tested on the prisoner(s). Oswald was present to observe what Ferrie taught the technicians, and how and where Ferrie administered the shots. Nothing was to be written down by Lee: he was required to memorize every procedure. The Cadillac finally joins the convoy and passes unchallenged through the gates to Jackson’s mental hospital. Shaw has the money and authority, David Ferrie medical knowledge on injections and information to keep cancer cells alive, and Lee Oswald observes, so he can orally transmit the same information to a medical contact in Mexico City, where the cancer weapon, if successful, will be handed off and smuggled into Cuba. Because Lee must return with me (so I can perform a critical blood test), he fills out a job application form. This gives him an excuse to return, with me, on Saturday, Aug. 31 (a day he knows the personnel office will be closed, but Lee often plays the “stupid” card).7 Backing up my belief is this quote from Dick Russell’s book, On the Trail of the JFK Assassins, p. 266: “A paper co-authored by Heath, Silva, and a few others, and published in Comprehensive Psychology 1960, was titled Comparative Effects of the Administration of Taraxein, d-LSD, Mescaline, and Psilocybin to Human Volunteers.” The introduction stated, “The patient donors are housed in a special Tulane University Research Unit at the East Louisiana State Hospital, Jackson.” The experiments were supported by a grant from the Commonwealth Fund, later identified as a CIA front.” Description of the main building by a former patient: “Lavishly decorated, 6-8 stories (including “dungeon”) building houses professional staff offices and medical records – it has “many” employees. What they do is not clear. They have no contact with patients – it appears they shuffle paper all day to justify their existence.

I was in New Orleans Parish Prison for nearly a year awaiting trial in 1962, then sent to Angola from 1963-5…. While at Angola several others & I volunteered for medical experiments to be held at Jackson. There were 8 or 10 in my group…. The only 2 names I remember are Dan Robertson & a guy with the last name of Mayes. After we were there for 4-5 days, Mayes walked out of the ward one night after seeing one of the hospital orderlies come in from outside & forgetting to lock the door. The next morning the bus came & took us all back to Angola. I remember we were given some pills every morning but I have no idea what the experiment was about I learned later that half of us were given medicine & the other half were given placebos. Several years later I went to New Orleans at the request of Dan Robertson to testify on his behalf in a lawsuit he had brought against the State (or possibly the hospital) to show that the pills he took during that brief stay had caused him mental problems. I remember the doctor from Jackson testifying also about the experiment. If I can help further please let me know. Sincerely, Bill Livesay. Aug. 30, 1963: My career in cancer research ends in minutes. I had asked Dave what kind of terminal cancer the test subject had, as I must do a blood test to check for live cancer cells. David tells me the subject is healthy. Shocked, and angry, I protest in a note to Ochsner. Soon after, Ochsner calls me at Sherman’s apartment and explodes about the “paper trail,” shouting that Lee and I are “expendable.” Late afternoon, Aug. 30, 1963: I take a cab and meet Lee at The Fontainebleau Hotel to discuss the emergency. Dave then drives me to Charity Hospital for my exit interview with Ochsner. Crushed by Ochsner’s fury, Dave comforts me, then drives me to my apartment at 1032 Marengo.

Lee gives me $400 in $20 bills (equals approx. $3700 in today’s funds) so I will have a means to reach him in the future. Lee had asked David for a copy of a pocket-sized Aristotle after reading, with me, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom in which T. E. Lawrence, whom Lee admired, talked about carrying around a pocket-sized book of plays by Aeschylus. Lee, while waiting for Robert to leave and, later, twice in the car, wrote comments in the margins, and underlined sections, in The Pocket Aristotle. The concern is about ethics. David Ferrie gave me the book Modern Greek Self-Taught (property of the ‘Consolidated Library Eglin Field, Fla’) to provide my ticket into Eglin AFB’s library, where I was slated to meet anti-Castro CIA asset Alex Rorke and his pilot Geoffrey Sullivan. They would have flown me to the Yucatan, but their plane was shot down the same day Lee crossed the border into Mexico, making it impossible for me to meet Lee as planned. August 31, 1963: Lee Oswald mails letters to the Communist Party, and to the Party’s nemesis, the Socialist-Workers Party, stating his intentions to move to the Washington-Baltimore area. He has also written other letters about plans to move to Philadelphia, New York, and even back to the USSR. Instead, in less than a month, Lee will be going to Mexico City, having told his wife that he intends to live in Cuba (Marina has no plan to follow him there). Lee wrote these letters to mask his expected final destination – Mexico – where I was supposed to meet him after he handed off the bioweapon (if it worked). A medical contact would smuggle it into Cuba. Lee mailed the letters the same day we traveled to Jackson. “As Dave would put it,” Lee said, “let them keep guessing.” Because I was a new face in this scenario, Dave gave Lee a password for me to use to enter the area where the medical records and blood-work of the prisoner(s) could be accessed at the mental hospital. Dave had all kinds of contacts at Jackson. Lee told me Dave had rescued a couple of young adults from this institution, as well as several kids from Mandeville.

If the experiment(s) on the injected prisoner(s) turned out successful (killing them) Lee Oswald would eventually go to Mexico City with the live materials. There, he would verbally instruct a medical contact in Mexico City as to what he had observed, and the biologically engineered materials, designed to cause lung cancer, would be on their way to Fidel.9 Castro, who smoked cigars constantly, would seem to die of natural causes if the bioweapon worked, thanks to cooperative Cuban doctors who resented their careers being taken over by the new revolutionary government. Lee had been trained in methods to keep the materials alive for transport.10 He only pretended to seek work at the hospital to provide a motive for the trip to bring me back there, 72 hours later, when I had to do some blood counts and initiate blood tests, should he be noticed and remembered.11 At least two witnesses remembered seeing Lee Oswald in Jackson associated with an old car and a woman sitting in the old car (the Jackson incident) – Louisiana State Representative Reeves Morgan’s daughter Mary, and the town barber, Lea McGehee. Neither Ferrie nor Shaw were seen by any of the Clay Shaw trial witnesses in the Jackson incident. In the Clinton incident, Hospital employee Estus Morgan (or possibly another hospital employee) had been brought along to help guide Dave and Lee to the White Men’s Clinic behind the main building, which would have been difficult to identify and enter without assistance. The same person who was with Lee, David, and Clay Shaw on the trip to Clinton let us in at the gate two days later around 6 : 00 PM . The Jackson SightingsOn the way up to Jackson, Lee and I had to make a stop due to had to stop again for the same reason, but it gave Lee a chance to spread story that he was job-hunting, which would help explain our presence, especially if the car broke down so seriously we’d need help to get back to new Orleans. In nearby Jackson, Louisiana, town barber Edwin Lea McGehee had also seen Lee. He testified that Lee entered his barbershop about the same day the Clinton incident occurred. Tightly associated with Lee’s visit was the appearance of an old car McGehee had never seen before in the village of Jackson, in which a woman was Photo taken in 2014 on a trip to Jackson with Mary Morgan.

The barbershop was the door and window in the center. At the time, Mr. McGehee, the barber said he saw a bassinet. The “bassinet” was a large wicker basket that actually was going to be used as a bassinet by Anna Lewis, David Lewis’ wife. The Kaiser-Frazier was a general-use vehicle that year for persons in The Project. It was considered a reliable vehicle, but Lee and I had problems with it. sitting.12 After Oswald left the barbershop, the car also left, though McGehee didn’t see Oswald get into the car. McGehee said he had advised Lee to visit a friend, Reeves Morgan, for information about getting employment at the nearby East Louisiana State (Mental) Hospital, about which Oswald had inquired.13 Reeves Morgan, who worked as a guard at the state mental hospital in Jackson, said he also received a visit from Lee just after sunset that same day. His daughter, Mary, a tenth-grader, was home. She saw Lee, the old car, and, testified later to Sciambra that she had seen a woman sitting in the old car – just as McGehee had.14 Lee indeed made excuses for his two separate appearances at the hospital, both times saying he was interested in a job. He had filled out a job application when he had come with Clay Shaw and David Ferrie, and an employee there who saw the application eventually reported it.15 Lee also told me that a friend of the hospital employee – and aide – that they had picked up on the way to Clinton joined the registration line at one point to talk to the hospital employee. This person might have been Winslow Foster, who was also employed by the East Louisiana State Hospital.16 In 1979, the HSCA’s Final Report stated the HSCA was “inclined to believe” that Lee Oswald had been in Clinton “in the company of David Ferrie, if not Clay Shaw.”17 Dr. Howard Platzman: (researcher/author) Conflict rose among researchers because Jackson witnesses had reported seeing Oswald in an old car, with a woman, in the late afternoon and early evening, while Clinton witnesses reported seeing Oswald in a late model black Cadillac with Clay Shaw and David Ferrie in the morning and afternoon in Clinton.

Nobody could satisfactorily reconcile two different cars until this explanation came to light in 1999. Nor could it be understood, until now, why Oswald would travel with Shaw and Ferrie so far from New Orleans. Some researchers continue to speculate that Shaw and Ferrie were trying to manipulate Lee to get him a job at the mental hospital, presumably so he could later be charged with mental instability after Kennedy’s assassination as part of efforts to frame Oswald.19 But there are two problems with this theory. (1) Employment records cannot be transformed into mental hospital medical records. (2) There was no need to sit openly – being stared at – for hours, if Lee just needed to register. (3) And why didn’t Lee have the correct ID, if all this time and effort was expended to drive him over a hundred miles and wait so long, only to see Lee turned away? Reason and logic shows this was a spontaneous act, to pass the time spent waiting. Lee Oswald was We are on our way back from the mental hospital at Jackson. It is near sunset, and a strong, cool breeze rises, but now the car’s engine is hissing from a pinhole leak, which we temporarily fix. Since the engine still needs to cool down, Lee turns into a long driveway, saying he’ll talk to Reeves Morgan, a state representative who works at the hospital, and then he’ll add water to the radiator. He parks under a big tree, near a nice house with a large front porch. “I’ll be right back,” Lee says, commenting that it is best that I stay in the car, so I don’t complicate things. “Sorry about the mosquitoes,” he adds. Lee then walks up to the house, knocks on the door, and is promptly invited inside. I sit in the car, in the deepening twilight, working on the charts and checking the temperature of the blood samples in the cooler. At one point, I look up and see a girl about my age standing on the porch. She’s looking in my direction. This is Reeve Morgan’s daughter, Mary. She will later tell Garrison investigator Andrew Sciambra that she remembered seeing a woman in an old car when Lee came. Her presence there was corroborated by her father.

Mary Morgan is the second witness to report my presence in “an old car” “at the end of August or the first of September.”20 Andrew Sciambra interviewed Reeves Morgan’s daughter, Mary, for Garrison privately on June 3, 1967. Here is an excerpt from his January 29, 1968 report of that interview: I … talk(ed) with his daughter, Mary Morgan, who had been at home at the time of the Oswald visit. Mary Morgan … told me that when Oswald was in the house talking with her dad, she happened to walk towards the screen door and went onto the porch and just casually noticed that there was a dark colored car parked under the tree in front of the house. It was rather dark and she didn’t really pay much attention to the car … it was an old car and the model was somewhere in the Fifties. She says that she remembers seeing a woman in the car.21 We plan to be in touch: Dave is going to help with arranging free phone calls, using his Mafia contacts. Lee says that he has already made it plain to Marina that he would leave, never to return. “I told her she had a hundred people in Dallas who would take care of her. She’d be happy there. Or she could live with me, and never be happy.” Lee feels divorce from Marina is inevitable. They should go ahead and get it over with, while the kids are young, so they won’t have a lot of bad memories of fights and arguments. Lee cries as he tells me these things. He understands the weight of his actions, and they grieve him. I can see that his love for me is as deep as mine is for him.

The CIA “advised that it was “giving some consideration to countering the activities of [the Committee] in foreign countries …. and giving thought to planting deceptive information which might embarrass the Committee.” The day after that memo was written, Oswald applied for a Tourist Card for a visit to Mexico. A new passport had been issued to him within twenty-four hours – even though his application stated he might wish to return to the Soviet Union. Funny that, you may think – given Oswald‘s background as a defector and traitor. (email) 1. Why would Lee, who could claim residency from April in Orleans Parish, wish to move to a new, faraway parish where he and his pregnant wife, Marina, and his little girl would not be able to obtain free medical care, whereas the family would soon qualify at New Orleans’ Charity Hospital in October, when the new baby was due? Ruth Paine will soon fake residency records for Marina Oswald so she can receive reduced-fee care at Parkland Hospital in Dallas. In a letter (WCE 90, p.1), Paine offered to pay Marina, for teaching her Russian, cash, free room and board, and all of Marina’s medical and dental bills. Paine removed Marina Oswald and Oswald’s daughter, June, taking them to Irving (a suburban town near Dallas) late in September, after which Lee left for Mexico City. 2. The registrar, Henry Earl Palmer, showed Garrison investigator Anne Dischler the page where an “O” could still be seen, overwritten after Oswald’s name was erased, by another registrant. The record, however, soon disappeared. Dischler’s credibility is considered unquestionable by honest researchers. See the book Me & Lee, for complete details regarding the Clinton and Jackson incidents. 3. Oswald’s active support of civil rights was reported by his friend, George deMohrenschildt in his book (I Am a Patsy!) published by the HSCA, and by Johan Rush, Carlos Bringuier, and others who observed that when Oswald paid his fine for “disturbing the peace” when he handed out Pro-Castro literature and pro-Cuba flyers, he chose to sit with “the negroes” on “the colored side” of the New Orleans courtroom. 5.

Therefore, it is misleading that some Warren Commission apologists such as Dave Reitzes (published by John McAdams) have written: “Registrar of Voters Henry Earl Palmer testified that …two men [were] inside: the passenger had heavy eyebrows “and his hair needed combing.” When Sciambra displayed a photograph of David Ferrie, Palmer said, “I can’t recognize the individual, but the hair and the eyebrows are similar.”(6) He was more certain about the defendant, Clay Shaw, whom he positively identified as the driver of the Cadillac.(7) The apologists then argue that surely Ferrie would be recognized. However, Palmer had only seen a profile of the passenger, including just one “bushy eyebrow” and “messed-up hair” – probably not enough to identify even Ferrie. 6. The HSCA was able to extract more details from the witnesses because they were no longer under pressure. While there is no evidence that the Cadillac was registered to the International Trade Mart, Manchester had no reason to lie. The International Trade Mart hosted important visitors worldwide, often housing them at International House, an organization connected to the Trade Mart for close to a decade by Clay Shaw and Dr. Alton Ochsner, who headed International House in 1963. Ochsner was given Cadillacs annually by Texas oil magnates such as Sid Richardson and the Murchisons. These incoming Cadillacs were used for fund-raising for Ochsner Clinic. See Surgeon of the South, Ochsner’s official biography, for details about how Ochsner disposed of some of the Cadillacs. 7. Once led to believe that Shaw and Ferrie spent half a day trying to get Lee Oswald ‘registered’ to help Lee get a job at the mental hospital, so that later his job there could be used to help show he was mentally unstable, researchers had no explanation for why Clay Shaw, a very busy man, was there, or why the long wait to get Lee registered occurred at all, since Lee had no ID for East Feliciana Parish – ID that could have been easily faked. Shaw and Ferrie were not idiots. They were trapped by a delayed phone call. Lee, avidly pro-civil rights, simply made a bet and got his name briefly on the registrar’s rolls. Some researchers tried to claim that because witnesses in Clinton didn’t speak out until 1967, the blacks and whites cooperated to make up the story, as if KKK and C.O.R.E. members would cooperate in such a thing. In addition, some witnesses such as McGehee stated they did try to contact FBI, and were ignored. 8.

Barber Lea McGehee and Mary Morgan, daughter of Reeves Morgan, both remembered an old car with a woman sitting in it associated with Lee Oswald on this trip to Jackson, due to a stop before and after the visit Lee and I made to the hospital. Because some witnesses saw Lee in the Cadillac and others saw him associated with the old car and a woman, researchers offered various theories, such as that the trip with Shaw and Ferrie must have lasted at least two days, not one. Efforts by researcher Joan Mellen, to push McGehee to add a Cadillac to his memories, and to remove Mary Morgan, Reeves Morgan’s daughter, from the record, continue to the present day. Full details and witness statements can be found in Me & Lee. 10. See more information in Me & Lee (2010); also, “The Love Affair,” Episode 8, last segment, the banned documentary produced for the History Channel (A&E) by Nigel Turner, 2003, in the once-popular, now-removed series The Men Who Killed Kennedy. Oswald was a logical choice because he had been posing as pro-Castro in New Orleans and would not be suspected of carrying biological materials to hand off (or take into Cuba himself, if necessary). With no paper trails allowed, Lee was required to observe and memorize how the material was to be handled and used on a prisoner, in order to pass on the information. When the contact failed to show, Oswald tried to enter Cuba himself. Failing in that attempt, he left Mexico City days before his tourist visa expired, because the materials, having a short shelf life, would soon die. In Dallas, Lee never attempted returning to Mexico City even though his transit visa to do so arrived on his birthday (Oct. 18). He had been assigned to a different mission by then. 11. Lee drove me from and to New Orleans: at least two witnesses reported seeing a woman at that time sitting in a an old car associated with Oswald in and near Jackson (McGehee and Morgan). Numerous witnesses reported Lee could drive, although Marina Oswald and Ruth Paine insisted otherwise. If considered unable to drive, Lee’s actual activities using a car would be harder to trace or anticipate. 12.

Documented by Sciambra memos and brought forth by Garrison prosecutors in the opening statements of the Clay Shaw trial, where the woman was stated not to be Marina Oswald, Oswald’s wife. Morgan’s daughter Mary, a student at Louisiana State University in 1967: “…when Oswald was in the house talking with her dad, she happened to walk towards the screen door and went onto the porch and just casually noticed that there was a dark colored car parked under the tree in front of the house.” It was “an old car and the model was somewhere in the Fifties.” She remembered “seeing a woman in the car.” In her most recent book, Joan Mellen removed Mary’s statement from her own description of Lee’s visit to Morgan’s home and said a Cadillac picked Lee up there, citing her brother, who was then a small boy. She also said McGehee told her he saw Lee get into a Cadillac after he left the barber shop. Original testimonies said no such things, and McGehee complained to me and witness Kelly Thomas that he had been harangued by Mellen to say he saw a Cadillac. This substitution of “new material” for the original testimonies was shocking to me. Lee told me that he did not want it known that he could drive for various reasons. I met Mary in October 2014. Mary said she could not remember seeing a lady in the car, but agreed I had to have been there when I described the following: (1) proper orientation of the car parked in her unusual driveway (2) large object sitting on her large porch (2) pointed out the size of the steps to the porch had changed (to longer) (3) when she asked me the color of the car, she agreed that was the color of the car (4) knew she was thin back then (5) knew the house was painted white back then (6) knew the azalea bushes – big and old – were not there back then (7) knew the area across the street had no houses back", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:171:4d7cac00ee59", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5521, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 172, "text": "on her large porch (2) pointed out the size of the steps to the porch had changed (to longer) (3) when she asked me the color of the car, she agreed that was the color of the car (4) knew she was thin back then (5) knew the house was painted white back then (6) knew the azalea bushes – big and old – were not there back then (7) knew the area across the street had no houses back then (8) described the car parked the correct direction in the driveway (9) Mary agreed there could have been a woman in the old car and that she had forgotten over the years (10) was surprised at my memory abilities (11) said her brother Van was 13 and didn’t climb trees at that age and could not have seen what he described to a researcher … that by the way, she was still in high school herself at the time, not a college student as everyone has described her (12) said I correctly described the time in the evening when Lee came to the house (deep twilight) (13) admitted I had to have been in the car (14) said nobody ever interviewed her separately, but she might have been asked questions bySciambra when he was interviewing her father.… It was not something that meant much to her at the time.… 15. Clay Shaw trial records show State Hospital employee Mrs. Bobbie Dedon testified in 1969 that she’d spoken briefly with Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963 and had directed him to the personnel office in the facility’s administration building. She placed this encounter at lunchtime – too early. She was also unable to describe Lee convincingly, but her testimony is significant because she worked in the White Male Clinic where Lee first came upon arriving at the hospital, and she had no reason to fabricate her story. Maxine Kemp, a secretary in the State Hospital’s personnel office, also testified that in September 1964 she found a job application filled out by a “Harvey Oswald,” but by 1967, it had disappeared. Her supervisor denied that Kemp had seen anything. While some may find it “odd” that neither Dedon nor Kemp mentioned Lee’s visit to the hospital earlier, when considered along with so many others who saw Ferrie, Shaw and Oswald together, and who testified that Oswald inquired about getting a job there, who also did not speak out until later (after all, New Orleans and its FBI offices were far from these small, sleepy towns), a convincing number of people from different walks of life spoke out, obviating opportunities for collusion. 17.

I have explained that a second trip to the hospital was needed to check on the viability of the injected cancer, using a variety of a blood sedimentation test I had developed, and that Lee drove me to the hospital less than 72 hours after the Clinton incident, during which the encounters with McGehee and Reeves Morgan occurred where I was seen sitting in the old car. Ever since I identified myself as the woman in the car, Mellen opposed this, apparently because it wrecked her theory that Lee was brought to Clinton to register to vote, and then to Jackson so he could be more easily framed. She has to therefore delete me altogether from everything else as well, so in 2004, she invents Gladys Palmer as Lee’s girlfriend, later (in 2013) abandoning poor Gladys, who she said was ^(′′)40 but still hot” for Gloria Wilson, who she says was murdered and was a Clinton resident. Before I’d spoken out, the two different cars were mentioned by anti-Oswald writers trying to prove that the Clinton and Jackson witnesses were not reliable, since one group saw a Cadillac with Shaw and Ferrie and Oswald, and the other group, at about the same time, insisted they saw an old car with a woman sitting in it, associated with Oswald in Jackson sightings. My explanation – that two trips were involved – was unwelcome to anti-Oswald writers and to researchers whose theories I disrupted, so evidence of me had to vanish. 21. The Warren Commission did not look into these events. In fact, they claimed that they did not know where Lee was during this time. The Clinton Incident, as it is called, was discovered and documented in the late 1960’s by the Garrison Investigation and again in the 1970’s during the HSCA Investigation. Some of the related documents were kept secret until the 1990s. Lee’s true activities were unknown and unsupported for years, but are clearly supported today. A few details were also gleaned from witnesses who testified either in the Clay Shaw Trial or the House Select Committee on Assassinations to present a more complete picture of the events. The Jackson-Clinton scenario has been a thorny issue for researchers. Why would Shaw and Ferrie be seen with somebody like Oswald, for example? Researchers pushing their theories have to convince readers that both Clay Shaw and David Ferrie for some reason needed to sit in Clinton for hours, visible to the whole town, as they waited for Lee to register to vote. In a real-life situation, Shaw and Ferrie would simply have dropped Lee off and gone to a place where", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:173:3389c87b5deb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5523, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 174, "text": "Jackson-Clinton scenario has been a thorny issue for researchers.

In a real-life situation, Shaw and Ferrie would simply have dropped Lee off and gone to a place where they wouldn’t be seen –that is, if you can believe that both Shaw and Ferrie were needed for this time-consuming foray. Meanwhile, Lee is making a spectacle of himself, but is unable to register, ultimately, because he has no proper ID. The bright minds of Shaw and Ferrie seem to have failed them on this very basic matter. They have wasted almost half-a-day with no results. And were visible to everybody. A claim has been made by Joan Mellen, who over the past fifteen years has offered the names of two different women (one in her 40’s, and, a decade later, a younger woman) as Lee’s ‘real’ girlfriend, without providing any evidence, is the only person who has also reported that Morgan’s very young son was supposedly up in a tree at the time Lee made his visit in the old car. The boy supposedly saw Lee get into a Cadillac that came suddenly roaring up. Such a statement must be weighed against witnesses telling the author, when she visited New Orleans in Oct. 2013, that the boy, now a grown man, could have been manipulated into saying almost anything. The boy has now been discredited by his older sister as being prone to make up things. She stated to Kris Millegan and me in October 2014 that no Cadillac came to the house when Lee was there, and that only an old car showed up when Lee visited. She asked me the color of the car, and was pleased when I told her it was dark green. “That is exactly right,” she said. My Last talk with David – “Dr. Joe” and Gainesville We all have times when we know we’ve made a turn in lifethat is going to change everything. That time had come Susie Hanover’s side yard, sitting on those aluminum folding-chairs with their harsh nylon weave. Dave was doing his best to calm me down until Lee could arrive and take over. I was about to be forced to return to Gainesville, and was still in shock from Ochsner’s hatefilled thunder, ringing in my ears. I was now banned from cancer research! Only Lee’s love, the thoughtful ministrations of dear old Susie, and darned ol’ Dave, kept me from falling apart.

Dave told me, as I shook all over, “Listen up, chickadee, I have some contacts in Gainesville, remember? I’m going to help you.” One of them, he said, knew a doctor they both trusted. The contact would give the message to Carlos, my pocked-marked anti-Castro friend who wore green sunglasses and worked at the Craft Shop.1 ”For your information,” Dave went on, “It is my friend, Dr. Joe Davis. I’ve told you about him.” In fact, Dave had, but I’d been under the impression that “Dr. Joe” lived in New Orleans. I knew he had taught Dave how to analyze autopsies. Dave had established a friendship with Dr. Joe in Miami for various reasons related to his CAP positions, before he lost his job as a pilot with Eastern Air Lines. Now Dave gave me more details about the man. Dr. Joe had interned at the US Public Health Service Hospital in New Orleans, where he eventually met Dr. Mary Sherman.2 Her expertise on bones intrigued him, and Dr. Joe spent time in her bone lab, observing the different kinds of trauma and diseases that could cause bones to break or deform, including bones stressed by cancer, polio or amputations. Dr. Joe was mentored by Dr. Stanley Durlacher, who did autopsies for New Orleans Parish Coroner Dr. Nicholas Chetta. Dave flew between New Orleans and Miami every once in a while, most often to attend training update sessions in Miami, where Eastern Air Lines had its main offices. There is also reason to believe he made some anti-Castro flights out of Miami. It seems that after Dr. Joe moved to Miami, Dr. Mary Sherman asked Dave to give Dr. Joe an unusual autopsy report. Dave told me his association with Dr. Joe began when he delivered the report, at which time he was invited to drop by “any time” with more of the same. From then on, Dave took unusual autopsy reports to Dr. Joe for examination whenever he could.4 Some of them reflected gangland murders, but others involved unusual tropical diseases brought in by Latino and Indian immigrants – highly valued by Dr. Joe. With characteristic magnanimity, Dr. Joe taught Dave how to analyze these reports. “He’s a tremendous teacher – a Sherlock Holmes,” Dave said. Dave also observed autopsies on occasion. Dr. Joe was unusual in that he allowed “the public” to attend his autopsy sessions.5 For the curious “Dr.” Ferrie, whose brother Parmely once said Dave wanted to be a doctor, these lessons were irresistible.

Dave never told the FBI details on how he was trained in the forensic sciences, or why his opinion might be trusted. To do so might have led to Dr. Joe, Dr. Sherman, and even me. Guy Banister, however, verified that Dave Ferrie analyzed autopsy reports for him: “… he … [entered an] arrangement in February 1962 with Guy Banister … a former FBI agent who ran a private investigative firm…. By the terms of the agreement, [Banister said] Ferrie’s work for Banister included analyzing autopsy reports in payment for Banister’s investigative services.”6 Dr. Joseph H. Davis became one of the most famous forensic pathologists in America. He was also one of the few medical experts selected by the HSCA to examine forensic details in the assassination cases of President Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King. Dr. Davis’ assessment of the JFK assassination may be gauged by a remark he made to a distinguished audience on Nov. 18, 1999: “…the first thing medical examiners are supposed to talk about is the drama of mystery in knowing the outcome of who-done-its. For example: What killed Elvis Presley, or is he really dead? Who fired the shot from the grassy knoll at JFK?”7 For those who wonder if such a strange-looking fellow as Dave would have been allowed in Davis’ office, this statement by a former police officer can put their minds at rest: “Doctor Davis … served as Miami-Dade County’s Chief Medical Examiner for forty years, between 1957 and 1996, conducting over 10,000 autopsies and mentoring hundreds, maybe thousands, of other pathologists, forensic technicians, cops, lawyers, politicians and media personnel around the world…. He was just as respectful and friendly to a rookie cop as he was to a state governor. I seriously doubt there is one human being on the planet – though he was known by thousands – who ever had a negative word to say about Doctor Joseph H. Davis.”9 Jack Martin’s Endless Hostility to Ferrie Explained David Ferrie once explained to me Jack Martin’s hostility to-wards him in some detail. “It went something like this,” Dave said. “Jack’s wife, Paula, has a little kid, and at one point, I got to feeling sorry for her and the baby, because I saw Martin go straight to a booze joint as soon as he got his pay. So I brought over some groceries, and milk for the kid.” the provider, not me.

So I brought over some groceries, and milk for the kid.” the provider, not me. When he raised his fists at me, Paula said she’d call the police and have him “sent to Jackson” – that she had that kind of power if he wouldn’t behave himself. And the Jackass curled up in a ball and started to cry.” Dave added, “That’s when I found out that Paula never realized that getting him ‘dried out’ at Charity would mean the electroshocks.” Dave laughed bitterly. “J,” he went on, “do you know how many kids I’ve rescued from [Dr.] Heath and Company’s clutches? You’d be surprised. A few of them had ended up at Mandeville. They’d been raped with mop handles, were forced to eat their own feces, and got beat up. They were electroshocked zombies by the time I got a couple of them out of there. But Jackson was even worse. Martin knew if he ever got sent to Jackson, he’d never get out of there alive. Jackson has a graveyard. Just numbers, not names, on the graves. And those numbers vanish from the record books.” Soon after that, Dave and Martin had another tangle, and when Dave threatened to call the ‘Thought Police.’ Martin knew exactly what Dave meant. “He went tearing over to Gill,” Dave said, “and told him to fire me, that I needed a psychiatrist, that I should be hauled off to Jackson. He made up a puke story about me. I heard him yelling, and Gill told me to get rid of him. I physically removed him from the office. From then on, we’ve been total enemies.” I realize now that Jack S. Martin was willing to say and do anything to get David Ferrie locked up, if he possibly could. I had forgotten all about this part of David’s life story until a researcher asked me, in 2013, if David had ever been to the mental hospital at Jackson before the incident in late August. I replied that I didn’t know, but he had been to Mandeville a few times, and rescued a few kids out there who had been cut off from the outside world. Dave used his influence with Gill to provide attorney’s writs to get them out of there.

Even the kids he saved. love to talk, we spend several hours doing everything we can think of to express our love, without words. I wear the black necklace he gave me, and just a little bit more. There is joy, laughter, and a kind of desperate mask overlaid to stop the tears. I give Lee a black and gold hunting knife, in anticipation of our meeting in the wilds of Mexico. Lee returns the love letter I had written to him. He can’t keep it safely with his things, but couldn’t bring himself to destroy it. He also asks me to keep the nice brown Vesuvio tie his uncle Dutz had given him after their secret talk, so he could wear it at our marriage ceremony. I fold it carefully, not realizing that it will remain folded up for fifty years. Because of Lee, New Orleans is transformed from a dark nest of evil into an incredibly romantic city filled with life, energy, and music. I can see it through his eyes – and it is beautiful. As our last hour together approaches, Lee and I hold each other as if our hearts will break. Finally, we must part. Robert isn’t there when I arrive at 1032, so I call Dave on Susie’s phone and ask him to tell Dr. Mary that I’m leaving in the morning. Dave said, “If I tried to run, like you and Lee plan to do, how could I hide, the way I look?” I hang up the phone with a heavy heart, realizing that my dream of finding a cure for cancer is dead, and that death, in fact, is now closing in on us from every side. September 1963: Lee retained his contacts with Dr. Mary Sherman and David Ferrie on a discrete basis. There were final steps being taken to perfect the bioweapon for The Project. Because I had protested to the use of healthy “volunteers;” I was expelled and forced to return to Florida. I believe this move saved my life. To convince Ochsner that he didn’t have to worry about me, Lee waited several weeks until he felt it was safe to be in contact again.

We drove to University of Florida, where Robert went off to meetings and I called Senator Smathers’ office from the Student Union. When Smathers’ secretary told me not to call again, and hung up on me, I knew Ochsner had lied about a scholarship arrangement with the senator. I had been blackballed, even to Smathers. I was dumped, without any hope of ever getting into any medical school, or ever having another scholarship. Almost in tears, but knowing Dave had promised I’d be getting a full-time job at a chemical research laboratory, I paid late fees and signed up for two night classes.10 Now I could apply for a part-time job at the Craft Shop, providing an excuse – just as Lee had done at the hospital at Jackson – for showing up there. Only I’d be begging to be hired again. I never dared approach any lab at UF itself, for fear they’d contact Ochsner or Smathers. Soon, the precious enrollment paper was in my hand. Trembling, I called Dave. He answered on my second attempt, but had only a minute to talk. “I have to go to Texas to set this thing up,” he said, apologizing that it would take so long. I gave Dave the second and third numbers we would need for Lee’s end of the “Call Wheel.”11 One of my numbers was a payphone sitting on a high curb, all by itself, in an older neighborhood near the tiny, roach-infested hovel Robert’s parents obtained for us. The other number was for a payphone located at a Seven-Eleven store a few blocks from the ‘cottage’ (so dubbed by Robert’s mother). Later, I’d give Dave and Lee a fourth number, from PenChem, where a job was to be arranged for me. My suitcase was packed, ready to go, kept under the bed. As soon as the prisoner(s) died, Lee was to leave New Orleans. Eventually I would learn much more from Lee: he would be routed to Mexico City through Dallas and Houston, carrying the bioweapon. (All the details of that secret and remarkable journey are in Me & Lee.) As for me, when the right phone call came, I would head to Mexico, too. I’d be back in Lee’s arms!

Later, when Lee felt it was finally safe to contact me, he affirmed that he had met with “Mr. B” and a man I now know was Alpha 66’s Antonio Veciana. Lee also gave me additional details, such as having to eat his lunch out of a vending machine at the airport because he wasn’t invited to eat with “Mr. B” and Veciana. (In November, 2013, Veciana finally officially identified “Mr. B^(′′) as David Atlee Phillips, just as Lee himself had finally guessed, back in 1963.) had only one phone number for Dave, and it could not be used I again after he received my phone numbers. When Dave said, “Let’s see if you remember the codes for the Call Wheel,” I hung up. It was already late, but it was a test. I was supposed to know which phone would ring (‘South’ – phone #2 ), and the time, which in this case was an hour later. When Dave made his second call, I told him we needed more codes. For example, “I’ll call you tomorrow, same time” might actually mean an hour later that same night, but at the next phone on the compass. A phone would be skipped simply by asking, “Can I reach you at this same number next time?” (no matter what the answer was). We had to work up new codes because so much of my time, at first, was spent in only two places. I was at UF on Tuesday and Thursday nights, while Robert was at UF every night. That’s because he preferred to study in a nice, well-lit carrel that UF provided for seniors and grad students. A sensible choice, since the only lighting we had in the “cottage” was a lamp with a paper plate for a shade, unless we kept the refrigerator door open. I took a bus home after working on campus, those first few weeks. After we put together the extra codes, Dave updated me on the civil rights unrest in New Orleans, which was making Guy Banister foam at the mouth. Finally, Dave told me the big news. “Hector is in Dallas,” he told me. This was probably Tuesday, September 10. (If Dave said, “All is well” it actually meant there were problems.). So, in the contorted language we utilized, Dave told me that Hector (Lee) had been flown to Dallas for a quick trip in preparation for his upcoming journey to Mexico City.13 There,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:180:7a5c75cc6036", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5530, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 181, "text": "the civil rights unrest in New Orleans, which was making Guy Banister foam at the mouth.

So, in the contorted language we utilized, Dave told me that Hector (Lee) had been flown to Dallas for a quick trip in preparation for his upcoming journey to Mexico City.13 There, Lee was introduced by his handler, “Mr. B,” to a man who was supposed to be in charge of his medical contact in Mexico City, so the bioweapon would not fall into the wrong hands. But Dave said there were problems with the meeting. First, Hector had been forbidden to speak to this man. Second, the meeting was suddenly called off. Third, “Mr. B” was calling himself “Mr. Bishop” now. At this point, Dave shut down the call. He felt he had already said too much.14 Today, I think Dave called so often to keep an eye on me. He knew I was an emotional person – just as he was – and that I needed emotional support during the time Lee and I could not communicate. So he made sure I was kept up to date on what Lee was doing. It was some kind of comfort. On this call, of which I remember little, Dave did tell me that Hector (Lee) was keeping nice and quiet in New Orleans, in contrast to all his pro-Cuba activities and his seeming obsession with promoting Uncle Fidel. It was a great relief. No more publicity – thank God! He must not be noticed leaving town … he must be forgotten, now … Until I spoke out in 1999, nobody had a logical explanation for Lee’s suddenly “giving up” on the FPCC. All his frenetic public activity supporting the FPCC and pro-Cuban interests had come to a screeching halt. Now, he hunkered down. Weeks would pass without a peep from Lee Oswald. He was waiting for an important event that would shape our future forever. As soon as the prisoner died – and the prisoner was doing quite poorly – Lee would then have to travel immediately. It was important that a sudden departure would not be noticed by the media. Lee still attended certain meetings, requiring quick trips to Sulphur, Louisiana (a very small town with its own airport outside of Lake Charles), some trips to Baton Rouge, and perhaps a flight to Florida. While waiting, Lee read books. He loved to read. Marina would later say he spent lots of time dry-firing his rifle: click … click-click … Clunk … aiming it at the street – though not another soul ever saw a rifle.

And those nosy neighbors saw a lot: they said Lee wore yellow trunks and flip-flops most of the time, as he sat reading on the porch, using a little lamp as it got dark. n our third call, Dave felt free to reveal more. Because “Hector” I had been told to say nothing, he could not speak when he was quietly waved away at the meeting with “Mr. B” and the contact we now know was Antonio Veciana. “The contact never heard his voice,” Dave said. “Not good. Somebody else could pose as him on the phone to this contact. Then he had to fly back to New Orleans on an empty stomach, while the other guy was invited to lunch.” I remembered what Lee told me about being held back by The Company, because he hadn’t come back to the USA in a coffin. When I asked for more clarification, Dave said, “Hector had to leave without any information, but the other guy stayed. He’s the one that’s getting information. The guy came there to ID Hector. Why?” Soon, Lee gave me more details. I would flesh out the rest many decades later. Lee had met one of the CIA’s most clever and dangerous leaders, David Atlee Phillips. Antonio Veciana, a notorious anti-Castro leader, the other individual, was the boss of Alpha 66. Even I had seen his photo, and certainly Lee had. After hearing this information, I purchased a .22 caliber pistol with a brown handle.15 “Mr. B’s” poor treatment of Lee would remain a nagging concern for us. After a quick meeting, Lee had been returned to New Orleans almost at once, without knowing for sure who he would meet in Mexico City. Now wary, Lee was doubly concerned because shortly after returning to New Orleans, he was driven to Baton Rouge, where, as he stood guard (supposedly to keep a meeting safe) he found himself “inspected” by a military officer prior to the officer’s entering the meeting.16 Sept. 17, 1963: Blue Boxes – Dave established a phone connection through a Mafia racing line so all three friends could communicate with each other. “Blue Boxes” were probably used. The Mafia constantly rigged up free telephone calls for betting purposes and private communications. Blue Boxes could be portable for use at a payphone, or installed into a switchboard, where it could be activated by hand or by the caller (using a code).

Ruth Paine was reliable: she would be on time, as promised. All that was set up. But what if the prisoner died before Paine arrived? There was no longer any doubt about the bioweapon’s power. In Dave’s fourth call, which was to me, and which had FBI File 92-HQ-4957 Serial #10: Myron Julian Deckelbaum, aka AR. 1961-11-30 “3 local men accused, 13 Indicted in New Orleans.” From “about November, 1952 and continuously until about July 31, 1959^(′′) when discovered, Mafia such as Albert Bagneris, Vincent Caminita, and Frank Marino “conspired” and concealed from the IRS “their widespread horse race betting and other gambling activities by securing free unauthorized long distance telephone service.” [FBI via FOA] (FBI Case #161 in series): ^(′′2) Attempted Murders, Suicide Link Mafia to Phone Company” 1975-03-30 John Moulder, The National Tattler: “Two lawyers… were shot while investigating Southwestern Bell and the attempt to connect Bell to the Mafia…” Involved: “Carlos Marcello (aka Little Man, mafia don, New Orleans); T.O.

Good (SBTCo VP); miniframe wiretapping device; FBI.” On September 20, while Dave was apparently in Houston (see call record, page 251), Ruth arrived at 4905 Magazine St. with her small children. She parked her station wagon, which had a boat on top, in front of Lee’s apartment on Magazine Street for the next few days. It couldn’t be ignored. After three days of packing, and a visit to Bourbon Street (Lee didn’t go) Ruth and Marina were ready to leave. Meanwhile, Dave was going to meetings himself, even as he ostensibly was doing work for only Carlos Marcello, whose upcoming trial was taking up more and more of his time, including yet more trips to Guatemala and days spent at Churchill Farms – Marcello’s inner sanctum for “taking care of business.” Dave’s phone record shows it was almost surely he who went to Houston twice and Ft. Worth Dallas once during the waiting period.17 At least one of those visits established the final links so Lee could call me from either Houston", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:183:ad0ecd57ce30", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5533, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 184, "text": "doing work for only Carlos Marcello, whose upcoming trial was taking up more and more of his time, including yet more trips to Guatemala and days spent at Churchill Farms – Marcello’s inner sanctum for “taking care of business.” Dave’s phone record shows it was almost surely he who went to Houston twice and Ft.

DA Jim Garrison penned in his notes that Dave called Washington, DC, on September 24, when Lee was seen “leaving New Orleans.” As I have reported in detail in Me & Lee, an emissary of Lyndon Johnson’s most powerful aide, Tommy “the Cork” Corcoran, flew to New Orleans the next day. Early the morning of Wednesday, September 25, the emissary gave Lee a large envelope to deliver to a government office in Austin, Texas, as part of his travels prior to crossing the border. Sept. 25, 1963: At dawn, Lee Oswald, at [Ochsner’s] International House, meets with Guy Banister, Hugh Ward, Clay Shaw and the envoy from Tommy “the Cork” Corcoran. David Ferrie is not present. Lee will carry money to Austin. A DeHaviland Dove awaits Lee and pilot Hugh Ward at Houma. Lee will fly to Austin and Dallas before ending up in Houston to catch a bus traveling to Laredo, TX. Only then will witnesses claim they saw him. The bus ticket leaves a trail that indicates Lee was never in Austin or Dallas. Decades later, researchers will wonder if there was a “second Oswald” due to this ploy. They will also puzzle over conflicting reports about the “lone nut’s” library books being returned after he’s “left town,” a cashed unemployment check, and the bus schedule that makes these acts impossible. The Warren Commission never considers access to private planes. Sept. 25, 1963, Dave obtains Guatemalan visa #1236 from the Consulate general of Guatemala to use for flights to Guatemala, where Marcello had falsely claimed to have been born. In the upcoming trial, Bobby Kennedy’s team will try to prove the Guatemalan birth records for Carlos Marcello were faked. As we entered the latter part of September, I knew Lee was await-ing Ruth Paine’s arrival in New Orleans, so she could transport “How could he abandon Marina like that?” Actually, Lee made sure Marina was in good hands. Ruth Paine’s letter to Marina in July is mind-blowing: it shows she will pay Marina $10 a week (equal to $90 a week in today’s funds), with free room and board, and all hospital and medical bills! In return, Marina is to teach Ruth Russian.

Paine had been speaking and writing Russian for years by now, and while it sounds like a good hobby, Paine never told the world that she would pay Marina to perfect her language skills. Instead, she told the Warren Commission that Lee never offered her a dime, though his family lived with her, leaving the impression that Lee was an ungrateful creep who left his wife penniless at the Paine’s house.18 Fall of 1963: David Ferrie is busy on many fronts. He advertises himself as a psychologist, with an office on Perdido St, in addition to investigative work he is doing for Guy Banister. He has made multiple trips to Miami to defend himself in his doomed appeal to be reinstated as a pilot with Eastern Air Lines, and his assistance in the Carlos Marcello case is also taking up a lot of his time.19 David Ferrie was indeed getting involved in the Kennedy assassina-tion. Later, that possibility frightened his friends. When faced with attorneys, trials, reporters and Grand Juries, they often lied. Even under oath. Then they had to stick by their lies, even if interviewed years later. David Ferrie’s true story was in danger of being forever lost, or distorted by biographers who never met him. Here is a single example of how far some of David’s closest friends would go to protect themselves: After a page or two of trying to refuse to testify, Martens told the jury: “I don’t recall ever taking a trip to Houma or anywhere in the vicinity of Houma with David Ferrie…” But by page 16 of the transcript, having declared he could remember nothing, he finally admitted there was a trip, and :“ … the only person I could actually say I know was present was Ferrie.” That angered a juror. Why? Over and over, Martens had insisted he recalled no such trip. Having finally admitted the trip occurred, he couldn’t remember when it happened. He couldn’t remember why he came along, or where they went. He didn’t know what they stole. He couldn’t remember who was driving. Martens could not remember a single person by name or face, for pages and pages. He couldn’t remember that a dynamite cap exploded when it was thrown from the vehicle. Exasperated with Martens, the Jurist blurted out: Let me make a statement, Mr. Martens. You must think these men are stupid.

You know good and well you have to know all about it…. In 1967, Perry Russo, a young man who had an on-and-off relationship with David, said he was introduced in September 1963, to a “Leon Oswald.” Perry described his first meeting of “Leon” this way: “…upon entering the house … I walked up and Oswald is sitting down fooling with a rifle, cleaning it or doing something with it. And I …stuck out my hand to shake hands. He jumped up and lunged at me and said “What in the fuck is he doing here?” And I backed up and I said, “Fuck you” and with some other expletive and then Dave Ferrie jumped in between and told Oswald “he’s alright.” Leon’s reaction, as described, shows he knew Perry Russo. Layton Martens and I agree that this man was not “Leon Oswald” but James Lewallen, someone Perry hadn’t seen very often. Even Perry, years later, finally admitted it might have been Lewallen. Layton Martens himself didn’t mention seeing Lewallen much. In 1961, Perry Russo had tried to “rescue” young Al Landry during the scandal that cost David Ferrie his job. Dave was furious, but later forgave him. Lewallen is probably reacting to this bad memory, upon seeing Perry for the first time in several years. …Walter Sheridan [wanted Russo] to retract his allegations, along with an offer to move [him] to California, where he would be given a good job.

To his credit, Russo refused to retract or even substantially change his testimony, although he slightly wavered as to whether the discussion to kill JFK was a serious one or just a “bull session.” … Russo was still certain that both Shaw and Oswald were at the party (even though LHO was supposedly on his way to Mexico by then), and that Shaw and Ferrie knew each other both before and after the assassination … (supported by several other witnesses, including a couple whose son had taken flying lessons from Ferrie, who was seen in the company of Shaw at the airport.) Perry Russo also said (via Whitmey): “Banister seemed paranoid; never turned lights on and stayed inside most of the time up to his death in June, 1964.” Witness Anna Lewis said the same thing. Perry said he had seen Clay Shaw once at David’s gas station (Dave -Al’s). Perry felt David Ferrie had been murdered, “possibly with chemical Ferrie had devised that would make a person appear to have died from an aneurysm.” ing lady came in several times a week; had lots of “outlaw” friends over, including Ferrie – lots of parties; drank a lot of wine; didn’t care about school – describes in great detail his arrest for theft, which he indicated was actually the work of several young friends, who left a stolen key in his living room; eventually found not guilty … won a $3500 settlement against the local newspaper in 1983, after they called him a convicted burglar – stated that by 1969 he had been “threatened, bugged, ridiculed, slandered, libeled, etc. “My life, because of the publicity, was a shambles…I regret I ever got involved.” Excerpts from Perry Russo’s last interview: “David Ferrie was an adventuresome type of person. There wasn’t anything that he wasn’t ready to attempt to conquer or challenge that he wouldn’t take. But he was obsessed with the Latin type for himself, sexually and otherwise. … the Latin type was something he was very interested in.” “… Dave Ferrie was the center axis of a wheel and all the spokes moved from Dave Ferrie and none as you pointed out, none ever touched the other. He had a relationship with me….He had a relationship with the Cubans. He had a relationship with the others and they did not have interrelationships.

He was pacing back and forth and ranting and raving… on his coffee table, which sat in the middle of the room, always you could find one cup stuck on top of another cup full of cigarette butts. You’d find beer cans here and there. He was a bachelor. He had absolutely no sense of keeping things in order. And everything in his home … there were little cages with mice and rats and so on … he had doctorate degrees on the wall from universities.” “… [in] the Times-Picayune… you will see that all of the places that were raided no arrests were made. Because, what are you doing arresting people who are patriots storing munitions for no other reason than to blow a communist head off in Cuba? Why would you arrest somebody? You couldn’t do that. So all you did was confiscate the weapons.” “I distinctly remember a map of Cuba and …an old phonograph machine with a 78, I guess, record album on there of a speech by … probably Fidel … and the Cubans here were just absolutely incensed by everything said out loud on this record…. And then over the evening there was Ferrie parading around …”we cannot invade, we don’t have any guns, what are we going to use … bows and arrows? You know this is really the shits”…he’s back and forth, back and forth … upset. And then by contribution from everybody around it was … we got to assassinate Castro. That’s it! That’ll work! Assassinate Castro. That’ll work! OK.” Perry Russo described a scruffy-bearded, filthy-dirty “Leon” as David Ferrie’s “roommate.” But in September, Lee is seen most of the time at his residence at 4905 Magazine looking normal. If he had been wearing a beard, neighbors would have reported it. Eyewitness Victoria Hawes describes Lee as neatly dressed and shaved. James Lewallen was known to wear a beard and look scruffy. Furthermore, his nickname was “Leon.” This person could have passed as a “Lee look-alike.” Note that Perry Russo, who often seemed depressed, shot himself “accidentally” a year after author Ed Haslam interviewed him.23 Whitmey wrote, “After writing to Perry … I received what turned out to be his last reply in a letter dated August 17, 1994 (in an unidentified friend’s handwriting)….

No, it was very curious…. The thing started hurting and then bleeding, so he said, “Wait a minute.” And very quickly, he put me back under – I knew the whole time what was happening … then he said, “Heal the wound. Absolutely heal the wound.” That’s what he said. And then he said, “Wake up again.” And there was no wound, no blood, no hole, no nothing. It was very curious.” A: James Lewallen could possibly fit that description very well. I remember at that time Lewallen did have some sort of beard, and I wouldn’t necessarily call him unkempt, but to some people this might represent being unkempt. But one of the things I’ve noticed, remembering Lewallen, he bears a striking resemblance to this mock picture of Oswald [sketched by the NODA at Perry Russo’s direction]. After Marina was taken to Texas, Dave said Lee spent the night of Sept. 24 at Ochsner’s International House, in tactical meetings. because by the 26^(th) , Lee was unable to communicate. Later, I would learn more details in conversations with Lee. Dave was aware, however, of Lee’s general movements. He even told me, in his phone call on October 3^(rd) , after Rorke and Sullivan had vanished, “I wish I could function as an emergency pilot for you, but I don’t dare.” Dave would have loved our modern cell phone world. I never met a man more addicted to phone calls. If Dave were alive today, he would probably be texting to one person, talking on a cell phone to a second, and writing emails with his pinky while conversing with somebody sitting in front of him. And he could be doing it in German, Spanish, French or Italian, as well as in English, all at the same time. Dave was a master of communication.

Then we’d go visit the famous Chichen-Itza pyramid. It would be much taller than New Orleans’ famous Monkey Hill,26 Lee had joked. I told Lee I had purchased a revolver, since I didn’t want anybody to force me out of a plane over the Gulf, and we could use the weapon in an emergency in the wilderness. Lee laughed and said that “they” would have finished me off before now, if “they” thought I was any problem. Then, in a far more serious vein, Lee gave me the bad news. Alex Rorke and his pilot were missing. I could hear the stress in his voice. Lee said he had planned to meet Alex in Mexico City to discuss Cozumel as a meeting place, or the area near Chichen-Itza (There was a hard beach there, suitable to land a plane, and it was conveniently remote). In the meantime, I should be ready to go to Eglin AFB. Our hopes were still high, but the call was short. Lee said he did not have any more time to talk. “I love you, Juduffki,” he told me, as he so often did. Then he hung up. With Lee in Mexico City, the plot to frame him began in earnest. For example, an impostor posed as Lee, speaking poor Russian, by telephone. The CIA even sent out photos of a “fake” Oswald at the Cuban Consulate. After admitting their “mistake” they went on to claim their cameras were broken when Lee was there. False witnesses would say Lee talked to Russia’s Valeriy Kostikov – an assassin – when Lee visited the Russian Embassy, that Lee bragged about his shooting skills, that Lee took a bribe of $6500 to kill Kennedy. The impostors made sure Lee was in Mexico City so he could be framed. The CIA must have anticipated that Lee was willing to take some risks to fulfill his mission. They counted on his loyalty. As Lee made desperate attempts to get the bioweapon into Cuba personally, his zeal made him look like a pro-Castro fanatic. That would make him easy to frame in Dallas.

Oct. 3, 1963: In Dave’s seventh phone call, after he told me that Rorke and Sullivan were probably dead, he said additional precautions had to be taken to break any final links between me and my time in New Orleans.28 It was imperative for me to order another birth certificate immediately, even if it still said “Female Infant Vary” and was useless as ID. My fourth phone number for the Call Wheel had finally come into play that Monday. It pinpointed my position at the exterior emergency phone at Peninsular ChemResearch. This prestigious research laboratory supplied exotic new concoctions to private labs, NIH, and many other government labs, including NASA.29 When I asked why I had to order another “Female Infant Vary” certificate, Dave explained. “That certificate was sent to New Orleans, and records in Indiana will show this as your last known address. We can’t have that. Order a replacement. Now.” I already had a birth certificate dated April 26, 1963 in my possession, sent to me when I lived in New Orleans. Now I had to order it again, with no time to correct the “Female Infant Vary” designation that made it useless as ID. However, the ‘last known address’ in the system would then show Gainesville, Florida, disconnecting me from New Orleans at this crucial time. Lee’s involvement in the bioweapon project was now over, as was mine. Cuba was no longer a target, or a priority. All that remained for Lee was his nagging belief that he had learned enough about Kennedy’s planned assassination that he might be able to do something about it. As he obeyed the directives of the CIA in the days ahead, he stayed in Dallas because he hoped he might be able to learn more about the band of right-wing nuts – military and civilian, and the politicos and rogue elements who wanted to kill Kennedy. But what could one man do? Dave and I knew that his stubborn commitment to duty could mean Lee’s death. Wed. Oct.16, 1963: Lee Oswald, with Ruth Paine’s assistance, gets a job at the Texas School Book Depository, two days before his 24^(th) birthday. Lee lives in rented rooms the rest of his life, visiting his wife and child (and soon, a new baby) on weekends. Marina remains with Ruth Paine. I am now working at Peninsular ChemResearch.

By now, Lee had moved into a safe house and had no plans to live with Marina again, though he would visit her and Junie most weekends. Lee gave me several phone numbers where he could be reached in an emergency. When Lee gets the Cuban transit visa in the mail – it comes surprisingly quickly – he ignores it. The Project is over. The transit visa is useless to us now. The TSBD had been recently purchased by Harold Byrd, a Texas oilman close to his oil baron pals and Lyndon Johnson. Lee said it was another temporary cover job. Lee had been promised he’d be able to return to Mexico “by Christmas” so the job’s low pay meant little. Mr. Roy Truly, his boss, had been told Lee was working undercover for the FBI. “I have the same kind of job freedom that I had at Reily,” Lee told me. “But even better, because there’s no time clock.” Lee was often elsewhere, doing assignments in Dallas. His work hours were filled out by a secretary (that sounded familiar!). It didn’t matter how many hours Lee actually worked there. Confirmation of this arrangement exists in Lee’s last filled-out workday. It is for Friday, Nov. 22, the day Kennedy was shot and Lee was arrested. Lee left the TSBD by 12:45 pm at the latest, but his worksheet said he was “present” all day long. I and Ruth gave him a little birthday cake. “I won’t live to see another birthday cake,” he told me, “unless I can get out of here. If I don’t do it right, we’ll all get killed.” Lee said that upon his return to Dallas, he had been invited even closer into the assassination ring that was planning to take out JFK. In a later call, Lee said he wasn’t good enough to be a shooter, but he’d been invited to be one, so he knew it was almost certainly a trap. “So,” I said sadly, “you’re going to go through with it?” I started to cry, feeling both hopeless and helpless. Dave and Dr. Mary had been the key to Lee’s learning about the assassination ring. Dave had given him names and all the information he’d collected from the wary and paranoid Guy Banister. Dave had already told me that pretending to hate JFK had eventually brought him into a ring that was dropping names, here and there.

He had evidence of their plans, he said that he would pass on to Lee, since the focus had shifted from New Orleans to the kill zones of the big cities that Kennedy was slated to visit that fall. I had needed all kinds of reassurances from Dave that he could be trusted. When I had felt the lumps on his neck, which he worried about, I said, jokingly, they weren’t cancer, they were just cloggedup hair follicles. “My neck gets so stiff,” he complained. “And I’ve had headaches ever since we lost pressure in a plane once. I think I ruptured something in my head. Or maybe I have a brain tumor. One of my school chums died from encephalitis. I have the same symptoms, sometimes.” “Stop it, Dave!” I told him. “Self-diagnosis is your worst enemy. Most of your headaches come from not drinking enough water and drinking too much coffee. When you don’t have coffee, you get a headache because your brain is used to all that caffeine. Just drink more water and tone down on the coffee.” I didn’t drink much coffee, so it was easy to criticize Dave, who was so hyperactive. He obviously had a high thyroid level. Today, with more knowledge, I suspect he was also taking too much Proloid – a combo of thyroid hormones – to keep feeling energetic, and this was giving him the symptoms that concerned him. Another worrying idea was that we’d worked with a cancer virus that was known to produce symptoms of encephalitis. I prayed Dave had never read the small print in any of my reports on such things. From Banister, Dave wheedled out the names of wealthy, racist Texas oilmen closely associated with Ochsner and Lyndon Johnson. Dr. Mary was just as concerned, and also helped. Together, they could make good guesses on which plots might be serious. These nests of adders were located in Chicago, Miami, Houston, and Dallas. Using the CIA, the military, the Secret Service (SS protects the Treasury – think “bankers”) the Mafia and anti-Castro agents, a webwork of plans to commit the ultimate treason was under construction, which JFK wouldn’t be able to escape. Lee was in Dallas, the most dangerous city of all.

They might even be able to blame it on Castro, thrusting America into war against Cuba, thus killing two birds with one big stone. Dave, Dr. Mary, Lee and I all believed that an invasion of Cuba could trigger World War III, if Russia moved in to defend her. With so much at stake, there was now no way to persuade Lee to save himself. In fact, he would have thought it immoral of me to try. Lee believed that saving Kennedy was worth everything he had to offer. Joseph Milteer: Some four weeks before the Kennedy assassination, Milteer, who was taped in Miami predicting the Kennedy assassination, had made two deposits after opening an account in a Utah bank for #115376: one for $5000 (Aug 20) and one for $2000 (Sept. 24.) All $7, 000 was removed Jan. 31, 1964 (52 days after the assassination) Various sources describe Lee as being present here. They are correct. Lee was holding a protest sign and was marching outside the building. He was there to assess the mood of the right-wingers and to gather information. He participated in the outburst against Stevenson as well, both to present himself as an apparent “right-winger” and also to help convince JFK’s Secret Service to enhance security for the President. But the Secret Service was already corrupted beyond repair. dered whether the President should go to Dallas, and so do I.” JFK’s staff encourages him to go to Dallas anyway. A month later in November, when JFK is slated to ride through Dallas streets in an open car, the Secret Service will decline the FBI’s reported offer of assistance to help augment their staff for the impending Presidential visit. Lyndon Johnson is in political trouble: a headline story in the Dallas Morning News reads: “Nixon Predicts Kennedy May Drop Johnson.”32 2. On p. 42 of the House Select Committee on Assassinations Investigation of the Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Volume 1, p. 42, we learn that “Dr. Davis received his M.D. degree from Long Island College of Medicine in 1949 and completed his residency in pathology at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital in New Orleans.” Dr. Davis retained his connections with the USPHS Hospital in New Orleans for years. 3.

Dr. Davis, in his lecture “Origins of the Medical Examiner System” stated how Miami’s Medical Examiner’s Lab was established by recruiting New Orleans pathologist Dr. Stanley Durlacher, Dr. Davis’ patron, upon the recommendation of New Orleans’ Coroner, Dr. Nicholas Chetta: “… in 1955…. The Search Committee … picked Dr. Stanley Durlacher … Associate Professor … at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine. He had a long illustrious career…. He had been picked by Dr. Chetta, who was elected Coroner in New Orleans way back when, to … set up a coroner’s laboratory in New Orleans. And Art Fisk, who was his sort of right hand man…. He and Stan actually physically built the office … built it in the basement of the Courthouse in New Orleans…. One of the things that happened at Tulane Medical School and at LSU, is the young pathologists, the junior members of the department, do autopsies for the coroner. They did not have a full time coroner staff; it was done by the medical school staff at fifty dollars a head, I think it was, at the time. And you were paid just as if you had been supplying potatoes to the parish, but I found it extremely fascinating. For the first time, I was able to see disease processes, the pathology of the disease, fresh, untreated. And then I began to see other things that I had never been taught in medical school, that was injury, and then, effects of drugs and alcohol, things you just completely ignored in medical teaching.” [Re the new Medical Examiner’s lab in Miami, Davis simply said, “Well, Durlacher brought me with him.”] 5. To illustrate Dr. Davis’ willingness to mentor anyone who requested knowledge, as did David Ferrie, this entry in Dr. Davis’ Dignity Memorial Guestbook should suffice: “March 26, 2013. When I was a lawyer handling medical malpractice cases in Miami, I called Dr. Davis to ask if I could observe autopsies at the ME’s office. I thought it would be a good way to learn something about anatomy. Dr. Davis did not hesitate: ‘This is a public office and you are a member of the public.’ So I went, several times. It was a very useful experience. I am grateful to Dr. Davis and to the other doctors who took the time to explain things to me and to answer my questions. Dr. Davis was a great public servant.” Bart Greene,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:195:63571d05ed8e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5545, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 196, "text": "at the ME’s office.

The important document following shows I withdrew from these 7 hours of night classes the ‘Winter Semester’ of 1963. After Lee was shot, I was incapable of taking any final examinations and went to campus doctors, who agreed that I was ill and authorized me to receive $\\ \" \\mathrm { H } ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ grades (unable to attend due to health). By petition, I was able to get the grade point penalties removed. This is one of the documents proving how distressed I was after the assassination. Because I also have my checks for Peninsular ChemResearch issued at the same time, proving I worked fulltime, the fact that these were night classes is thus established, and that establishes my pre-cognition that I would be hired fulltime by PenChem, though that didn’t happen until mid-October. I was hired at Peninsular ChemResearch on Monday, October 14 as a research assistant. I began work on October 16 and worked that Saturday and Sunday as well, to get my paycheck ‘in synch’ – easy to do because PenChem closed only on Christmas and the 4th of July. On Nov. 22, I wept in front of people who cheered JFK’s murder. A week later, on Nov. 29th, a meeting was held and I received 30 days’ notice. On the 31st of December, I was terminated. I had worked overtime every week: some of the work was possibly for The Project in New Orleans, since I shipped glycol-based products I was asked to create to Mound Park Hospital, FL, which then were shipped on to New Orleans. I worked 88 – 100+ hrs/every 80-hr.pay period. Only one job was routine: I arrived, alone, an hour early every morning to unlock the gates to the facility, then replenished liquid oxygen and nitrogen supplies needed for the day, which took half an hour.

I told Robert that my friend Don Federman was now an editor of The New Orange Peel (UF’s witty student magazine) and that he’d pay me to do some illustrations for the magazine (true). So Robert brought me along, and I stopped by the Craft Shop and picked up the phone number I could use to call Dave or Lee for free and with privacy. This got the Call Wheel started. I registered for classes after I knew I could be re-hired at the Craft Shop so Robert wouldn’t have a hissy-fit about my spending money on college. Having “found” $400 , and having earned $150 for art work Robert and I did together for his parents (ads for their new complex Hurlbert Arms near Eglin AFB). he could not forbid me to register. 12. For full details of Lee’s trip to Mexico City, and how he arrived by circuitous means,, see Me & Lee. In 2000, Gerry Hemming at one point tried to tell me that Lee had been flown into Mexico by Alex Rorke – a story he told others on 11 Feb., 2005: “Hoover’s next big shot at revenge came during September 1964, upon demand by two members of the Warren Commission that: The Silvia Odio/Oswald visit issue be resolved or they wouldn’t “sign-off”!! …These two Castro double-agents were Manolo Aguilar and Enrique Molina Rivera. Molina Rivera later “disappeared?” while flying with Rorke and Sullivan during September ‘63 – after picking up Oswald and flying him from New Orleans to Merida, Mexico for further infiltration inside Cuba.” (Viz: http:// educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic173 ) Gerry knew Lee had been flown out of New Orleans, and he knew that two Latinos were with him on some legs of the trip, but he erroneously assumed Lee was flown into Merida – exactly where Lee was planning for us to go after he finished his Mexico City assignment – we’d be seeing Chichen-Itza, if we didn’t have to flee to the Cayman islands – then head to Merida. Perhaps Gerry had obtained information about our plans to go to Merida. After reading what he’d written to The Education Forum, I confronted him with the full details, since by then I had the full information of when Alex and Geoffrey were shot down.

Many accounts show the event a week earlier than it actually occurred. It was in error, and I was then able to proceed with my argument from 2000. Gerry had to agree that he might have been giving out false information. He defended himself by cursing Weberman, who he said misquoted him “all the time.” Regarding his 2005 statements, he then wrote, a few days later: “…my greatest focus is on the 40 years of misquotes, lies, libel and slander – aimed specifically at “The No Name Key Bunch”; as the perpetrators or support element in the assassinations of JFK, RFK, and MLK, Jr. (and they might throw in “Cock Robin” and Judge Crater also) – and the stupid bastards just can’t grasp that this was engineered by faggot J. Edgar Hoover in retaliation for getting the goods on his ass and delivering same to RFK. His final queer stroke was to cover his ass on the Sylvia Odio meeting with Oswald in Dallas, Sept. 1963.” He then added his feelings about A. J. Weberman: “Most of the InterPen guys aren’t even aware (nor interested) in this JFK fantasy crap – and those who are don’t really give a shit. However, some have been called out of retirement and are currently serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, etc. – and others non-military are working (even in their late 60s) for government agencies – including “Homeland Defense”. They sure as hell don’t need snitches like Weberman, et al. bandying their names about on the Internet at this stage in their careers.” Hemming also wrote to the Forum that Weberman offered him a lot of money to make a full confession before he died. Sadly, Hemming died Jan. 8, 2008. We had become good friends, and I have tried to maintain contact with his children. 13. Researcher A. J. Weberman wrote, in his Nodule section on Veciana, “After the assassination, there was absolutely no doubt in Antonio Veciana’s mind that the man he had seen was OSWALD. Marina Oswald told this researcher: “According to my file, Veciana said this meeting was in the first week of September. We were in New Orleans. Who was that man? Was it LEE OSWALD then? If there was a meeting in Dallas and we were in New Orleans, how is that possible unless he had a plane to fly back and forth?” (Viz: http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/belligerence/veciana-oswald.htm, retrieved May 1, 2013).

But Lee did have a plane “to fly back and forth.” Not only did he tell me so, but on September 10, according to phone records reported by researcher Peter Whitmey, to which I did not have access when I wrote Me & Lee, we learn that David Ferrie almost certainly called from Ft. Worth, Texas on Sunday, September 10, the same day he called me. 18. The world has been told, for over fifty years, that Lee Oswald was ungrateful to Ruth Paine for all her help, never giving her a penny. Ruth Paine is presented as sensitive, considerate and generous. Lee Oswald is presented as ungrateful, miserly and manipulative. When the Warren Commission asked Ruth if Lee ever helped out financially for all she had done, Paine just says he never gave her a penny, making Lee look like an ungrateful jerk. However, knowing Lee’s true character, I decided to read Paine’s letters and found, in Vol. XVI of the Warren Commission’s 26 volumes, that Paine offered to pay Marina $10 a week, plus free room and board, and all her medical and hospital bills, in exchange for Marina teaching her Russian. Lee Oswald has been slammed for FIFTY years as an ungrateful wretch who took advantage of Ruth’s kindness and hospitality, without offering any financial help. It is perhaps all the more touching, then, that Lee left Marina $170 total in cash for her (equal to about $1600 in today’s funds) on the morning he knew he might be going to his death, Nov. 22, 1963, in his attempt to save JFK. I urge everyone to read the evidence in James Douglass’ JFK and the Unspeakable and in Me & Lee, to get the full truth about Lee. 21. Researcher Stephen Roy (David Blackburst) refused to identify any of the witnesses he says he has recorded, saying they fear their reputations could be ruined, even though they are elderly men now and could die at any time (or may already be dead).

In contrast, researcher Vincent Palamara interviewed, photographed and recorded witness statements of members of the Secret Service involved with The Kennedy Detail.

Email, March 2014,from Edward T Haslam: “I talked to Perry in New Orleans in the Spring of 1993, ²⁺ years before I published Mary …He picked me up from the airport in his cab. He was overweight, but not overtly sick or wounded. He was curious about the cancer lab, and wondered how it could have been done without his seeing it … a point that I think you explained clearly in Me and Lee, a book which I wish he could have read before passing…ETH.” 27. This quote from Summers (an email quote from Nov. 2013) reveals how Summers made a turnabout and has gone on to endorse the unreliable researcher Patricia Lambert’s account of the Clinton and Jackson witnesses (for example, never having interviewed me and changing Anne Dischler’s testimony). He actually threw out the entire Clinton-Jackson scenario, for which I have castigated him, with no response, by email. Summers also fell from grace by deciding that Lee Oswald shot Officer Tippit after all. This was another shock, for he based his conclusion on Dale Myers’ outdated book With Malice that argues Lee Oswald killed Officer J. D. Tippit, despite convincing evidence supplied by Texas Theater Manager Butch Burroughs that he sold Lee Oswald popcorn in the Texas Theater at the time Tippit was shot (and much more). Jim DiEugenio’s review of Summer’s updated book is spot-on. 28. It was later determined that the same day Lee left 4905 Magazine, Alex Rorke and Geoffrey Sullivan were shot down over Cuba while on a mission. We now know they took off from Cozumel, and some speculated they had plans to land in Florida. But their plane was shot down. They would never meet me at Eglin Air Force base on the 26th. 29. A.

Ross and Ol- ive Streets intersection, and San Jacinto and Harwood Streets intersection, are in the downtown area where numerous office buildings, parking lots and other businesses are located.” The notation that there were ‘marks’ at an intersection, where only one mark would be needed if it was a business, suggest that Lee may have placed marks for the four telephone numbers I’d given him at the locations he used to call me. He would have to keep track. There was also a mark at Houston and Elm – for the location of the TSBD – but in fact, I had been given that number for emergency calls.

(Why would he have to, since Paine had offered to pay Marina $10 a week (equal to $90 a week in today’s funds), to teach her Russian, plus free room, board and medical and dental bills paid?) Nov. 11, 1963: In his FAA application form for a commercial pilot’s license, David says he has use of a Cessna 206. (Stephen Roy says this plane is “…probably owned by his longtime friend Lewis ‘Buster’ Abadie.”) David now resumes flying commercially, this time for businesses affiliated with the Marcello crime family, such as the Marinos, and with Marcello’s brothers, Joe, Sammy, etc. David Ferrie is now a Mafia pilot.

It reportedly stated: “If you have anything you want to learn about me, come talk to me directly. If you don’t cease bothering my wife, I will take appropriate action and report this to the proper authorities.” … Hosty’s name and number were discovered in Oswald’s address book. Looking to assuage Hoover’s fears that Oswald might have been an FBI informant, Hosty’s supervisor, Gordon Shanklin, ordered Hosty to destroy the note. Hosty was temporarily suspended from duty when the truth came out during congressional hearings about his having misled the Warren Commission. So, was the note to Hosty supposedly destroyed “to assuage Hoover’s fears that Oswald might have been an FBI informant”? Then it couldn’t have been about leaving Lee’s wife alone, could it? If the note had said only what Hosty claims, there would have been no reason to destroy it. But what if the note said something like: “My wife knows nothing. Leave her alone. You need to meet me, because I have information of vital importance regarding the safety of a very important person.” Such a message, having been ignored, would have had to be destroyed. Such a message could have come from an FBI informant. Such a message might have been about saving Kennedy. Ten days earlier, on Nov. 2, a person named “Lee” had successfully contacted the FBI in Chicago, saving Kennedy’s life. Lee may oan Mellen tells us David Ferrie began to carry around a manila file, Jwhich he nicknamed “the Bomb.” It would “blow this city apart if he ever released it,”(this is after the assassination). She describes Jimmy Johnson, the young man who spied on Dave for Garrison, and who found Dave dead on Feb. 22, 1967, as saying he found “a loose-leaf paper with a diagram on it” in a notebook marked “Files, 1963.” Antiques dealer Clara “Bootsie” Gay also saw the diagram, which Wray Gill’s secretary was then intent on destroying. It was of a car, as seen from a great distance above, in what appeared to be the layout of Dealey Plaza. An image of a plane suggested that shots could come from the plane to shoot JFK. There were many photos and other diagrams as well.

Handwriting on such diagrams could identify the plotters. David Ferrie often used the coffee shop at the Lakefront Airport as an “office” to recruit students interested in flying lessons. Around 1961, the whole building was fitted with thick sheets of concrete, covering the original Art Deco façade. It was deliberately done to make the building as strong as a bomb shelter. When Dave told me that he kept his “important stuff” in a “bomb shelter” he probably meant Lakefront He said he had key information about the Kennedy assassination safely tucked away in “the bomb shelter.” I didn’t know where any bomb shelter was located in New Orleans until I heard about Lakefront. Nov. 17, 1963: 20-year-old Layton Martens moves into David’s apartment after being kicked out of his mother’s house. On Nov. 25 he tells FBI that “3330 Louisiana Avenue” (sic) is his address. He says he has known David five years, and Alvin Beauboeuf about one year. (FBI File # NO 89-69, SA Ronald A. Hoverson) The whereabouts of Lee Harvey Oswald on this weekend remain unknown” according to outsiders, but Lee told me he was meeting with members of the assassination ring. Coincidentally, James Files says he was with Lee Oswald this weekend. I know Lee sent a TELEX at this time, in an attempt to save Kennedy’s life (and at risk of his own) to the FBI. “End and ack pls”: (“End and act, pls”) “Assisinate” “sictythree” and “immidiately” reflect the poor spelling of our very own Lee Oswald, who was dyslexic. He obviously had to type in haste, with no time to look up the correct spelling. The Telex had been destroyed but was reconstructed by New Orleans FBI Special Agent William Walter, the security clerk on duty that night. Researchers tend to think the Telex, purportedly sent from DC, went everywhere, but it may have been sent to only a few cities – the ones where Kennedy had been or would soon visit. It would not take that much time for Hoover to remove such files from so few locations. Cities such as Chicago, Dallas, Austin, Fort Worth, New Orleans, and Miami would have received the Telex. The designation “All SAGS” might have simply meant to all SAGS at each location.

The Telex numbers for the various FBI offices in the country were posted, by the way, in Banister’s office, right next to his own Telex machine. Lee would have memorized the most important numbers. What has to be understood is that Lee arly afternoon: I call the TSBD person-to-person, asking for “the Enew janitor” Lee Oswald (the word “Harvey” is penciled into the name in the call record later, by the FBI. “J.A.” are the first two letters in “janitor”– the initials for “Judyth Anne” – just as in the Times-Picayune message back in April. When I ask for the “new janitor” Lee knows who is placing the person-to-person call. Lee is not a janitor at the TSBD. He is a clerk in the shipping department. The time at which I placed the call told Lee when to call me back, and at what phone number, due to the Call Wheel. No actual message was exchanged because the person-to-person call (as planned) was rejected. The call appeared to have come from Covington. FBI: Mrs. COOPER stated that this call was placed by an adult female who was very polite, had no speech impediment, no accent, and who appeared to be familiar with the proceedings in placing long distance calls … the answering party in Dallas, who was a female, was asked by her for LEE HARVEY [sic] OSWALD. The answering party advised she did not know who Oswald was. At this point, according to Mrs. COOPER, the calling party advised that OSWALD was a new employee. Mrs. Cooper thinks the calling party said that OSWALD was the janitor. Mrs. Cooper stated at this point the answering party said “oh” as if she knew who it was, and the call was completed.2 When Lee rejected this person-to-person call to the TSBD, I knew he had received it and that he would call back a certain number of hours later, according to the Call Wheel. At 11 : 00 pM , Dallas time, only 37 % hours before Kennedy was shot, Lee called and apologized for not calling me back on Sunday, saying he did not have the privacy he needed to talk to me. For the next hour and a half, we talked our hearts out. It was the most ominous call I’ve ever experienced. But Lee said he was no longer alone. He said an abort team had formed, and would come in to help him.

He said an abort team had formed, and would come in to help him. Lee told around 6 : 00 PM a meeting was held at 3525 Turtle Creek, in Dallas, on November 20. Lee pretended to feed ducks at using binoculars to get the license plates of cars driving into the gated area of this posh, luxury apartment building. Later, he obtained information from the black doorman. By late that evening, Lee had been able to learn that the plan to “go ahead” with the assassination was complete. A “trophy film” was going to be made of JFK’s death, “with his eyes open, and they were going to pass the film around.” If the party at the Murchison’s home the next night occurred (which was possible), that meeting apprised those attending of the certainty of Friday’s plans.” William A. Blakey served two incomplete terms in the U.S. Senate from Texas (1957, 1961) and was succeeded in 1961 by another 3525 Turtle Creek resident, John Tower, first Republican U.S. Senator from Texas (1961-85)… Earle Cabell, mayor of Dallas (1961-64) and U.S. Congressman from Texas (1965-73) lived in the building.” Decades later, former Secret Service agent Abraham Bolden will reveal to author James Douglass and others that someone named “Lee” called the FBI in Chicago, which led to Kennedy calling off his trip there, resulting in the arrest of armed men. Bolden was present when the FBI called his Secret Service office and told the agents there the news by telephone. Lee had been sending warnings and even threats to get more protection for Kennedy. He was even playing the role of a willing assassin to avoid suspicion. His plans are to stay close to where he is told to be, until it is too late to replace him with somebody else. His words to that effect: “If I stay, that will be one less bullet aimed at Kennedy.”3 William “Tosh” Plumlee (CIA contract pilot, who knew Lee Oswald by sight) verifies existence of an abort team:4 “…the CIA was our support people. We were military intelligence…[John] Roselli was on board the aircraft…. Our objective … to try to stop crosstriangulation gunfire on an ambush. We had people that filtrated out into the Plaza and the object there was …do anything you can to eliminate the actual assassination….”5 Lee then said there were two other names he needed me to remember: Bobby Baker and Billy Sol Estes.

My thoughts seemed to be racing every direction at once, as I frantically sought a solution. “Is there any way you could get out of this? Something you haven’t thought of?” Much of the information in the timeline below for those fateful days (unless otherwise noted) is from the Ira Woods’ chronology in The Assassination Research Journal (ARJ).8 While focused primarily on assumed and speculated actions of David Ferrie, this timeline also highlights some events in Dallas and elsewhere. 11:05 am, November 21, 1963: Air Force One leaves Andrews Air Force Base.. Aboard Air Force One today, JFK speaks to Congressman Henry Gonzalez. He is responding to Gonzalez’s fears about Dallas. JFK says: “Henry, the Secret Service told me they had taken care of everything, there’s nothing to worry about.” 6:25 pm, November 21, 1963: Lee’s last night with his family is misrepresented: The respected ARJ chronology says “Lee Harvey Oswald and Marina quarrel. Four times tonight, LHO asks Marina to move with him to a nicer apartment in Dallas. Each time, she refuses.” This gives a sinister sheen to Lee’s last night with Marina. After all, they quarreled four times! But did it happen? Here’s Marina Oswald’s Warren Commission testimony: Dallas. He said that he was tired of living alone and perhaps the reason for my being so angry was the fact that we were not living together. That if I want to he would rent an apartment in Dallas tomorrow – that he didn’t want me to remain with Ruth any longer, but wanted me to live with him in Dallas. He repeated this not once but several times, but I refused. And he said that once again I was preferring my friends to him, and that I didn’t need him. Lee told Marina that he would rent an apartment, if Marina would come to live with him, well knowing Marina would reject the idea. He even offered to get a new washing machine, but Marina turned it down. She was happy where she was. I see this as Lee making sure Marina would be okay, knowing that tomorrow, he likely could do no more for her. The next morning he would leave $170 and his wedding ring behind. There were no real quarrels.

Greg Burnham (author/researcher): Perhaps the most powerful evidence indicating that select Senior Administration Officials and Senior Military personnel may have had foreknowledge of the plot to assassinate … Kennedy, is found in the DRAFT of … NSAM Number 273. There are several smoking guns, but the one that initially stands out as the most obvious is the date of the DRAFT … signed by McGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant to the President for National Security. The DRAFT was written and dated November 21st, 1963 less than 24 hours before the assassination. It was ostensibly the result of the meetings that took place the previous day at the Honolulu Conference. The first sentence is indeed quite revelatory of its dubious nature: “The President has reviewed the discussions of South Vietnam which occurred in Honolulu, and has discussed the matter further with Ambassador Lodge.” That is false.”9 Late evening, Fort Worth, November 21: After Johnson enters JFK’s Texas Hotel suite, “an argument erupts between the two men that can be heard by the hotel staff outside in the hallway. Reportedly, they fight about Johnson’s demand to change the seating position in the cars for the next morning’s motorcade in Dallas. Johnson wants Governor Connally to ride with him and wants Senator Yarborough, his bitter political enemy, to ride in the Presidential Limousine with JFK. The President flatly refuses and Johnson leaves the suite ‘like a pistol.’ Private Eugene B. Dinkin, Richard Case Nagell, Gilberto Alvarado Ugarte, Joseph Milteer, Rose Cherami and Abraham Bolden have all made public statements concerning the imminent assassination of JFK. Of these people, Dinkin, Cherami, Nagell, and Ugarte are threatened with being declared to be mentally unstable. Secret Service Agent Bolden will be sent to prison [part of that time, he will be drugged in a mental hospital] on a charge of discussing a bribe with two counterfeiters. He will be subsequently released and claim that he had been framed by the Secret Service and convicted in order to silence him regarding the Kennedy threat. Later in the evening: Jack Ruby reportedly dines at the Egyptian Lounge with his old friend and financial backer Ralph Paul. The Lounge is run by Joseph and Sam Campisi. Joseph acknowledges being very close to Carlos Marcello – each Christmas he sends Marcello and his associates 260 pounds of Italian sausage. He also makes as many as twenty telephone calls a day to New Orleans. 2.

William Robert “Tosh” Plumlee has suffered, as I have, at the hands of the “moderated” Education Forum. Tosh wrote this to the Deep Politics Forum Sept. 2008: (RE: two apartments used by Lee in Dallas, just as he used two apartments in New Orleans; minor edits) “Ask Jim Marrs and Peter Lemkin … I took Jim Marrs to both of these apts, Beckley and Elsbeth, also [took] Nigel Turner and Oliver Stone’s people….

For full details, see: http://jfklancer.com/NSAM273.html (Retrieved 03/03/2014). t 9:00 am Carlos Marcello’s trial begins in New Orleans.Witnesses say David Ferrie is in court during Marcello’s tri-1 when President Kennedy’s death is announced. George Lardner, who spoke to David by phone, (see Feb. 22, 1967 timeline) said David was sitting outside the courtroom conversing with sheriff deputies when it was announced that Kennedy was shot. A one-hour recess was then announced. 9:15 am, Dallas: Ruth Paine says she takes her small daughter, Lynn, to the dentist and then runs errands. A car resembling Paine’s will be seen minutes after Kennedy is shot, speeding away with Lee Oswald or a lookalike. Paine has left the television set on for Marina Oswald – who says she watches it all morning without getting dressed. 11:55 am: The Kennedy motorcade leaves Love Field. The motorcade will be running late through Dallas. As the motorcade begins, film footage from ABC television’s Dallas/Fort Worth affiliate WFAA shows SS agent Henry J. Rybka being recalled by shift leader (and commander of the follow-up car detail) Emory P. Roberts. As the limo begins leaving the area, Rybka’s frustration – he is supposed to be riding on the back of JFK’s car – is made clear as he throws his arms up several times before, during, and after the follow-up car passes him by. The motorcade is composed of dark cars, except Vice President Johnson’s car (light blue) and LBJ’s secret service agents (they ride in a white car behind him). (ARJ) [In 2014, Rybka will deny, saying that his gestures only meant, “OK, I will guard the plane and go eat lunch.” But his gestures were repeated – obviously a show of confusion and exasperation.] 12:30 pm: JFK’s limo passes a group of sheriff ’s deputies at Main and Houston, in front of the Sheriff’s Office.

Of the twenty Dallas Police deputies who will give statements “sixteen thought the assassin had fired from the area of the grassy knoll…” (ARJ) Lyndon Johnson is listening to a small walkie-talkie held over the back seat. The device is turned low. (This description comes from Sen. Ralph Yarborough who is riding with Johnson.)(ARJ) cer experiments were held, tells hospital staff Kennedy will now die. “[She] is watching television with several nurses when a spot report about JFK’s motorcade comes on. Cherami says “This is when it is going to happen!” The nurses dismiss her remarks because Cherami is suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms – until moments later, when JFK is shot. Cherami has also told one of the hospital interns “…that one of the men involved in the plot was a man named Jack Rubenstein.” (Probe magazine, Vol. 6, No. 5) 12:31 pm: Shooting begins. In seven seconds, it is over. It will take SS agent Clint Hill (Jackie’s guard, who had no business riding on a different car to begin with) twelve seconds to reach JFK’s limo. It takes three seconds for LBJ’s Secret Service agent to cover the Vice President with his own body, because he is in the car with LBJ. Roy Kellerman, the SS agent “protecting” JFK in the front seat of JFK’s limo, never moves to cover JFK. Many witnesses say Secret Service agent William Greer, the driver, puts on the brakes, perhaps fearing an ambush. (David Ferrie will later make a study of the bullets’ trajectories.) Photographer/photo retouching specialist Ike Altgens captures the JFK hit on film within two seconds of the impact of a bullet that strikes JFK’s head. In the photo, a figure is visible in the background that many people think strongly resembles Lee Harvey Oswald, standing in the front entrance of the Texas School Book Depository building. If it is, in fact, Oswald, he could not have been on the sixth The famous “Altgens photo.” As first shot is heard, Secret Service agents do not look up at the 6th floor.

Motorcycle police are protecting the Secret Service car, not JFK’s. James T. Tague, standing near the concrete abutment of the triple underpass, about 260 feet downhill from the President’s position, is hit on his cheek by a piece of concrete blown off the street curb when it is hit by one of the bullets fired at the President, forcing the creation of the [patently absurd] “single bullet theory” because one rifle could not have made four shots in the time frame observed.(ARJ) James Tague: J. Edgar Hoover didn’t want me to exist. I was the only proof that there were more shots fired. They said I didn’t see anything that would shed any light on the assassination. I was just one man slightly injured. I was ignored. (Tague, to the author, Nov. 22, 2103. Tague died Feb. 28, 2014) Agent John D. Ready jumps off Secret Service follow-up car to dash to JFK limo. He is recalled by special Agent-in-Charge Emory Roberts. Roberts also orders all other agents not to move. Secret Service expert Vincent Palamara, in Survivors Guilt, shows that JFK did not order Secret Service agents off his car, and that indeed, he had no authority to do so. But during the 50th anniversary hoopla in 2013, the “Kennedy Detail” told the world in a television special that JFK was the cause of his own death by ordering them off the car. The Grassy Knoll: Dozens of witnesses who said they heard a shot come from the Grassy Knoll are never officially interviewed. As the final shot occurs, Kenneth O’Donnell (in the Secret Service car behind JFK) begins to bless himself. Dave Powers murmurs: “Jesus, Mary, and Joseph …” Powers will later say that he and O’Donnell clearly heard shots come from the grassy knoll. Powers says he felt they were “riding into an ambush,” explaining why William Greer begins to slow the limo. Secret Service agent Kellerman (JFK limo, front seat): Let me give you an illustration….

Victoria and Sandra descended the stairs in the TSBD building at the same time authorities said Lee Oswald had to have done the same. In the book by Barry Ernest, The Girl on the Stairs, Adams, who says she was threatened into silence, makes it clear she neither saw nor heard Lee Oswald on the stairs (Victoria died of cancer soon after speaking out). Lee could not have been on the 6th floor at the time claimed because he was seen no more than 90 seconds after the first shot was fired, on the second floor, by officer Marion Baker and TSBD boss Roy Truly. “stuck” open for at least four minutes total). But first there is an electronic beeping – the Morse code signal for “Victory.” (2) As Officer Marion Baker and Roy Truly leave the lunchroom and run from the 2nd floor to the 5th floor, the electricity and telephone service in the TSBD is suddenly restored. The west elevator moves from the 5th floor to the 1st. (3) The telephone system in Washington, D.C. is interrupted and, in some areas, goes dead and remains out of service for an hour. (4) Aboard Air Force One, Col. James B. Swindal overhears Roy Kellerman on the Secret Service radio channel speaking from JFK’s limo: “Lancer is hurt. It looks bad. We have to get to a hospital.” Moments later, Secret Service communications gear on Air Force One goes dead. Swindal receives the news that JFK is dead by tuning in to network television aboard the aircraft. ~12:45 pm: Eugene Hale Brading (calling himself Jim Braden) is arrested leaving the Dal-Tex building. He is an ex-con with reputed underworld ties and thirty-five arrests. He spent the previous night at the Cabana Hotel, owned by Joe Campisi, one of Marcello’s men (Jack Ruby visited there at midnight). During the months preceding and after the assassination, Brading kept an office in the Pere Marquette Building in New Orleans. On the same floor, down the hall, from G. Wray Gill’s office, is David Ferrie’s office (#1701).(ARJ) 12:45 pm: At the Marcello trial in New Orleans, Judge Herbert W. Christenberry delivers his fifteen minute charge to the jury.

It’s more likely that David reached Gill’s office soon after the judge called the recess, was there until 1:15, told the secretary he would return in an hour, but did not. At about 3:30, Gill would have called his office and learned David had not returned there.” Nov. 22, 1963: Peninsular ChemResearch, FL had recently sent Dave a concoction I’d created at PenChem I upon his request. It should have helped eradicate the sensation of burning at the urethral exit, in gonorrhea, which could be expedited with a catheter, using aromatic solutions I devised. Overcome by Then, soon after 1 : 30 PM , Florida time ( (12:30 PM , Dallas time), we heard “three shots” had been fired in Dealey Plaza! Soon, we learned the President had been seriously wounded. The television cut away from its regular programming. About an hour later, we heard that a priest had given last rites. This news was greeted with cheers and whistles of approval in the lab. That’s when tears began running down my cheeks, despite all efforts to hide them. “For God’s sake!” I exploded, “This man is fighting for his life! What’s the matter with you?” That was not the kind of language you were supposed to use with your boss, and immediately, I knew I’d crossed that invisible line. Seeing the expressions on the faces around me, I realized the terrible political error I had just made. I’d forgotten where I was, and who I was supposed to be. This was Florida! And I was a mere lab assistant. I squirmed under the malevolent glares, wiped my tears, and lowered my head.

The poisonous whispers and sidelong glances at me continued, so I went to the sink and washed my face, put my lab coat up on a hook, and fell into a seat at the records desk, facing away from them all. Who would believe our government was being taken over from the inside? While Dave, Dr. Mary, Lee and I had done everything we could, we knew we were fighting forces much bigger than ourselves. I whispered to myself: Remember where you are. Stay calm. You have to survive. Finally, Lee’s picture flashed on the screen. He had been beaten! I gasped. Mr. Mays noticed. “What’s with you?” he shouted. “He’s a God-damned Communist!” And how much could Lee dare say, without exposing us? If he cried out, “I work for the CIA! I was loaned to them by the ONI!” his CIA and ONI contacts in the USSR would have been tortured for information and then executed. Marina’s uncle, and Lee’s ordinary friends there would probably be arrested. Lee had already told me so. He was a dead man walking. At least he had not been shot on the street, or during his arrest. Suddenly, I remembered the Call Wheel. Oh, no! I got it from my purse and checked it. Sure enough, Dave was supposed to call tonight. Thank God, I was still here! I had called Robert to take me home when everybody left, but he told me to stay (as I usually did on Fridays) to keep earning overtime money…for once, I was grateful for Robert’s miserly ways! When it was time, I headed across a deserted tract of sand and crab grass to the pay phone. I looked at my watch. I am not certain of the actual time, after so many years, but I think it may have been around 5 : 30 PM Dallas time. I waited in the silence. When the phone rang, I didn’t let it ring a second time.5 I have a very poor memory of all that happened to me before and after Lee’s death. I used to believe that Dave called me ‘right away’ about the medical library card, but evidence available doesn’t support it. Psychologists say that my memory loss of this time period was due to PTSS.

They had wanted Kennedy killed, and if they thought Lee had done them the favor, they were willing to exert some “influence.”7 I later learned they had chosen Dean Andrews to exert the “influence” – but there was problem: Dean Andrews was in the hospital with pneumonia. His career as an assistant District Attorney in Jefferson Parish would be ruined by the reporting of the matter, which he later called a figment of his imagination due to sedatives. Token assistance to Lee Oswald would have assured Lee’s Uncle Dutz Murret (who was close to Marcello) that his nephew had not been thrown to the wolves. “He’s not the only one who got arrested,” Dave said. “He’s just getting all the publicity right now. You have no concept of how powerful the Mob is in Dallas. Look, Marcello got off the hook today, at the trial. Went scot-free. That’s power. Marcello’s lawyers are on top of it right now. And we’ll be going over to Houston –me and my boys. I give you my oath – I swear – on a stack of Bibles,” he went on, fiercely. “We’ll get him out, or somebody will pay, big time.” 5:00 pm, Nov. 22: Al Beauboeuf said Dave picked him up and drove to David’s apartment, reaching it at about 5:15 pm. (Stephen Roy says Layton Martens, John Irion and Johnny Johnson are there); they all watch TV as news about Kennedy’s assassination unfolds. Lee Harvey Oswald, reported as arrested for shooting “a police officer” is already linked to Kennedy’s murder by the media.9 6:00 pm, Nov. 22: Dave and Al Beauboeuf leave Dave’s apartment. Layton Martens stays behind. His mom has kicked him out: perhaps he hopes she’ll reconcile with him. Dave and Al drive to Melvin Coffey’s place. Back in September, Coffey was arrested for giving alcohol to a minor, Ruth Kyler, who then attempted suicide. They arrive at about 6:30.

This occurs before Jack Martin, out of spite, formally contacts FBI and police. Memo: Dated 11/25/63, from ASAC J.T. Sylvester Jr. to SAC of New Orleans tells of a telephone contact at 8:32pm, 11/22/63, where David Ferrie’s name is brought up in conjunction with Lee, and asks for “any information which would indicate that Oswald was friendly with Ferrie.”12 The memo was ignored. Dave is trying to hide his connections to Lee Oswald. His preplanned Texas “getaway” was an option based on contingency. While most of America watched the crime of the century unfold before their eyes, riveted to their TV sets, Dave and friends drove hundreds of miles in a driving rain for ‘recreation.’ Lee had been in contact with Dave, Mary Sherman, and me. In Houston, Dave will introduce himself to rink manager Chuck Rolland at the Winterland ice rink four or five times, by name, making sure Rolland won’t forget he was there. 9:00 pm, Nov. 22: David Ferrie and his young friends Alvin Beauboeuf and Melvin Coffey commence a nerve-wracking 7.5-hour drive, at night, of 365 miles through on-and-off rain and road construction to Houston, Texas. One stated purpose of the trip is to look over an ice skating rink and to do some skating. His companions variously say the trip was planned two days or two weeks in advance. “The most important was to obtain a document from a man in Vinton”? Then why does Dave drive all night, pass Vinton, and at 4:30 am collapse at the Alamotel? After rest and food, he’s at Winterland at 3:30 pm. Had Dave waited until 6 : 00AM on the 23^(rd) , he could have driven in good weather, picked up the document in Vinton at 10 : 00 AM , gone on to Houston, checked in at the Alamotel, rested some, eaten, and arrived at Winterland at the same Opportunity Ice Skating Rink: I have all machinery and equipment including skates for large Ice Rink to be located in New Orleans.

Stephen Roy (posting as Blackburst): For those who find David Ferrie’s interest in investing in a skating rink in New Orleans in 1963 completely unbelievable, here is evidence that such a proposition was not only possible, but offered a guaranteed return on the investment…. One wonders if Ferrie might have seen this ad, or have spoken to C.A. Bass. In Houston, of all places. Once again, an allegation of suspicious activity on Ferrie’s part does not seem so suspicious when seen in context of the real events of his life. But wait. The ad appeared July 14, 1963, one day before Dave flew to Miami to defend himself in his Eastern Airlines grievance hearing to try to get his job back. He was scrambling to collect evidence, witnesses and statements. Would he have taken the time to read “Classifieds – Business Opportunities” on the 14^(th) ? Probably not. As for speaking with Mr. Bass, in Houston, David surely would have told the FBI, because it would have helped prove he was in Houston for the right reasons. of money: About $7100 from Wray Gill for his work on the Marcello case, and about $1650 in settlement of his grievance against Eastern Air Lines. He planned to partner with Alvin Beauboeuf, who would contribute a couple of thousand dollars, in a new business. Their investment capital of about $10, 750 was not far from the $15, 000 asked for in this ad. Dave’s ‘modest sum of money’ was actually substantial for the time. The $7, 093 (for helping in Marcello’s case), was about $54, 200 in 3/2013 funds. The EAL settlement of $1, 635.90 , in 3/2013 funds, was ∼ $123, 488 . So Dave had ∼ $66, 688 in 3/2013 funds. Rink cost of $15, 000 was ∼ $114, 508 (in 3/2013 funds). Al’s “couple of thousand ($2000 was ∼ $15, 300 in 3/2013 funds. So they had ∼ $81, 988 (in 3/2013 funds). Mr. Roy says it’s ∼ $82, 064 in 3/2013 funds. He says that’s “not far from” the ∼ 114, 508 asked. In fact, it’s ∼ $32 ,444 from reality (using Roy’s figures) in 3/2013 funds.

Minimum wage Φ = ∼ $52, 100 /year.18 Poverty level in 1964 for a single male Ferrie’s age was $1, 650 (US Census, Bureau of Statistics). 12:00 noon, Nov. 23, 1963: [FBI] Alamotel ignores wake-up call request and David and friends sleep until noon. They rise, dress, eat breakfast, and go shopping at Sears, where David purchases “a jacket, a sweater and several other items.” After leaving Sears, they drive directly to the Winterland Ice Skating Rink at 2400 Norfolk, which would open at 3:30 pm and close at 5 : 30 PM . Around 3:30 pm David Ferrie, Al Beauboeuf and Melvin Cof-fey visit Winterland Ice Rink. Though David will say he skates skate. Though David says he talks to Rolland about operating costs, etc. of an ice rink, Rolland will deny it. Rolland will testify to FBI and in court that he observed David spending most of his time at the rink’s payphone. From R. Charles Rolland testimony (Clay Shaw trial): Rolland: Skating [at the rink] started at 3:30… Q: Would you approximate the time you returned? Rolland: Somewhere between 4:00 and 4:15. Q: How many times did Ferrie introduce himself to you? Rolland: Approximately four or five. Q: He mentioned his name on four or five occasions? Rolland: Yes, sir, he did. Q: Did you consider this strange? Rolland: Quite strange.19 Stephen Roy: Ferrie said he spoke to the owner about the costs of equipping and operating such a rink, but manager Chuck Rolland denied that he was the person Ferrie spoke to…. Rolland also said he arrived late and did not watch Ferrie continuously, so it is not impossible that Ferrie spoke to someone else at Winterland about operating a rink. David told the FBI he spoke to the manager, Chuck Rolland, “at length” about operating an ice rink, which Rolland denied. David never mentioned an owner. David recalled two unnamed employees – a boy and an older man. Had he spoken to the owner, he would have said so, since he did mention two unnamed employees. (See Appendix for full FBI interview Nov. 25, 1963) FBI (Nov. 25, 1963): FERRIE stated that during the time he was talking to CHUCK ROLLAND other employees of ROLLAND were present at the rink.

He recalled specifically there was a young boy who was passing out skates and an older man who was on duty at the rink but he does not recall whether he was introduced to these two individuals or not. Stephen Roy (2005): Another researcher tipped me to a contact Ferrie may have had with another ice rink proprietor and it appears that he did discuss a franchise to open a rink in New Orleans, where there were no ice rinks…. As told to me, the trip had several purposes…. The second was to talk to the Houston man about the franchise. Rolland: Yes, he did … he did not skate. He spent most of his time walking around in the lobby, looking in the Pro Shop and watching the skaters. He made a number of trips to the telephone booth and then to his two companions and he was talking to his companions and talking to me on a number of occasions.20 On Noyember 28，1963,CHUCK ROLLAND，Winte1and Skating Rink,24oo Norfoik,wag nterviewed,at wlon me he stated that a man who introduced himself as a Mr.FERRis FRR contacted him by telephone November 22，1963 and asked for the skating Bchedule at the Winteriand Skating Rink.Mr.FERRIE stated that he was coming in from out of town and desired to do some skating while in HoustonOn November 23,1963,between 3:30and 5:30 PM, MrFERRrE and two companions came to the Winterland Skating Rink and talked to Mr.ROLLAND.Mr.FERRIE had hort general conversation with Mr.ROLLAND,but at no time did they disouse the cost of equipping or operating an ice kating rin.Mr.FERRIE tated to Mr.ROLLAND that he and hia companions would be in and out of the skating rink during the weekend. This is the last time MROLLAND BaW ERRIE Or hi Ompanions We can conjecture that Andrews was contacted not only because he was Marcello’s attorney, but because he was running for office as a judge, and could be easily manipulated to handle Lee Oswald’s case the way Marcello wanted. As an out-of-state attorney, Andrews could serve in an ‘advisory’ capacity to one of Marcello’s low-ranking attorneys in Dallas, guaranteeing Lee Oswald’s fate (conviction), if one of Marcello’s soldiers, or a doctor, couldn’t kill Lee before he went to trial.

The chief topic of discussion … was the progress of ANDREWS’ political campaign for election as a judge in Jefferson Parish.” Evening, Nov. 23 [From 11/25/1963 FBI report]: David and his two friends leave Winterland, promising to return, but they do not. They return to Alamotel. There, Dave calls New Orleans, trying to locate Gill. Dave will tell FBI they checked out of Alamotel, then drove to Houston’s Bellaire ice rink, leaving after 45 minutes or so, as they were unable to speak to the owner. (Alamotel records show they do not check out, however, until 10:00 the next morning.) Saturday, November 23, 1963 A call from David Ferrie: Waiting for Dave’s phone call was taking forever. Fortunate-ly, Robert, who had little interest in Kennedy (his parents despised JFK), was more concerned about his final exams and his GRE, just around the corner. Once again we were visiting the Zeiglars (mainly, their TV set). I said I wanted to go for a walk, to clear my head, and would be happy to pick up some cokes. They gave me some money for a vending machine down the street. As I walked to the payphone, I was on edge. Every sound in the darkness made me tense. I hoped my watch was in synch with Dave’s, so I wouldn’t have to wait around for his call. The phone rang as soon as I reached it. Dave was as nervous as I was and apologized for calling a few minutes early. I told him I was glad he did. Then I heard Dave make a sound as if he were choking. I realized he was swallowing back his tears. “Oh, my God, J,” he said to me. “I won’t hide it from you…“ As Dave started to cry, all the wretched fear and horror and sorrow burst open inside my heart, and I began crying, too. I didn’t think I had any tears left, but there they were, stinging my eyes. I was so anxious to hear what he had to say, but the darkness grew even thicker when he said, “It’s hopeless. God is against us.” I felt paralyzed.

God is against us.” I felt paralyzed. The cokes I had been carrying in a sack suddenly broke through the bottom, and I just let them fall. Miraculously, they didn’t break. The bottles just rolled to the curb, glittering with bits of sand in the streetlight that was flickering, like a broken live wire, against the dark sky. “If you want to stay alive,” Dave warned me, with a strained voice, “it’s time to go into the catacombs. Promise me you will keep your mouth shut!” he added. “I don’t want to lose you, too.” I felt weak all over. “If there is any chance to save him, we’ll get him out of there, I swear to you,” he went on. I could tell he was just trying to inject some hope. Dave said, “Play the dumb broad. Save yourself. Remember, Mr. T will watch every step you make.” Trafficante was also the good friend and ally of Carlos Marcello. Fortunately, Marcello liked me, which is why I believed I had a chance to survive any threats from that direction. Dave added, “I’ll call you once more – check the time (the Call Wheel). After that, I probably can’t call you anymore. And now I have other calls to Breck Wall, a homosexual and nightclub performer, also head of Dallas’ AVGA union, lives in the Adolphus Hotel across from Ruby’s Carousel Club in Dallas. After 44 minutes of attempting to reach Wall, Wall answers at 11:44 pm, at SO 3-8022 [the number of J. McKenna, Wall’s adoptive father]. This is Jack Ruby’s last known long-distance call before he shoots Lee Oswald the next day.21 8:00 am-10:00AM Nov. 24, 1963: FBI: David Ferrie says he and friends get up, eat breakfast, then check out of the Driftwood Hotel. (Conflicts: Driftwood Hotel records showed David Ferrie and friends checked out at 2 : 00 pM , Nov. 24. Alamotel records show David Ferrie and his two companions checked out at 10:00 am.) Conflicting Checkout Hours for the Driftwood and Alamotels: [HSCA’s] Gaeton Fonzi discovered “check-in and check-out times for the Alamotel Motel and Driftwood Motel conflicted.

I couldn’t sleep. Robert was surprised that I couldn’t even cook. “I had no idea you liked Kennedy so much,” he said. Luckily, all of America was transfixed by the tragedy. Everyone was watching their televisions, and the Zeiglars were no exception. As before, I was welcome to pop over and watch. As lunchtime approached, Ron, his wife Karen and I viewed the non-stop television coverage of the JFK assassination. As for Robert, he returned to his carrel at the university library to finish an English paper. Lee was to be transferred from the city jail to another location, a matter announced the night before and repeatedly all morning. My outrage was intense, because I heard no friend or acquaintance put in a single good word for this man who had done no evil. He was being declared guilty, without a trial! Nobody else was being sought in connection with the crime of the century. They had their man, they knew it from the very beginning, and that was that. Retouched photo, left, shows ‘smirk’ and redrawn nose, chin and fingers. There seems to be a drop of whiteout on the right cheek. Photo to right, taken at the same moment, is un-retouched. Lee has just been brought in. He raises his handcuffed hands quickly in reply to a question as to whether he is handcuffed (rare back then). Over in a second, the gesture was touted in newspapers as a “Communist salute.” It was a bold, outright lie. At first, the glass in the door was not covered with newspapers. Inside, Roger Craig can be seen in rear. His testimony would have indicated conspirators, and that Lee had help. That kind of evidence could not be considered in the cover-up. Dallas police insisted that Craig was never inside this office, until this photo emerged. arms. A horn honked, there was a pause, and it honked again, as Captain Will Fritz moved quickly out of the way, leaving Lee wide open in the front. Then, as shouts mixed with the flashing of cameras, Lee glanced briefly to his left. Suddenly a hulking figure in a dark suit leapt out at him. At the same moment – a gunshot – Lee’s dreadful outcry, pure agony. A bullet was tearing through his body. I screamed, as our souls were ripped apart. Then came the time for Lee’s transfer to a place out of the public eye. At first, I was relieved that they had given him a sweater to wear. Then I realized Lee was dressed all in black, like a villain or a hit man.

Then I realized Lee was dressed all in black, like a villain or a hit man. How crowded the place was! Practically a mob scene. I could only see people in plain clothes: where were the police? I strained to see Lee as he was brought forward. You could hear the excitement rippling through the crowd in the basement. And Photo shows Jack Ruby restrained from shooting Lee Oswald a second time as Capt. Will Fritz (facing away, to left) is only one to stare ahead, despite gunfire. Film (from which this still was taken) shows Fritz had been walking in front of Lee, which gave Lee protection, but suddenly moved quickly away to the left, exposing Lee to Jack Ruby, who then moved in for the kill. Det. Jim Leavelle [to Topeka’s CJ Online]: To keep Oswald from being snatched from custody, Leavelle [said he] handcuffed his left wrist to Oswald’s right wrist. A second set of cuffs was snapped on Oswald’s wrists. As Leavelle walked into the basement of the Dallas police building, he held onto Oswald’s belt to control him. Leavelle was briefly blinded by TV news lights but then spotted Ruby holding a pistol by his thigh. “I saw that pistol in his hand and knew what was going to happen,” he said. Ruby shoved the pistol toward Oswald and fired, mortally wounding him.23 When Marcello’s bagman, Jack Ruby, shot Lee on Nov. 24, Marcello’s “power” Dave Ferrie told me about was on raw display. Lee was assassinated in the presence of seventy Dallas police and innumerable reporters and media personnel. As for me, after screaming, and, I think, vomiting, I can remember nothing more. Treatment of Oswald in Custody: Gus Russo tells us that Police put makeup on Lee Oswald’s face to hide abuse: … Dallas Police have officially admitted that they put makeup on his face so that he would appear unmarred when the press viewed his transfer… FBI ordered an investigation of Dallas Police to determine if abuses had occurred … headed by agent Vincent Drain. When asked [about results] … Drain responded, “I just wouldn’t want to comment on that.” (Vincent Drain, interview by Russo, 18 Oct. 1993,p 568 Live by the Sword: the Secret War Against Castro and the Death of JFK (Russo is no supporter of Oswald’s innocence, by the way).

When viewing autopsy photos, I realized Lee had been burned behind his left ear. Since Lee was seen at the ‘Midnight Conference’ with cuts and bruises, one must ask what new bruising was covered up if they had to use makeup. Note the autopsy photo of Lee’s feet. What are those puncture marks and cuts on both feet? The wounds look like the result of inserting electrodes to shock him. There is a bruised area next to the arch of his right foot, full of cuts such as a sharp switch would make. Afternoon, Nov. 24, 1963: With Lee Oswald dead and unable to defend himself, Jack Martin now whips up more accusations against David Ferrie. He will call New Orleans Assistant District Attorney Herman Kohlman, a former reporter, three times. Today and tomorrow he will contact radio and TV stations, newspapers, Secret Service, and FBI with his version of David Ferrie. To wit: Ferrie taught Oswald how to shoot, Ferrie has a rifle such as the one that killed JFK, Ferrie was Oswald’s mentor in the Civil Air Patrol, Ferrie hypnotized Oswald, Ferrie discussed killing JFK with Oswald, Ferrie flew Oswald to Dallas, and Ferrie was Oswald’s “getaway pilot.” Warren Commission Doc. # 75, p. 285, shows Martin even blames David Ferrie for the pistol-whipping Guy Banister gave him. David’s “adopted son” – a young Marine – officially lives in Alexandria when not on duty. According to Stephen Roy, the young Marine’s parents refused to allow him to register a 1959 Ford (in poor condition). David, therefore, registered the car in his own name, adding “Jr.” so his “son” could drive it. Dave probably kept his “son’s” car stored in New Orleans, available whenever the young man was on leave.25 5:00 pm-5:15 pm? Nov. 24, 1963: FBI: David makes several [unsuccessful] pre-paid long distance calls from a gas station, trying to reach Attorney G. Wray Gill’s office. Finally, he calls Layton Martens at his apartment and learns that two people from WWL-TV have come, and are still in the neighborhood. The reason: he’s likely to be arrested as a suspect in Kennedy’s assassination. 9:15 pm, Nov. 24, 1963: Beauboeuf and Martens are arrested at David’s apartment. Without a warrant, investigators from the DA’s office and the police “confiscate books, photographs and other material including a library on hypnotism, abstracts on post-hypnotic suggestion, three U.S. passports (stamped but with no pictures or descriptions) and weapons.” It is presumed that both young men call G. Wray Gill to help them.26 5:30 am, Nov. 25, 1963: Thomas Compton is wakened", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:224:71c05296f4a5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5574, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 225, "text": "as a suspect in Kennedy’s assassination. 9:15 pm, Nov. 24, 1963: Beauboeuf and Martens are arrested at David’s apartment.

Wray Gill to help them.26 5:30 am, Nov. 25, 1963: Thomas Compton is wakened in his dorm bed in Holloway-Smith Hall for men at Southeastern Louisiana College in Hammond. FBI: “[FERRIE] stated that COMPTON is doing research at this school.” [David also says Compton is “researching narcotics addiction.” Compton is a former Moisant Squadron CAP cadet from the late 1950’s.] Thomas Compton depicts David as “hysterical and near tears” as David states “The police are at my home and have taken some of my things.” David says he has done nothing wrong. They talk of “unrelated” things, then David sleeps in Compton’s dorm room. In the morning, before David leaves, he calls G. Wray Gill for an update. He decides to turn himself in, hoping this will take police and FBI pressure off Beauboeuf and Martens.27 An FBI Teletype from the New Orleans field office to Director J. Edgar Hoover and the special agent in charge of the FBI office in Dallas says Layton Martens has been interviewed, that he is David Ferrie’s roommate, and that “Martens said attorney G. Wray Gill visited Ferrie’s residence and told Martens he was looking for Ferrie, who was then not at home. Gill remarked to Martens that, when he was arrested by Dallas Police, Oswald was carrying a library card with Ferrie’s name on it. David Ferrie called Bill Wulf: Compton (March, 1967) said somehow, David knew Lee Oswald had known “Mr. BILL WULF who headed” a high school astronomy club in 1956 that “OSWALD attempted to join … and submitted an application which was refused.” [Wulf would insist that Lee was already acting ‘violently pro-communist’ and broke off friendship with him.] Garrison Investigator Alvin Oser reported “COMPTON related that after the assassination, MR. WULF turned over this application to the F.B.I. COMP-TON stated that shortly after the assassination, DAVE FERRIE called MR. WULF and inquired if he knew anything about LEE HARVEY OSWALD. COMPTON related that he couldn’t figure how DAVE FERRIE had knowledge of MR. WULF and the Astronomy Club and connecting this with LEE HARVEY OSWALD.” Lee and I had talked about astronomy with Dave. My former high-school boyfriend, Al Freeman, made me a really nice telescope.

Dave, knowing he will soon be arrested, has been contacting anyone who might have seen him with Lee, especially former CAP cadets and science-savvy people such as Compton and Wulf. Conflict: David will tell the FBI he stayed in Hammond until 1:00 or 1 : 30 PM that day. Compton, however, will tell Garrison investigators in March 1967 that David left at 8:30 am. When Compton was questioned in 1967, he said he was unable to figure out how David was able to find him. It is possible that David stopped by at Clay Shaw’s parents’ home at this time. By now, Shaw has returned from his “alibi trip” to San Francisco, where he invited himself as a speaker for a Trade Mart meeting on Nov. 22. Afternoon, Nov. 25, 1963: FBI: “He [Ferrie] stated that he then drove to New Orleans and went directly to his home where he obtained a clean shirt and then proceeded to the office of Attorney GILL. He stated that from there he went to the District Attorney’s office accompanied by Mr. GILL where he surrendered to the District Attorney.” FBI: (interview with Sgt. Davis): “On November 25, 1963, Sergeant DAVIS stated that when he visited DEAN ANDREWS, he was very much upset over a news item [on TV]… that OSWALD had fired three shots at the President of the United States from a bolt action rifle within three seconds . ANDREWS insisted that this could not be done and wanted to call the FBI and the Secret Service and furnish these agencies with his opinion. Sergeant DAVIS advised he talked ANDREWS out of this action and left the hospital.” I agree with Martens’ assessment. Dave personally told me he had to avoid crying out “Hail to the Chief” but only to stay credible to the fanatics and radicals who wanted to see “The Man” dead.

Nov. 25, 1963: Sciambra (interview, 1967): “I then asked [Ferrie] if he would like to tell me some more about his trip to Hammond and he smiled and said ‘Go to hell.’ I then asked if he stayed with CLAY SHAW. He said, ‘Who’s CLAY SHAW?’ I said, ‘All right, if that doesn’t ring a bell, how about CLAY BERTRAND?’ He said, ‘Who’s CLAY BERTRAND?’ I said CLAY BERTRAND and CLAY SHAW are the same person. He asked, ‘Who said that?’ I said, ‘Dean Andrews told us.’ He said, ‘Dean Andrews might tell you guys anything. You know how Dean Andrews is.’” Alex and Doris Eames lived next door to the house owned by the “innocent” McLaneys. Lena Garner [Mrs. Jesse Garner] lived for them. Lee moved into 4905 on May 9, 1963, but used 4907 as his mailing address, even stamping some FPCC flyers “4907 Magazine St.” which he distributed July 16. Eric Rogers (jobless) and wife moved to 4907 at that time, accepting Lee’s mail and keeping 4905 safer for Lee’s family. Upon vacating on September 22, Lee owed nothing for 4905, but Garner reported he owed a utility bill and two weeks’ rent at 4907, where Rogers still lived (Rogers got an external job at once).

Dave couldn’t contact me until our next pre-arranged time. Since I might have given Lee the card when I left NOLA, and knowing Lee would not have kept the card in his wallet, David was in a panic. He began a search for the medical library card. Russell Eames: (Doris Eames’ son, to the author, 2011): I remember the FBI agents in our living room [in 1967], Jim Garrison sending a limo to take my mother “downtown” for interrogation by his investigators, I remember a visit (documented) by David Ferrie and how my mother was aghast by his appearance at our front door asking questions about a library card … with … orange hair and fake eyebrows.30 There is no doubt that David Ferrie was looking for his “library card.” In fact, it seems that Dave took significant risks in his attempts to locate it. He visited Mrs. Eames not only to see what Mr. Eames might know, but also in order to have an excuse for being in the neighborhood. Dave told me he had frantically searched Lee’s apartment before contacting me. He could have been arrested for doing that, if caught. A.J. Weberman: Mrs. Jesse Garner, OSWALD’S former landlady in New Orleans, told the HSCA that David Ferrie visited her home on the night of the assassination and asked about OSWALD’S library card, but she refused to speak with him: “I just opened the door and he came in, and he said, ‘I’m David Ferrie.’ Well, I thought he was one of the FBI men or newsmen…. He said they found his library card on OSWALD… (Weberman thinks Garner is lying). Was Garner’s story a lie? Perhaps. But note that everything else Garner told FBI, Warren Commission, Garrison etc. is accepted as truthful, even though she lied about Lee owing rent and utilities at 4907. Neither witness reported Dave’s visit for a long time, but David wasn’t important in the case until he became front-page news in 1967. I tend to believe David did visit Garner – on the 26^(th) , the same day he visited Mrs. Eames. Blackburst: Well, actually, this is not my speculation. This is what Ferrie told his friends … he heard the story that Oswald had possessed a library card with his name on it.

Not knowing Jack Martin was the source of the story, he worried that Oswald might have taken an old library card. If you give Ferrie a presumption of innocence, the story is not at all unbelievable. I don’t know why you find it funny. But by now, Dave knew Jack Martin was the source, since he had talked to Gill many times by the 27^(th) . Gill had soon learned that Hardy Davis got his information from Martin. Dave knew Davis, who was gay. Dave doesn’t openly name Martin as the source about the card because Martin could do more damage if he knew how important the card was to Dave. Above all, he doesn’t want Martin to bring David Lewis into the mix, though Martin will do just that after David dies in 1967.34 The Eames’ said Dave visited them the day after the newspaper mentioned that Alex Eames had seen Lee Oswald in the public library. That date was Nov. 25, so Mrs. Eames received Dave’s visit on Tuesday, Nov. 26. The HSCA said Dave talked to Mr. Eames, but it was Doris to whom he spoke.35 Once Dave knew the medical library card was no longer a problem, he shifted his focus to denying he knew Lee Oswald. On his visit to Roy McCoy, he asked if McCoy recalled photos of Lee in the CAP.36 He had also visited Lee’s erstwhile friend, former CAP cadet Ed Voebel, who reminded Dave that Lee had attended a party at Dave’s house, prompting Dave to suggest that maybe Lee stole his library card from his home on Vinet St. This reduced Dave’s previous frantic search to a mere comment.” 3.

The SS was responsible for providing the President with the protection believed to be necessary and the President could not override any such decisions. 5. My memory is terrible concerning the time period shortly before and after Lee was shot down in cold blood before my eyes. I had a complete blackout of memory right after Lee was shot, from which I didn’t properly emerge for almost a day. I cannot remember working at PenChem, but obviously put in time there. This was the most terrible experience of my life. I now believe, from evidence provided by others, that Dave didn’t question me about our medical library card until after Lee was shot. I have therefore removed that part of the conversation, and transposed it to a later call. 7. Marcello attorney Dean Andrews at first would say a man called “Bertrand’ whom many in the French Quarter to this day equate to Clay Shaw, had called him when he was in a hospital bed, asking him to arrange legal representation for Lee. Andrews never did it. He later claimed it was all a hallucination because he was on medication. But Andrews mentioned that Lee and his “gay friends” had visited him, and that he handled cases for gays. Guess what? Clay Shaw was gay. Most honest researchers assume that Shaw did make this gesture, possibly to appease Marcello, who would want to make sure that a properly designated attorney would be necessary to hide Lee’s ties to the Mafia. 16.

Synopsis, by Tolan Investigations, Inc. for Southern Research Corp. Background Check, Nov. 1962 report for Eastern Air Lines. Signed by Thomas M. Tolan. “1959 Ford found registered to David W. Ferrie, Jr. 11 Prospect St., Alexandria, LA. “…efforts to identify negative to date.” Stephen Roy stated in August, 2013, on Education Forum that this was not the first car, for some young male for whom David had faked registration papers. Mr. Roy had previously said David had no car available after his had been towed away in March, 1963 – that he had used his motorcycle only, and that I was lying about Dave’s having a car at that time. It is probably this neglected car, which was unlikely to have been kept at the address of the disapproving parents. Dave used a car (though sparingly) between April and the end of August. Dave is on record as borrowing airplanes, let alone cars. I reported that Dave had a motorcycle, as well. However, the car was not reliable and David apparently used it only once in a while –possibly to keep the battery from running down. I would not have known that Dave secretly owned it for a “son.” 28. Rogers became employed by Meal-a-Minute in September and was still living at 4907 when questioned by the Warren Commission in 1964. The FBI and Warren Commission knew Lee’s true address, as shown in their interviews, but advertised that Lee left New Orleans owing rent and utilities at 4907. By such means, and in other ways, they created a negative picture of Lee Oswald for their own use.

When the apartment manager [Mrs. Garner] testified to the Warren Commission on April 6, 1964, she did not mention David Ferrie’s visit, but on the other hand, she was never questioned about anyone but Oswald and had no real opportunity to volunteer information about David Ferrie. 30. In March, 2011, Russell Eames, son of Oswald’s landlady, Doris Eames, wrote to me about the library card (and much more – he had known Lee Oswald as a pre-teen). In the course of our IM conversation, described other details about Lee Oswald, who lived in the house next door, at 4905 Magazine St.” 34. Immediately after reciting his long list of problems with Martin to the FBI, Dave says: “…that he had learned through interviews with other officers that one of the allegations made against him was that when OSWALD was arrested he had his (FERRIE’s) library card in OSWALD’s possession and that it had been alleged that OSWALD had been using FERRIE’s library card to get books at the New Orleans Public Library. FERRIE said that in his personal property located in the Property Room at the First District is his library card which expired March 13, 1963. FERRIE said that he has not made application for a new card since the above card expired and that this card has been in his possession at all times.” 35. HSCA: “(457) A neighbor of Oswald’s, Mrs. Doris Eames, told New Orleans district attorney investigators in 1968 that Ferrie had come by her house after the assassination, inquiring if Mr. Eames had any information regarding Oswald’s library card.

I never heard from Dave again. drews recants and says the phone call he received to act as Lee Oswald’s attorney was “a dream” because he was under sedation at the hospital. Andrews does insist that Lee is just “a patsy.” But he also says, “I like to live. If they can get the President, they can crush me like a bug.” Next, Jack S. Martin will confess that while in the hospital from Guy Banister’s pistol-whipping, he had a case of “telephonitis” and didn’t know what he was talking about. Don Jeffries (friend of Andrews’ son, Dean Andrews, III) wrote:“Dean’s son told me someone did put out a contract on his father’s life, but that Carlos Marcello, according to him a personal friend of his father’s, intervened. Even after the Shaw trial, Dean Andrews grew more paranoid as time went on, and his family clearly understood he was afraid and believed the assassination was the result of a high level conspiracy.” David Andrews [a son] [Sept. 12, 2012]: Manipulating LHO’s legal counsel would be the real reason. It is the exact same reason Lyndon Johnson put Abe Fortas as the lawyer for Bobby Baker. And LBJ lawyer John Cofer as the lawyer for Billie Sol Estes. Control the lawyer and you can control the client for someone else’s benefit.”6 Stephen Roy: Who intimidated him? You sound very certain about it. I’ve covered much the same ground, and I am not so certain about it. That Andrews told people of a call from Washington is not a very specific intimidation. He continued to talk about the call through 1967, including under oath, so he can’t have been very intimidated by it…. If people think the Andrews story falls together, I must be missing something. Don Jeffries (replying to Roy): My questions about the call from Bertrand to Andrews should not suggest that I doubt he ever received such a call. I do believe Andrews was intimidated, as he suggested in interviews (“they can squash me like a bug,” “I got the shortest memory in the world,” etc.) From knowing his son (and I also met and spoke with his widow), I’ve learned just how paranoid Andrews was in his later years…. I don’t share [Stephen’s] suspicions that Andrews may have invented the story.

He identifies one of the men as David Ferrie. (See p. 449 on why Dave may have been at the airport; researcher Peter Whitmey brought together much of this material.) Paris Flammonde: Ferrie … was concerned over how much Oswald had told his wife about the plot to kill Kennedy. Additionally, they discussed a man named Isaacs, his relationship with Oswald, and how curious it was that he would have gotten himself involved with a “psycho” like Oswald … Ferrie inquired about some paper, or merchandise, coming out of Nevada and the other man replied that things had gotten too risky and that the house, or shop, at a place called Mercury had been closed down, but that a “good shipment” had reached Caracas from Newport. It was also agreed that the Warren Commission would not stop its investigation, even if it did decide that Oswald was guilty.9 Feb. 14, 1964: David attends his uncle’s funeral in Cleveland. [See researcher Robert Harris’ argument challenging Stephen Roy’s long-standing declaration that Ferrie could not have been in the Winnipeg airport on the 13^(th) , because Ferrie was traveling in the US in a car with “a traveling companion” (who refuses to be named)]. (See Appendix XI). Feb. 25, 1964: Flight 304, an Eastern Air Lines DC-8, crashes into Lake Pontchartrain, New Orleans. Fifty-eight people aboard the jet plane die. “A Coast Guard pilot said there were indications that the plane had exploded either in the air or on impact.10 The aircraft crashed … nineteen miles northeast of New Orleans International Airport, shortly after taking off.”11 End of March, 1964: Betty Rubio says she saw Clay Shaw and David Ferrie together: “Betty Rubio worked at Lakefront Airport and knew Ferrie.

Shaw and Ferrie talked for a while and then Ferrie got in his plane as Shaw walked past her toward the terminal building.”12 The same day, the Warren Commission opens in New Orleans to obtain voluntary (unsolicited) testimonies about the Kennedy assassination. It is believed that Dr. Sherman would have testified. Her murder was front page news. Dean Andrews, Jr., aware of the death of Dr. Mary Sherman on this morning’s front page, offers his The “Plane Truth” About David Ferrie’s Planes n mid-1964 David Ferrie sells his Taylorcraft L-2. Previously, Dave sold I his beloved Stinson to Tom Brister, one of his flight students. (see below). As we’ve discussed elsewhere, Dave borrowed a Cessna on April 8, 1963 to transport three persons, “Lambert” “Hidell” and “Diaz,” to Garland TX.16 Dave had flown the group to Hammond, LA. “Hidell” was a name used by Lee Oswald. I myself, was introduced to Clay Shaw at Lake- For such reasons as the above, researchers have tried to find records associated with the planes David Ferrie owned or could have been using. Most of the logbooks are missing. No mention can be found of flight logs for the Taylorcraft L-2. Stephen Roy says he has logbooks, but has not publicly identified which logbooks he has. Jan. 1965: Dave continues in some role as a “psychologist.” A Garrison Memo (Mar. 3, 1967) from Julian R. Murray says Mrs. William B. Jones, who needed a male nurse, interviewed and hired Jimmy Johnson in Jan. 1965 based on a recommendation from “a psychiatrist or psychologist whose last name was Ferrie and who lived on Louisiana Avenue Parkway.” Stephen Roy: (2004) …as his temp job with G. Wray Gill…was winding down in 1963, Ferrie tried to set himself up as a psychologist, both at his home and at an office building on Perdido. Neighbors reported young teen boys coming and going from Ferrie’s home, but it is unclear which were patients and which were not.

As for David’s standing as a psychologist, he was already in practice when new regulations came along. He was probably grandfathered-in. Dave’s bogus PhD would have looked good enough, back then, to “pass.”20 Stephen Roy: …the reason for Ferrie’s departure from Gill’s office was embarrassment over his implication in the JFK matter, (David Blackburst, Interviews with Gill associates; E-mail to Reitzes, August 14, 1999)…. The Marcello case was over (temporarily) and Gill thought it best to gently help steer Ferrie toward the service station he had just purchased.21 Mr. Roy is being unkind. Since Dave was trying to open his own flight school, he would want the certificate to display. David, over-qualified to be a flight instructor, with instrument rating and thousands of hours of flying as a senior commercial pilot, had trained students for years in small high performance airplanes such as his Taylorcraft L-2. At any time he could have grabbed a certificate. “Prior to 1960 (and through the early 1960s), CAA regulation 20.130 provided for private pilots to obtain a limited flight instructor certificate with as little as 200 hours total time and no instrument rating. If this private pilot instructor had an instrument rating, then he or she could also give instrument instruction to prepare and endorse applicants for their instrument rating.23 March 23, 1965: David Ferrie and J.O. Weilbaecher create “Professional Research Inc.” There are two “Registered Agents” … J. O. Weilbaecher, III, 822 Perdido St, New Orleans, La 70112^(′′) and “… David W. Ferrie, 3330 La Ave, New Orleans, La 70115” (R Charter/ Organization ID: 26915010D). Several doctors are associated with the Weilbaecher name in the area.24 Researchers John Bevilaqua and Susan Klopfer: (Bevilaqua posting to Ed.

CIA operative Charles Frederick Rogers, a friend of David Ferrie from CAP days, is a brilliant man. He is multi-lingual, a pilot, geologist, physicist, and CIA asset.28 Last seen fleeing in a plane headed toward Mexico, Rogers is never seen again, though reports placed him, in 1986, in Guatemala “working in the Iran-Contra program.” Reports of his ties to David Ferrie, Lee Oswald and the Kennedy assassination resulted in a book: The Man on the Grassy Knoll, by John Craig & Philip A. Rogers. July 11, 1965: There are various records of David flying fishermen to islands. Here is a well-documented example: Three witnesses recall that David Ferrie flew someone resembling Clay Shaw and three others out to Freemason Island for a fishing excursion. But on this date, David contacts one pilot Natt Milligan of Trans-Gulf Seaplane Service to bring Shaw and two companions back because of an upcoming storm surge that could flood the island. William Gurvich will write a memorandum to Jim Garrison on April 5, 1967, about the event. His memo is unusually descriptive, with phone numbers, addresses, specific details and verifiable quotes. Gurvich wrote: “…Ferrie had [flown] to this island at least three times prior to Hurricane Betsy on September 9, 1965…. Both Veazeys [owners] identified photograph of David Ferrie … Ferrie’s third …visit was a day or two prior to July 11, 1965, at that time he had flown four fishermen to the island in a land plane, making two trips, On July 11, Ferrie telephoned Steve Littleton of Trans-Gulf Seaplane Service … asking the latter to send a seaplane to Freemason to pick up three fishermen as the lowering ceiling prevented him from doing so in a land plane. At 1400 hours…pilot Natt Milligan arrived at the island … he described [one of] these fishermen to me as -White male, 5’11”, 55 - 58 years, gray hair, ruddy complexion as if sunburned…. The original Trans-Gulf log of July 11, 1965… confirms the above. [Milligan was shown photos and]… selected one of Andrew Blackmon … Milligan then selected a photograph of Clay Shaw and said this was similar to one of the men he bad picked up at Freemason Island for Ferrie.” Sept. 4, 1965: Rose Cherami,30 who predicted JFK’s assassination before and at the moment it happened, who also told of a ride toward Dallas with two “Italians’, dies in a hit-andrun incident.

Author Todd. C. Elliot [A Rose by Many Other Names] says witness Jerry Don Moore described her luggage lined up in the center of the road along which he was speeding, forcing him to swerve. He narrowly missed striking Rose’s supine body. Stopping, he saw, however, tire tread marks on her arm. She was alive: he eventually got her to Gladewater Memorial Hospital. “I surely didn’t think she would die,” he said. A doctor was inexplicably called in from faraway Dallas to “care” for Cherami, after which hospital personnel told Moore “she didn’t live long.”31 Oct. 11, 1965: Clay Lavergne Shaw retires as Managing Director of New Orleans International Trade Mart, a position he had held for 18 years.32 He has been absent in Europe much of the time since the assassination. Shaw tells reporters “the new Trade Mart Building, erected at the foot of Canal St. [is] the fulfillment of [a] lifelong dream.” According to Tommie L. Clark, David begins working for Sat-urn Aviation in 1965 as a charter pilot after leaving Dav-Al’s (which will be sold) and tries to organize his own flight school. He will be training students to fly until almost the end of his life, canceling his last appointment just a few days before his death. But Tommie leaves out other airlines for which David worked. Stephen Roy [to Owen Parsons, Oct. 10, 2006, Ed. Forum]: Joan Mellen is wrong about the airline … Southcentral Air Lines was originally Space Air Freight, chartered by Charles Wendorf and Jacob Nastasi. It was changed to Southcentral Air Lines on June 22, 1966, but had trouble being accepted by the FAA…. There is NO EVIDENCE that Southcentral had anything to do with the CIA, much less being a proprietary. Mellen was wrong to make this claim.34 But is “South Central Airlines” the same as “Southcentral Airlines?” Since Mr. Roy writes the name twice, it isn’t a typo. South Central Airlines was doing business in Florida, North Carolina and other states by Dec. 5, 1963 and was still in business up to September, 1965, according to newspaper articles. Then lawsuits over a devastating plane crash35 in Gainesville, where I happened to be living, on Feb. 6, 1964, basically shut South Central down by 1965. A rehearing was denied36 Nov. 3, 1966. 37 But was this the company in Slidell, Louisiana, run by Wendorf and Nastasi? Let’s see if we can figure that out. So, was Space Air Freight’s name changed to “South Central” on June 22, 1966, thus putting Space Air freight out of business?

So, was Space Air Freight’s name changed to “South Central” on June 22, 1966, thus putting Space Air freight out of business? Actually, Space Air Freight was still up and running until at least March, 1967 (we know this because of an oblique bribe to Al Beauboeuf by Garrison investigators Lynn Loisel and Louis Ivon, which was recorded) and so conclude it wasn’t. “About 10 : 00 PM on Thursday, March 9th, 1967, five days before the start of the Shaw preliminary hearing, Loisel and Ivon again appeared at Beauboeuf’s home… [Loisel said], “You know, Al, my boss has got unlimited money and … we’re in a position to do something for you, perhaps pay you $5, 000 − $10, 000 − $15, 000 and a guaranteed job with an airline…” The next day, they mentioned Space Air Freight as the airline where a job could be arranged: “… For instance … a small operation such as Space Air Freight. I know with one phone call he could go out to the Space Air Freight and write his own ticket, you know. That’s just Space Air Freight. That’s not Eastern or something else. But I feel like we have people who are stepping stones to the larger airlines and so forth.” Added Loisel: “They’re politically motivated, too, you know, like anything else.” The day Dave is fired, he writes his will. His dearest friend, Alvin Beauboeuf, is the beneficiary. Dave will soon purchase a grave site in St. Bernard Cemetery. He worries that he has “encephalitis” or “cancer of the neck.” The migraines he’s had for so many years are now worse,41 but his blood pressure medication could be the cause.42 Atop that, David is apparently overdosing himself on Proloid to combat hypothyroidism. His “bug eyes” sleeplessness, nervousness, nausea and headaches are likely side effects of Proloid (see Appendix IX). From the National Institute of Health: If you have a severe headache, nausea or vomiting, bad headache, confusion … you may have a severe and dangerous form of high blood pressure called malignant hypertension. (See Appendix IX for the official cause of death and arguments for murder versus a natural death).43 Tommie L. Clark: (Garrison investigation interview, March 15, 1967). Dave sold the filling station, and he asked me if I wanted to work with him as a flight instructor at the [Lakefront] airport. He was working for Saturn Aviation at that time.

He asked me to work with him there. This was 1966.45 When Carlos and his brother Joe flew from New York to New Orleans International Airport a large crowd met him, along with flashing cameras and reporters. Suddenly, finding his way blocked, Carlos punched him. “According to Collins, as he approached Carlos, the little man shouted at him, “I’m the boss around here,” and then let fly. A press photographer captured the scene and the next day Carlos was arrested and charged…. Eventually, the case came to court and on May 20, 1968, Carlos went on trial in Laredo, Texas…. Yet again, he was acquitted, this time by a hung jury.” But not even Wasserman, Gill, Andrews or a bribed jury could stop conviction at a final trial, in Houston, ending on August 9, 1968 with a two-year prison term (Marcello served six months in high style).46 Stephen Roy (Ed. Forum, 15 Feb. 2005): I now have access to most of Ferrie’s medical records…. I have new information about Ferrie’s medical condition. He saw a doctor and was actually hospitalized in the fall of 1966. The symptoms he was complaining of are quite interesting … I have noted before that Ferrie had long experienced severe headaches Concerns about autopsy photos: I was unable to obtain these records, which Mr. Roy has chosen to keep for his book. These records, along with Dave’s autopsy photos, had been shown to researchers just before the Internet became available. Despite requests to place these records and photos on the Internet, they remain in the hands of Mr. Roy and a few others. Perhaps Mr. Roy will someday show them to us. It can be argued that Dave was over-medicating on Proloid (see Appendix IX), but Dave suspects, through self-diagnosis, that he has encephalitis, perhaps based on events in 1963: “Cancer or even exposure to certain drugs or toxins may also cause encephalitis.”48 (See Appendix IX) Our virus-laden lung cancer project was dangerous. David may have believed a virus in the bioweapon had infected him. Dr. Sherman was dead. He was probably no longer able to directly contact Ochsner. Dave might have thought he had a version of autoimmune encephalitis, with cancer the eventual end product.49 [Note: Nevertheless, David still flies. He still teaches students how to fly.

And they still praise his abilities.] Oct. 1966: David is hired as a flight instructor at a flight school operated by Al Crouch at the New Orleans Lakefront Airport. [Tommy L. Clark accompanies him]. David also still works as a chartered pilot for Saturn Aviation, run by Crouch.50 “Some time” during his work with Al Crouch at the New Orleans Lakefront Airport, Crouch finds out that David’s “certificate” had expired (was this for training students?). Crouch is upset.51 Dec. 7, 1966: Jack Ruby slips a note into Al Maddox’ hand. It says that he has been injected with cancer cells. Ruby has previously given other notes to Maddox, to give to his family, and he will do so at Parkland hospital, as well. When Maddox tells Ruby’s sister, Eva Grant about the note, Grant thinks Ruby is hallucinating. I personally interviewed Al Maddox in July 2002. He brought out boxes of letters people had written to Jack, showed me Jack’s expensive glasses, and shared hours of personal information about Jack. Al told me about Jack Ruby’s life in jail, and at Parkland Hospital. In the photo, right, Al Maddox looks with awe at the rifle taken from the TSBD. He said everyone in the office wore bowties, just as did Lt. Carl Day. “We were a close bunch,” he said. “It was like a fraternity.” Dec. 9, 1966: Jack Ruby is admitted to Parkland Hospital. Ruby, who fatally shot Lee Oswald and who many believe was an associate of David Ferrie, through links to Carlos Marcello, was to have a re-trial in February or March 1967, in Wichita Falls, Texas. Of course a re-trial would focus on Lee Oswald as well, and on the Kennedy assassination. Jack Ruby: I have been used for a purpose (To Chief Justice Earl Warren, June 7, 1964). Ruby’s interview with the Warren Commission was 120 pages long, replete with incompetent handling of information and leads that Ruby offered. Ruby’s plea to be transferred out of Dallas, that he could not safely disclose what he knew with Dallas jailers present, fell on deaf ears. He then predicted (correctly) that he would never be able to testify again. in New York in 1963. Certainly Ruby was paranoid about Jews being killed and tortured.

I repeat here that David and I had expounded to Jack – a ‘health nut’ – on the method to be used to kill Castro because he was curious, and Dave trusted him. Chicago. Though not from Chicago, Alan Adelson said he had met with Dr Jolyon West in the Windy City to discuss the case. (Earl Ruby HSCA testimony) The last word however, probably should go to the Inspector General in reference to CIA medical experiments: “The risk of compromise of the program through correct diagnosis of an illness by an unwitting medical specialist is regularly considered and is stated to be a governing factor in the decision to conduct a given test. The Bureau officials also maintain close working relations with local police authorities which could be utilized to protect the activity in critical situations.” (July 26, 1963 memo from JS Eamon to Director, CIA).54 Greg Parker published news articles: “Cancer has been found in the lining of Ruby’s chest, in addition to the lymph node on his neck, where it was originally discovered. Both lungs are filled with suspicious looking nodules. The cancer spread to these areas; physicians are still looking for the place it started. The right lung was collapsed by the pressure of four quarts of fluid that were in his chest cavity when he was taken Friday from the Dallas County jail…. Dr. Barnett said it was impossible to tell how long Ruby had been suffering from cancer and declined even to speculate whether he may have had it when he killed Oswald.” ORIGINATOR : FBI FROM : [No From] TO : [No To] TITLE : [No Title] DATE : 03/17/1967 PAGES : 2 DOCUMENT TYPE : MEMORANDUM.

Parkland Doctors told the press at first that Ruby had “pneumonia” – a common cause of the ascites fluid that drained from his lungs. One report said Ruby was in the X -ray room soon after admission for 45 minutes. The diagnosis was changed the next day to lung cancer. Doctors treating Ruby had strong links to New Orleans, Dr. Alton Ochsner, and Tulane.56 Ruby’s fatal cancer advanced at such a rapid pace after its discovery that it is rather absurd to suggest that his cancer was a slow-growing matter of years. Ruby was described as healthy until his sister, Eva, complained he was looking bad. That was a few weeks before he was admitted to Parkland Hospital. It is possible that Ruby’s illness, could have been caused by an onset of pneumonia in his poorly heated cell, which provided an excuse to bring in “the new doctor from Chicago” to give him “shots.” Dec.15, 1966: David Ferrie is interviewed by Asst. DA John Volz for Garrison. This interview seems to take the place of a subpoena that had been issued by Garrison’s Grand Jury. David tells Volz, among many other things, that he and the boys took shotguns for goose hunting in Galveston (Not mentioned in 1963). I am told Beauboeuf’s friends/relatives in Louisiana had shotguns to borrow. Dave tells Volz they had shotguns when they went looking for geese, first using the ferry and then driving from Texas over into Louisiana. Trouble is, they never stopped on the way to Texas to pick up shotguns, and friends and relatives lived further east. The logistics don’t work. David was probably lying. I suspect he asked Beauboeuf and Coffey to lie about it, too. Bill Davy: …when [Sciambra asked Shaw] where he was at the time of the assassination, he said he was traveling by train, on his way to San Francisco. With the exception of E.

Howard Hunt, just about every American who was alive at the time of the assassination can remember where they were on that fateful day…. [In fact,] Shaw was already in San Francisco at the time of the assassination, in the company of San Francisco Trade Mart Director, J. Monroe Sullivan. After his arrest, Shaw … [said] he was at the St. Francis Hotel at the time of the assassination. Later, under oath at his own trial, Shaw said he was invited to make a speech at the request of Sullivan. Sullivan, to this day, disputes this.58 Shaw told Warren Commission defender James R. Phelan, who wrote for the Saturday Evening Post, that he only had to stay at his desk all day to establish an alibi. But Shaw knew that FBI informants in The Big Easy’s homosexual underground might say anything. We know that Shaw invited himself to speak at a Trade Mart meeting in San Francisco, and that when he was told that JFK had been shot, he showed no reaction and said he wanted to give his speech anyway. n November 1966, when Dave was both a contract pilot for Al I Crouch’s Saturn Aviation and a flight instructor in Crouch’s flight school,59 he found himself in trouble with FAA (a familiar story). Reporters Rosemary James and Jack Wardlaw60 say Crouch fired him, apparently regarding contract pilot assignments. This was at the same time that Tommie Clark moved in with Dave, supposedly to “watch him because he was sick.” But Dave was sick in the fall. This might have been Tommie’s excuse to hide David’s intention to train Tommie to help with his own flight school. Tommie is probably a sex object as well. Dave needs an office at the airport, but nobody wants to rent facilities to him. He tries to use the airport’s restaurant, instead, and gets caught. The FAA dislikes Dave and refuses to give him space in the Administration Building. Briefly, after David’s flying school all but shuts down, he is stressed. He’s been interviewed again, too. All the old fear is beginning again.

Both jobs are located at Lakefront Airport. Bob will be making contract flights for Al Crouch. Arriving from Ecuador around Christmas, they will not have a TV set or even a radio for a while. Of course they are unaware of the Garrison investigation, which still hasn’t reached the papers. Bob is an “instrument pilot” and J.G. works as a secretary. Their little daughter is allowed to play in and around the office and hangar doors on her tricycle. Al Campbell’s former secretary, J.G., says she believes Crouch rid himself of Ferrie because he was “terrified.” Garrison’s investigators had put Ferrie under constant surveillance and were “down at the airport all the time.” Though J.G.’s husband started working for Crouch just before David was fired, and she was working for Campbell in the same airport, J.G. never got a chance to see Ferrie. 4 : 00 pM , Feb. 7, 1967: A training plane owned by Crouch’s Saturn Aviation takes off from Lakefront. Gordon Wade needs a qualifying cross-country flight with a return and landing at 10PM . Ferrie, fired earlier that day, was supposed to have been the pilot, but Crouch asks J.G.’s husband, Bob, to take Dave’s place. The Last Days of David Ferrie: A Witness Speaks Out itness J.

It was soon clear that she was intelligent and sincere. Slowly, she began to reveal her secrets. “It started with Al Crouch – and then there was Allen Campbell,”65 she told me. “I was new there. I and my husband had just come back from Ecuador, and we were out of touch with our country. We didn’t know JFK had been assassinated. We arrived at Christmas, 1966, not long before they killed David Ferrie. Ferrie was working out at the Lakefront Airport. So was my husband, Bob.” “They most definitely did,” she said firmly. J.G. has a soft, gentle voice, the voice of a lady who is comfortable baking pies and typing a letter for her boss. But as the memories crowded in, her voice became tense, and fear threaded her words like a sharp needle dipping in and out of the cloth of her story. “ Allen Campbell was the head of the Bell Helicopter port at the Lakefront Airport,” she told me. The researcher who misquoted her was Joan Mellen, she said. After J.G. had talked to her, Mellen “had gone out there” and talked to Al Campbell. He had gone to school with Lee Oswald, J.G. thought. “He knew who Oswald was,” she added. “He was always hanging around Guy Banister’s office.” I had heard of Al. Al had seen Lee at Banister’s. Just as his brother Dan, Al did investigative work and college campus commie-hunting for Banister. It was similar to what Lee told me he had also done for Banister in the months of April and May 1963. “Ferrie – he took two gay people [pilots] with him, to our terminal,” she went on. “That left Crouch needing a pilot right away. That’s how my husband got hired.” J.G., Bob, and their 3-year-old daughter had only been in New Orleans a couple of months. Dave would complain a day or two later to Al Campbell that, without his job at the airport, what future did he have there? “Just watch,” said Campbell to J.G. “These are David Ferrie’s last days. Pay attention,” he said, “because this is history.” Campbell wasn’t alone in his declarations. Crouch said, “I want you to go down and take a look at David Ferrie, but you’d better hurry. He’ll be dead in a week.” J.G. coughed, and sounded uncomfortable talking about it. “I decided not to meet him,” she said. “I didn’t want to get that close to a man in that kind of danger.

I was worried about my little girl.” J.G. explained her situation. “We were new in town still – no phone, no TV, no car. We had just moved here…” She said they fueled up the plane David Ferrie was supposed to have used – a Cessna – and, her voice breaking, she went on to say that she “waited and waited … I kept watching the clock … I kept waiting and waiting with my little girl, then suddenly, I sat straight up.” She knew, deep inside, that her husband’s plane had crashed. She could feel it. She got her daughter up and they walked toward New Orleans to find somebody with a phone, because the buses weren’t running. “So they called,” she said. “And we found out a farmer saw this plane trying to land, couldn’t hear a motor – it was out of gas – he said he heard it crash in thick woods, where there weren’t any roads. I tried – I called the police,” she went on. “They finally got to it at the crack of dawn through those thick trees and bushes. The plane was hanging upside down. Gordon’s face was ruined by hanging upside down. He had to have his face reconstructed.” As she fell silent, I asked her if she was okay. “Bob had a concussion,” she went on. “There was blood all over him, too.” But no! Stop! You are not to think about conspiracies! There are no conspiracies! Nothing in the Kennedy assassination should suggest anything like that to a rational person. Right? Think again. “All of a sudden,” J.G. says, “I heard a helicopter.” She knew who that had to be. “Here comes Al,” Bob said. But the visit wasn’t a get-well sympathy call. “He looked at Bob and said, ‘We gotta talk.” “Go over and look in my shirt,” Bob told J.G.. The shirt had been removed and set aside. “It was all bloody,” she said. “It was soaked with blood. I went over and looked into the shirt pocket. It was bloodstained, but it was there – the fuel receipt. He and Gordon had fueled up.

David was also giving flying lessons to some CAP cadets.67 Afraid to go home, he now spent most of his time at the airport.68 “He practically moved in,” J. G. says. Dave, she said, was using the airport’s pilot’s lounge, with its storage, showers and rest areas, as a second home. J.G.: “They had this pilot’s rest and overnight area. He was taking a bath in the bathroom, doing his laundry there, eating there, drinking there.” Feb. 14, 1967: Life magazine’s resident investigator in New Orleans, Richard Billings, writes privately on this date that David Ferrie carries a loaded rifle [“David William Ferrie”, Box 4, folder 48]. Stressed and frightened, David keeps the loaded rifle handy when he sleeps at his apartment. Surveillance on Dave’s apartment is being conducted by Life investigators. From their vantage point in a house across the street, they can see portions of David’s living room and front porch. Feb. 15, 1967: David is still giving flying lessons. His friends, however, are withdrawing as the plane crash crisis is exposed as a plot against Ferrie. Al Crouch realizes the end is near. He tells his secretary, “ … go down and look at David Ferrie … you’d better hurry, he’ll be dead in a week,” J.G. said somberly. “I never could bring myself to go take a look at him. And Al was right. David was dead a week later.”69 tucked shirt scorched by unfiltered Camels, his spectacularly lewd humor and his showy way of holding forth on topics like pathology, physics and organic chemistry…. He was a pilot by profession…. His associations were shadowy. There were rumors of mob connections. But there was this grudging consensus around the airport: He could really fly.” (New Orleans Advocate) 70 “I met him at 18, just before he became both dead and famous.

Early into the lessons, Ferrie and his onearmed boss had a falling out. Ferrie left; I collected a partial refund and followed him to protect my investment. Over three or four months in late 1966 and early 1967, we spent 20 or 25 hours squeezed together behind the prop of a tiny single-engine Cessna. In hourly increments over several months we flew repeated touch-and-go landings, or climbed to 2,500 feet over the empty marshes toward Chef Menteur. He taught stalls and spin recovery, crosswind landings, navigation and rudimentary instrument flying … our relationship was commercial. We did not talk politics…. Ferrie had few students, little income and no office. At Lakefront we would meet in the lobby, sometimes have a couple of cups of coffee waiting for the weather to clear. “That’s when he would indulge his blue humor, or launch some disquisition on his amateur research in chemistry or pathology…. I recollect that once, in his persona of unrecognized scientific genius, he disparaged the clinical competence of Dr. Nick Chetta, then the Orleans Parish coroner…. Odd, I thought, that he would single out so minor an officeholder. He said something to the effect that a clever somebody could easily slip something past Chetta…. One day in early 1967, I arrived for a lesson and found Ferrie slumped over a desk, crippled by a blazing headache. He could not fly. He could barely open one eye. I shoveled him into my car. He asked to be taken to his home on Louisiana Avenue Parkway. I got him to the porch and watched him shuffle inside …” Nolan never saw him again. Feb. 17, 1967: The Garrison probe becomes news. An ‘extra’ front page story by reporters Rosemary James, Jack Dempsey and David Snyder exposes Jim Garrison’s investigation into the Kennedy assassination. “Mysterious Trips Cost Large Sums… DA Here Launches Full JFK Death Plot Probe.” James says she showed Garrison the story before Peter Whitmey, who studied Gervais closely, wrote: Upon the death of Jim Garrison in Oct. 1992, Gervais (in a Times-Picayune interview) made no reference to his own lack of credibility, but was quite willing to give his assessment of Jim Garrison: “I cannot say anything but evil about him…He was a menace, and anybody who thinks he was an honest man is insane.” It seems to me that this description more accurately describes Pershing Gervais.72 Friday, Feb. 17, 1967: Distraught, Dave invites reporter David Snyder, one of the three writers who broke the story about Garrison’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:249:d869fbfa7e42", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5599, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 250, "text": "Gervais (in a Times-Picayune interview) made no reference to his own lack of credibility, but was quite willing to give his assessment of Jim Garrison: “I cannot say anything but evil about him…He was a menace, and anybody who thinks he was an honest man is insane.” It seems to me that this description more accurately describes Pershing Gervais.72 Friday, Feb. 17, 1967: Distraught, Dave invites reporter David Snyder, one of the three writers who broke the story about Garrison’s investigation, to his apartment. Anti-Oswald researcher Patricia Lambert says Snyder described David as “physically ill … his voice was barely audible, his breathing unsteady.” On the way up to his second floor apartment, David’s “steps were feeble … he said he had encephalitis … Snyder has no compassion for this sick man: his interview lasts 4% hours, from 6-10:30 pm. Soon after, Sam DePino of channel 12 called. The call lasted about 20 minutes. Feb. 18, 1967: It’s another horrible day for David Ferrie. The Times-Picayune runs a huge front page story: “DAs Won’t Confirm JFK Plot Probe On” revealing David’s name and his statements, all of it penned by David Snyder. Dave is again a notorious figure. He wants to sue somebody. He calls Lou Ivon at Garrison’s office: Ivon says he’ll come over to conduct a fair and factual interview. Meanwhile, Garrison’s staff is busy questioning Dave’s friends, including Dante Marochini, Melvin Coffey and David’s “godson” (addict Morris Brownlee). In the course of his lecture on anatomy and pathology, he named every bone in the human body and every hard and soft muscle … FERRIE said that if the same bullet that struck JFK in the back or neck eventually struck Connally, that Connally or JFK had to be a contortionist. He then rattled off more scientific information in regards to bones and skin and how a bullet decreases in speed when it strikes an object and how the same bullet could not have possibly caused all that damage. FERRIE said that the question would never be answered because the doctor that performed the tracheotomy had 10 thumbs and left unanswered the most important question of all time…” George Lardner, as does Dave Snyder, both claimed later that David Ferrie suddenly changed his mind about the Magic Bullet Theory – that he became a “believer” after studying JFK’s autopsy report more carefully. It was a well-timed change of opinion that Dave might have used in hopes of reducing suspicious, as hinted in the Sciambra interview. tioned by Garrison’s people and the FBI about the assassination. Having been a focus of unwanted attention for weeks, Dave would have read more than “a few books.” He would have read everything he could get his hands on, making sure he was safe.

And he would say only those things that would keep him safe. Stephen Roy (posting as Blackburst): He complained about cancer of the neck, and also about encephalitis. The symptoms of these things are not unlike what one would experience with berry aneurysms, and might be misdiagnosed by an amateur medical person. A “doctor” who diagnoses himself has a fool for a patient… Is Mr. Roy? Yes, a leaking “berry aneurysm” might at first cause a headache, but it will not recur every afternoon on schedule, as reported, for months at a time. Dave had suffered from migraine headaches for decades. Yes, he had some healed “leaks,” reported years later (1992) but not mentioned in the autopsy (they were too small to be seen without a microscope). All good doctors know that high blood pressure can cause small bleeds, and hypertension is listed as one of the causes of Dave’s death. On the other hand, overdosing on Proloid, a thyroid medication, can create a daily recurrence of headaches. Dave was diagnosed as “hypo” long ago. He may have needed Proloid all these years. A little “extra” Proloid packs a feel-good effect. It can fool people. Keep doing it, and it will make you sick. If Dave took Proloid every morning, and the dose was too high, it could create high blood pressure and a headache within hours. Next, neck pain, fatigue and depression can set in. (See Appendix IX). Dave may have been unaware of the connection because a single pill takes 5-6 hours to create such a headache. If he took a handful, his blood pressure would skyrocket in a matter of an hour or two. I, myself, once accidentally overdosed on a similar thyroid medication, and felt the effects within an hour. If David didn’t connect Proloid to his symptoms, if he thought the headache and neck pain might have resulted from an inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), knowing one of our concerns when working with the radiated monkey virus and its cancer was exactly that, he might have thought that exposure to the cancer viruses, exacerbated by his weakened immune system, had given him a case of encephalitis. This would explain why Dave told others that he was afraid he had this condition.

(Note that Lewallen is still not being given the attention he deserves to this very day). In Alcock’s Feb. 20 report, Lewallen said he originally met David in Cleveland in 1948 when David taught flying at Benedictine High School. By 1953 he was in New Orleans and moved in with Dave and two other Eastern Air Line pilots. He worked for EAL, as well. Lewallen lived next door to Clay Shaw at 1309 Dauphine from 1958–64, and became Shaw’s friend. Lewallen made some dubious claims, such as that David Ferrie and Clay Shaw never mentioned each other, and that David Ferrie never mentioned “the Cuban situation” at any time, even though he revealed that through Dave, he met both Layton Martens and Guy Banister. Lewallen said David called him up and asked him to help go through piles of junk, papers and books, in the presence of two FBI agents, seeking something about Lee Oswald among his possessions. But was Lewallen really there as Dave’s friend? They had parted ways six months earlier, when David commandeered his plane one night. The FBI later spoke “briefly” to Lewallen in his car, asking about Dave. Neither agent took any notes. With David safely dead, Lewallen could say anything. But why was Lewallen with the two FBI agents? It might have been vengeful: Lewallen used to room with Dave in 1963 and may have seen some evidence that Lee and Dave knew each other. Of course, Dave would have had to be crazy to keep any evidence of Lee after the assassination. In photos taken in 1967, a framed group photo of Lee with his CAP squadron is no longer on display on the living room wall, along with other CAP group photos. What happened to all the framed photos of Dave’s many cadets?. Sunday, Feb. 19, 1967: One of Garrison’s aides, asked to locate an anti-Castro activist and Mafia man of interest, Eladio del Valle, finds him in a Miami bar. He is a friend of David Ferrie, according to several sources. In three days, del Valle will die – David Ferrie’s death will be in newspapers at the same time.

He said that reporters were pestering him around the clock, and asked Ivon for help in temporarily getting away from them. With Jim Garrison’s permission, Ivon got Ferrie a room at the Fontainebleau Motor Hotel.76 Bill Davy: (interview of Lou Ivon, whom Ferrie called) Ferrie was “very scared – a wild man.” Ferrie confided to Ivon that he had done work for the CIA and had known Oswald. He admitted he knew Clay Shaw and that Shaw, too, worked for the CIA. He added that Shaw hated Kennedy. However, he did not yet admit any involvement in the assassination.77 If David called Ivon because “reporters were pestering him around the clock…” asking “Ivon for help in temporarily getting away from them?” Then, why did he agree to be taken to The Fontainebleau Motor Hotel? Garrison had announced that he would hold his very first press conference at The Fontainebleau the next day, and it was swarming with reporters. This was, in fact, the usual place Garrison’s team housed witnesses. Evening, Feb. 19, 1967: Ivon phones Jim Garrison, who reserves Dave a room in the Fontainebleau. Ivon picks up Dave at a bar, as he is afraid to go home. Garrison witnesses are often brought to this huge hotel for ‘secret’ questioning and to entrap suspects by making hidden tape recordings of their conversations. Trafficante uses this same huge hotel. It is Mafia-friendly, as are all big businesses in the area. Registering David Ferrie under an alias, with the well known Ivon and Loisel at his side, is like trying to smuggle in a rabbit among wolves. As long as Dave is not alone, though, he should be safe. However, that will turn out to be a problem. Stephen Roy (Ed. Forum 2005): More Ferrie history: …Ferrie phones Dave Snyder and tells him that, while he had had some doubts about the WC shooting scenario, he had just resolved it in his own mind [the Magic Bullet Theory]: that the autopsy “slab” distorted the positioning of the wounds. He also tells Snyder that he plans to consult an attorney about suing Jack Martin and Garrison…79 So, did Dave decide to phone Snyder about his change of mind? Yes.

Hoover signs and sends a document from the “Latent Fingerprint Section” (ID Division)to the SAC in San Francisco, with a copy sent to New Orleans, dated December 5, 1963, regarding “five train tickets” from Southern Pacific.(Mellen, A Farewell to Justice, p. 128.) Shaw went by train to San Francisco to speak at J. Monroe Sullivan’s San Francisco World Trade Center on November 22. He traveled from Los Angeles on November 20 to San Francisco. He testified that he took an overnight train run by Southern Pacific (‘The Lark’). 13. Mrs. Mary Banister: (4/29-30/1967) to Sciambra: “… after her husband died Mrs. DELPHINE ROBERTS and her daughter took some files from GUY BANISTER’s apartment and also from GUY BANISTER’s office and turned them over to Mr. G. WRAY GILL … she believes these files were in reference to an investigation concerning DAVID FERRIE and his case with Eastern Airlines … she later on called Mr. GILL and asked him to return these files to her and he did not do so… she also burned some files because she felt, in her opinion, that these files should be destroyed as they might hurt some innocent people…” 20. In Florida, with my B.S. degree in anthropology (including psychology courses, culture studies, linguistics, archaeology, medical anthropology, biology, etc.) after training by the HRS, State of Florida, I was qualified to be a counselor without a degree in psychology. When the law changed a few years later, I still qualified because I was “grandfathered-in” – this was in the 1980’s. 24.

The death certificate recorded death at 11am, but Moore said he was at the hospital at 10am and was told she was already dead. The coroner marked “DOA” in three places. The certificate was made out an astonishing five days after her death. Author Todd C. Elliott (A Rose by Many Other Names) found evidence that Cherami, who worked for Jack Ruby and was a heroin addict, was probably informing to the FBI, who for some reason had a long file on her, but with 1963 references missing.

And that was the last time I ever got to him. Maddox was not the only lawman to suspect that Ruby’s death was not entirely natural … “Bruce McCarty operated an electron microscope at Southwest Medical School near Parkland. He told this author that he was called back to work during the holidays in 1966 to make a study of Ruby’s cancer cells. McCarty explained that there are two types of cancer cells – cilia, which indicate an origin in the respiratory system, and microvilli, which indicate an origin in the digestive system. These cells are difficult to differentiate with a regular microscope, hence the need for his electron microscope. McCarty confirmed that Ruby’s cells were microvilli, indicating his cancer originated in the digestive system. He was shocked when it was announced that Ruby died from lung cancer. Could Ruby have been injected with live cancer cells, which could account for the presence of the microvilli? Traditional medical science claims this is impossible.” [Author: “Jim Marrs wrote this before we met and I was able to explain to him about our project to weaponize cancer and Ruby’s knowledge of our project. As I’ve long said, the original strain came from a pancreatic cancer – not from a lung cancer. This had nothing to do with the cancer injection project in New York where Jewish patients were injected with cancer cells. Those injections were intramuscular I myself had explained to “Sparky” (as I knew him), that the cancer cells, to stay alive, had to be injected into the bloodstream. So Jack Ruby knew what had been done to him.” http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?s60a1083f9146ac226334cf40bcf565&showtopic 18&page : =3 Nov. 2006. Trolls at Education Forum can be easily detected in this discussion, mocking the idea of injected cancer and my witness thereto. Jack Ruby was complaining of injections and said he was told it was cancer (this would make people think Ruby was paranoid, so it was just fine to tell him what he was getting – it would be undetectable and Ruby would be laughed at and accused of being paranoid.).

Forum material retrieved Sept. 5, 2013). Greg Parker argues that the cancer was caused by thallium or beryllium. Neither heavy metal always causes cancer, and usually organ failure from heavy metal poisoning could be expected before cancer would develop. Dr. Ochsner tried to spread the idea that it “wasn’t true” that Jack Ruby had come to Ochsner’s Clinic in 1962 to be treated for rectal cancer, planting the seed of a “prior” cancer firmly in people’s heads. But Ruby would have told doctors he had rectal cancer, if true. There is no whisper of that. He does not complain of headaches and nausea for weeks, as would be the case with heavy metal poisoning. In fact, injection with cancer cells would be easy to “disprove” as “paranoid” because Ruby knew about the experiments done on Jewish patients in New York. 59.

Even the Coroner’s first estimate of time of death wasn’t that early. Dave died before 4 : 00 AM , Feb. 22, but the coroner had to change the time of death to after 4 : 00 AM because of George Lardner’s report that he interviewed David Ferrie between midnight and 4:00 am on the 22nd. avid Ferrie had called Ivon asking for protection, saying he feared for his life. He was taken to the Fontainebleau, where David was interviewed at length. Mr. Roy simply says, “Ferrie does not stay put.” But, why? When Lou Ivon went home to his family and left Dave with just Lynn Loisel, and then Lynn went out “for cigarettes,”1 Dave found himself alone at The Fontainebleau. How long did he wait for Loisel’s return, before he ran? Without Loisel, Dave surely felt vulnerable. He probably spent the night of the 19^(th) at the Lakefront Airport. Broshears (to Dick Russell): “He said he was going to be killed. I said, oh sure, what are you drinking. No, he says, really. I said, why don’t you come out here? He said, ‘I can’t really leave the South. I don’t want to come out there with all those Communists’. That was it. The next thing I knew, he was dead.

As for being a roommate, do we count one night, two, five, or what? Broshears offers unpleasant information, but I cannot dismiss him just because I don’t like the information. He had much to lose by talking about Dave. Hid description of Dave’s activities implicated Lee Oswald in the assassination. Dick Russell: (email, Aug. 22, 2013) Hi Judyth, I believed Broshears, had no reason to think he’d be making this up – and he was VERY nervous during our interview, unsure of how much to say, always a sign that somebody is more likely telling the truth than obfuscating it.* Best wishes, Dick. (More of Russell’s interview with Broshears can be read in end note ).4 To reconcile this, maybe Dave gave Broshears a sanitized version of why he drove to Houston and why he was standing by that payphone at the ice rink. Dave did successfully plant a seed in Broshear’s head that more than one gunman was involved. At the same time he kept up his long-standing pose that he was anti-JFK. After all, there were dangerous “Bishops” out there, such as Jack Martin, Dr. Bryan, and Dr. Jolyon West, who might contact Broshears (also a Bishop).5 Feb. 20, 1967: As Jim Garrison holds his first press conference about his investigation at The Fontainebleau Motel,6 David visits Dr. Bagnetto, his physician, then goes to see FBI’s Regis Kennedy at the FBI office.

He then goes to Broadmoor Pharmacy and picks up a prescription (Is it Proloid?). Next, he encounters and visits an unknown number of people, including Jimmy Johnson, Carlos Bringuier and Orest Pena (who is later beaten up). It’s assumed Dave eats out, as usual.

It’s a busy day for “feeble,” “groaning with every step” David Ferrie. But wait. Dave – a fast reader with interest in the case – would have accessed the 26 volumes many times by now. I suggest David’s fear comes from not knowing what Jim Garrison knows. He pretends bewilderment, but knows Garrison could learn, at any time, about the New Orleans project, his work with Dr. Alton Ochsner, Dr. Mary Sherman, and Lee on the CIA-sponsored kill-Castro cancer project. On May 25, 1967, Juan Valdez will be questioned about Dr. Mary Sherman. A secret report generated by the FBI on May 22,1968, confirms that Garrison planned to arrest Ochsner, a Reily Coffee executive, and others associated with the New Or- How does Mr. Roy know when Dave returned home? And we do not know who found the note. Here’s why: Lardner said he slipped a note under David’s door. Lardner, new in town, only knew about the front door. He didn’t know there was a back entrance when he left the note. At least in 1963, Dave would enter his apartment through the back door, unless he had visitors. The note was photographed on David’s end table, after his death. That part of the photo was later poorly scanned (see note, right). But the positions of things in Dave’s apartment were tampered with. Dave’s rifles, for example, are shown laid out on a chair – that’s not where Dave kept his rifles. The note could have been found at the front door by those entering the front way after Dave died. It could have been laid down inside, so it would not be stepped on, or it could have been planted. These are unlikely scenarios, but we have evidence from Lardner himself that David never called him that night (see below). While Dave, or Lardner, could have picked up the note and brought it inside when Lardner made his supposed midnight visit, I will present evidence from Lardner himself that argues he was never inside that night.

Dave had means and ways to leave New Orleans and even the country.] “FERRIE PHONES SNYDER. AT 11PM, NODA WATCHERS SEE LIGHTS GO OUT AND LEAVE FOR EVENING. BUT FERRIE PHONES LARDNER, WHO COMES OVER AND TALKS TO HIM UNTIL ABOUT 4am, (original in caps). In Mr. Roy’s published chronology, he doesn’t mention that Garrison’s “NODA watchers” said Dave’s lights went out at 11 : 00 pM , apparently soon after Dave called Dave Snyder. Ferrie had asked the DA’s office for protection, but Garrison’s men stopped their surveillance at precisely the time they should have been alert for his safety. It is an unconscionable act, under the circumstances. Their claim of “surveillance” doesn’t hold water for the 22^(nd) , either, since nobody was watching Dave’s apartment when he was found dead late the next morning. Jimmy Johnson had to call Garrison to get his people over there. They arrived soon after the police. Later, Garrison will claim that his men got there first because they were already on the scene. So there was no call inviting Lardner to come over. This is our first clue that something is fishy about Lardner’s account. What reporter would drop by anybody’s home at midnight, without calling first? That’s what Lardner says he did, and I don’t buy it. The other problem is that Dave’s lights were reported off at 11 pM , so why would Dave turn the lights on again? Lardner says the lights were on. Lardner’s interview with Gurvich is surely available to Mr. Roy, since even I have a copy from the Internet, and I live overseas. Anyone can see the discrepancies. David‘s health was broken, but not his spirit. He was assembling people in his defense. He was packing boxes and had asked Jimmy Johnson to help him move them. Was he planning on fleeing?

He was frightened, but not beaten. He was planning a lawsuit against his enemies. Not a plane crash, not Garrison’s pressure, not his poor health, not the pressure of reporters, could combine to make him curl up in a ball, so he was killed. Stephen Roy (2005): He knocks. No answer. He knocks for an additional 3 minutes or so, but still no answer. He peeks in through the missing pane of glass and pushes the curtain outward. He sees Ferrie lying in bed. He calls to him repeatedly but Ferrie…is unresponsive. Worse, Ferrie’s eyes are open. At about 11:50, Johnson runs downstairs to get the landlord, and the two return to break-in the lock on the back door. They quickly determine that Ferrie appears to be deceased in his bed. friend? There are no tears, no expressions of sorrow, from Jimmy or anybody else, in the standing records. But I’ve cried over him. Dave was a tragic figure. Despite his misdeeds, he sincerely tried to conquer his demons. I believed Dave when he said he only pretended to hate JFK after he learned of the treachery of Kennedy’s generals and cabinet members. He gained the trust of some of the most notorious right-wingers, Cuban exiles and military men when they were going after Castro, not Kennedy. Then, when it turned ugly, Dave was able to pass on information to me, and to Lee, from his dangerous position. Having known this man, I’m split in half over him. I steadfastly believe David Ferrie was innocent of conspiracy against Kennedy, and that he helped Lee infiltrate the assassination ring in Dallas. My prayer is: “O God, give rest to David Ferrie’s soul, because so many times, he meant well, and wanted to be a better man. Have mercy on him.” Jack S. Martin, who considered JFK a communist, at one point said, and it rings true because of what he added at the end, that “Ferrie … was pro, pro, pro-Kennedy. He worshiped him like God … he worshiped Kennedy. According to him, the way he preached about Kennedy, he worshiped him like God, and at the same time he [claimed] to be anti-Communist.” Sometime later, a longer, apparently rigged, “farewell letter” is found in a pile of papers in the hall.

This might mean the letter was of immediate and current value to David, rather than having been relegated to a pile of papers in 1961 search: quote Ibid. [Two] submarines were found in a Sept. 22, 1961 search of Ferrie’s house. Also discovered among Ferrie’s effects were: a Morse code key, four model 1903 Springfield rifles, two .22 caliber rifles, one rifle, a flare gun, .38 caliber revolver, a sword, a quantity of ammunition, three maps (of Havana r. Bob Artwohl’s opinion: (from McAdams’ site): “Even if David Ferrie had been forced to ingest Proloid, it could not have been responsible for his death. T4, either taken orally, or injected subcutaneously, will not begin to exert a metabolic effect for about one or two days. T3 acts a little quicker, but will will [sic] not exert an effect until 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. Thus one must assume that whatever goons forced the proloid down Ferries throat, hung around his apartment 6-12 hours waiting for him to die.”13 Dr. Artwohl said, “T3 acts a little quicker, but will…not exert an effect until 6 to 12 HOURS after ingestion.” I disagree entirely, having myself accidentally overdosed on a similar thyroid product. I take a large dose, by the way. With the overdose I experienced, the effect began within an hour, with only four tablets too many, not 93. My heart raced, I counted my pills and realized what I had done. The doctor says it takes 6-12 hours for an effect (but NOT with 93 pills down your throat!). Lardner is the key here. He had motives to be cooperative: his uncle, the famed sportswriter Ring Lardner, had long ago been accused of being a communist. Recently disclosed photos from Ferrie’s autopsy …made public in 1992, show bruises on the inside of Ferrie’s mouth and gums … “perhaps to make him swallow something against his will”… The day before he died, Ferrie purchased 100 thyroid tablets.14 However, when his body was discovered, they were nowhere to be found in his apartment. …[Dr. and coroner]Frank Minyard theorizes that the killers may have mixed the pills into a solution and then forced it down Ferrie’s throat with a tube.

In this regard, it is interesting to note that one of the contusions visible in the autopsy photos of Ferrie’s mouth is on the inside of the lower lip “where the tube may have struck during a struggle”…”15 Stephen Roy (as Blackburst, 2001, ignoring Griffith’s description of the photos, which were posted online since 1995). ”Frank Minyard never examined the body of David Ferrie. All he has to speculate upon are the same autopsy report, the same autopsy photographs I have seen. There is no contusion in the roof of the mouth mentioned in the autopsy report or visible in the photographs.” The autopsy report mentions two areas of damage to the inner lips, including a “lesion in the upper lip…Both areas show no deep hemorrhages or swellings.” A ‘contusion’ is an injury that does not break the skin. A ‘lesion’ is a wound or injury to the skin and might include breakage of the skin. A ‘deep hemorrhage’ is a serious bleed. By using the word ‘hemorrhage’, we cannot exclude a bruise, which did not involve profuse subcutaneous bleeding. Further, Dr. Frank Minyard is a highly experienced Coroner whose task has been, for decades, to rule on four types of death: “natural”, “suicide”, “murder” or “undetermined.” As of this writing (2013) Minyard is still New Orleans’ Coroner, the longest serving of any major city in the US. Dr. Minyard says David Ferrie was murdered.16 His is a professional opinion, after seeing the same photographs of David’s mouth that Mr. Roy viewed. But Mr. Roy says he is correct and the doctor is wrong. James Richards (Education Forum, describing autopsy photos he has seen): Ferrie’s head showed no visible trauma but there was an abrasion of sorts under his top lip. This poor quality image below shows Ferrie during his autopsy and the abrasion being demonstrated (photo link did not work). I am not able to post the actual and very clear series of photographs but one can get the idea here. Obviously it could be theorized that something was forced into Ferrie’s mouth and down his throat.17 Richards was denied permission to show the clear autopsy photos. Why? Why can’t the world see David Ferrie’s autopsy photos? They were once available to the public. We have JFK’s and Lee Oswald’s autopsy photos. Why not David Ferrie’s? We sought copies of these photos from a doctor holding them, without success. Mr. Roy says he has them, but does not share them online.

Feb. 22, 1967: David Talbot (Brothers) says Coroner Chetta received a phone call from Bobby Kennedy to verify that David Ferrie had died, with no foul play involved. Records shows LBJ telephoned Acting Attorney General Ramsey Clark to inform him of Ferrie’s death. An FBI report will later disclose that LBJ was “very concerned about this matter” and wanted full details about Ferrie’s death. Who would have guessed no book would be written about David Ferrie until now? HIM UNTIL ABOUT 4AM… Based on a note found in Ferrie’s apartment, George Lardner is called in for a statement. At about the same time, NODA is taking a statement from Rancier Blaise Ehlinger and Gordon Novel.

Police said del Valle was involved with Santos Trafficante and Miami gambling interests.22 There is some evidence that David Ferrie and del Valle flew some anti-Castro sorties together in the past, though re- Geraci was also interviewed by Weisberg after his father was electrocuted. The young man’s “wrongful death“ has been misreported. Numerous deaths, however, are still classified as “natural” – such as an undue number of heart attacks and sudden cancers, along with a plethora of suicides, murders and ‘accidental deaths” that can no longer be ignored. A competent statistical analysis has been conducted by mathematician Richard Charnin, demonstrating that an overwhelming number of deaths of witnesses in the Kennedy assassination case have occurred passing a trillion-to-one in probability. Feb. 24, 1967: Jim Garrison publicly announces that he has “positively solved the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.” David Franklin Lewis, Jack Martin’s “sidekick” now steps forth. Later, Lewis will be discredited after he is threatened, then shot at, when he lies as to the identity of the shooter. He tries to blame a suspected pro-Castro spy, Carlos Quiroga, when he originally stated in his handwritten notes that he did not know who the driver was, and on this basis, he failed a polygraph. Though Lewis, who was friends with both Lee Oswald and David Ferrie, said far less than he knew, he gave out the right names and places, which would help support the testimonies of later witnesses. His pregnant wife, Anna Lewis, is threatened and harassed. She ceased to live with Lewis after 1967. [] This front page Dutch newspaper article “Moord [Death] of President Kennedy” is typical of the worldwide shock felt after David Ferrie was found dead. David Lewis (left) is shown on same page with George Lardner, (right). Defamation of Lewis began at once, including false accusations. I knew Lewis and his wife, Anna, well. Eventually the Lewis family fled New Orleans, never to return. Here is what Mellen put into print: “… new information is always appearing: for example, I was telephoned after the publication of A Farewell to Justice by a witness who observed the Gurvich brothers in New Orleans at Saturn Aviation, a company run by one Al Crouch, and for whom David Ferrie flew.

The Gurviches took away with them, never to be seen again, the flight record showing Ferrie’s movements. These included a flight Ferrie made to Dallas the week of the assassination. After the assassination, knowing how sensitive they were, Crouch had put Ferrie’s logbooks in a floor safe, and they survived even a break-in. Crouch was threatened, getting an anonymous phone call, saying, “Do you have a little girl about three years old who rides a tricycle?” Then he turned the logbooks over to the brothers Gurvich, one of whom, William Gurvich, had ingratiated himself into the Garrison investigation. Gurvich claimed he would deliver these records to Jim Garrison. Of course, Garrison never saw Ferrie’s log books.25 “My boss, I thought he was going to have a heart attack,” she said. “So, pretty soon, all of a sudden, somebody’s at our door. (at the airport) I saw these two men, dressed in dark suits. I thought they were on our side – agents to protect us from these threats. ‘I’ve been expecting you,’ I told them.” “Yes. When RFK sent Sheridan to talk to Gurvich, that’s how. I didn’t know Gurvich had a brother. But there he was. Gurvich lied. He was going behind Garrison’s back. He told Sheridan to tell RFK that there was no conspiracy. Forget it! And then RFK bad-mouthed Garrison, because he believed Gurvich’s lie. But not long after that, I think Bobby started to realize, maybe he was the one responsible for his brother’s death.” Feb. 23, 1967: US secret agencies and the US government react to Garrison’s investigation with mockery and rumors. Their harassment and defamation of Garrison begins about a week after newspapers break the story. Not that Garrison is lily-white. Both sides will accuse each other of bribery of witnesses in the Clay Shaw trial. Garrison’s office has not given up on seeking more information about David Ferrie. Sgt. Sedsebeer gives Lou Ivon a memo regarding his interview of Roy Tell, former CAP. Tell says David Ferrie told him he “was working for the FBI” when Tell inquired about Lee Oswald and CAP days (Nov. 1963). Asked to name friends, Tell gives a list, among them “OLIVER ST.

And then I read all this material that had come out of [CIA Director Richard] Helm’s office, that in fact what Garrison had said was true. They [CIA agents] were harassing his witnesses, they were intimidating his witnesses.”26 “Give Garrison nothing!” FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover’s directive was sent to FBI field offices a week after Jim Garrison’s investigation became public. In reference to the Special Agent in Charge in New Orleans, Robert Rightmyer, Hoover added: “Tell Rightmyer that I want him and all personnel in New Orleans to keep their mouths shut!” First there was Jack, now there’s Bobby, and then Teddy. We’ll have them on our necks until the year 2000.” – Clyde Tolson (J. Edgar Hoover’s associate director, confidant, and roommate) cited by William Sullivan, The Bureau: My Thirty Years in Hoover’s FBI. (Upon hearing Tolson’s comment, Hoover reportedly nodded in agreement. Note: Sullivan’s book about the FBI was published posthumously after Sullivan was shot dead near his New Hampshire home by a man who mistook him for a deer. February 25, 1967: Perry Russo stands forth. After reading of Ferrie’s death and contacting Jim Garrison’s office, Perry Russo, onetime friend of David Ferrie, who held an ongoing grudge with him later, is interviewed by Andrew Sciambra. He does not mention any conspiracy meeting to “kill Kennedy” at this time. In a later interview, Russo says he was present at David’s apartment when a New Orleans conspiracy meeting about assassinating Kennedy was held, involving Clay Shaw [‘Clay Bertrand’], David Ferrie, and “Leon Oswald.” Russo’s credibility will be questioned due to a failed polygraph test and the use of hypnosis and sodium pentothal by coroner Nicholas Chetta and doctors. However, Russo turned down bribes from Garrison’s enemies and inducements from Garrison. On the basis of Russo’s testimony to the Grand Jury, Clay Shaw will go on trial. Dick Russell: “…Congressman Gerald Ford [Warren Commission]… asked to see Garrison’s information and pass it on to Lyndon Johnson … [Garrison replied] ‘… We’re investigating a conspiracy which appeared to have occurred In New Orleans … if they want to help me, I’ll welcome their help.

A man who taught countless people how to fly, who influenced dozens to become priests or to serve their country in the Armed Services, and whose acts of charity, patriotism and courage were overshadowed by his sexual misbehavior, is buried in near-isolation. David’s body had finally been claimed by his brother, Parmely T. Ferrie, of Rockford, New York.

In 1994, Assistant DA James Alcock, lead prosecutor at the Clay Shaw trial, broke his silence and admitted the truth. Although Garrison specifically named Alcock as one of the assistants in on the decision, Alcock states, “To my knowledge, there was no intent to arrest David Ferrie.”(13) [The source for these statements: 13. Patricia Lambert, False Witness (New York: M. Evans and Co., 1998), p. 65.] But wait! Researchers have found false quotes attributed to Dischler in Lambert’s book. As Jim DiEugenio critiques False Witness, one of his comments about her assertion that Shaw never used the alias ‘Clay Bertrand’ caught my eye as he quotes my longtime friend Edgar Tatro regarding the alias: “…In fact, the number of witnesses in the files who are now on record as stating that Shaw used the alias of Clay Bertrand is well into the double digits. To illustrate just how common this knowledge was in New Orleans at the time, consider this anecdote from Ed Tatro. Tatro was a young college student who decided to go down to New Orleans to watch the Shaw trial in person. One night he visited one of the bistros in the French Quarter. The New Orleans residents noted his Boston accent and asked him what he was there for. When he told them, the residents started giggling. He asked them what was so humorous. The reply was, “Look, everybody down here knows that Shaw uses the name Bertrand.

Disputing the notes as not linked to a suicide (or having feelings of immediate demise, as Mr. Roy claims), Jesse Ventura comments that the letters were typed, did not have signatures and were not dated. Ventura’s inquiry into Dave’s life and death brought him to the conclusion that David Ferrie was murdered. His book, They Killed Our President: 63 Facts That Prove a Conspiracy to Kill JFK, names Fact #39 as “Another Key Witness Conveniently Silenced.” Researcher Dick Russell worked with Ventura to assemble the facts for this conclusion. “… Ferrie predicted his own death,” Ventura notes, adding that Jim Garrison said “… witnesses in this case are bad insurance risks.” 12. Changes in Stephen Roy’s timeline: Roy (2005) “Ten medicine bottles are found on the coffee table in the living room. A police officer finds an envelope taped under a dining table, marked “To be opened in the event of my death”. It contains a “letter of farewell” to a friend [Me: Al Beauboeuf ] and a will, dated July 1966…” Representatives of the coroner’s office arrive at about 12:30 [Author: in 1999 Blackburst says Coroner arrived at 12:45)]…” Stephen Roy (contd): “Ferrie is pronounced dead at 1 : 00 pM . His body is removed at about 2:30 [Author: in 1999, Blackburst says the body is removed at 2:00] …” 16. Memo from Garrison to Alcock, “a bottle of Proloid (with only seven tablets found in it) was found in David Ferrie’s apartment.” The author was sent an email about a 1/31/92 interview of Dr. Minyard with Jim DiEugenio, where “Proloid” and “thyroid pills” seem to have been considered as separate medications, but the scenario is still clear, DiEugenio said “Dr. Minyard considered this a possible scenario for the murder of Ferrie: The thyroid pills [Proloid] [were mixed with some liquid and ] forced down Ferrie’s mouth with a tube, which caused the mouth wounds.” Cuba.

Mar. 1, 1967: A Telex is sent: URGENT BY JOHN LANG ASSOCI-ATED PRESS WRITER NEW ORLEANS, MARCH 1 (AP) – DIST, ATTY. JIM GARRISON ARRESTED WEALTHY CLAY L. SHAW TONIGHT AND ACCUSED HIM OF TAKING PART IN A CON-SPIRACY TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT JOHN F, KENNEDY. SHAW, A RETIRED EXECUTIVE, WAS BOOKED ON “CONSPIRA-CY TO COMMIT MURDER” AND RELEASED ON $10,000 BOND. In his Penthouse interview with James Phelan, Clay Shaw said something odd. He said, “Walter Sheridan … came down and told me there was a rumor in town that I was ‘Clay Bertrand,’ I told him this was silly and ridiculous, that I had never been ‘Clay Bertrand’.” But wait. Instead of saying, “I never called myself ‘Clay Bertrand’” Shaw said, “I had never been” Clay Bertrand. This linguistic slip suggests Shaw probably did use aliases. Clay Shaw (to Phelan): I went out to the DA’s office with a perfectly clear conscience, I didn’t take a lawyer with me…. Finally they began to question me about David Ferrie … I told them I didn’t know Ferrie and had never been to his place. Then suddenly they said: “What would you say if we said we had three witnesses proving that you have been there?” I told them that their witnesses were either mistaken or they were lying. At this point it was suggested that I take a lie-detector test. I said: “Certainly not. Why on earth should I take a lie-detector test?” They told me ‘”If you don’t take a lie-detector test, we’re going to charge you with conspiring to kill the President of the United States.” To put it mildly, I was stunned. Anthony Summers (how CIA Reacts to Shaw’s arrest): Victor Marchetti [former special assistant to CIA Director Richard Helms] told me that he observed consternation on the part of then CIA Director Richard Helms and other senior officials when Ferrie’s name was first publicly linked with the assassination in 1967. Marchetti claimed he asked a colleague about this and was told that “Ferrie had been a contract agent to the Agency in the early sixties and had been involved in some of the Cuban activities.” (Summers, Not in Your Lifetime) Mar. 1967: Clay Shaw’s association with CIA-linked Permindex, first located in Rome, then in Switzerland, then in South Africa, is revealed by Italian newspaper Paese Sera. “Paese Sera wondered,” wrote Joan Mellen, “about Shaw’s leaving the United States", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:273:3de4c9a54b17", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5623, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 274, "text": "in 1967.

Night, Mar. 1, 1967: Shaw’s home at 1313 Dauphine is searched. While downstairs there is much elegance, upstairs in Shaw’s bedroom big hooks, leather straps and chains hang from the ceiling, which has bloody handprints. A black cape, whips, a chain and other paraphernalia are found in a closet. [Note: Mardi Gras was Feb. 7, 1967, providing an excuse for the costumes, but Shaw’s sado-masochism cannot be hidden]. Mar. 5, 1967: Clay Shaw’s former secretary, Aura Lee, after hearing on television that Shaw denied knowing David Ferrie, tells Dr. Charles B. Moore and others (including an FBI informant) that Ferrie was often seen in Clay Shaw’s office at the Trade Mart, and she believes Ferrie had privileged access there.4 March 8, 1967: Two weeks after his FBI interview, the day after Dave died, Archbishop Carl John Stanley dies from a heart attack at the age of 64 in Louisville, Kentucky. His death comes at the same time the FBI report is published. He will be canonized by the Byzantine Catholic Church, to which he also belongs. Peter Levenda: At one time, there were as many as four “bishops” [in] Guy Banister’s Camp Street office … virtually all of his investigators, from David Ferrie and Jack Martin to Thomas Beckham and the lawyer Thomas Jude Baumler. Beckham was a bishop with the Universal Life Church … [as was] Raymond Broshears … later with one of the Orthodox sects with lines to Stanley…. In addition, Ferrie, Martin, Beckham, Broshears and Baumler all shared the same apostolic succession: that of Bishop Earl Anglin James in Canada … and of Bishop Carl Stanley of the American Orthodox Catholic Church.5 Speculations: Some say Bryan taught David Ferrie hypnotism. He may have hypnotized Sirhan Sirhan (who shot wildly at Bobby Kennedy from the front, as a patsy, while RFK’s actual assassin shot from behind, a fatal wound behind the ear). It is also suggested that Arthur Bremer, who shot Gov. George Wallace, may have been programmed by Bryan.6 (Jan. 29, 1965): Jack S.

The much-maligned Jack Martin, condemned for heavy drinking and labeled so disreputable that, for some, his statements are deemed worthless, but in 1965 he continued to show some mettle. He is a business partner with lawyer-Bishop-politician Thomas Jude Baumler. Though the name of this organization reeks of fraud, and neither man is qualified to do psychoanalysis, Dr. William Bryan is a psychoanalyst with CIA, into mind control. All three men are Bishops in the same inter-related sects, which keep getting involved in clandestine activities. David Ferrie is still advertising himself as a psychologist. The company may be a front to lure candidates for CIA-sponsored experiments. Fred Lee Crisman, whose UFO experiences have been monumentalized in the Maury Island Affair, is a Bishop via Stanley, too. His link to Dave’s friend Raymond Broshears was through the same Universal Life Church.7 Crisman could not be trusted. Broshears was in contact with Crisman and/or Bryan, which could influence what information Dave had given Broshears before he died. Tommie Clark is a frightened young man. He brings up Dave’s illness to change the subject. He abandoned Dave the same day Dave was fired and the plane Dave was scheduled to fly was sabotaged to crash. Did Dave suddenly get “well” so Tommie could leave? Tommie fled, as a rat would from a sinking ship. March 15, 1967: The FBI ignores a good lead: “Carroll S. Thomas, owner of Thomas Funeral Homes, Inc. in Hammond, Louisiana … volunteered that he was a close personal friend of Clay Shaw, and that he’d met David Ferrie through Shaw. Thomas’ claim remains unsubstantiated; it is not known whether he actually was friendly with Clay Shaw or not.(FBI NO 89-69-1781) But Thomas was in charge of Clay Shaw’s father’s funeral. That was in the newspapers and could have been easily discovered by the FBI. Shaw and Thomas had been friends for years. Time after time, FBI fails to “substantiate” witness statements, lest they accumulate the wrong kind of evidence. No effort was made to interview any of Thomas’ associates. Thomas would be one of the few persons who would attend Clay Shaw’s funeral. March 16, 1967: Gordon Novel is briefly questioned by Garrison’s Grand Jury. He’s a convicted car-jacker who some say “has to cooperate” with the CIA. But Novel, is also an electronics and bugging expert connected to Banister, a participant in the Houma Schlumberger raid with David Ferrie, Arcacha Smith, Layton Martens, and others.

He sells his share of a restaurant business in New Orleans and flees to Columbus, Ohio to avoid serious questioning by Garrison’s Grand Jury. The governor is persuaded to refuse to extradite Novel after Novel (1) visits CIA headquarters (2) Novel posts bond. Next, Novel “begins a national and international junket denouncing Jim Garrison from Columbus, Ohio, McLean, Virginia, and Montreal, Canada – sidestepping Garrison’s efforts to extradite him.”9 Mar. 30, 1967: George Piazza II dies in a flaming crash that kills nineteen people. Piazza was “… counsel for James Lewallen, a former roommate of David W. Ferrie, the man Garrison alleges was part of an assassination conspiracy here. Piazza was both a lawyer and a pilot. There were no signs or calls of distress from the plane before the crash. The night was balmy with a nearly full moon.”10 New Orleans, La. (AP) – “A DC8 jet flying a practice landing pattern cut a swath of destruction through a residential area near New Orleans International Airport early Thursday and exploded in a fiery crash into the rear of the Hilton Inn, killing 18 persons…. On board the Delta Air Line jet were five pilots and an inspector for the Federal Aviation Agency. All were killed…. The big jet had been in the air only 9 minutes.” April 3, 1967: Sergio Arcacha Smith, formerly of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) and manager of an air conditioner firm in Dallas, is arrested at his home in front of his family by officers sent from Jim Garrison’s office. They demand that Arcacha speak with them alone, without an attorney present. After posting $1, 500 bail, Arcacha is released. Garrison will seek to extradite Arcacha from Texas to Louisiana (without success, blocked by Gov. John Connally).

April 3, 1967: Jim Garrison calls a press conference to announce that he has identified the men involved in the conspiracy to assassinate JFK. Garrison says that most of the participants “are in Texas and Dallas particularly where they are protected – one, by the Dallas law enforcement establishment and two, by the federal government.” April 1967: Orestes Pena is beaten, then sued, by Carlos Bringuier. Orestes Pena was David Ferrie’s friend. Not long after David’s death, Pena was beaten up at one of the three bars he owned and was hospitalized, just after agreeing to meet an investigator from another state. Pena had said he saw Lee Oswald with FBI SAC Warren DeBrueys. Author/researcher Harold Weisberg12 tells Garrison’s Grand Jury: Pena also said he had attended “meetings including Arcacha, Ferrie and Warren DeBrueys,” and “indicated Ferrie had other associates under federal employment.” When Pena left the Cuban Revolutionary Front, he said he began to have trouble with DeBrueys. After investigator Harold Weisberg reported on what Pena told him and the Warren Commission, Carlos Bringuier filed a $350, 000 civil suit against Pena, claiming Pena gave “slanderous and defamatory testimony” before the Warren Commission, portraying Bringuier as “an enemy and traitor to the United States, a Castro sympathizer and vulgar opportunist.” Weisberg’s article was in the April issue of Saga Magazine. when Oswald got murdered – a remarkable coincidence, gentlemen…. Warren DeBrueys from the time of his first attendance at the Cuban organizational meetings had Pena as an informer … when things begin to get close with Cubans who might be involved or were with Oswald…. They don’t want to know their names … like the Cuban who walked out of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City with Oswald. There is no way to see what he looked like – they sent the wrong picture up.” Sept. 18, 1967: Edward James “Jim” Whalen, who has mental problems, is interviewed by DA James Alcock. Whalen is a career criminal and possibly a hitman, but his take is too wild to be fully truthful. According to Whalen, he was offered a large sum by David Ferrie and Clay Shaw to kill Jim Garrison in “Feb. or March of 1963.” An out-of-towner, he correctly described the suspects and Dean Andrews, as well, but the scenario smacks of somebody hoping to get a reduced prison sentence based on rumors heard in New Orleans’ underbelly.

[F.B.I. #346-8982] Oct. 1967: Playboy interviews Jim Garrison, with a long introduction that presents a balanced account of Garrison’s past, his embattled status at present, and his determination to continue his investigation into the Kennedy assassination. The interview conducted by Eric Norden took 12 hours. Garrison was allowed to propose the list of questions asked.15 Nov. 1967: MacLean’s, a Canadian magazine, runs a story by Jon Ruddy about the Winnipeg airport incident, saying Garrison confirmed that Ferrie had been in Winnipeg at the time. (In late September witness Richard Giesbrecht agreed tentatively to testify at Shaw trial. Now he will refuse to do so, after being threatened.) Nov. 14, 1967: Garrison’s speech in Los Angeles attacks LBJ as the one person who has to be responsible for the cover-up. He discusses the symptoms of fascism, the government’s attitude that it has the right to lie, and that if it can feel it’s OK to lie it can feel it’s OK to murder. He claims the make-up of the Warren Commission indicates it was chosen mainly to protect CIA, and that Warren was named to charm the liberals. He says Ferrie had high blood pressure and killed himself with an overdose of Proloid. LA Free Press, 11/17/67. April 24, 1968: A confidential source advises the New Orleans FBI on April 24, 1968, that New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison believed: “Dr. Alton Ochsner was involved in the Kennedy assassination conspiracy. According to the source, Garrison bases his belief on the fact that Dr. Ochsner was closely involved with the Cuban element in New Orleans prior to Kennedy’s assassination.” Kennedy, has just won the California primary in his bid to obtain the Democrat Party’s nomination for President when he is suddenly shot down. The deed occurs at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Though RFK was killed by a bullet that struck him behind his ear, Sirhan Sirhan, wildly shooting from the front, will be the only person arrested and accused. Essential evidence is hauled off by LA police and never seen again. Most boxes of major evidence and witness testimonies will later be destroyed “due to the need for more storage space.” Jan. 1969: Witness Richard Giesbrecht, who says he has said enough, and people are dying, will not testify in the Clay Shaw trial.

Jan. 1969: Henry Delaune, brother-in-law of coroner Dr. Nicholas Chetta, is murdered. As was the case with Guy Banister, David Ferrie and Dr. Mary Sherman, Henry DeLaune’s body is found naked. The Times-Picayune. “New Orleans Henry M. Delaune Slain – Teacher Is Remembered. Friends Recall Peaceful, Softspoken Man “His friends remembered him as a peaceful man who seldom raised his voice. None would have expected Henry M. Delaune, an English teacher at Thibodaux’s Nicholls State College, to meet a violent death. But his nude body, its chest punctured by two bullet wounds, was found in the apartment building at 828 Burgundy, which he owned and where he lived. By Monday afternoon homicide detectives had questioned many persons, but still had no suspects…”18 Johnson described a meeting involving Jack Ruby, Clay Shaw and “Leon” whom he later identified as Lee Oswald, but why he would be invited to such an important meeting remains unexplained. However, Johnson was yet another “Reverend” with ties to David Ferrie, typically offering suspicious information.19 1. Lie detector tests are used when a suspect is thought to be lying. Shaw was right to refuse, because to the public, taking a lie detector test means important people must doubt your statements. The use of an alias is another matter. It is used to obscure one’s identity for a purpose. I used “Avary Baker” as my name in Louisiana to hide my original identity as “Judy Vary Baker” to protect myself when I returned to live in Louisiana. 3. FBI’s 3rd-in-command, C. DeLoach sends a memo to 2nd-in-command Clyde Tolson that the Attorney General “asked whether the FBI knew anything about Shaw.

I’m interested in the incident not because I believe there is enough evidence to decide if David Ferrie was there or not, but because of the exchange about the incident between Robert Harris and Stephen Roy (Blackburst), which illustrates how an error or a deliberate obfuscation can influence a debate about Ferrie. On April 27, 2010 11:49 pm an exchange commenced between Robert Harris and Stephen Roy (as Blackburst):about the Winnipeg Airport Incident (described elsewhere in this book, but in great detail online by researcher Peter Whitmey, at http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/winnipeg.htm. ) By far, the most powerful indictment of David Ferrie was his identification by a fellow named, Giesbrecht, in Winnipeg, Ontario. For years, [Blackburst –Roy] told people that Ferrie was at his uncle’s funeral on the day that he was allegedly spotted at the Winnipeg airport, but during our discussion on that, I made a phone call to the Cleveland Plain Dealer and confirmed that the funeral was not Feb. 13th, but on the 14th, which means that Ferrie was at the airport at precisely the right time to catch a plane to Cleveland to be at the funeral the next day, and even attend the open casket showing that evening. David[Blackburst-Roy replied, “I stand corrected. I was working from rough notes and memory, and got the date wrong. David [Blackburst-Roy] also claims that he has spoken to one of Ferrie’s associates who told him that he drove Ferrie to Cleveland that day, but he refuses to divulge the man’s name or even his story. He even states that he made no effort to take notes or record his conversation with this guy, which is a strange way to research a book, IMHO. But he did say that he would contact the man for permission and then report back. That was about 7 months ago and he hasn’t said a word. For those who are unfamiliar with this issue, Giesbrecht, who was an extremely credible witness, which even[Blackburst-Roy] has admitted, overheard a conversation among several men at the airport in Winnipeg, in which a man with the “oddest eyebrows” (he also called them “streaky”) he had even seen, was going on about his fears that Oswald told his wife about the conspiracy and that she would tell the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:280:0812bee3a3fd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5630, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/David-Ferrie-Participant-Anti-Castro-Assassination/dp/1937584542", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 281, "text": "back.

He also stated that he believed that at least two of the men, including the one he later identified as Ferrie, were homosexuals. Giesbrecht had no idea who the men were, until two years later, when he saw a photo of Ferrie in the newspapers and immediately identified him. So, not only did DAVID [Blackburst-Roy] “alibi” for Ferrie fall apart, but the man Giesbrecht identified as Ferrie was in exactly the place he needed to be, to catch a flight to Cleveland in plenty of time to attend the viewing of the body that night, as well as the funeral the next day. Interestingly, he also heard Ferrie say that he “wondered why he got involved with someone so ‘psycho’ as Oswald.” That’s exactly how Marcello described Oswald when he told an FBI informant that Ferrie introduced him to the alleged assassin, at a meeting at his brother’s restaurant. The Giesbrecht incident is probably the most underrated issue in the JFK case. Because of Ferrie’s unique physical appearance, it amounts to rock solid proof of conspiracy.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DavidFerrie_IPG_cleaned.txt:281:1962fad4b01c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5631, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DO0007IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Dorothy-Amoral-Dangerous-Woman-Watergates/dp/1634240375", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DO0007IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Hunt would also implicate Cord Meyer, David Phillips, Frank Sturgis, David Morales, Antonio Veciana, William Harvey, and Lucien Sarti.

The wind made a faint whistling sound on the branches of the trees that stood like arms with bony fingers outstretched into the blackness of the sky. It was just 11:00 p.m. and there was not a soul around. Dorothy had driven by herself on this dark foreboding night.

After saying good night to them, she quickly and quietly slipped out of the house and under this witches moon started her car and let it coast down the long gravel driveway that led from the house to River Road. She drove through the veil of darkness and cloaked in fright, she waited alone in her car, by the only phone booth in the now deserted little village of Potomac, Maryland. During the day Potomac was the essence of upper middle class society. A bright cheery village with a small shopping center, post office, a Catholic church and boutique. The town was affluent without being gaudy, manicured without being stuffy and inhabited by people of wealth. It was sparsely populated, mostly large rambling houses with horse breeding ranches and lots and lots of open space to ride and yet was only an hour from the center of political power, media manipulation and the inner sanctum of all things powerful in Washington D.C. Those that lived here were either city folk riding horses on weekends, or riding folk working highly specialized government careers during the week. Washington was just across the Potomac River from Langley in northern Virginia where the CIA maintained it’s headquarters. Northern Virginia also boasted the Pentagon; nerve center of all things military. Within just a short drive from the city center of Washington D.C., one could find all the brightly lit buildings that tourists from around the world came to stand before … stand in awe of the power and history in the capitol city of the most powerful nation in the world. The Capitol building, the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, the United States Senate and Congress, and the White House. This surely was the center of all that is good and right and moral in the world. Potomac, Maryland is located in Montgomery County just an hour north east of Washington DC. In 2013, it held the title of most affluent town in all of the United States based on median house income. Potomac is also seventh most highly-educated American small towns according to Forbes. But in 1972, Potomac was a town not yet on the public map of celebrity sightseeing. It was more of a well kept secret. A town that kept secrets. A town with secrets to keep.

Dorothy was ready to bargain, to negotiate. She thought for a moment, “How had it come to this?’ She knew well the answer and she silently cursed her husband Howard; E. Howard Hunt. In his selfish and vain attempts to live as if he were one of the heroes in his spy novels he had gambled everything and lost. No amount of reason could persuade him of the futility of his acts. The arguments, the fighting, the affairs she had caught him in. She had made up her mind several months ago that upon her return from Europe that summer, she would divorce him. But now she was trapped and it was too late to do anything else but clean up his dirty mess and protect her family. Dorothy had played these “games” before, years ago. But now she was playing the most dangerous game she had ever played; blackmailing the President of the United States. This is what brought her to the Crossroads, where River Road and Great Falls Road intersect and where Dorothy Hunt now waited for the Devil. Alone in her 1970 Monte Carlo she waited. It was now 11:01 p.m. and as she rolled down the drivers side window she thought she heard something moving in the dark. She stopped breathing. In the dark car she was completely still … as if she were dead. With the greatest control she let her breath out slowly, calculating just how much she would need to breath out before she breathed in again. And then like a flash in her mind, she saw how this scene might play out. The dull sound of a silenced 9mm and the sickening feeling of blood seeping out. She saw herself slumped over in the front seat of her blood stained car, smoke from the gun barrel whose discharge had penetrated the side of her face, dancing in the air before it simply disappeared. Dorothy let her breath out slowly, trying not to allow any mist being seen. She reached down and felt the reassurance of her .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol. As she curled her fingers around the pearl inlaid handle, she breathed in, quietly, slowly, deliberately. She expelled her breath and drew the pistol from her coat. Without barely a sound she drew back the slide and felt the magazine push a round into the firing chamber. She slipped down onto the seat, away from view, away from sight.

Dorothy’s parents were Albert Charles Wetzel (1891-1954) and Jeannette Adams (1891-1961). Dorothy’s paternal grandparents were Anthony Joseph Wetzel (1867-1912) and Mary Therese Kochendorfer (1870-1952). Dorothy’s maternal grandparents were Ella E. Chambers (1865-1940) and Benjamin F Adams (1865-1940), a dentist. Following some time spent in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Wetzel family traveled to Ohio and settled along the Miami River. At the time Ohio was one of the farthest lands settled in the West and had been populated by a variety of Indian tribes. The American colonization of Ohio didn’t start until after the Revolutionary War and at various times prior, the area was under French control. During the Civil War, Ohio was on the Union side and was deeply anti slavery. The wave of German immigrants started in the mid-1800’s and continued for many years. Many of Ohio’s wealthiest citizens were German/American and founded such giants of businesses as Goodyear Rubber, Procter and Gamble, and Macy’s. Dorothy always maintained that she had American Indian blood, and that there was a connection with a tribe of Oglala Sioux and Crazy Horse. It was something, she said that was rarely discussed when she was growing up and it still remains unclear. What was Dorothy’s true family lineage? Was she really part Sioux? She told me she was, and showed me a pair of very old and worn moccasins, which she claimed came from Black Shawl, Crazy Horse’s second wife. I still have those beautifully beaded moccasins and I remember the day when I was 12 and Dorothy gave them to me along with a book about Crazy Horse written by Mary Sandoz called Crazy Horse, Strange Man of the Oglalas. On the inner flap of the book cover she signed it to me with these words “to my little Indian, Saint John.” When I was 14 she and I fashioned a Sioux ceremonial shirt for me. She hand stitched it out of heavy muslin, and we both decorated it with horse hair fringe, beaded strips down both arms, and rabbit fur strips hanging down the back. She called it my warrior shirt. I still have it and remember well how she was so proud when I put it on for the first time. She encouraged my interest in all things Indian. We taught each other to speak a few phrases in Sioux.

She was rambunctious at times but was never a “bad” girl. She was sent to the principal’s office and disciplined for arguing with a teacher once. She always rooted for the underdog. She never spoke, as many of her peers did, using racial slurs and had no prejudices towards anyone; Jews, Indians, Blacks or whatever. Jeanette and Dorothy Wetzel living in an apartment in the heart of downtown San Francisco. It shows that they lived in #17 on Valencia street and that Jeanette was a cashier at San Francisco General Hospital. They may have moved back to Dayton at some point although my records search has produced little information on this period. Photographs have emerged showing Dorothy in Ohio in 1935 when she was 15. She may have spent a few years in San Francisco and then moved back to Ohio by 1935. By the time Dorothy reached high school age, she showed an interest in world affairs that set her apart from most of the other girls in her class. They were looking for a way in, into marriage, into children, into middle class security. Dorothy was looking for a way out, out of a dull life, out of wherever she was, and out into the world. It may very well be that the move to San Francisco at such an impressionable age and then back to small town Ohio, was the catalyst that set her on her path of seeking adventure, intrigue and danger. Dorothy wasn’t yet 16 when she first started developing the features which would come to define her physical looks. Her dark brown almost black hair came to a perfect widows peak above the largest most beautiful almond shaped eyes. Her nose was perfectly shaped with a hint of nobility and exotically high cheek bones that gave a hint of her Sioux Indian heritage. She was an only child and by all accounts a well mannered introspective child until she realized that the world was bigger than her town, bigger than her state and she wanted to be a part of it. The wide eyed beauty of Dorothy was becoming apparent and the world was calling. Dorothy would answer that call.

Dorothy would have been 15 when she and her mother moved back to Ohio. What happened then is completely unknown to me. In Tad Szulc’s 1974 book Compulsive Spy, he states on page 64 that from the age of three she lived with her uncle and aunt because her parents had divorced and her mother evidently could not afford to take care of a young child. In another photograph I found of Dorothy sitting, a radiant beauty, with what appears to be a cocktail at her table. Her corsage tells me that it could be a college soirée although the people in the background don’t appear to be nearly as glamorous. There is much mystery surrounding Dorothy Wetzel and what details are available to those willing to search, were written by people that never knew her. There are many parts to a person’s life, and even though she was my Mother, there are many things about her that I will never know. If she were drinking a cocktail, she may have been twenty one. It is more than evident that between 1935 when Dorothy was 15, and 1941 when I believe the picture was taken, she transformed herself from a gangly midwestern girl into a self assured woman ready to take on the world. Her look was exotic to say the least. I do know that she attended college in Ohio, and by 1945 she was a woman with a ferocious sense of purpose. That sense of purpose included travel and with the War going in full swing, she joined the Treasury Department, Hidden Assets Division. Dorothy’s first posting was to Bern, Switzerland. n 1944 Bern was the center for Intelligence gathering for the Office of Strategic Service, the wartime predecessor of the CIA. Switzerland was neutral during World War II and as such made it the buffer for countries wanting to do business with Nazis. By 1944 when Dorothy was stationed in Bern, it was clear that the war was coming to an end. As Allied troops made their way to Berlin, the amount of gold looted from countries that had fallen to Hitler’s war machine was at an all time high with over 440 million dollars in gold bullion pouring into Swiss bank accounts.

The ovens and wholesale slaughter at the death camps were working 24 hours a day and as much as 316 million dollars had been taken directly from the death camps in the form of pocket watches, jewelry, and gold teeth. With a seemingly endless supply of victims the death camps had become a huge source of wealth for the Nazis. These items were confiscated from the prisoners and then melted down at the Reichsbank in Berlin and turned into gold bars, which were then deposited into protected accounts from which the Nazi war machine would use to buy supplies. It is my speculation, since we know that Dorothy was stationed in Bern and worked for the Treasury Department’s Hidden Assets, that she was more than likely to have been involved in Operation Safe Haven. In addition there have been some writers and publications that have stated that Dorothy was in fact CIA although in 1944 the CIA hadn’t yet been created and would not be until 1947 the OSS did have a strong presence in Bern, and Dorothy may have worked for them at that time. At the very least it is well documented that Bern, Operation Safe Haven was a joint undertaking by the State Department and the Treasury Department to track down and block the flow of Nazi assets in neutral and nonbelligerent counties throughout Europe and the Americas. The fear was that German political and economic leaders, sensing defeat, would act to transfer huge blocs of industrial and fiscal capital to neutral countries thereby escaping confiscation and reparations by Allied forces. By extension it was feared that if Nazi assets were not found and held, it was very likely that Germany would rebuild and start a Fourth Reich within 20 years. WW III? It was a real fear. In any event, the overriding goal of Safe Haven was to prevent Germany from ever starting another war. The immediate goals were to restrict German economic penetration outside the borders of the Reich, to stop Germany from hiding assets in neutral countries, to make sure that German assets would be available for post war reparations and the rebuilding of Europe, and finally to prevent the escape of the Nazi ruling elite who had been marked as war criminals. In August and September of 1944, instructions were sent out to various State and Treasury Departments to implement these objectives.

In August and September of 1944, instructions were sent out to various State and Treasury Departments to implement these objectives. Almost immediately there waged a bureaucratic battle between State and Treasury as to how best to follow the directives. This fight for control of Safe Haven ultimately led to its next and most important phase: centralize intelligence and data collecting under one power. It was to this end that the OSS was formally invited to oversee Safe Haven. Dorothy’s participation in Safe Haven would have been under the umbrella of the OSS, and her duties would be subject to OSS directives. Within the OSS, Safe Haven fell under the control of the Secret Intelligence (SI) Branch which was responsible for gathering intelligence from clandestine sources inside neutral and German occupied Europe. Safe Haven became part of the OSS SI branch, and by default another branch of OSS, the counter-intelligence or X-2 division. From this point on, Safe Haven was a joint operation of the SI and X-2 branches of OSS. It was a perfect merger, away from bureaucratic infighting between State and Treasury, towards clandestine secret operations placed under a wartime spy apparatus Office of Strategic Service. Dorothy was moving up and deeper into the world of covert intelligence: spying. I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore. In 1945 Bern, the Chief of OSS was Allen Dulles. Dulles was to become the Director of Central Intelligence (CIA) in 1953-1962. It is safe to say that Safe Haven was one of the many operations under the watchful eye of Dulles. There have been many articles and books written about Allen Dulles, some of them showing his patriotism and others showing his favoritism for his “old boy” network of contacts in the Swiss banking elite. It has been shown that Dulles may have steered intelligence investigations away from some of his cronies who may have otherwise been prosecuted under Safe Haven guidelines. As this book is not an examination of Dulles’ character, or of his innumerable merits as an intelligence master, I will refrain from further discussion of such a fascinating topic. My interest in Dulles is merely to weave a traceable storyline concerning Dorothy’s ever deepening involvement in the world of covert intelligence. There is no doubt in my mind that Dulles would have crossed paths with one of his most beautiful assets. While in Bern , Dorothy’s work continued in the search for hidden Nazi assets, until a most unusual cable was received by her office shifting manpower and resources in an entirely new direction.

In 1946 the State Department received a secret report from a Treasury agent named Emerson Bigelow that a highly reliable source had information that in 1945 the Vatican (yes, the Vatican), had confiscated 350 million Swiss francs in Nazi gold for “safe keeping.” The gold had been kept in secret numbered Vatican accounts in Swiss banks and then moved to Vatican City banks owned by the Vatican. It was additionally stated that a large percentage of this Vatican gold had been obtained at the death camps. The document finally declassified in 1996 and released in 1997 was called the Bigelow Report. There is no doubt that the OSS and specifically the office where Dorothy worked was the source for this top secret report and sent it over to the State Department. Spying has always relied on the talents of its most beautiful women, and Dorothy understood her part in this cat and mouse game. The game was to make the mouse think he was the cat when all the time it was Dorothy who had the sharpest claws. She was no mouse. She was ferocious. This game of sexual manipulation could be at times dangerous but always thrilling. The danger came from many areas. How intoxicated could she get her “target” and still obtain useful information from him? What would she do under circumstances whose only avenue was allowing a sexual conquest? Would she surrender? Was her target a spy trying to elicit information from her? Was he a killer? Was she being recorded or filmed? This was not an uncommon tool used to manipulate agents on either side into becoming double agents or moles. She obtained her .25 cal semi automatic pistol while she was in Bern and told me she kept it within reach during these midnight trysts. All over America women were doing everything they could in support of the Allies. Here in Bern she was doing her part as well. The difference in her mind was that she was closer to the danger, closer to the excitement … it was, she would say to me many years later, intoxicating. This would have been quite a major adjustment to most girls from Ohio, but Dorothy was drawn to it. She was driven by it and this was just the beginning.

She felt, like most spies I suppose, a sense that what they were doing was belonging to a world that transcended normal boundaries of morality and legality. But years later, it would be these exact notions that would bring about the downfall of her life and the office of the President. But for now, the feeling she had about these early years, she would say, was that it was part of her induction in this secretive and glamorous world. In the course of her duties at Herrengasse she had met the man in charge of all things: Allen Dulles. In early 1946 she heard that Treasury was opening a new foreign office. They were looking for employees with an eye towards adventure. That was Dorothy. She put in her request and in the fall was notified that she had been accepted for inclusion into the new foreign office in Shanghai, China. China, the Great Wall, and forbidden cities. She was thrilled about her move to China. Dorothy phoned her mother Jeanette and told her of this marvelous opportunity! Having known her mother whom I affectionately called “Gaga,” I know how she would have felt about her daughter’s insatiable desire for travel. “Why won’t that girl stay at home and find a proper husband?” she must have thought. However unconventional Jeannette thought of her daughter, it is without question that she was proud of Dorothy. After all, Dorothy grew up without ever having known her father. In Jeanette’s time it was equally as brave for her to move to San Francisco with little Dorothy and make a go of it as a single parent. Shanghai sits at the mouth of the Yangtze River delta on the eastern side of China. Following the British victory in the first forced to allow the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement. During World War II, Japan invaded China and specifically it’s most prosperous cities on the coast. Shanghai and Nanking were hard hit by the Japanese and they committed great atrocities in the city of Nanking. This was known as “the rape of Nanking,” where thousands of Chinese men women and children were dragged out into the streets and beheaded. Women were raped by thousands of Japanese soldiers and lay bleeding and dying in the streets. The Japanese had cut off the food supply and starved those they couldn’t kill with swords or bayonets. Shanghai had been an occupied city in one way or another for generations.

I feel I understand now for the first time why it was thought to be absolutely necessary for the Allies to unleash the atomic bombs on the populations of Japan. There had to be a reckoning. With Japan’s surrender in September 1945 life was starting to return to Shanghai and it was here that Dorothy had come. The Chinese had endured the Opium Wars, followed by an invasion of Westerners who blatantly took advantage of the foothold they had achieved, then with the advent of World War II and the subsequent invasion by Japan, and “liberation” of China it is no wonder that the Chinese were suspicious. Dorothy was there to open up the Treasury Departments’ Shanghai office, and in this way somehow make life better for the Chinese. She didn’t see herself as part of a capitalist machine bent on greed. She, along with many other Westerners were duped by the lies told by the banking cartels used to control China for Western profits. She truly believed that she was there to help the Chinese recover from the Japanese invasion. The United States was funding Chiang’s forces and this bitter civil war would rage for years and take the lives of thousands of Chinese lives. There would be no peace for China. The political climate in Shanghai was volatile, and revolution ran through the streets. As the fighting grew in the hinterlands of China, there was a sense of urgency among the American employees stationed in Shanghai. Dorothy had only arrived a few short weeks ago, and already there was talk of Mao’s invading forces. Huge glittery advertisement signs offered tastes of decadent western culture. Products flashed their hypnotic charms to passers by in the hustle and bustle of downtown Shanghai, Westerners rode in modern taxis or rickshaws taking afternoons in cafes and cocktail houses. Yet all around were people, children starving, beggars on every street corner, pathetic survivors of the Japanese death squads. No amount of brightly lit signs The slums, the stench, the hands of death choking this city were to Dorothy all the more reason to stay and help. In the evenings there was plenty of partying and dining as Europeans of all types; Germans, English, French, Swedes, and Americans intermingled under the lush protection of their status and discussed the oncoming Communist threat as if it were in some remote place.

To Dorothy it seemed more immediate than that. She thought most of these people to be devoid of any sense of reality, a privileged caste that had always thought themselves above the common fate. They would be given plenty of time to gather their things, pack their jewelry and make their way to private railway cars and chauffeur driven limousines for a relaxed and glorious retreat from the peasant invaders. Dorothy in her capacity as an employee of the Treasury Department and newly assigned to Shanghai had no such illusions or connections. Still, in this moment of international crisis and history she met someone. His name was Peter de Goutiere. He was the Marquis de Goutiere. Dorothy met and fell in love with this dashing man … a pilot for China’s National Airways Corporation. He was rugged looking, and as we see by his title, a Marquis of French nobility. His family had a sprawling estate in Chandernagore near Calcutta, India. The Marquis swept Dorothy off her feet and after obtaining a temporary leave of absence from her job, she married him sometime in late 1946 or early 1947. The marriage was wonderful at first and she moved to his family’s estate. She tried her best to make a go of things. His family treated her like a commoner and made their displeasure known. The Marquis had no sooner got her settled in, then he was gone. Most of her time was spent in small boring social gatherings where she felt the hushed conversations and brief glances judging her. The de Goutiere family were nobility and as long as Peter was there they fussed over Dorothy, but when he left, she was on her own. She felt trapped. Why had she been so foolish she thought? Peter was charming, but that too wore away quickly. And now she was alone in his world. This was not how she imagined married life to be, and she was damn sure she was not going to play the game of coy little wife waiting at home for her globe-trotting pilot to come home. She realized that she had married too quickly and now she must make a change. The Marquis had been drinking steadily and when they retired for the night he suddenly decided he wanted to go out for a bit of nightlife – without Dorothy. She begged him to take her along. In a fit of violent anger he slapped her so hard she fell to the floor, then without a word he turned coldly and left.

In a fit of violent anger he slapped her so hard she fell to the floor, then without a word he turned coldly and left. She packed her things and the next day before he returned, was on a plane back to Shanghai and the only friends she had at Treasury. She was now the Marquesas Dorothy de Goutiere of Chandernagore. All things Calcutta were not bad; she had loved and learned to cook simple Indian food. Years later she taught me how to prepare curry, Indian style with chopped peanuts and raisins, chutney, and spices. Her return to Shanghai was brief. The weeks that she had been away had only increased the reality of a Communist takeover. Mao’s forces were now poised on the outskirts of Shanghai, and the order was to burn the files and make an escape with the rest of the employees. Dorothy told me that her heart had not completely turned cold for this man and they made arrangements for her extraction. She waited at a pre-arranged location, but the Marquis never came. He left her there, by the train yard, alone and frightened. She had been abandoned, and she vowed to herself never to depend on anyone, for such was life and cruel was the way of the world. Dorothy told me many years later that she was on one of the last trains allowed to travel freely out of Shanghai. It was getting increasingly more dangerous to move about and Mao’s forces might have executed this American “spy” traveling with her cash and her gun. No one would have known what had happened to her. On the train dressed in shabby clothing, crammed into a passenger car, hundreds of people clambering and yelling, chickens and goats and children wailing, not knowing whether she would make her escape, Dorothy kept her pearl handled pistol strapped safely under her skirt. She carried two suitcases of cash, and whatever she could fit in her oversized handbag to bribe her way out of trouble – if she needed to. As the over crowded train left the city, Dorothy held her face down and quietly wiped the tears from her eyes. Hour after hour the train moved slowly on with its rhythmic rolling and swaying motion.

Keeping her head down and pulling her scarf over much of her face, she did her best to blend in amongst the dozens of people clamoring around her. Every time the train stopped her heart beat ferociously, her mouth dried and she prayed that she would not be discovered. Her only plan upon being discovered and questioned was to bribe, if that didn’t work she would shoot, saving the last bullet for herself. She would not surrender, she vowed, and be raped, or imprisoned. The life Dorothy had hoped for, her marriage to the Marquis and any possibility of a future, or a family, were gone now like the smoke she saw dissipating from the smoldering fires of burning villages that lit the night sky. She closed her eyes once again and as the train whistled, she was comforted. It was a sound she heard so many times before as a young girl growing up in Dayton Ohio. But there was still one more thing – she had lost her first baby. She flew back to the States to her mother, and after spending some time recuperating from her ordeal she was off again, another quest, another purpose, another mission. This time she applied for and was accepted by the ECA, The Economic Cooperation Administration also known as the Marshall Plan. Her new post was Paris, France. can’t imagine what a thrill it must have been for Dorothy to come to Paris after having barely escaped death at the hands of I Communist forces in China. Even more, she did it on her own. That last month of her life had been so horrible and such an emotional roller coaster ride. She felt relieved it was over, and she was back on track with a fresh outlook on life. She was confidant that her new job as secretary to Ambassador Averell Harriman would be rewarding and meaningful. On that long flight from New York, Dorothy couldn’t help feeling excited when she thought about Paris’ legendary nightlife. She also couldn’t get a young man out of her thoughts. She had met him at a party before she left Washington D.C., and she had gone out on a date with him. He was a Harriman employee named Hunt, Everette Howard Hunt. She called him Howard. On June 5th, 1947 he addressed Harvard University in a speech which would be the defining moment in his life and lead to the most important foreign policy initiative in American history.

From this speech came the formation of the Organization for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) in 1948 whose mandate was to work on a joint recovery program and supervise the distribution of aid. It’s interesting to note that some countries who had been victims of Germany’s blitzkrieg hesitated in accepting what appeared to be the helping hand of the United States. In truth, the Marshall Plan did call for huge financial loans for many of Europe’s war ravaged countries with the profit on the side of the United States, virtually enslaving these destitute countries under United States policy. The Marshall Plan was the lesser of two evils. Americans felt that we must extend aid in the form of financial credit, food, and materials for rebuilding infrastructure to prevent the continent from embracing communism. After Europe was liberated from the Nazis, there was a very serious possibility of influence from communist Russia. Remember, Russia had also won the war and consequently along with England they were allowed to share in the spoils of the victorious. Russia had lost a million-and-a-half people fighting the Germans. At the same time, the Russians were very aggressive in taking measures to create a revolutionary movement in much of the same counties that we were trying to recruit into the Marshall Plan. This was a battle of epic proportions waged covertly by the two biggest superpowers on the planet, who at this time were technically allies but not really on the same side. World War II had enabled the United States and Russia to become industrial giants, both capable of producing huge numbers of armaments and matériels at a rate never known to mankind. One must wonder how much slower this industrialization would have occurred without the immediate demands of a world war. Russia advanced from the east, and soon everything from there to Berlin would fall under communism. Berlin became the dividing line and like a game of Monopoly, we began negotiating for control of countries that had existed for hundreds of years. I have found it interesting that Russia busts through the front door, rolling tanks in and building walls, where as the Americans tend to try and slip in the back door, taking over while also trying to appear benevolent and concerned with alleviating human suffering. Two very different approaches that both leading to a single outcome: control. The person in charge of the Marshall Plan in Paris was a man named Averell Harriman. Harriman was an interesting man.

He was an active member of the Order of Skull & Bones. Before the war he had been a partner with another Bonesman, Prescott Bush at Brown Brothers, Harriman in New York. This were top of the food chain, investment attorneys involved in international banking. Harriman’s Bank was a major Wall Street connection for German companies and the many U.S. financial interests doing business with the Nazis. Under the Trading With The Enemy Act business transactions for profit were illegal once Germany went to war against the United States. In October 1942 the U.S. Government ordered the seizure of Nazi German banking op- Harriman had the following interests seized: Union Banking Corp., Holland American Trading Co., Seamless Steal Equipment Trading Corp., and the Silesia-American Corp. This was a major falling out for Harriman who some considered a Nazi sympathizer. Yet just a few years later he was put in charge of the Paris office of the Economic Cooperation Administration under the Marshall Plan. This was the man that Dorothy now worked for. It seems likely that she may have known of his prior banking problems, it wasn’t a secret. If she did know, this may have given her a clue as to the devious and often hypocritical nature of political standards. Regardless, she was glad to be in Paris at the height of the most creative, artistic, and groundbreaking cultural explosions of modern times. The art scene was blowing up with such legendary painters as Dali, Marcel Duchamp and René Magritte with their surrealist movement. Picasso of Spain spent time in France soaking up the incredible vibrations. Art Deco was born there in the late forties and Josephine Baker was dancing in theaters with her incredible saucy revue. Abstract and impressionistic art styles could be seen along the busy streets in the day while dozens of painters both obscure and famous perfected their craft for anyone who strolled by. Paris after dark was a hedonistic sanctuary of poets and mimes, singers and songs, lovers and dreamers all in the dazzle and sparkle of life for the world to see. Paris offered anything and everything a traveler could want. Lovers strolled along the banks of the River Seine and sat on benches kissing and touching in ways that were unashamed and free of guilt.

Couples of all types, mixed racial, lesbian and gay, openly showed their passion as if to say, “We just survived a world war and time is too precious to hide who we are and what we feel!” Paris was sending off a million watts of cultural and social illumination, lighting up the rest of the world in a spinning array of dizzying dimensions. Anyone who knew about anything wanted to be in Paris in 1949. Dorothy was there and the intoxicating vibrations of it all were filling her senses and calling her out. he headquarters of the Organization for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) where Dorothy worked was in the Chateau de la Muette in Paris. In 1770 Marie Antoinette took residency there to await her marriage to Louis XVI at Versailles. For the next three years she made this grand palace her home. During the Nazi invasion they made the Chateau headquarters of the German Navy. The Chateau was one of those magnificent palaces with gilded rooms and vast entry ways. Huge paintings from the Renaissance hung along the vast corridors and fresco’s adorned the walls and ceilings. Society and nightlife weren’t the only things going on in Paris, politics and intellectuals, propaganda and workers rights were all taking aim for control of post war France. Dorothy saw the daily demonstrations by leftist, pro-Stalinist, anarchists, and communists. All of them passing out leaflets and marching down the streets towards the center of the city, demonstrating in front of the workers unions and instigating social revolution. France, anyone could see, was in the middle of a second French Revolution. In New York a gathering of 800 prominent literary and artistic figures along with delegates from Europe and Russia came together at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and denounced American warmongering. This marked a clear indication that the Soviets were sponsoring a campaign to influence the West and shape Western opinion. Needing to continue with an intelligence gathering capability, there was formed the Office of Policy Coordination. This small office would eventually transform into what is now the CIA. One of OPC’s earliest programs was to hold a similar conference in Europe. They knew of plans for the Soviets to hold a second world conference denouncing American Imperialism in April in Paris. Frank Wisner, OPC’s first Director, planned a counter demonstration. He had gathered his own roster of intellectuals, artists and writers, all anti-communists.

OPC would need funding for the plan and Wisner knew just where to get it. Wisner cabled Dorothy’s boss Averell Harriman for help. Harriman diverted 5 million francs from the coffers of the Marshall Plan and made that available to OPC members in Paris to fund the counter demonstration. Dorothy was on Harriman’s secretarial staff and as such was taking notes, preparing cables, and compiling lists of those persons who would take part in this counter demonstration. It was here, in Paris she reunited with Howard Hunt. He worked for Harriman as a speech writer and film producer although it is more than likely Hunt was actually working for both Harriman’s OEEC office and for Wisner’s OPC unit. The double agent would be Hunt’s modis operandi in later years when he “retired” from CIA and joined Nixon’s covert-ops team. In his book, American Spy, Hunt writes that the relationship between Dorothy and he grew stronger, and by September he realized that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with this “feisty woman.” For her part, Dorothy had started divorce proceedings in Paris to end her disastrous marriage to the Marquis. By all accounts this seems to have been a love at first sight fairytale. I say “seems” to have been. In researching this book I came across this entry in CIA files declassified under the Freedom of Information Act. What follows is the entry: Dorothy Wetzel worked for the State Department in Bern, Switzerland, between July 1944 and January 1946. From April 1946 to May 1947, DOROTHY HUNT worked for the Treasury Department, Shanghai, China. She joined Economic Cooperation Administration in April 1948. She married HOWARD HUNT on September 7, 1949. The CIA reported that “DOROTHY LOUISE HUNT [OS 355,750] was investigated for Agency employment in 1948. Her former husband [Goutiere] was described as an habitual drunkard and not inclined to remain in any one place for any length of time. She did not enter on duty, having accepted a position with the Economic Cooperation Administration in Paris. Our Paris sources later reported that Subject’s wife was formerly his mistress and was openly flouted as such for several months. She was then described as an amoral and dangerous individual who underhandedly attacked those persons who incurred her enmity.” [Emphasis added.] Openly flaunted her?

However knowing that Dorothy had applied for a CIA (OPC) position and “did not enter on duty” leads me to suspect that Dorothy may have been keeping tabs on Harriman, Hunt et al. for OPC under the protective cover of Harriman’s Office of Economic Cooperation unit. Howard had not yet officially joined OPC and it was standard procedure to have members of various office staffs keeping tabs on the goings on in and around these offices. The nature of good intelligence work especially for women is to allow themselves to appear in some way involved with mundane matters, while actually serving a higher master. Dorothy was considered by the CIA to be a “dangerous” individual. I’m sure she would have been happy to have such opinions in her file. It was only a few years before that skinny little “Dottie” as she was called, was dreaming of traveling the world on secret missions and now just a few years later she had become an “amoral and dangerous individual.” There is nothing more dangerous than an amoral woman! thy was Howard’s mistress and he openly flaunted her as such for several months! I think that Howard Hunt, wanting to appear to his friends like a ladies man, may have and probably did talk about her in this derogatory fashion. He very well may have been dating several ladies at the time and passed them all off as Thirty-five thousand dollars was quite a sum of money in those days and regardless, Dorothy accepted without hesitation. She told me, years later of course, that Howard was a different man in those head-spinning months in Paris. There, they had spent evenings and nights together walking hand in hand along the Champs-Elysees, strolling through back alleys to hear the latest jazz, and on Sundays they would walk down to the famous Paris flea market where one could find just about anything. They had become quite an item in the secretarial pool and Dorothy and Howard were the gossip within the agency, I know that Dorothy was madly in love with Howard, and they felt that it would be ideal for them to leave the demands and suspicions of these fledgling spy programs and live off of Howard’s income as a writer. She could always take work in some capacity, possibly related to an embassy. Dorothy wanted children and was already showing signs of a pregnancy.

On September 7, 1949, Dorothy married Everette Howard Hunt Jr. Because of his parents difficulties with the marriage, they married not in Albany but in Millbrook, New York. They spent their first night at the Sherry Netherland Hotel in New York City. The next day they drove to Sea Island Georgia and enjoyed their honeymoon. Howard had become disillusioned by the lack of forward progress in OPC. He felt frustrated at the amount of political red tape and paperwork he had to go through to get anything done, and then very little real action had come across his desk since his days at OSS. Still there was something incomplete about writing as a career. He needed stimulation. He longed for action and intrigue. Realizing that all his books thus far had been based on his wartime/OSS experiences, the need for new and ongoing involvement was absolutely mandatory if he were to continue writing. hey settled in a small townhouse in Georgetown near Washington, D.C. and within a few days Howard accepted a posi-T tion with the CIA as station chief of Mexico City. He became consumed with hiring staff and vetting out those who didn’t measure up to his standards. This was what he wanted and he was anxious and thrilled. Dorothy was not. She miscarried the baby, a girl. The devastation Dorothy felt left her wondering if this might be some kind of omen or warning. What is it like for a woman to lose not one but two babies? She stayed in the Georgetown Medical Center Hospital alone save for the occasional visit from Howard. Jeanette came to visit and ended up agreeing to move to Washington to be near her daughter. Still she kept a brave if not happy face when Howard talked of what their life might be like in Mexico City. On February 17, 1950, HUNT was informed by the CIA’s Office of Security that his wife held left-wing attitudes regarding certain minority groups: “With regard to his wife, Mr. HUNT states that she is one of these individuals who carries the torch for minority groups and always has been too ready to take up the battle when any derogatory remarks are made concerning members of these groups. He advised, however, that she is becoming less pugnacious about this because he has constantly made it a point to request her not to express her opinion so strongly.

Mr. HUNT advises, as a matter of fact, that at the outset he used to bait his wife on these matters, but as he realized how strongly she feels about them, he ceased the practice. It seems as though Mrs. Hunt becomes so upset concerning racial and minority prejudices that the resultant condition is really injurious to her health. Mr. HUNT advises that he will have a heart-to-heart talk with his wife and ask her to tighten up on the control of her emotions. He will further suggest to his wife that she take the chip off her shoulders, and if remarks are made which disturb her, she should assume the attitude of considering the source. Mr. HUNT believes his wife is becoming less susceptible to remarks which have enraged her in the past. He has promised me to adopt a policy of discontinuing social relations with individuals who constantly discuss matters which are repugnant to his wife. I was very favorably impressed by Mr. HUNT’S attitude concerning my admonitions, and I respect him for his forthright denouncement and evaluation of his wife’s shortcomings. I am firm in my belief that Mr. HUNT is thoroughly patriotic, completely anti-Communist, and that there will be no repetition of past complaints. I sincerely recommend that we close the book on this issue, and start over with a clean slate. (Deleted) OS.” Someone in CIA had lodged a formal complaint or complaints in the form of a memo and Howard’s boss, probably Frank Wisner had a sit down with Howard regarding his wife’s behavior. She wasn’t a communist at all, but she also wasn’t a racist like Howard was. He sided with CIA and basically told Dorothy to keep her mouth shut and her opinions to herself. As an afterthought he agreed to try and not associate socially with other racists which would anger Dorothy. I don’t think that Dorothy was very happy and this being the first year of her marriage, it must have been heartbreaking for her to not only have lost a child but to then suffer the indignation of her husband warning her to keep her opinions to herself. I think at this point Dorothy was considering a separation if not a divorce when she found herself with child again. She vowed to do everything she could to carry this baby to full term.

Her doctor at Georgetown recommended that if they were planning a move to Mexico they should do it as soon as possible. n early 1950 Howard and Dorothy had settled into a small apartment in Mexico City. In a few short weeks they found a nice two Istory house in a very upscale residential area. Mexico had its rewards in the form of help for Dorothy. She now had a small staff of housekeepers to take care of the day to day duties of running the house. She had a cook, housekeeper, and a gardener. Dorothy had little to do besides read and rest. Aside from being a bit bored, it was everything that Howard had promised and she felt renewed in her desire to make this marriage work. Having served in the field before, she knew that Howard was under a great deal of pressure to build a team of operatives which would bring in valuable intelligence. The aim of the CIA at this time in Mexico was to infiltrate and counter the Soviet influence there. Howard was consumed with setting up his station and going about the business of covert political action. The house was smaller than others in the neighborhood, but it was larger in comparison with their Georgetown home. There was a large master bedroom with a bathroom as big as most American bedrooms, completely tiled with a drain in the middle of the floor and a shower at one end. Americans have always separated the shower from the rest of the bathroom but in many of the more expensive houses in Mexico City there was no separate “shower stall.” To one side of this spacious room was the sink, toilet and bidet. A bidet was a luxury that both Howard and Dorothy had gotten used to in Europe and they were happy to see that the house was outfitted with bidets in every bathroom. Dorothy had several walkin closets and her own dressing room with large gilded floor to ceiling mirrors. The home was structured around a large and very lovely garden courtyard with a small fountain, roses and well manicured flowering shrubs. Dorothy would sun herself there reading and admiring the many blossoms. The servants had their own living quarters in a second building on the property which housed the cook and housekeeper. The gardener came daily to keep the grounds in perfect condition. Howard, she thought, had done well. She felt confidant that if everything proceeded as planned, she would have this baby.

Dorothy became pregnant again in February and on November 23, 1952, she gave birth to her second child Kevan Totterdale Hunt. The little Hunt family was growing in population and by all accounts was the perfect nuclear family; working Dad, stay at home Mom and two little girls who had already wrapped the world around their tiny little fingers. Dorothy was happy with her two babies,and Howard was happy with the progress of his service to CIA. Mexico was turning out to be a blissful time. Howard was in charge of political action, disinformation, and psychological warfare. In essence his job was to create and fund the opposition group whose ragtag army of ill-equipped and poorly-trained peasants would, with a little CIA motivation, lead the country in the overthrow of Arbenz. In addition, he would print thousands of leaflets to be dropped over the capital city, stage phony aircraft sounds, and announce the impending wrath of thousands of Arbenz haters out looking for his head, both actually and figuratively. Hunt also had the responsibility of finding and grooming a pro-western successor to Arbenz. This was a huge responsibility and kept Hunt busy on long nights away from Dorothy. He had been shuttling to Nicaragua to help train the Guatemalan “freedom fighters” in a country run by the pro-west General Somoza. It wasn’t so bad Dorothy thought, Mexico had shown her that life as the wife of a spy had its good side, and the worst of it was that she missed Howard. She felt he was missing the first years of his daughter’s lives, years that passed all to quickly. Aside from his very outspoken racism, there were many things about him she loved. Howard was a good provider, husband and when he was home, a good father. He was not a heavy drinker like the Marquis had been, he never slapped or physically abused her and he was highly sexual, something she enjoyed. Howard would return home after days in the field and make love to her again and again. His tastes ran a little exotic for his young bride who had only begun learning the many ways of love. Howard had a moderate taste for pornography and she saw nothing wrong with it, and was happy that he shared his collection of magazines and photos with her.

On the contrary, she felt closer to him and worried less about the many sexual temptations in a city like Mexico where one could find anything you could think of, and plenty of women and men to engage with. Mexico had it all. The Hunt’s lived very well, much better than they would have in America. For Dorothy, her time in Mexico would be forever saddened when she had another miscarriage in 1953. Howard on the other hand quickly put the annoying incident out of his mind and told Dorothy she had better do the same. The truth as Hunt knew was that CIA boss Allen Dulles’ brother John Foster Dulles had a controlling interest in the United Fruit Company of Guatemala. This was Western greed and exploitation at its worst, and the truth of the matter is that when Arbenz was going to nationalize the land and agriculture, Dulles and his brother thought they could accomplish both ends under the smoke screen of liberty and freedom. So Arbenz was deposed and the peasants were denied decent wages and any promise of a better life. Once the new CIA backed puppet was installed, upwards of 14,000 civilians were put to death as a precautionary move to quell any signs of anti American activity. The cost to the American taxpayer for this little venture was twenty million dollars. Our house was a mix of traditional Japanese style with sliding rice paper doors, beautiful round archways and hardwood floors with bamboo room dividers. I remember a small Koi pond in a courtyard where we would splash and play when the weather permitted. We had several servants and two nannies; one for Lisa and Kevan and one for me. Her name was Yoneko and she adored me, sometimes refusing to let my feet touch the ground as this was undignified for the first son. Dorothy, for her part, fit into Japanese culture very well. She looked so beautiful and radiated warmth and charm at the many cocktail parties and embassy functions she and Howard attended.

I was just three years old and the cultural change for me and my sisters must have been quite overwhelming. I spoke a bare minimum of short Japanese phrases which would do me no good in a Spanish speaking country. I’ve been told that I went through a kind of withdrawal from my constant companion Yoneko. That, I don’t doubt. The landscape of Uruguay was completely different than what we had been accustomed to in Japan. In Japan, everything was smaller, and here in this new land, everything seemed to be much bigger. Our house was a massive estate on the east side of a large city block in the upscale neighborhood of Carrasco, near the beach. Surrounded by a huge six-foot wall of hedges, we were well insulated from the outside world. There was a vast lawn surrounding the house and a large iron gate at the end of a driveway. In the above photo we see the large mansion behind us. It was a small palace and we left some of the rooms closed off and empty. Slowly it became a home and we lived a privileged lifestyle. This was our normal dress wear, the girls with matching outfits and me with sweater over shirt, and shorts. For school we had uniforms and I wore a little tie and beanie cap. It’s an interesting shot and I wonder why we all looked so glum? Here I’m sitting behind my Papa and in the background you can see some of the many artifacts my parents brought with them from their travels. The large painting above the fireplace was from Japan and the vases on each end of the mantle are from China. The bookends are hand carved dragons from China. The rest of the room seems empty. We didn’t have that much from our home in Japan which by comparison was quite small. Both my parents were avid collectors of art and our frequent moves to exotic lands gave them wonderful opportunities to acquire valuable pieces.

Darling, you are the real article,” said Howard. “Why if we hadn’t met in Paris, I would probably have encountered you in Hong Kong on some enchanted evening.” Dorothy was still involved in espionage. I think she always was, and it is no coincidence that she worked in the diplomatic offices of various Latin American Embassies while Howard was posted as station chief with CIA. This is the very nature of a classic CIA couple. Dorothy was privy to sensitive cables and top secret memos, and would therefore have been a great asset to Howard. Dorothy was a busy lady with three children, a staff and house to manage, dinners, parties, and her work. She had 12 years left to live. I’m not so sure now. The term “free” and “freedom” seem to have been commandeered by the United States government and now serve to shield the unscrupulous warmongering for profit that has proliferated since World War II. Operation Iraqi Freedom? Afghan Freedom Fighters? Nicaraguan Freedom fighters? A free Cuba? Some of our close Cuban friends were Bernard Barker, who ran Batista’s secret police, Dr. Manuel Artime, chosen by my father to become President of Cuba upon the assassination of Fidel Castro and also was my father’s best friend. Artime would spend sixteen months in Castro’s filthy prison, living on rats and keeping his sanity by writing poetry and memorizing it. Frank Sturgis, who along with Barker features prominently in future Watergate history. Of these and others I have no doubt they were loving family men and lifelong friends of my father’s and mother’s, but at the same time they fed into the idea of Presidential right; which would eventually destroy my family, bring down the President and cause the death of my mother.

His rise to the higher echelons of CIA were dashed as the waves of blood splashed on the rocky coast of the Bay of Pigs. Howard’s boss, Tracy Barnes, as well as Allen Dulles, the Director of CIA, were all but put out to pasture. Never again would there be the kind of “golden days” that had graced the Agency for the last decades. I remember little of what our home was like. I do remember a deep shadow cast over our family. Nothing was ever quite the same for us. My father was eventually drawn into one of several plots to assassinate JFK. Did my mother know? I think she did. She and Howard depended on each other as sounding boards and I know that when my father told me in 2005 that he was a “bench warmer” in the Kennedy killing, it was probably due to Dorothy’s level headed advice. Just how much of a bench warmer was he? He didn’t live long enough to tell me everything. He had felt so betrayed and the idea of meting out equal justice appealed to him. Kennedy had to die. He owed it to his Cuban comrades. He owed it to his family, and he owed it to the world. Kennedy was soft, and a treacherous backstabbing liberal who would break under pressure from the stronger ideology of the Soviet Union. (His opinion) This was purely an act of revenge. This was really a rather simple task. Morales was the CIA’s top liquidator and had carried out murders for the agency in the past, Sturgis and Veciana were military/CIA soldiers and as such had extensive knowledge in assassinations and according to them, Bill Harvey was running the whole show with the approval of Lyndon Johnson. They had been rounded up from parishes throughout Cuba, and delivered to the port of Havana in trucks and police wagons. Armed militiamen, a civilian police force assembled after the 1959 revolution, accompanied them.

The pool was empty save for some bilge water sloshing around at it’s depth, the shuffle board deck was broken and in disrepair, the crew looked menacing and we were told to stay inside our rooms. The food was horrible and my poor little brother David who had been born on September 1st, 1963 was having a negative reaction to milk and barely made it alive. As it turns out our little family trip to “get away from it all” was another secret only now coming to light. After the death of JFK it was decided by Richard Helms, the new CIA boss, that E. Howard Hunt should retire. In 1965 Howard “retired” from the CIA and took his family to Spain (on an ex-prison ship) where he could write his novels and lead the good citizen life à la Hemingway. Sounds to good to be true. According to Lamar Waldron in his book, Legacy of Secrecy: The Long Shadow of the JFK Assassination, the early retirement of Hunt was a means whereby Hunt could delve into anti-communist matters with less of a trail leading to CIA. According to Tad Szulc in his book, Compulsive Spy, Hunt remained active in Cuban operations in 1965 with Manuel Artime and Rolando Cubela. Manuel Artime, the CIA’s golden boy meant to succeed Fidel, was in Spain with Hunt and had several meetings with other “technicians” regarding plots to kill the Cuban leader. Artime’s right hand man at these meetings was “Chi Chi Quintero” later to figure prominently in the drugs for guns Iran-Contra project. On a much more devious level, Castro was starting to disassociate himself with his long time co-revolutionary comrade, Ernesto “Che” Guevara. Guevara had returned to Cuba after a three month journey abroad and met in New York with journalist Tad Szulc and others. He was placed under house arrest by Fidel and phased out of any meaningful role in governing Cuba. For Che, it was a betrayal equal to that of Kennedy to his Cubans. In just a few more years Che Guevara would be captured in the jungles of Bolivia by one of Howard Hunt’s friends, CIA killer Felix Rodriguez and after a call to Washington, was told to allow a Bolivian guard to execute Che so as not to directly implicate the CIA. After they put a bullet in Che’s head, Rodriguez chopped his hands off and sent them to CIA (as proof.) Dorothy must have been deeply involved as well.

She worked in the Spanish Embassy in Washington D.C. And now in Madrid her position allowed access to classified files. She was also able to insert faked or retouched files into the Embassy system. Here is the only known group photograph of some of the members of Operation 40, the CIA’s super-secret assassination squad, taken in the Mexico City nightclub, La Reforma, January 1963.

The fourth from the right is said to be Jorge Robreno, the third Alberto “Loco” Blanco. Covering his face with his sport coat is Tosh Plumlee and to the far right is William Seymour. Later we moved to a American community outside of Madrid called Aravaca. Our house was a modern one story with a pool in front. We had a British nanny and we went to the American School of Madrid, where I fell in love with twin sisters Judy and Joyce. I was ten years old and dressed in cool Beatle fashion; Cuban heeled Beatle boots, straight thin black tie cut square at the ends, tight fitting pants and cool shirt and suit jacket. I sported a longish Beatle haircut and enjoyed our privileged lifestyle. While living in Madrid, Dorothy took us to Paris for an extended stay of about a week as I recall. It must have been thrilling for her to walk down the streets now with her children. I know that with some regret she had fulfilled much of what she wanted out of life. She had led an extraordinary career in espionage, married into royalty (the French Count), and remarried a wonderful man of many talents, given life to four children, and now she was back in Paris where so much of all this life had started. She took us on expeditions to the Louvre, and a Paris flea market. We visited the Cathedral of Notre Dame and ate crepes at the little Cafe “Quasimodo” in honor of the Victor Hugo character in his novel “The Hunchback of Notre Dame.” I even had the pleasure of meeting movie star Anthony Quinn who portrayed the hunchback in a version of the classic film.

My parents found a ranch style home on 14 acres of prime real estate in Potomac, Maryland. IThis one story 5 bedroom house was just perfect for us. In the front was a large corral. From River Road a long gravel driveway meandered through the woods and looped around to itself again, creating a sort of island of trees and rocks. Dorothy loved it and gave the name “Witches Island” to our home. The master bedroom and bath were on the left side with two large windows. On the front door Dorothy insisted that we use a beautiful large brass door knocker she purchased in Paris a few months before. It was heavy, very old, and sported goats with dragon tails. The knocker itself came down square on the head of Satan himself. Perfect for a Witches Island. I would in a few years, turn the little rabbit house into my living quarters where I would lose my virginity with my first girlfriend. The woods surrounding the house and riding areas were impenetrable. We could have held black mass there and no one would have been able to see or hear us. I formed a rock group and we rebuilt the inside of the pigeon coop for our band rehearsals. The entire picture of domestic bliss was capped of with a large underground bomb shelter. To reach it, one had to enter from a false wall in the maid’s bedroom downstairs behind which there was a metal door. A long metal tube led to another metal door. On the other side of that was the large reinforced concrete room. Against one wall was a ladder made of re-bar going up to a secret hatch which opened up way out in the woods behind the house. Pretty cool I thought. My room, which my father built, was behind his office wall. I had access to a back stairs which led up and out to the rear porch area.

Slowly we made the adjustments of becoming stationary, and we were all enrolled in the Montgomery County public school system. I think we were all very happy at least for a time. In 1968 Lisa and Kevan were involved in a car accident in Front Royal Virginia and after suffering amnesia and a suicide attempt, Lisa was committed to Shepard Pratt Mental Institution near Baltimore, Maryland for a year. I remember visiting her and crying when we left, not knowing if or when she would come home. Kevan suffered a broken leg and ribs and soon was up and around. She excelled in her studies and would eventually go to Smith College. I was having problems adapting to the academic and social culture of public school and so it was decided that I needed smaller classes and a more private atmosphere. I was angry and confused. Mama visited me within the first few weeks and brought up a tray of home made chocolate éclairs. Looking back I can see that in the year and a half I attended, I made friends that would last me a life time. Never having had a single friend in my life before, I cannot regret my time at Saint James. When it was time to return for my second year I was happy to do so even though something had occurred which I had kept to myself. I cried as I told her of this man and how he had done things to me and I had done things to him. She held me in her arms and slowly rocked back and forth and with soothing words tried to make me understand that it was not my fault and that the nightmares that I had been having were probably a result of what had been going on at the school. I wonder if years later the perp recognized my father from Watergate? If he did, he must have realized how close he came to losing his life. I never told my parents the complete details of what had happened and it was thought that I should see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me as being “over stimulated.” The psychiatrist was a creepy guy who kept wanting me to recall every detail of the many molestations I had been involved in. At that point, I regretted that I had ever said anything about it. Mostly, I felt that I should tell my mother because I couldn’t keep such a secret from her. I had no idea she would tell my father.

We returned to Potomac and Mama and I pretty much had the house to ourselves. Lisa, back from Shepard Pratt, was spending more time with her first boyfriend, a musician named Gary Myers. Kevan had decided to attend an upscale girls boarding school and little David was doing what most 5 year old boys do, playing and running around. Mama told me of her many miscarriages and her volatile first marriage to the Marquis. She asked me if I could pick open a lock on a trunk that she had found in our wine and liquor closet under the stairs going to the basement. She made me promise not to look inside once I opened it. This was very curious indeed. I would bring a Beatles album up for us to listen to, and we spent many evenings just talking and listening to music. I feel now, that she was trying to give me more attention of the feminine side, that I may have been lacking. She asked me little of my molestation and explained to me that I was drawn into it because Papa never spent enough time with me. But she also said that if I in fact did like men, in that way, it was perfectly alright. I remember this time we had with deep fondness and affection. In 1970 I was enrolled at Flint Hill School in Vienna, Virginia and made a best friend named Mark who introduced me to marijuana. When his parents discovered this they called my parents and, oh my God, what a ruckus. We were told not to associate even at school where all the teachers were advised to keep us apart and report any transgressions. This was in a similar vein to the false defector program that the CIA ran in the 50’s. Howard Hunt was clearly an asset for the CIA. How much did the CIA know about Nixon’s intelligence gathering capabilities? Probably only that Nixon was looking around for some real life spies to get matters going. In Howard Hunt, he found him. It was no secret that Nixon had requested an operational staff from both FBI and CIA for the purpose of spying on anti-war protesters. Nixon feared that the hippies were funded by pro-communist groups, even going so far as to think that George McGovern of South Dakota, his strongest rival for the next election, might be funded by these same leftist groups.

Both the CIA and FBI balked at the Presidents request. Nixon ordered Hoover to tap the phones of his political enemies … Hoover refused. Nixon grew increasingly distrustful and decided to put together his own team of covert operatives. The timing was perfect, when after several informal lunches with Hunt, Colson decided that Hunt would be the perfect asset for the type of clandestine capability that his president was looking for. Hunt was in. The CIA now had an inside man deep in the White House. Whatever researchers of Watergate have written or implied, I know for a fact that my father was working as a double agent during Watergate. I know this because he told me so during one of many trips to visit him in Miami. He had made reservations at his favorite Cuban restaurant in “little Havana,” and as we enjoyed a wonderful “paella,” we got to talking about Watergate. He turned to me and without so much of a second thought he said, “Well that’s true Saint, and those sons of bitches left me high and dry. I was keeping tabs on the intelligence program that the President was undertaking and reporting back to my superiors at the Agency. But now is not the time or place to discuss such matters, suffice to say I should have been well protected and was not.” If my Dad hadn’t had a few Miller Light’s he wouldn’t have been so communicative. (In James Hougan’s amazing book Secret Agenda, he gives us ample evidence that Hunt was still employed by CIA, when he was hired by the White House to look into “certain matters.” One of his sources is an internal CIA memorandum by the Agency’s Central Cover Staff, where they reviewed and extended Hunt’s top security clearance prior to his “retirement” and moreover this was done in anticipation of Hunt’s continued utilization by CIA.) Dorothy didn’t like Liddy. She told me he was an extremist and a racist. It didn’t mean much to me then, but in retrospect I understand her dislike of Liddy. She worried about the path that Papa was taking, and she confided to me that he was in “over his head” with men who didn’t have the moral fiber or integrity to do what was right, only to do what was in their best interests. Although that brief moment of clarity was admirable, the lies didn’t stop.

Although that brief moment of clarity was admirable, the lies didn’t stop. Not only was Papa not retired from CIA, but his job at Mullen was also a lie, and to top it off he was acting as a double agent allowing the White House to think that they were using him for his CIA connections and experience when in fact the CIA was using him to keep tabs on the White House. Howard on the other hand felt he was in control of his controllers. After all, he had done this kind of work for years and knew that the utmost power comes from allowing your handlers to think they are controlling the spy, when in fact it is the spy who wields the most power by working all sides and vowing allegiance to all. I don’t want to get to involved with the minute details of Watergate except to give the reader a general overview of its’ particulars. There were more serious matters that my mother confided to me on our rides through the pastures and woods of Potomac. She told me that Papa had been having an affair with a woman and after denying it for a year, he had finally confessed saying it was over, and she meant nothing to him. I fantasize about her still being alive and how, to escape a lengthy prison sentence for her role in Watergate, she had to fake her own death. But she died and it’s only a trick of my mind that places her on a bus or in a car driving past me … she would never allow me to suffer without coming forward. Howard was well thought of, almost legendary in Cuban circles as “Edwardo,” the CIA man who believed that the invasion was sound and who felt just as betrayed by Kennedy as they did. He was one of the “good guys.” He was also there to renew friendships and see if there were any old warriors around that might be willing to do some work for the government, in hopes that it would lead to a favorable policy against Castro and ultimately a re invasion of Cuba. I last saw Macho Barker at my father’s funeral service in 2007, and he gave me a big hug and as tears rolled down his cheeks he told me how sorry he had been that Dorothy died. He said she was a remarkable woman, and Howard was never luckier than to have her keeping an eye out for him.

He said she was a remarkable woman, and Howard was never luckier than to have her keeping an eye out for him. Also in attendance were Artime’s children and CIA contract killer Felix Rodriguez. Rodriguez embraced me and said how my father was a true hero. According to Colson, Hunt’s trip to Miami was a “call to arms.” Hunt was recruiting loyal men, battle proven, ready to undertake anything that Hunt directed. It’s a mystery as to what exactly was the mission that Hunt was preparing for. Dorothy however knew. She knew everything about what Howard was doing, and she was uneasy, wishing he would just retire and let those men do there own dirty work. His vanity and addiction to power were clouding his judgment. Howard needed just one more shot at the big time. I understand how Papa must have felt. He had given much of his life to serve his country, and he’d been groomed as a political actions officer. The word here is “action.” Howard had put everything he had into his duties at CIA but the government had failed him and his beloved Cubans. Since then his career had stalled and the restructuring of the old boy network had created, for the first time, a lack of clear will. Now all espionage activities had to go through political channels. This was politics, not intelligence. The CIA had been run and staffed by men of honor, soldiers of a different kind. Politics is a very public endeavor while espionage is a craft based on secrecy. The burden was Dorothy’s. She was the one who calmed his rage when the invasion fell apart. She was the one who listened hour after hour to his deliberations. She held him together as she always had, and it took everything she had to keep him from breaking apart. His anger, his shame, his remorse, his loss. Dorothy was already making plans to divorce him, but at the same time she wasn’t about to let him blindly walk into a trap. If he would only listen! Why couldn’t he see? She was frustrated and knew that the stakes in this game were higher than any before. She couldn’t see of course that she would be pulled into this fight against the President of the United States. In the ring against the most powerful man on earth there would be only one winner.

I remember one evening I walked upstairs and knocked on my parents bedroom door. I think I had heard their voices in an argument and wanted to see if mama was alright. I felt very protective of her, and fantasized in my thoughts of stepping between she and papa during one of their arguments so as to protect her from his verbal abuse. [] (L to R) Virgilio Gonzalez: locksmith, Frank Sturgis: ex CIA contract agent, pilot during Bay of Pigs, fought alongside Castro yet was spying for CIA, Bernie “Macho” Barker: Chief of pre-Castro secret police, Mafia liaison with Cuba, double agent for CIA and FBI. Eugenio Martinez: anti Castro Cuban exile. Missing are Gordon Liddy, James McCord and E. Howard Hunt. This book is very hard to write. My thoughts and fears, the memories come back slowly and painfully. Memories are like glowing embers from a fire. It’s as if thinking about her breathes life into those embers. If memories are left unthought of, and if we don’t use our recall, they grow dim because a memory is an imprint of a time, a place, an experience that needs to be recalled to survive. I’m sure Lisa and Kevan were well aware of it, I knew, and little David probably not. Watergate was just about to break open and our lives change dramatically … forever. Lisa and me stayed in Potomac for our own personal reasons. She, in order to be with her boyfriend and me, to be with my girlfriend and rehearse with my rock band. And so it was with an air of innocence that I hugged and kissed mama good bye and as an afterthought said, “Bring me back something mama.” What I will say is that Watergate was just one of many operations that my father thought had been authorized by John Mitchell, the Attorney General of the United States. Mitchell therefore was the top lawman in the country. Certainly if he had approved of these covert ops, then wouldn’t it be safe to say that they were within the law? Each operation or mission was given the name of a semi-precious stone.

These films were to be shot through a two way mirror and the prostitutes would be well aware of their duties. Another assignment was to fly a small surveillance plan along side the Democratic candidate’s plane and eavesdrop on their conversations. Plans also included the breaking and entering of Dr. Fielding’s office, the planting of pro-Democratic party literature in the apartment of Arthur Bremmer, the man who shot Governor George Wallace of Alabama, and the fire-bombing of the Brooking Institute. Other plans called for the use of the Cubans to start riots at the upcoming Democratic Convention in Miami. It appears that Nixon was fully aware of these illegal operations. It’s odd because Nixon was predicted to win by a landslide, yet he was so paranoid of his “enemies” that getting dirt on the Democrats was consuming his mind and actions. In June, Dorothy and the two children left. I remember going to the airport to see them off. She looked tired and I knew that upon her return our family would undergo a drastic change; I just didn’t know it would be the change that would lead ultimately to her death. In my book Bond of Secrecy, I recount what happened: June 17th, 1972. It must have been very late or very early in the morning. I was asleep in my windowless room downstairs. I was alone in the house except for Mary our house maid. Lisa must have been with her boyfriend Gary. Suddenly Papa burst in and flipped on the light switch. “Saint, Saint John, wake up!” For the next three days I helped my father destroy crucial and damning evidence, transfer large amounts of cash from a safety deposit bank in Georgetown to our home in Potomac, and run errands for him. In the next few days, I received visits from the FBI at our home, and Papa made plans to go to New York. The press had started to come to our door and Papa thought that with him gone, we would be able to honestly say that he wasn’t home. Thinking that the Attorney General, who ordered the break in at Watergate would get Howard’s men released, he phoned Dorothy and spoke with her in England. She had read in the papers there that five men had been arrested in connection with a break in at the Democratic National committee headquarters and knew immediately who the five men were.

She had read in the papers there that five men had been arrested in connection with a break in at the Democratic National committee headquarters and knew immediately who the five men were. We didn’t know what was going on, and as we watched along with the rest of the country, the story unfolded on national television and seemed to bring Papa’s name to the forefront of this nightmare. I did however know that this was precisely the reason for all the disharmony in our home for the last year and a half. I drove Papa to the airport and as we embraced I had no idea just how devastating this would be. In the end it would cost more than I could bear. My father would be jailed for years, my mother would be killed in a very suspicious plane crash, and our home would be shuttered and locked from us, with all our possessions inside, never to be seen again. Every time I turned on the television there was more news about “Watergate.” Our father’s name was now in the headlines of every newspaper and on every wire service. To a clandestine officer of the CIA, this alone must have been absolutely unbearable. I can imagine what was racing through his mind while he was wrestling with his options in New York. Options? Instead, I was a failed student, a stuttering child, non athletic and easily preyed upon by a homosexual. Still, I would have done just about anything for this man I called father. This deeply critical, racist, war mongering, role model that I would never, ever be able to come close to living up to his grand Eastern college expectations. At times I felt that the man who molested me on so many occasions was at least honest in his feverish and unquenchable desire for sex with me. Lisa was going through a deep realization that she too had been sidelined. Instead of keeping her home after her car accident, he insisted that she be institutionalized in a monstrously Gothic mental hospital for the criminally insane. But that was not for me to judge at that time. From New York he flew to Los Angeles to stay with his friend and lawyer, Tony Jackson. While in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times ran a story of how the FBI was looking for Howard Hunt. The next day he flew to Miami and from there flew back to LA.

After that he flew to Chicago and stayed with Dorothy’s childhood friend Phyllis Carlstead. “I wiped it all down … stuff that looked like electronics, uhm, walkie talkies too, and then we drove out to the river and threw them in. Later the next night I took a typewriter and wiped it down, put it in a sack and threw it into the General’s pond.… Oh, and I drove to a bank in Georgetown where I met Papa.” From his book Undercover:“Dorothy informed me she had been in touch with Douglas Caddy, (Howard’s first attorney as well as his good friend), not knowing where to turn, but had been in effect rebuffed.” She stayed one night with Papa and flew back to Maryland the next day. Lisa and me were relieved to have her back, she was the strength of our family. On July 2nd, Howard came home. Dorothy picked him up at the airport. It seems he had been searched at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport randomly and gave the authorities a false ID saying he had been robbed while in Chicago and didn’t have a drivers license or any supporting documentation. Random? He was a wanted man, wanted for questioning, but thus far had not broken any laws. For several days he hid out at home while news of the largest manhunt in recent FBI history was splattered all over the TV news and papers. I could see black cars parked down the road. Day and night they remained and it felt creepy to drive past them. The phone rang continuously, and our house maid was placed in charge of answering. We were in effect surrounded and monitored. Thank God our home was very private. You could barely see our house from the road when the leaves were on the trees. I had my own refurbished little rabbit house where I had run an electric cord from the back porch to light up the inside. There was a little lamp, a small stereo, and a foam pad on the floor. Drew had sewn together some curtains and we kept it very clean. We smoked weed, drank Lambrusco and made our plans for our summer trip. I felt badly about leaving.

There was an urgency to my journey, one that was not lost to me. I had committed a crime, several crimes and could be arrested. If the FBI had wanted to, they could have stopped my escape. They had me under surveillance since Papa’s name appeared as a link to the burglary. I finished packing the van; Coleman cook stove, pots, pans, dry goods, it was as close to a gypsy wagon as anything I’d seen. How sad to squander such talent on a father that would never give back a fraction of that attention. Still, I had not given up on the man, I just stopped seeking recognition and acceptance from him. I respected him as a man and as my father but in a less emotional manner. Was I becoming a little bit like him? I wouldn’t know for years to come. In any event, the time had come to strike out on my own. I had a van, a girlfriend, a map, several thousand dollars in cash, and I was ready to hit the road. I brought my mother’s 20 gauge shotgun with me. With pots and pans clanking, I turned the van down the driveway kicking up dust and gravel. Just at the entrance where our driveway and River Road intersects, I paused and looked at the “Witches Island” sign, turned right and with grave thoughts and overwhelming emotions, left to find America. I never thought that our lives were in danger. I didn’t know that the stakes were rising, and someone would give there life up for the rest. Had I known, I would never have left. I would have given up the trip just to have that month of her in my life. If I stayed maybe I could have changed the future … if I stayed. In South Dakota I visited the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and spent time with an old Indian woman I found by the roadside.

It was a scorching hot afternoon and Drew, my girlfriend, had been driving for a few hours when we saw a slow moving beat up old pickup just ahead. When I returned back home it was as if nothing had really changed. Watergate was still the main topic in the press. Papa’s old Bay of Pigs friend Manolo Artime had set up a “Free the Watergate five” committee to handle monies from certain parties to help pay for the defense of the Cubans. Nixon wanted to make sure that the Watergate defendants remained quiet and wouldn’t implicate the White House. On a June 30th tape Nixon told his aide H.R. Haldeman: “I’ll pardon the bastards.” On June 29th, Nixon’s personal attorney, Herbert Kalmbach had $75, 000 in cash delivered to the defendants and their attorneys. Over the next three months some $219, 000 would be distributed with at least another $237, 000 after that. Keeping Hunt happy was a top priority for Richard Nixon. There seemed to be no shortage of cash. There was cash coming from the Committee to Re-elect the President (CREEP), and another source; Bebe Rebozo. Rebozo was a close friend and supporter of Nixon for many years. He was a financier and mob connected. There is much evidence to show that the Mob had made numerous “loans” and “payoffs” to Nixon through Rebozo. Now Rebozo funneled Mob money to Artime. Bfull cover-our-asses mode. Nixon’s personal lawyer Herbert Kalmbach had now called in the services of an earlier member of the secret White House investigations team, a retired New York cop turned private detective named Anthony Ulasewicz, or Tony U. for short. He had originally worked on a request from Nixon which was later transferred to Howard Hunt on finding dirt about Senator Edward Kennedy and Chappaquiddick. For those that don’t remember what that was , briefly, when Ted Kennedy was leaving a party up near Martha’s Vineyard he missed the road and plummeted his car into the muddy waters off Dike Bridge. He survived and swam to the surface with only minor injuries. Unfortunately he forgot his passenger who was left to drown.

He survived and swam to the surface with only minor injuries. Unfortunately he forgot his passenger who was left to drown. She had been one of the many pretty secretaries that worked long hours for the Senator’s campaign. Tony’s cover name was “Mr. Rivers.” In his little known book, aptly named, The President’s Private Eye, he tells of delivering $25, 000 to Bittman, my fathers attorney at the time. Every time there was a payment to be delivered Tony would fly down from New York city and meet at some prearranged location to pick up his “package.” After delivering Bittman’s “price,” I began to have a series of long tortuous conversations with the “writer’s wife,” Dorothy Hunt. On July 11, Kalmbach had called me to give me Dorothy Hunt’s telephone number, instructing me to deal with her from now on. I don’t know who put her in charge of arranging delivery of the rest of the money, but as soon as I spoke with her, the pattern and mood of the calls changed dramatically. She acted like a gambling casino pit boss, directing the dealer, counting the chips, figuring the odds, making sure her cut was secure. She didn’t want to listen to the strictures binding my position as courier of the money. She also raised the ante each time I spoke with her. At first, she told me that she had lost her job over the Watergate scandal including her medical benefits. She said somebody had to take care of those. She started calculating everybody’s needs and came up with a minimum figure of $3, 000 a month, but as she didn’t want to worry about the monthly delivery from the post man, it was better, she said, to get a big chunk up front to relieve the pressure on everybody. “So let’s start with $10, 000 or $15, 000 apiece to get this thing off the ground,” she said. She wanted the advance to cover five months of needed living expenses. She said Barker, Sturgis, Gonzales, and Martinez needed at least $14, 000 apiece and Barker need another $10, 000 for bail, $10, 000 more under the table, and $3, 000 more “other expenses.” Twenty-five grand apiece were needed for Sturgis, Gonzales, and Martinez’s attorneys. I told Mrs. Hunt to slow down. Now she was talking about $400, 000 or maybe $450, 000 . That wasn’t even close to the amount Dean had told Kalmbach to raise when they met in Lafayette Park.

The pressure was on. With only a few months till the election, Nixon needed to keep the lid on this Watergate problem. At this point he thought that he could order the Justice Department to have the charges dismissed for the four Cubans and James McCord. Gordon Liddy’s name had not surfaced yet. As Tony U. writes: When I told Mrs. Hunt that I had no room to negotiate and that it was pointless to present me with a shopping list of who needed what, she said some people were starting to get desperate. They felt they were being abandoned. She added a new name when she told me that one of those who needed money was a guy named Liddy. He was involved in the break in along with the “writer” but hadn’t yet been charged with anything. That was news. Hunt’s name had been found in an address book kept by one of the burglars. (Barker) So had the name Colson. Now Mrs. Hunt was adding another name to the stew. I was a stranger to Mrs. Hunt, and yet she was telling me something that proved Hunt’s connection to Colson in the White House. With Liddy in the picture the ring of involvement was widening, and I was learning more than I wanted to know.

My wife was with me, and almost as an afterthought, Bittman told of a curious phone call he had received. “Some guy – I don’t know who he was – said he wanted to talk to the ‘writer’s wife.’ He said his name was ‘Mr. Rivers’ and that he wanted to talk only to the writer’s wife.” After leaving Bittman, Dorothy told me that upon her return from Europe she had called Caddy [Hunt’s first attorney] on several occasions and received what she considered", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:DO0007IPG_cleaned.txt:42:4d840297fc88", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5674, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "DO0007IPG_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Dorothy-Amoral-Dangerous-Woman-Watergates/dp/1634240375", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "DO0007IPG_cleaned", "chunk_index": 43, "text": "me, and almost as an afterthought, Bittman told of a curious phone call he had received. “Some guy – I don’t know who he was – said he wanted to talk to the ‘writer’s wife.’ He said his name was ‘Mr. Rivers’ and that he wanted to talk only to the writer’s wife.” After leaving Bittman, Dorothy told me that upon her return from Europe she had called Caddy [Hunt’s first attorney] on several occasions and received what she considered were unsatisfactory responses. She had been unable to reach Liddy. Confronted with this situation, and not knowing where I was or what faced me, she went to CREP headquarters [Committee to Re-Elect the President] and demanded to see the general counsel, an attorney named Paul O’Brien. Dorothy went on to say that O’Brien had blanched when she told him of my involvement with Gordon Liddy, and he said he would look into the circumstances at once. Mr. Rivers’ call, she theorized, was in response to her enlightenment of Paul O’Brien.… When my wife returned, she told me that Mr. Rivers had instructed her to obtain from the arrested men, Liddy and myself, an estimate of monthly living costs and attorneys’ fees. This she was to do by the following day, when she was to be at a different phone booth to receive a call from Mr. Rivers. Accordingly she telephoned James McCord, then Bernard Barker, asking the latter for a combined estimate covering all four Miami men. These figures she delivered to Mr. Rivers during their subsequent telephone contact, after which he said, “Well, multiply that by five to cut down on the number of deliveries.” In Tony Ulasewicz’ version he claims that it was Dorothy’s idea for a five month figure. In my father’s version he has Ulasewicz calling the shots. It’s difficult at this point to decide which one is closer to the truth, but one thing is certain, the first meeting between the writer’s wife and Mr. Rivers was at the very least fraught with tension. In my opinion, I feel that this first meeting was crucial in establishing position of power. Dorothy would not appear to be timid, docile, or easily frightened. Her years of intelligence work had taught her to stay tough, and never back down. Mr. Rivers also had years of police experience and would have taken the upper hand position. In dealing with a situation such as this, it being similar to a list of demands in a kidnap or hostage situation, it is standard operating procedure to allow the one making the demands to feel they had control. There was nothing Mr. Rivers could accomplish by stalling or bargaining. There was so much pressure coming from Nixon to keep Hunt quiet that money, at least according to Nixon, was no problem at all.

There was nothing Mr. Rivers could accomplish by stalling or bargaining. There was so much pressure coming from Nixon to keep Hunt quiet that money, at least according to Nixon, was no problem at all. He had the power and connections to pay out millions of dollars in hush money as long as Hunt kept quiet. Towards the beginning of August 1972, in a taped meeting with H.R. Haldeman, Nixon can be heard calling the hush money for Hunt and the others “a considerable cost,” but said that “it’s worth it.” Haldeman protested that “it’s very expensive. It’s costly.…” But Nixon interrupted him saying, “That’s what the money is for … they have to be paid. That’s all there is to that.” Above all else keeping Hunt happy was Nixon’s highest priority. In Lamar Waldron’s book Watergate: The Hidden History, he writes, “The tapes make it clear that Nixon, and aides such as Colson, admired some of Hunt’s exploits while dreading what he could reveal.” Nixon would tell John Dean the following year that “Well, your major guy to keep under control is Hunt. Because he knows – about a lot of other things.” In October 1972, Nixon would allude to one of those “other things” in a taped conversation with Haldeman and Treasury Secretary John Connally, saying that Hunt “was working the Pentagon Papers, trying to make sure it was Ellsberg.… Given Hunt’s role in the CIA-Mafia plots, for a time nothing Hunt did seemed to surprise Nixon. In a June 30th meeting, the President told Haldeman, “About this fellow [Hunt] – I mean, after all, the gun [found in Hunt’s White House safe] and the wiretapping doesn’t bother me a bit with this fellow. He’s in the Cuban thing, the whole Cuban business.” In transcripts of Nixon’s taped conversations days after the Plumbers’ arrests, when Colson told Nixon on July 1, 1972, that Hunt had “certainly done a lot of hot stuff … Oh Jesus. He pulled a lot of very fancy stuff in the sixties,” that was followed by a notice from the National Archives: “[Withdrawn item. National security.]” After the censored portion, Nixon then said, “If anything ever happens to him, be sure that he blows the whistle, [on] the whole Bay of Pigs.” Unknown to most people, E. Howard Hunt and Richard Nixon had known each other as far back as 1950, when according to Lamar Waldron, the two met quite by chance in Washington D.C. – at a restaurant. Hunt took it upon himself to compliment Nixon on his pursuit of Alger Hiss.

Hunt took it upon himself to compliment Nixon on his pursuit of Alger Hiss. The young Congressman Nixon and the newly appointed CIA agent ended up having dinner together for about an hour. Vice President Nixon stopped there on his whirlwind foreign-policy tour of Latin America. While in Uruguay, Nixon, who remembered Hunt from their dinner several years before met with Hunt and discussed Hunt’s success at overthrowing the Arbenz government in Guatemala. The meeting went well and after Nixon returned to Washington, Hunt was told he would soon be working on a new covert operation being pushed by Vice President Nixon. Starting in 1959, Nixon was the key player in a secret Nixon-CIA plan to assassinate Fidel Castro. Even the plan was hidden from most CIA officials, and it certainly was layered with deniability. It was with this deniability in mind that the Mafia was brought into the murder plot. If anything should go wrong, The White House and the CIA could hide behind the Mafia as the perpetrators of this evil deed. The Mafia was a logical choice. They had the motive; they had lost millions and millions of gambling and drug money when Castro closed the Havana casinos, and Cuba could no longer be the staging ground for drug smuggling into the United States … and they had the means; mob hit men were a well known enforcement arm of the Mafia. According to Lamar Waldron, Nixon gave the green light to have Castro killed. The elections were coming up and Nixon was in for a tight race. His hope was that if Castro was assassinated and Cuba became embroiled in a civil war (no doubt funded and staffed by CIA paid mercenaries), Americans living there would be in danger and United States troops would need to be sent to establish order and protect our citizens. He felt that the general American public would then vote for him due to his outstanding service in the field of international foreign policy. to real hands on foreign policy experience would lose, and Nixon would win the election. Why this is so important is because the attempts on Castro’s life did not end after Kennedy was elected. In fact they went on for many more years. Despite losing the election Nixon remained involved behind the scenes in many Mafia/CIA plots. In September and October of 1960, Nixon was fighting for his political life, with the election was just a month away.

Twelve years later, in 1972, Nixon would again be fighting for his political life, again with an election just a few months away. Nixon knew that the man he had selected to lead his Special Investigations Group (the Plumbers), and was now facing prison for doing similar things Nixon had ordered done so many years before. That man was E. Howard Hunt. that would lead to many of the illegal activities that Nixon had approved since 1970. These included the breaking and entering of Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist office, the breaking into the Chilean Embassy, the plot to murder news columnist Jack Anderson, the plans to bug democrats, bait them with hookers who would slip them LSD and then take them to a house where the drug fueled sex debauchery would be filmed, the bribes Nixon had taken from Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters, the bribes he took from Chicago Mafia boss Sam Giancana ($250.000.00) , the use of campaign funds to finance his personal vendettas, and the list goes on and on. The single most explosive information, that without question, could get Nixon impeached was his involvement while Vice President, to have Fidel Castro assassinated. Howard Hunt knew these things. His wife Dorothy knew these things, and now facing a grand jury inquisition, Howard demanded payment for his silence. He held the trump card. There was nothing Nixon could do about it but pay and pay dearly. Or was there? There are unproven cases where people have been murdered to maintain Presidential power; Marilyn Monroe, Mary Pinchot Meyer, George de Mohrenschildt, and Dorothy Killgalin are just a few that come to mind. One must not forget the many witnesses to Kennedy’s assassination also have died under suspicious circumstances. Nixon was a schemer. I don’t think it’s too far of a reach to speculate that there were only two options for Nixon in dealing with Howard Hunt: pay and keep paying or, silence the man. From his own secret White House tapes, we know that although Nixon’s inner circle was against paying Hunt the hush money, Nixon wasn’t. In fact the tapes prove that Nixon knew all along of the devastating threat that Howard Hunt posed for him. Once Dorothy was part of the threat, it was clear that rather than kill Howard Hunt, it would be just as valuable to kill his wife. Killing Hunt would be too obvious, but by killing his wife that would silence him and force him to take the fall.

Nixon cherished political power, Hunt cherished his family. That would keep Howard Hunt from talking, especially when his children were so vulnerable. Kill the wife, and the implications of killing the children become all too clear. It happens all the time, for reasons much less dramatic than trading the White House for the Big House. As we approached our driveway, we could see the parked cars on either side of the road. Were they press? Were they FBI? Maybe just curious onlookers. The village of Potomac was thrust into the limelight as the media searched out our location. So much was happening … so quickly. I wondered, as I’m sure we all did, what was coming next? Now that Dorothy was an accessory to the crime, and she could go to prison, her physical state was deteriorating. A severe back injury she sustained years ago was excruciatingly painful. I witnessed her crying quietly many times from the pain, and she was consuming larger amounts of pain pills which left her depressed and addicted. Now, with all the pressure and problems, the insecurity of not being in control of your future, the feeling of being trapped in a relationship that should have ended years ago, the constant magnification of your private life, was like living in a nightmare. It was draining the life from her. I can’t imagine how desperate she felt. Dorothy had been planning to divorce Howard, but now she was committed to see this through. Her strength, even as her body was failing, was immense. Her courage, ferocious. As she retreated from her normal routines, we spent less time together. I felt helpless. I was keenly aware when she left at night – coming back in thirty minutes or so. She stretched as if trying to release the tension in her back. “God I wish this would stop hurting.” She sat down in front of her vanity and undid the clips in her hair. Slowly she brushed it out. It was long and thick. I sat on the bed behind her and watched. Despite everything that was happening, she was still a very beautiful woman. There was a sadness in her eyes that betrayed her loneliness.

The stores, so sunny and cheery by day, transformed by the night into ghost town shops empty of life, but filled with memories and energies of people, living lives; some in desperation, some in sublime ignorance, and some with purposeful intent. We pulled up slowly alongside the phone booth, and I understood why this place spooked Dorothy. Anything could have happened here, and it might be three or four hours before the earliest shop keepers returned to their stores. She turned the lights and engine off, rolled down the window about half way and waited for the phone. She said, “It’s so quiet.” Dorothy opened the car door and stepped into the booth. Picking up the receiver I heard her say, “Where?” and then “When?” She hung up the receiver and sat back down into the safety of the big car. Turning over the engine we kept the lights off until we cleared the parking lot. With all intent we drove deeper into the black night, heading for Witches Island. Suddenly I jumped up and ran to the front door. Struggling with the locks, I flung it open and dashed out onto the front lawn just in time to see the red glow from her tail lights disappearing through the trees until they too were consumed by the night. I felt sick. Just awful for not arguing to go. I turned and promised myself I wouldn’t let her go alone next time. I locked the big door and tip toed down the stairs to my room. It was totally dark, completely quiet. I wondered if they told her to come alone because they had seen me with her in the Village? If that were true then she was under surveillance. I lay on my bed and had awful thoughts. I swore I could hear cars on River Road and waited anxiously for the sound of her car coming up the drive. With a wink and a twinkle in her eye, she spoke without saying a word. I knew what she was saying and she smiled reassuringly, knowing my words spoke not from ,my lips, but from my heart. There were so many questions I wanted to ask. What happened? How long was she gone? Could I go with her next time? Hopefully we would get the time today to talk about last night. I wanted to know everything.

I wanted to know everything. In researching for this book I found out that the phone call at the Potomac phone booth was from Mr Rivers (Tony Ulasewicz), who instructed “the writer’s wife” to drive to National Airport (Dulles International) and go to a specific phone where she would find, taped underneath, a key with a number stamped on it. This key was to a locker at the airport. Inside the locker she would find a small travel bag and inside would be a manila envelope. On this first occasion, the envelope contained $40, 000 . On the way home she had stopped at the local supermarket and bought the items which she prepared for breakfast. It’s weird to think that we all ate a breakfast which was purchased with Watergate hush money supplied to us by Richard Nixon and his Mafia friends! That bacon tasted extra good, and that orange juice was the best I ever had! As promised, David and I went fishing across the street at General Griffin’s pond, the same pond where, into, just a month ago I had thrown my father’s typewriter.. The significance of the typewriter was that it had been used (by him) to forge State Department cables which showed that President Kennedy was aware and therefore responsible for the assassination of Vietnamese President Diem. This was just one of many smear projects ordered by Nixon to disgrace the former President. As David and me fished, I wondered if the little minnows had set up house among the typewriter keys and ribbon spools. The whole thing sounded “fishy” to me. When we came back, empty handed as usual, Dorothy asked us if we wanted to go on a ride over in the woods behind the General’s house. She added that it just may be one of the last chances we’d have because she was selling the horses. This was a reality check for me. “No, it was basically empty,” she replied.

Dorothy now was given the additional task of calling Chuck Colson’s secretary Joan Hall and leaving cryptic messages asking that Colson return the call so Howard could speak to him. According to Hunt, in his autobiography Undercover, On the twenty second of October 1972, Dorothy called Joan Hall again “to ask Colson’s intercession in the matter of long overdue payments to the defendants. Mrs. Hall told her to call back on the twenty fourth, but when Dorothy did so, there was no answer.” On the following night Dorothy got a call from Mr. Rivers telling her that he would call on her the following day. More from Hunt’s Undercover; “Dorothy now expressed to me her great dissatisfaction at the role she had been asked to undertake by Mr. Rivers. It was he who had solicited budget figures from her; they had been agreed to, yet the payments had never been fully met. Now Dorothy was dealing with ‘a friend of Mr. Rivers,’ and she felt that with the election won, the White House would be less inclined to live up to its assurances.” Mr. Rivers had met with Dorothy several times in the last months and according to him had given her a total of $150, 000 in four installments. I wonder who was this new person, this friend of Mr. Rivers that Dorothy was having to deal with now. I never did go on any of these pick-ups, and I stayed home worried if she would come back at all. When we did have time to talk about it she was nervous and unable to hide how creepy she felt picking up keys at airport phone booths or driving down to get packages or keys from lockers in the old decrepit Greyhound station. She confided that she knew she was being watched and in some cases followed almost all the way back to Witches Island. Privately, she was completely aware of the high risk game she was involved in.

They (Howard and Dorothy) were in a head to head battle with the President of the United States. Blackmail the President? Who would come out the winner?) Howard eventually called Colson directly and made a plea and a threat saying that “this was a two way street,” and that all of the Watergate defendants had behaved manfully even though the promised money had not been forthcoming. The phone call ended with my father feeling that the White House was washing its hands of them. Some days earlier Dorothy had suggested to me that she fly to her cousins’ home in suburban Chicago and deliver Christmas presents she had selected for them, their children and their daughter’s in-law. While there, she said, she would like to leave $10, 000 in cash with Hal Carlstead for investment. For sometime she and I had been discussing our financial future and had decided that we would invest a portion of our savings in a motel management company formed by Carlstead and some of his associates. A $10, 000 investment would give us an equity in a company controlling two already-built Holiday Inns in the Chicago area and a third under construction. Granted the investment was relatively small, still, I had been jobless for six months, and my prospects for future employment were, to say the least, diminished. Perhaps the investment would enable me to work in some capacity at one of the Holiday Inns after my trial. Her plane reservations to Chicago was on United Airlines flight 553 to Chicago’s Midway Airport, with a return on Sunday the tenth. There had been no economy-class seats available, so while she was in the process of making reservations, she turned to me and said, “Could I travel first class, Papa, just this once?” At this point I want to clear up some of the untruths that have long since become fact. First of all, Dorothy always traveled first class. Secondly, she had purchased the seat next to her on this flight. Thirdly, it is absolutely ridiculous that a measly $10, 000 was enough to buy into anything as serious as an interest in a Holiday Inn, let alone two or three of them, cousins or not. In Nixon’s world, this money was to be paid to Hunt for his continued silence. For others not accustomed to blackmail, there was another way of handling things.

According to White House tapes, “Dean later told the President that Mrs. Hunt had gone to Chicago to pass that money to one of the Cubans, to meet him in Chicago.” Stevens informed the FBI that Dorothy Hunt was traveling to see him to ensure his silence. Just after the crash, and in fear of his life, Stevens notified the FBI of threats made to him by persons unknown who claimed that Dorothy Hunt’s death was a homicide. These persons unknown mentioned the death of Mrs. Hunt in their threats to him. In addition to the $10, 000 that Dorothy carried with her, she also had a suitcase full of incriminating evidence with which to continue pressuring the White House for hush money. This evidence consisted of canceled checks drawn on the account of CREEP and laundered through a Mexican bank in the account of Bernard Barker, one of the Watergate defendants and a close personal friend of our family. A week before the fatal crash Howard Hunt had sent a letter to a CREEP attorney, stating that “The Watergate bugging is only one of a number of highly illegal conspiracies engaged in by one or more of the defendants at the behest of senior White House officials. These as yet undisclosed crimes can be proven.” So many others were aware of the blackmailing and hush money payments. Nixon as we have shown, had no problem paying off Hunt. His concerns dated from many years before Watergate. The Mafia was also aware of the blackmailing scheme by the Hunt’s and were looking for any angle – someway of controlling Nixon – and all the President’s men were advising Nixon not to pay off Hunt. At midday an attorney who was a partner of Hal’s in the motel management firm joined us to use his good offices with the Chicago police and coroner. I told him that Dorothy was traveling with $10, 000 in cash for the investment and had perhaps $700 in her purse besides. He suggested I sketch some of the jewelry she was wearing, and I did: wedding ring, family signet ring, engagement ring and finally a large solitaire diamond that had been my mother’s.

The United Airlines passenger agent who had given us his card seemed to be unavailable and we could get no information from other United offices. It was a long ride through gathering dusk to the ugly and solitary old building, and when our party had identified itself, we sat down for a long wait. Finally a functionary returned with a plastic bag containing scorched jewelry. This he emptied onto a table and I stared at it unbelieving. Everything I had sketched was there – except my mother’s diamond solitaire. Flight 533 left Washington DC for Omaha, Nebraska stopping in Chicago. Approaching Midway the pilot was instructed by the control tower to execute a “missed approach” pattern. The pilot applied full power to go around for another landing attempt. At 2:27 p.m., 1.5 miles from the airport, Flight 533 hit the branches of trees on the south side of 71st Street. It then hit the roofs of a number of neighborhood bungalows before plowing into the home of Mrs. Veronica Kuculich at 3722 70th Place, demolishing the home and killing her and a daughter, Theresa. The plane burst into flames killing a total of 45 persons, 43 of them on the plane, including the pilot and first and second officers. Eighteen passengers survived. Among the passengers killed were U.S. Representative George Collins (7th), a former 24th Ward Alderman, and Mrs. Dorothy Hunt. Her husband, E. Howard Hunt, had been indicted on charges of conspiring to break into the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. Found in the debris was a purse belonging to Mrs. Hunt containing $10, 585 in cash. There was immediate concern that the money might be linked to the financial dealings surrounding the Nixon “slush fund” to which defendants in the Watergate case had access and that the crash therefore might be linked to sabotage. In the end sabotage was ruled out, but the mystery surrounding the money and the deaths of such prominent, politically connected individuals insured a very thorough investigation.

I felt as if all the air had been sucked out of my lungs and I gasped for breath. Still no answer. My room had no windows, and yet, I could see her sitting there as if she were the light. I waited for her to say something. I felt almost tranquil, knowing that the image I was seeing was not of this realm, yet I had no way of knowing the horror that I would awaken to. Her image wavered as if a soft rippling on the surface of water. isa, Kevan, David and me waited at home all afternoon for word from the crash site stating if Dorothy was a survivor or Lif she was dead. None of us had even the slightest thought that this could have been murder. Once Howard identified the charred remains, he phoned us and told us the terrible news. What more could we be asked to endure? I wondered. She was the strength in our family. With Howard almost surely going to prison, we at least had the comfort of knowing that our mother would be there. I found Julia very easy to work with and she remains an inspiration to journalists everywhere. An interesting fact is that December 8, is the same day John Lennon was murdered and October 9th, (my fathers birthday) is John Lennon’s birthday. So, my mother died on the same day as John Lennon died, and my father was born on the same day as John Lennon was born! E. Howard Hunt threatened to reveal details of who paid him to organize the Watergate break-in. Dorothy Hunt took part in the negotiations with Charles Colson. According to investigator Sherman Skolnick, Hunt also had information on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He argued that if “Nixon didn’t pay heavy to suppress the documents they had showing he was implicated in the planning and carrying out, by the FBI and the CIA, of the political murder of President Kennedy” On 15th November, Colson met with Richard Nixon, H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman at Camp David to discuss Howard Hunt’s blackmail threat. John N. Mitchell was also getting worried by Dorothy Hunt’s threats, and he asked John Dean to use a secret White House fund to “get the Hunt situation settled down.” Eventually it was arranged for Frederick LaRue to give Hunt about $250, 000 to buy his silence.

However, on 8th December, 1972, Dorothy Hunt had a meeting with Michelle Clark, a journalist working for CBS. According to Sherman Skolnick, Clark was working on a story on the Watergate case: “Ms Clark had lots of insight into the bugging and cover-up through her boyfriend, a CIA operative.” Also with Hunt and Clark was Chicago Congressman George Collins. Dorothy Hunt, Michelle Clark and George Collins took the Flight 533 from Washington to Chicago. The aircraft hit the branches of trees close to Midway Airport: “It then hit the roofs of a number of neighborhood bungalows before plowing into the home of Mrs. Veronica Kuculich at 3722 70th Place, demolishing the home and killing her and a daughter, Theresa. The plane burst into flames killing a total of 45 persons, 43 of them on the plane, including the pilot and first and second officers. Eighteen passengers survived.” Hunt, Clark and Collins were all killed in the accident. Just before Dorothy Hunt boarded the aircraft she purchased $250, 000 in flight insurance payable to E. Howard Hunt. In his book Undercover (1974) Hunt claims he was unaware that his wife planned to do this. In the book he also tried to explain what his wife was doing with $10, 000 in her purse. According to Hunt it was money to be invested with Hal Carlstead in “two already-built Holiday Inns in the Chicago area.” The following month E. Howard Hunt pleaded guilty to burglary and wiretapping and eventually served 33 months in prison. Hunt kept his silence although another member of the Watergate team, James W. McCord, wrote a letter to Judge John J. Sirica claiming that the defendants had pleaded guilty under pressure (from John Dean and John N. Mitchell) and that perjury had been committed. The airplane crash was blamed on equipment malfunctions. Carl Oglesby (The Yankee and Cowboy War) has pointed out that the day after the crash, White House aide Egil Krogh was appointed Undersecretary of Transportation, supervising the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Association – the two agencies charged with investigating the airline crash. A week later, Nixon’s deputy assistant Alexander P. Butterfield was made the new head of the FAA.

Barbara Morris Freed also raised several issues in her article, “Flight 553: The Watergate Murder?” Freed claimed that Attorney General John N. Mitchell was under investigation for corruptly helping the El Paso Natural Gas Company against its main competitor, the Northern Natural Gas Company. Mitchell’s decision to drop anti-trust charges was worth an estimated $300 million to El Paso. Ralph Blodgett and James W. Kreuger, two attorneys working for Northern Natural Gas Company in the investigation of Mitchell, were both killed in the crash. Freed also claimed that just hours after the crash an anonymous call was made to the WBBM Chicago (CBS) talk show. The caller described himself as a radio ham who had monitored ground control’s communications with 553, and he reported an exchange concerning gross control tower error or sabotage. CBS, the employer of Michelle Clark, kept this information from the authorities investigating the accident. One FBI agent went straight to Midway’s control tower and confiscated the tape containing information concerning the crash. The FBI did this before the NTSB could act – a unique and illegal intervention. Freed also pointed out that FBI agents were at the scene of the crash before the Fire Department, which received a call within one minute of the crash. The FBI later claimed that 12 agents reached the scene of the crash. Later it was revealed that there were over 50 agents searching through the wreckage. It was completely irregular for the FBI to get involved in investigating a crash until invited in by the National Transportation Safety Board. The FBI director justified this action because it considered the accident to have been the result of sabotage. That raises two issues: (i) How were they able to get to the crash scene so quickly? (ii) Why did they believe Flight 553 had been a case of possible sabotage? Freed does not answer these questions. However, it could be argued that it is possible to answer both questions with the same answer. The FBI had been told that Flight 553 was going to crash as it landed in Chicago. There are a couple of points I will address: on this flight, Dorothy took out an insurance policy for wrongful death for $250, 000.00 (two hundred and fifty thousand) dollars. Why? Why on this flight? She had been flying around the country many times to deliver the hush money payments to the Cubans, why would she take out an insurance policy on this flight?

I feel that Dorothy knew that there was a possibility of her being murdered. She told me several times she knew that someone or some persons had watched her during her pick ups, and she had the distinct feeling she was not only being watched, but followed practically all the way back to our home in Potomac. As the demands for money increased, the Nixon crew searched for ways to back down from the promises they had made. With Nixon having been the instigator in plots with the Mafia to kill Castro and later newspaper columnist Jack Anderson, (my father and Liddy had drawn up plans to have Anderson killed), do you think it’s beyond possibility that Nixon or his aides held covert talks discussing various options for keeping Hunt quiet? I don’t think so. It is very clear that in the days prior to the crash, when Howard sent the threat (“The Watergate bugging is only one of a number of highly illegal conspiracies engaged in by one or more of the defendants at the behest of senior White House officials. These as yet undisclosed crimes can be proved”), the boiling point had been reached. 2. The papers kept in Hunt’s office were seen as their “insurance.” According to Freed, L. Patrick Gray did not get all these papers. Roy H. Sheppard took most of them. Sheppard claimed he burned them at the city dump in November 1972, but Jack Anderson claimed they were returned to Hunt in August 1972. 6. It was completely irregular for the FBI to get involved in investigating a crash until invited in by the NTSB. The FBI director justified this action because it considered the accident to have been the result of sabotage. That raises two issues: (i) How were they able to get to the crash scene so quickly?

However, I would argue that it is possible to answer both questions with the same answer. The FBI had been told that Flight 553 was going to crash as it landed in Chicago. 9. Within days, Nixon appointed Egil Krogh to the position of Undersecretary of Transportation. Egil Krogh was a Nixon loyalist and one of three White House officials that were Howard Hunt’s superiors in the secret “plumbers” team that carried out all of Nixon’s illegal activities. The other two being Attorney General John Mitchell and Special Counsel to the President, Charles Colson. 10.

The Department of Transportation oversees the National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB) which is the sole investigating unit for airline crashes. Therefore Krogh was in a position to not only guide the investigation, but also to include or exclude pertinent information about the crash, and keep Nixon informed as to the particulars of the investigation. 11. On the flight were several persons related to bribery and corruption deals with the White house. Attorney General John N. Mitchell was under investigation for corruptly helping the El Paso Natural Gas Company against its main competitor, the Northern Natural Gas Company. Mitchell’s decision to drop anti-trust charges was worth an estimated $300 million to El Paso. Ralph Blodgett and James W.

Just hours after the crash an anonymous call was made to a WBBM Chicago (CBS) talk show. The caller described himself as a radio ham who had monitored ground control’s communications with 553, and he reported an exchange concerning gross control tower error or sabotage. CBS, Michelle Clark’s employer, kept this information from the authorities investigating the accident. Our investigative team assigned to this accident discovered on the day following the accident that several FBI agents had taken a number of non-typical actions relating to this accident within the first few hours following the accident. Included were: for the first time in the memory of our staff, an FBI agent went to the control tower and listened to the tower tapes before our investigators had done so; and for the-first time to our knowledge, in connection with an aircraft accident, an FBI agent interviewed witnesses to the crash, including flight attendants on the aircraft prior to the NTSB interviews. As I am sure you can understand, these actions, particularly with respect to this flight on which Mrs. E. Howard Hunt was killed, have raised innumerable questions in the minds of those with legitimate interests in ascertaining the cause of this accident. Included among those who have asked questions, for example, is the Government Activities Subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee. FBI has primary investigative jurisdiction in connection with the Destruction of Aircraft or Motor Vehicles (DAMV) Statute, Title 18, Section 32, U.S. Code, which pertains to the willful damaging, destroying or disabling of any civil aircraft in interstate, overseas or foreign air commerce.

The fact that Mrs. E. Howard Hunt was aboard the plane was unknown to the FBI at the time our investigation was instituted. It has been longstanding FBI policy to immediately proceed to the scene of an airplane crash for the purpose of developing any information indicating a possible Federal violation within the investigative jurisdiction of the FBI. In all such instances liaison is immediately, established with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) personnel upon their arrival at the scene. Approximately 50 FBI Agents responded to the crash scene, the first ones arriving within 45 minutes of the crash.… The FBI’s investigation in this matter was terminated within 20 hours of the accident and on December 11, 1972. (End of letter.) I also uncovered another interesting mystery. In my mother’s wallet, there was a slip of paper with the name of Dr. Gary Morris. He was treating my mother for pain and stress, using hypnosis. Earlier in March, 1972, Dr. Morris and wife just completely vanished. I mean no trace. Down in the Ca - ribbean, no bodies or boat parts were found. There may be a connection. If the forces that arranged her death thought, even for one second that Morris may be privy to things my mother knew, (under a doctor patient privilege), they would not hesitate to tie up loose ends. Why would she be carrying a slip of paper with his name on it, presumably in her handwriting? Did someone give it to her as a threat? (What happened to him will happen to you etc.) Was she trying to uncov - er facts about his death? Strange. I think she knew there was only one way that this epic battle against much stronger and heartless forces would turn out. It is clear that she was facing prison, possibly for many years, as an accessory to the crimes she committed in defense of her husband and family. Her freedom was quickly coming to an end.

At our home we received guests for the services of her funeral. The setting at St. Gabriel was beautiful and lonely. At the intersection of Great Falls Rd. and River Rd., where the narrative of this book started out, coming from Potomac Village, you turn right onto Great Falls Rd. and after a mile you’ll see the sign on the right side of the road that says St. Gabriel Roman Catholic Cemetery. Turn up the narrow black top road and park your car. Walk down into the graveyard about 50 steps and you’ll see her marker; Dorothy L. Hunt 1920-1972. After our reunion Mona and me managed to find Dorothy’s grave on the way back to Dulles Airport. We also stopped by the old Witches Island house on River Road, and the occupants were nice enough to let us walk through the house. It remains very much how I remembered it. The pigeon coop in the back where I rehearsed my band was gone, the little rabbit hutch where I spent long nights with my then girlfriend Drew was gone, but the rest was there. It all seemed so surreal.… Here was the happiest moment of my childhood and at the same time the most hurtful too. I could feel Mama’s energy in the woods that surrounded and protected our home. She was there, alive, laughing, crying, living, and breathing. Across River Road where we once rode our horses, was now a huge tract development. The pond where David and me fished and I threw my father’s typewriter in was paved over. General Griffith’s mansion at the top of the hill was gone. The ghosts of Potomac. The ghosts of Witches Island. I wonder if my mother was a ghost or if she had found peace somewhere over the rainbow. In the end, it was real. It happened. I lived it and she lived it. I miss her now, more than ever and the pages in this book have, at great emotional cost, given me strength. This quest of mine isn’t over, it’s just beginning. Now, to the rest of the story.

This quest of mine isn’t over, it’s just beginning. Now, to the rest of the story. As the despondent Hunt increased his demands for clemency and cash, Nixon was very receptive to the idea. In his diary, Nixon wrote that “Colson told me on Friday that he had tried to do everything he could to keep Hunt in line [to keep] from turning state’s evidence. After what happened to Hunt’s wife, etc., I think we have a very good cause for clemency.” In a taped discussion with Colson, Nixon said on the “Question of clemency – Hunt’s is a simple case. I mean, after all, the man’s wife is dead, was killed; he’s got one child that has–.” Colson added, “Brain damage from an automobile accident.”Nixon said, “We’ll build, we’ll build that sonofabitch up like nobody’s business. We’ll have [William] Buckley write a column and say, you know, that he, he should have clemency.” Colson met with Hunt’s lawyer, William Bittman … on January 3, and the next day told the lawyer that he had spoken to ‘people’ about Hunt’s plight.” According to Dean, “on January 5 Colson met with him and Ehrlichman … and reported that they had indeed given Bittman a ‘general assurance’ that Hunt would get clemency” from Nixon. The next day, according to the FBI, Colson got the Mafia-Teamster bribe of $500, 000 for Nixon. The clemency message was conveyed to Hunt, who was willing “to plead guilty but would do so only if he got a White House promise of executive clemency.” The White House wanted the guilty plea to avoid a potentially problematic trial, and that’s what Hunt gave them. In addition, he convinced Barker and the other exile defendants, and Fiorini, to plead guilty as well, “to seven charges of conspiracy, burglary, and wiretapping.” It’s interesting that Hunt received special treatment from Nixon over the other defendants, with the President saying in a conversation with Colson on January 8. 1973, that when it came to clemen- Hunt told him, “I am going to be sentenced Friday, and I’ve got to be able to get my financial affairs in order.” Howard Hunt backed up this request with a threat. “I will bring John Ehrlichman down to his knees and put him in jail. I have done enough seamy things for he and [Egil] Krogh that they’ll never survive it.” This is the famous tape of March 21, 1973 where Nixon replies, “We could get that … if you need the money … you could get the money.… What I mean is, you could, you could get a million dollars.

I, I know where it could be gotten … I mean it’s not easy, but it could be done.… We can’t provide the clemency, but we, the money can be provided.” For me, finding out that William F. Buckley was a pill addict laid to rest a memory of the time when Buckley read me the riot act for writing about his godchildren in Rolling Stone. Titled “Life Without Father,” the piece interviewed E. Howard Hunt’s children Lisa and Saint John. It was the first behind- the-scenes piece published on Watergate. In it, the children spoke frankly of their painful dealings with their father. This was too close to the bone for William F. Buckley to bear. He phoned me at my parents’ house over Christmas and gave me a real tongue-lashing. I countered by asking him exactly how close he really was to the children. Not very—I already knew the answer. Buckley sputtered in outrage that I dared to question him. It seems easy now to picture his icy demeanor being fed by a handful of pills. The pills would support his conviction that he was king of the mountain. I found Julia a very sympathetic journalist in a very delicate situation. She practically lived with Lisa and I for two weeks and her account is worth reading. She’s the only person I have ever revealed such deep sorrow and anger, and we became close in an emotional way that’s hard to explain. I would very much like to see Julia again just for the sake that she was there when this all happened. It was clear, we could do nothing. The powers had come and taken a little boy, a child, who had just lost his mother. I can’t imagine anything so heartless and callous as that. For David, it was the end of everything, the end of innocence. The end of trust. I would not see my baby brother for many years, and to this day there is a rage that comes over me when I think of this. It wasn’t until 2005 when I was down in Miami with my father that I had a conversation with Bill Snyder about those horrible days. Snyder was gloating over his success at driving a wedge of distrust between me and my father.

I’ll tell you something that I bet you didn’t know about your dad … he never sold the house.” My Godfather, William F. Buckley Jr., aka “Uncle Bill” who was recruited into the CIA in the 1950’s by my father, E. Howard Hunt, who later called upon Buckley to evict my sister Lisa and me, and kidnap my brother David. In the last ten years of his life, Buckley would send Lisa a thousand dollars every Christmas. That fall when the leaves gave way to winter and the wind whipped the piles of raked leaves into little twisters across the lawn of Witches Island, when the bare branches of the trees, lit from the headlights of passing cars, seemed to turn into bony fingers reaching up as if to claw out the stars, we sat alone in our home, our house, surrounded by boxes half full or half empty and dared to struggle through each moment of desperation. I took my band and girlfriend to live on a farm in the middle of Wisconsin, North of Milwaukee, in a small dairy community of hippies and farmers called Iola, population 600. We stayed with a friend of Drew’s who lived in a small farm house with a porch that went around three sides of it and sat atop a small hill overlooking miles and miles of corn fields. I had never lived in ten feet of snow before. Our little wooden farm house lay unprotected from the wrath of winter, and the snow piled up against its sides twenty feet. We had to dig a tunnel to get out. We ran out of money and when the propane ran out, we had no heat. It was freezing us, the cold, was unbearable. All the water pipes froze and burst, as did our houseplants and cuttings on the window ledges. Our friend had a bow and a few arrows and after several hunting expeditions in the deep and snowy woods, we bagged one, a small buck. We skinned it and cooked it on our small kitchen stove.

When that ran out we took to shooting pigeons in the barn with the shot gun I had kept from my National Parks trip I took the summer of Watergate. That spring we hooked up with a talent agency who booked us in every two-cent-dive bar and bowling alley in Wisconsin and Illinois. We even drove to Lexington Kentucky and played in a redneck bowling alley for two weeks. It reminded me of Texas … hippie with a shotgun all over again. The insurance policy that Dorothy had taken out on that murderous flight was coming to its conclusion. Each of us kids were to receive thirty three thousand dollars, except David who was to get ninety thousand. The money would not be released until all the children signed papers. Howard signed for David, and Lisa and Kevan had already signed. It was left up to me to sign and the money would be released. Easy right? Not really. I had a big problem with taking money from my mother’s death. I had been studying Lao Tzu and reading Carlos Through out all that time I stayed close to my father visiting him every couple years when he moved to Miami, Florida. He remarried in the late seventies after spending 33 months in prison; one of the longest sentences of all the Watergate people. Nixon of course resigned rather than face impeachment. Slowly the Watergate participants have passed on. At the very end of his life Papa talked to me about my mother’s death. He confessed that he had thought that her death was a homicide but was too afraid to say anything. He confessed to being afraid that his children would be killed. He confessed to having involvement in the JFK assassination. He confessed that Dorothy had been in a losing battle with the President of the United States of America. My first book, Bond of Secrecy was published in 2012, and I began working on this one. The hardest story of my life. I want to write about the children of spies.

So began the first investigation into the possibility that Dorothy and the rest of the passengers on United Flight 553 were murdered. Skolnick was not some kook. His investigations had caused the resignation of two Illinois Supreme Court justices, Roy Solfisburg Jr., and Ray Klinbiel after he exposed that they had accepted bribes. In 1973 he started writing his book called “The Secret History of Airplane Sabotage.” An extensive chapter was devoted to flight 553. He detailed a flawed and corrupt investigation by the NTSB (National Transportation and Safety Board), suppression of evidence which pointed to foul play, and many other lies and distortions some of which I have already listed for the reader.

He also stated that a Chicagoan named Lawrence T. O’Connor had received a phone cal from someone he knew with White House connections, telling him not to take that flight to Chicago. Also on that flight, according to Skolnick was a reputed “hit man” pursuing Dorothy Hunt. The man’s name was Harold Metcalf and he was a Narcotics official with Drug Abuse Law Enforcement (DALE). Metcalf told the pilot of his status and that he was carrying a gun and was assigned seat B-17, near the stewardesses jump seat near the food galley at the back of the plane. In testimony for the NTSB hearings he acknowledged his official position as a drug enforcement agent and that he had indeed been armed. (NTSB Docket SA-435, Exhibit 6-B page 17). After the crash he simply walked out of the rear of the plane with little damage. Recent files have shown that whoever this man was, he was not who he said he was and his identity may or may not have been a cover. At the hearings Skolnick confronted Metcalf and asked him whether he knew the plane was sabotaged. At this Metcalf blurted out “It was not supposed to…” and turned and walked quickly away. It has been speculated by a former Military Intelligence Investigator that Metcalf was a “double cut out,” someone who carries out an assassination and then they themselves are murdered. Sound familiar? So who could have murdered my mother? Nixon’s mafia-Teamster connections, the CIA to keep Howard Hunt from exposing the CIA’s involvement in Watergate, or others still in the shadows? The facts that I have outlined in the aftermath of the crash clearly are too numerous to be mere coincidence. I hope someday the truth will come out, just as I do the Kennedy assassination, the killing of Martin Luther King, Bobby Kennedy, members of the Black Panther Party, members of AIM, the American Indian Movement and all persons who pose a perceived threat to the people in power whether they be Government, Mafia or your local police. n November, 1972, Richard M.

In 1973, I wrote a book, “The Secret History of Airplane Sabotage.” So far as I could find out, there never was an authoritative book on the subject up to that time. And even now, I know of no other such book. A sizable book publisher undertook to publish my work. The book, however, was stopped in the print cycle and no copies became available. The book was suppressed by the Rockefellers, at the time the major owners of UAL, Inc., the parent firm of United Air Lines, with the United Air Lines crash near Midway Airport being a major section of the book. 1. THE PEOPLE. Upwards of twelve persons connected in one way or another with Watergate, boarded United Air Lines Flight 553 on the afternoon of December 8, 1972. They had something in common. That week there had been a gas pipeline lobbyists meeting as part of the American Bar Association meeting in Washington, D.C. It was conducted by Roger Moreau. His secretary was Nancy Parker. Among those attending were Ralph Blodgett and James W. Krueger, both attorneys for the Northern Natural Gas Co., of Omaha, Nebraska. Associated with them were Lon Bayer, attorney for Kansas-Nebraska Natural Gas Co.; Wilbur Erickson, president, Federal Land Bank in Omaha. This was a belligerent group determined to blow the lid off the Watergate case. Reason Former U.S. Attorney General, John Mitchell, and his friends running the Justice Department were putting the spear into Northern Natural Gas. Some officials of that firm and its subsidiaries were indicted on federal criminal charges, September 7, 1972, in Omaha, Chicago, and Hammond, Indiana. Charge bribery of local officials in Northwest Indiana to let the gas pipeline go through. (Chicago Daily News, 9/8/72). To blackmail their way out of these charges, the Omaha firm had uncovered documents showing that Mitchell, while U.S. Attorney General in 1969, dropped anti-trust charges against a competitor of Northern Natural Gas – El Paso Gas Co.

To blackmail their way out of these charges, the Omaha firm had uncovered documents showing that Mitchell, while U.S. Attorney General in 1969, dropped anti-trust charges against a competitor of Northern Natural Gas – El Paso Gas Co. The dropping of the charges against El Paso was worth 300 million dollars. A spokesman for Mitchell belatedly claimed, in March, 1973, that Mitchell had “disqualified” himself in 1969, because Mitchell’s law partner represented El Paso. The Justice Department under Mitchell, dropped the charges. Period. About the same time, Mitchell, through a law partner as nominee, got a stock interest in El Paso. Gas and oil interests, such as El Paso, Gulf Resources, and others contributed heavily to Nixon’s spy fund, supervised by Mitchell. Pipeline official Krueger was carrying the Mitchell-El Paso documents on the plane. He had told his wife that he had in his possession irreplaceable papers of a sensitive nature. For months after the crash, his widow demanded, to no avail, that United Air Lines turn over to her his briefcase. It later came out in the pipeline trial in Hammond, that Blodgett had been browbeating federal officials, to drop the criminal charges just prior to the crash. (Chicago Tribune, 5/18/73.) [Our investigation uncovered that most of the local officials, to be government witnesses against the pipeline, were murdered just prior to trial. In all, some five Northwest Indiana officials.] Dorothy Hunt, Watergate pay-off woman, who offered executive clemency directly on behalf of Nixon to some of the Watergate defendants, was seeking to leave the U.S. with over 2 million Dollars in cash and negotiables that she had gotten from CREEP, Committee to Re-Elect the President. [She was so concerned about these valuables, she purchased a separate first class seat next to her on the plane for this luggage.] She and her husband, E. Howard Hunt, the Watergate conspirator, were a “C.I.A. couple,” two agents “married” and living together. Early in December, 1972,both were threatening to blow the lid off the White House if (a) he wasn’t freed of the criminal charges; (b) Nixon didn’t pay heavy to suppress the documents they had showing he was implicated in the planning and carrying out, by the FBI and the CIA, of the political murder of President Kennedy; and (c) Dorothy and Howard Hunt didn’t both get several million dollars. Some of these details are in the Memo of Watergate double-agent, James McCord, a CIA official in charge of the Agency’s physical security; details before the Senator Ervin Committee. (N.Y.

Times, 5/9/73.) Hunt claimed, according to McCord, to have the data necessary to impeach Nixon. McCord said matters were coming to a head early in December, 1972. Mrs. Hunt was unhappy with her job of going all over the country to bribe defendants and witnesses in the bugging case. She wanted out. Mrs. Hunt was on the way to arrange to take her money out of the country, possibly Costa Rica, to link up with international swindler Robert Vesco who was there at the time; through Harold C. Carlstead, whose wife was Mrs. Hunt’s cousin. Carlstead reportedly did accounting and tax work for mobster-owned businesses in the Chicago-area. He operated two Holiday Inn motels in Chicago’s south suburbs – at 174th and Torrence, Lansing, Illinois and at 171st and Halsted, Harvey, Illinois. Carlstead’s motel on Torrence was reportedly a favorite hang out for gangsters and dope traffickers such as apparently “Cool” Freddie Smith, Grover Barnes, and the late Chicago mobster Sam DeStefano (who aided the American CIA in bloody tricks and was snuffed out to silence him), to name a few. Mrs. Hunt had (a) Ten Thousand Dollars in untraceable cash; (b) Forty Thousand Dollars in so-called “Barker” bills, traceable to Watergate spy Bernard Barker; and (c) upwards of Two Million Dollars in American Express money orders, travelers checks, and postal money orders. (As shown by testimony before the National Transportation Safety Board, re-opened Watergate plane crash hearings, June 13-14, 1973. Hearings re-opened as a result of my lawsuit claiming sabotage covered up by the N.T.S.B.) Carlstead issued a fake “cover” story that had (only) Ten Thousand Dollars with Mrs. Hunt. A story swallowed up by the Establishment Press. Mrs. Hunt got on Flight 553 with Michele Clark, CBS Network newswoman, going to do an exclusive story on Watergate. Mrs. Hunt, Mitchell, Nixon – the story could have destroyed Nixon at the time. Ms Clark had lots of insight into the bugging and cover-up through her boyfriend, a CIA operative. In the summer of 1972, prior to any major revelations of Watergate, Ms Clark tried to pick the brains of Chicago Congressman George Collins, regarding the bugging of the Democratic headquarters. Ms Clark was sitting with Cong. Collins on the plane. (Testimony 6/14/73, of Cong. Collins’ public relations director.)

Later, the mortician was murdered in his business establishment, an unsolved crime. (We interviewed close confidants of her family who informed us of the details how CBS applied tremendous pressure and offered large sums for silence on the crash details and having her body cremated contrary to her family’s wishes.) For many years, like clockwork, one Chicagoan went to Washington, D.C. on Monday and came back Friday afternoon on Flight 553 or its equivalent Lawrence T. O’Connor, Apt. 5-C, 999 North Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, Illinois. On Friday, December 8, 1972, he received a call from someone he knows in the White House, telling him not to take Flight 553 but to go instead to a special meeting. Also getting on Flight 553 was a reputed “hit-man,” pursuing Mrs. Hunt and others, and going under the “cover” of being a top Narcotics official with DALE (Drug Abuse Law Enforcement). He used the name Harold R. Metcalf. He is an unusual “narc”; he worked directly for Nixon. Metcalf told the pilot he was packing a gun, and so Metcalf was assigned seat B-17, near the stewardesses’ jump seat and also near the food galley and the rear door of the plane. After the crash, he walked out of the cracked open fuselage of the pancaked plane wearing a jumpsuit. A former Military Intelligence investigator, who used his credentials to get into the crash site, identified the person posing as “Harold Metcalf” as an overseas CIA parachute spy. (Investigator’s testimony at re-opened N.T.S.B. hearings, 6/14/73). Also see Metcalf ’s statement about being a “narc” and his gun on the plane. (N.T.S.B. Docket SA-435, Exhibit 6- B, p. 17, surviving passenger statements). Metcalf evidently supervised certain foul play, possibly cyanide, directed at certain passengers, but he didn’t know of the over all sabotage plan. One of our staff investigators confronted Metcalf about a week after the crash. (a) Metcalf, supposedly a government narcotics bigshot, knows nothings about dope. (b) in response to our question, “Did you know the plane was sabotaged?,” he blurted out half a sentence, “It was not supposed to….,” turning purple, he then left the room.

A decade ago, one estimate, printed in Reader’s Digest in July 1982, was that “approximately 100,000 children are unaccounted for” each year. That number sounds too high, but nobody knows what the true figure is, because the FBI does not keep count. Gunderson observes: “The FBI has an accurate count of the number of automobiles stolen every year. It knows the number of homicides, rapes, and robberies, but the FBI has no idea of the number of children who disappear every year. They simply do not ask for the statistics. Every month, every major police department in the United States files its uniform crime statistics with the FBI. It would be simple for the bureau to add one more column to the statistics and get a breakdown of every reported case of missing children-not to even mention children who are kidnaped for ritualistic purposes, and, in some cases, murdered. I am convinced that the FBI does not ask for these statistics because they do not want to see them. They would be confronted with an instant public outcry for action, because the figures would show a major social problem. That problem would demand action.” National media interest in the case flickered in 1988, when the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union was raided by federal agencies and shut down. Franklin’s manager was Lawrence E. (Larry) King, Jr., then 44, a rising star in state and national Republican circles, an officer of the National Black Republican Council. King sang the national anthem at the GOP national conventions in 1984 and 1988. Nearly $40 million was missing from the coffers of the small, ostensibly community-oriented credit union. The financial scandal turned into something more, when it became known that children from Omaha and its surroundings said they had been flown from city to city, to be abused at parties held by Franklin’s officers and well-known Nebraskans, including nationally prominent Republican Party activists. \"A Lurid, Three years later, people living outside eastern Nebraska are unlikely to be aware of the Franklin scandal, and those in the region have been told that the case is closed.

Law enforcement at the local, state and federal levels said there was no evidence of drug-peddling, organized child abuse, or satanic activity by King. The allegations of child abuse were “a carefully crafted hoax,” according to one of the two grand juries that examined the affair. A chief witness, Owen, stands convicted of perjury. This book will explore the substance of the Franklin case, much of which has never been revealed to the public until now. That means evidence concerning key players, which apparently was never brought before, or was ignored by, the grand juries. It means evidence gathered for the Nebraska Legislature’s special committee on the Franklin case, which found and verified the tracks of criminal activity, where law enforcement purported to see none. The legislative investigation, which began in November 1988, ended on January 9, 1991, when a new Legislature was sworn into office, and the investigative committee authorized by the previous Legislature was automatically terminated as required by the state constitution. The Legislature had the option to renew the investigation, but did not; many members knew or suspected what the stakes were, and were terrified. I write about the unfolding of the Franklin case, its exposure and its cover-up, as not only an eyewitness, but a participant in these events. I knew how high Larry King’s reach went; I was sitting in the front row, just fifteen feet from the main podium, at the 1984 and 1988 Republican national conventions, duly elected by the people of the State of Nebraska as a delegate, pledged, in the first instance, to Ronald Reagan and, in 1988, to George Bush. I was there, as the story of the Franklin Credit Union and the child abuse broke in Nebraska. I wrote the “DeCamp memo” in 1990, which marked a new phase of the case. I will describe events in which I personally was involved. Most of these have never been made public, and it has pained me tremendously at times, when I knew that the Omaha World-Herald was saying something false or distorting a fact, that I had no forum or no legal right to respond, because I had to protect a client or honor a legal privilege. As an attorney, furthermore, I have some specialization in cases of allegations by youngsters against adults in the area of child abuse. It has been my policy and belief, as it is now, that there is nothing worse than child abuse, with the possible exception of falsely accusing people of child abuse.

It has been my policy and belief, as it is now, that there is nothing worse than child abuse, with the possible exception of falsely accusing people of child abuse. Just in the past year, I have overturned two felony charges against individuals in rural Nebraska, who were charged with abusing their daughters, based on allegations from the daughters. I was convinced the girls were not telling the truth. I successfully proved this in both cases, and the girls broke down and told the whole story as to why they had lied. The files of the Legislature’s main investigator, the late Gary Caradori, testify to the mass of leads law enforcement would not pursue. Documentary evidence presented in this book, never before made public, makes it possible to contrast the assurances of local and state officials that there was little or no Franklin-related abuse, with what those agencies had in their own files. The chapters of this book dealing with Franklin are based, apart from my direct experience, strictly on documents available and documented facts. I do not claim to know the accuracy or veracity of every statement made by every witness or other person, recorded in these documents. I do claim, however, that the statements and the evidence were officially presented exactly as described. Readers can draw their own conclusions, as to what is or is not believable. I also must state, that I received none of the Franklin committee documentation from the committee’s chairman, Senator Loran Schmit, other than what I was entitled to as attorney for Paul Bonacci. Some people inevitably will claim, as they did when I issued the DeCamp memo in January 1990, that Senator Schmit, whose private attorney I am, “leaked” everything to me. I said then, and I say now, that nothing could be further from the truth. Neither is anything whatsoever from grand jury documents-some of which I had access to-presented here, because I am not allowed to disclose this information. I wish I could. I wish everything about Franklin could be made public. Then, the public could judge even more thoroughly about what is true and what is false. I believe that sunshine and exposure of all facts from all agencies that have information about Franklin would establish the truth of the stories of drug abuse, child abuse, pedophilia, abuse of positions of public trust, cover-up by institutions of government, and, most tragic, involvement in this conduct and later cover-up by some of our most respected and wealthiest citizens. Otherwise, truth becomes whatever those who control the institutions of government, and the press, say it is.

Otherwise, truth becomes whatever those who control the institutions of government, and the press, say it is. Benjamin Franklin said, “Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech.” For a textbook example of how this can be done, I would say: Come to Nebraska! Watch how when you totally control the press, when you own the press, you can make truth be whatever you want, you can make villains out of heroes, sinners out of saints, and vice versa. In this book, therefore, much of the material has been kept in its documentary form-the words of investigators, state senators, victim-witnesses, parents, police, or FBI, as recorded in police documents, eyewitness reports, testimony to the Legislature, published interviews, and so on. I will allow these documents to speak for themselves. Spelling and punctuation have been left as they appear in documents, except for minor punctuation changes in transcripts. Interpolations in quoted material are denoted by brackets []. When the name of a victim or other person is not his or her real name, it is marked with an asterisk * the first time it appears. The Franklin case, which has dominated political life in Nebraska for three years, has chilling implications for.the whole United States. The unfinished business of the investigation is a matter not only of justice for children in one state, but of the lives of untold numbers of children everywhere. Evidence developed from Franklin and King’s activities leads into drug-trafficking, money-laundering, pornography, child prostitution, and the kidnaping and sale of children in different parts of the United States, and abroad. The shocking treatment of Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci by the courts in Nebraska is one give-away, of what a high stake has been wagered on suppressing the Franklin scandal. Members of the state Senate and investigators who sought to discover the truth of the matter, found that out earlier on, in a personal, violent manner. “If even half of what I have heard is true, this is the biggest thing to ever hit Nebraska,” Gary Caradori told his wife, Sandie, late one night in August 1989. Although he was exhausted, the new chief investigator for the Nebraska Legislature’s Franklin committee did not sleep that night. There was more cause for sleeplessness in the weeks that followed.

Threatening situations have resulted numerous times. Why? Am I too close to something they do not want to become public?” The investigator continued to work, with a growing sense of the importance of his task.On May 29, 1990 Caradori wrote to Franklin committee chairman Loran Schmit. “To be frank,” he told the senator, “it is my opinion that we are the only ones who are seriously working to get this case ‘out in the open,’ so to speak. I honestly feel that should we terminate this investigation that no further work will be done on it.” On June 23, 1990, Caradori took a few hours off to attend a barbecue at the Omaha home of Mary Lyons-Barrett. Most of those present were members of the Concerned Parents, a group of citizens who were outraged about the lack of a serious investigation of child abuse by state or federal authorities, and the campaign in Nebraska’s major newspaper, the Omaha World-Herald, to discredit young victim-witnesses. Arriving in a 1980 white Corvette, Caradori told Concerned Parents president Trish Lanphier he had taken the car out of storage for the day’s drive, because his other vehicles had been tampered with, and he was “sure that no one had ever seen that car.” He was planning to sell his boat for the same reason, but what he most feared, he told Lanphier, was that someone would tamper with the private plane he often flew. “It would be so easy to tamper with a plane.” In early July 1990, Caradori phoned Senator Schmit. “We’ve got them!” he exclaimed about some new evidence he had just developed. “There’s no way they can get out of it now!” He and his son Andrew would be flying to Chicago for the All-Star Game the weekend of July 7-8, he told Schmit. Caradori was going to do a little investigating on the side and would review the new evidence with the senator, upon his return the following Wednesday. On that Wednesday morning, July 11, 1990, Senator Schmit was in his office, talking with a journalist about the Franklin investigation. He related the numerous threats received by himself and Caradori, and Caradori’s evaluation of those threats. “It’s unlikely that they would kill you or me, Loran, because that would be too obvious,” Gary had said once, “But then again, you never know.” It happened at 2 : 30 a.m . on July 11, when Gary and AJ. were flying back to Lincoln,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:4:324754228423", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5710, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "morning, July 11, 1990, Senator Schmit was in his office, talking with a journalist about the Franklin investigation.

A farmer in Lee County, Illinois reported that he saw a flash of light, heard an explosion, and saw a plane plunge to the ground. The Caradoris were killed, the plane’s wreckage scattered over three-quarters of a mile. The eyewitness account of a flash of light and an explosion was on the early edition of television news in Nebraska, but got pulled from subsequent reports, which said that the plane exploded on impact. Gary’s brother Dick Caradori was interviewed by the Lincoln Journal about the many threats Gary had received. “I know that it weighed a lot on his mind,” Dick said. “He always hoped that they just didn’t cover it up. He said there was a lot to it and a lot of big names involved and hoped their money wouldn’t sweep it under the rug.” Gary’s mother, Mary, told the paper that Gary “cared dearly about the people involved in the Franklin case. He worked day and night for them.” What evidence had Caradori turned up? According to the Lincoln Journal the day after Caradori’s death, “Schmit confirmed that Gary Caradori had been trying to obtain pictures that some alleged victims said were taken of them during the period when they were being abused. He also confirmed that Caradori had been told that some of those allegedly involved in child sexual abuse ‘had exposed some of the victims to satanic cultism. He was working on places and times.’” He was also working on leads into Washington, D.C. Mystery surrounded not only the crash of the airplane, but Caradori’s whole trip. Gary and A.J. had stayed at the Days Inn Lakefront Motel in Chicago, where both his wife and his associate Karen J. Ormiston had telephoned, asked for him by name, and spoken with him (their phone bills showed the calls), but motel management would tell Caradori’s investigative firm there was no record of his ever having stayed there. And if there was no record that Caradori had registered at the motel, there was also no record of what phone calls he might have made from Chicago. After months of investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board had not come up with the cause of the crash.

My friend Bill Colby, former director of the CIA, commented after he looked into the matter, that the cause would probably never be known. Mary Caradori rendered her own verdict on the deaths of Gary and AJ.: “My son and grandson were murdered.” Many Nebraskans echoed her opinion. They have growing grounds for suspicion. From late 1988, when the Franklin case first broke into public view, until mid-1991, at least 15 people associated with the case as investigators, alleged perpetrators, or potential witnesses, died sudden deaths, many of them violent. Caradori’s death cast a pall of terror over the state. Civil rights leader Rev. James Bevel, who visited Nebraska in October 1990 as part of a fact-finding commission, said that he had never seen such terror on people’s faces, “not even on the faces of Mississippi Negroes in the 1950s and 1960s,” who lived under the threat of lynchings by the Ku Klux Klan. In this atmosphere, Douglas County and federal grand juries indicted victim-witnesses Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci. The Senate Franklin committee went out of existence on January 9, 1991. On June 21, 1991, Alisha Owen was found guilty, and Douglas County prosecutors dropped the charges against Paul Bonacci. As far as the Nebraska political establishment was concerned, the door on the Franklin case was slammed shut for good. Thousands ofNebraska citizens are concerned that what Gary Caradori uncovered not go with him to the grave. The story of the Franklin Credit Union investigation is intertwined with the systematic cover-up that investigation confronted, from the time of the first cries for help from children six years ago. The first alarm went off on June 10, 1985, when the Washington County, Nebraska, Sheriffs Department contacted a Nebraska Department of Social Services (DSS) social worker handling the case of Sean*, Sally* and Steve McArthur*. The children were living in foster care with Jarrett and Barbara Webb of Fort Calhoun. The Sheriffs department phoned today and stated they have the McArthur children in their custody and they had picked them up from the Webb home due to child abuse complaint. Sean had welts and scratches over parts of his back which he said the Webbs had beat him with a railroad iron and belt. They also had picked up the Webbs’ son Joey*, age 16. Joey also complained of being beaten by his parents. . . . Sean said the Webbs have been beating [them] for quite some time and this is not the first time this has happened to them.

Foster child Sean McArthur and adopted son Joey Patterson* Webb were removed from the Webbs’ custody that month. Other of their foster and adopted children-there were as many as nine in the house at one time-tried to make their break, sometimes alone, sometimes in pairs. In August, Joey’s sister Kimberly Patterson* Webb (age 14) and another brother, Michael*, ran away, but were returned to the Webbs. InNovember, Nelly Patterson* Webb, 16, fled to the home of her grandmother, Ruby Patterson*. Our office and a Deputy interviewed Kimberly [who had obtained permission to visit Nelly at their grandmother’s] and Nelly separately and together. Both girls stated numerous times that they refuse to go back to the Webbs. . .. Both girls have stated they have received “whippings” and “beatings” from both Barbara and Jarrett at different times. These started in 1978, approximately eight months after they moved into the Webb home. The girls said they were hit with objects: an extension cord, a belt, a “black thing,” (rubber hose) and a “railroad prop” (a narrow piece of heavy black rubber approximately two feet long with several holes in each end). Before they were struck, they were made to remove their clothing. They were mainly struck on the back or on the behind, but occasionally on the head or face. Social workers removed Nelly, whose full name was Cornelia M. Patterson* Webb, from the Webb home and placed her with foster parents Ron and Kathleen Sorenson in Blair, Nebraska. Soon after this move, she was interviewed at the Washington County Sheriff’s Office by State Patrol Investigator Jane F. Tooley. Tooley found out that the abuse was not limited to beatings. She stated that she had been sexually abused. . .. Nelly stated that when she was approximately nine or ten years of age, that Jarrett Webb kissed her for a long time and that she pulled away because she couldn’t breathe and it was nasty. She stated that he was french kissing her and she stated that he was slobbering in her mouth….

Nelly stated that when she was 10 and 11 years old, at night time when everyone was in bed, Jarrett Webb called her into his room a couple of times. When she didn’t come into the room he then told her to come in or he would whip her. … She stated that Jarrett Webb pulled the sheet down and pulled her on top of him. . . . She stated that she could feel his hair against her leg and knew that he didn’t have any underwear on. When Nelly was 15, she told Tooley, Jarrett Webb punished her by ordering her to undress and lie on the bed, and then beating her with a rubber strap. Next, he made her lie on her back, put her legs in the air, and “he pressed himself between her legs,” and “started ‘humping her’ …. He started beating her again with the strap…. He then started sucking on her breasts. . .. Nelly stated that she started crying and that Webb left.” Reversing an adoption was not a routine procedure. “Regarding a relinquishment [of adopted children], the Department does not accept one easily,” noted one DSS social worker in her log of the Patterson Webb case. The Webbs insisted on it. Social workers recorded that in January 1986, Barbara Webb “was crying and carrying on,” inquired about “allegations” the girls were making, and wanted “to get relinquishment over with.” Negotiations on behalf of the Webbs were conducted by attorney Gary Randall, whose brother Casey Randall was in the orbit of Larry King’s Franklin Credit Union; Nelly and Kimberly referred to Casey as “Larry’s maid.” Gary Randall arranged the relinquishment with the help of the very official who would have handled a criminal prosecution of the Webbs for child abuse, had there been one at that time-Washington County prosecutor Patrick Tripp. Tripp’s attitude was recorded by Julie Walters, a youth care worker called on to interview Nelly and Kimberly Patterson Webb in March 1986, because they had described abuse of boys residing at Boys Town, the large orphanage west of Omaha, where Walters was employed. In Walters’ fifty-page report on the child abuse described to her by the girls, Tripp figures as an adversary of the children: The state trooper, after Nelly’s testing was completed, told Kathleen Sorenson he tried to “break Nelly down” but he was convinced she was telling the truth.

He also told Nelly that she “passed” and that he believed her. Although the polygraph tests showed Nelly was not deceptive, Atty. Pat Tripp maintained he still didn’t believe what Nelly said. He said Nelly had fantasized those stories to the point that she believed they were true. For Pat Tripp, there was a personal element in this case. He was a “good friend,” according to foster parents cited in a September 1989 report by legislative Franklin committee investigator Karen Ormiston, of two individuals named by Nelly and Kimberly Webb as involved with the Webbs-Fort Calhoun Superintendent of Schools Deward Finch and Fort Calhoun High School principal Kent Miller. While the Webbs were away, the kids snooped through the house. They found: I. pornographic video tapes in a bag under the Webbs’ bed (which the kids played on the VCR while Webbs were gone)-one tape specifically showing teenagers involved in sexual activity. Nelly and Kimberly knew from eavesdropping that Larry King supplied the Webbs with the video tapes; 2. pornographic magazines in the basement. Once when Sean was suspected of snooping around in the magazines he was not allowed to eat anything at the Webbs’ house for one week; 3. box of a lot of “romantic” novels in Mrs. Webb’s closet (i.e., mothers having sex with their sons); 4. stacks of $8 \" \\times 1 0 \"$ (approx.) “photo” envelopes marked NOT BEND\" in Mrs. Webb’s closet … ; 5. photos of naked white women in Webbs’ bedroom dresser drawer. Although at the 3/7/86 hearing, Mr. Webb stated that he earns $32, 000 year, the Webbs’ home is furnished quite expensively $2, 000 paintings, crystal, silver, several VCRs, TVs, etc.). Also, Mrs. Webb wears a four carat diamond ring, a full-length fur coat, all custom-made dresses, expensive accessories. When they throw a party it includes caterers and limousines…. Larry [King] attends meetings/parties at the Omaha Girls’ Club … about every other week. He sometimes invited Joey Webb or Nelly by calling the Webbs and telling them to have one of the kids ready in so many minutes. Nelly said they had no choice about attending these functions.

She said she attended one held on a Fri. evening about 7 : 00 p.m . There were about ten to fifteen older men present and about twenty-five young teenage girls there.

Again, Nelly said the kids had no choice about whether or not they would attend. They were driven over to King’s with Mr. and Mrs. Webb…. Nelly and Kimberly said they talked with boys at those parties who said they were from Boys’ Town…. From [Boys’ Town] year book photos, after examining ‘83, ’84 & ’85 yearbooks, Kimberly said [four boys] had all attended some of Larry’s parties during the summers of ’84 and ’85. Nelly was afraid to mention any names but earlier had mentioned a “Brent” (whose picture she didn’t find in the yearbooks), who told her he had left Boys’ Town in ’84. Brent was “flown to another city somewhere” in Larry’s private plane to “work for someone else” after he and Larry had a disagreement. … At the parties there are usually about thirty adults present, male & females, more white than black guests because according to Larry “blacks get ignorant when they drink and tighter with their money and whites spend more money when they’re drunk.” Also present were some prostitutes (ages unknown but not teenagers) and [illegible] ages 16-22, and Nelly and Kimberly-about twenty kids total. If a man was interested in a young lady he held out a folded $50 or $100 bill in front of them and whispered something in their ear. Then they went upstairs or to some other area of the house. Nelly and Kimberly said the prostitutes told them they gave half of the money they got to Larry King. Larry also gave some of the boys at these parties new cars.

Larry claims to donate money to Boys’ Town and be on the Board of Directors at Girls Club. Nelly said Larry has gotten Boys’ Town boys and other boys to his home by asking them to do some yard work. If Larry asks the young man to do something and he refuses, Larry might hit him. Nelly said Larry “has a bad temper.” Larry also tells the young men they’ll get hurt. Julie Walters’ write-up contains the most explosive account by the Patterson Webb girls, which marked the pornography and prostitution network they were caught up in as a scandal of national scope. What they told was so awful, that it screamed for immediate investigation. In the course of attempts by law enforcement personnel and, later on, news media to belittle the children’s testimony, however, this particular item from Nelly’s account would serve the opposite purpose: How can anything she says be believed, the line went, if she says this? The passage in Julie Walters’ handwritten report reads as follows: Nelly also accompanied Mr. and Mrs. King and [their son] Prince on trips to Chicago, N.Y. and Washington, D.C., beginning when she was 15 years old. She missed twentytwo days of school almost totally due to these trips. Nelly was taken along on the pretense of being Prince’s babysitter. Last year she met V.P. George Bush and saw him again at one of the parties Larry gave while on a Washington, D.C. trip. At some of the parties there are just men (as was the case at the party George Bush attended)-older men and younger men in their early twenties. Nelly said she has seen sodomy committed at those parties. At other parties during Larry’s trips, Larry had local prostitutes (in their 20’s & 30’s) there to entertain his male guests…. Kimberly overheard Mrs. Webb tell someone on the phone, got him [Finch] all the way. 1 caught him several times down there with black girls.\" Nelly saw Mr. Finch leave the Webb home once as she returned home from school and Kimberly saw him leave the Webb house several times during daytime hours.

Kimberly’s first period class at school is a study hall which is located across the hall from the school’s office. She said Mr. Finch would regularly call the Webbs and say, “It’s time for another meeting.” Mr. Finch would interrupt whatever he was doing when the Webbs arrived to meet with them, meeting in the school office sometimes for several hours. At some meetings, Kent Miller, principal of Ft. Calhoun H.S., was also present. Mrs. Webb almost always carried a large Gucci bag (almost the size of a shopping bag) with her into these meetings. Kimberly said Mrs. Webb carried some photo envelopes (from Mrs. Webb’s closet) with her at least once into these meetings, telling Kimberly she was going to show Mr. Miller pictures from their trip. Law enforcement officials failed to pursue the many clues and leads provided in these eyewitness accounts by children living with the Webbs, which might have taken them into a cleanout of child prostitution, pornography, and interstate transportation of child prostitutes from Boys Town. While they stalled, the trail grew cold. County Prosecutor Patrick Tripp called Nelly Patterson Webb a liar after she passed four lie detector tests. Nobody was indicted. Jarrett and Barbara Webb went free. And Larry King was invited back to sing the Star Spangled Banner at the Republican National Convention in 1988, as he had done in 1984. According to police records, Nelson approached Brenda at a store where she was a cashier, and told her he was “doing some photographic work for the Easter Seals Campaign.” He left her his business card, which read “Rusty Nelson the Camera Man, Creative Photography.” When Brenda telephoned, Nelson said he needed to take pictures of redheads like her for a “European portfolio,” and that she would pose wearing swimsuits and lingerie. Brenda asked if she could bring her mother to the photography session, to which Nelson agreed. NELSON took several photographs of PARKER in various types of clothing, although no swimsuits or lengerie [sic] were worn. Brenda stated that NELSON repeatedly made references to PARKER in her birthday suit and making her breasts look bigger. Nelson never specifically asked PARKER to pose nude or semi-nude but did try to get her to show as much skin as possible and also try to make PARKER show as much cleavage as possible. Repeatedly, NELSON tried to persuade PARKER to model in lengerie [sic] as well as a form of clothing known as “teddies.” PARKER indicated she refused to do this.

During the course of the photographic session, PAR-KER’S mother MARGO GEORGIU looked at several photographs which were scattered about the apartment and apparently taken by NELSON. Margo GEORGIU stated that she observed several photographs of nude females ranging in age in her estimation from 20 years old to as young as possibly twelve. Several of the females in the photographs showed frontal nudity. Suspicious about the Creative Photography set-up, Margo Georgiu phoned around to various modeling agencies and schools in Omaha, to which Nelson had claimed he supplied pictures. No one there had heard of him, with the exception of a man at one agency, who called Nelson a pervert and warned Georgiu to keep her daughter away from him. That’s when she called the police. On Wednesday, 25 May 88, Reporting Officer MICHAEL HOCH went to The TWIN TOWERS, 2900 Farnam Street, and spoke with the Owner/Operator of The TWIN TOWER complex. … [He] indicated that a party by the name of RUSTY NELSON, who is occupying Apt. #3-B (which was leased to LARRY KING), has since moved out of the apartment complex. Since KING has rented the apartment [in August 1987], [the manager] believed that he has possibly put $50, 000.00 into the apartment in such things as decorating, drapes, and furnishings. [He] went on to state that he had bought a couch from one of the furniture dealers in Omaha that would not fit in the elevator as it was being transported to KING’S apartment. And, as a result of this, a crane was rented for the amount of $1, 200.00 to have the couch lifted to the apartment from the outside. [He] also stated that the apartment was very elegantly furnished; and the $50, 000.00 outlay would not include (what he described as) original paintings, along with what is believed to be possibly a solid silver chair. [He] also stated … that he knows that KING drives at least five different vehicles: Three of the vehicles being Mercedes-Benzes, one being a Cadillac Alante, and the other being some type of sports car…. [He] also stated that he believes that KING owns properties in Washington, D.C. ….[He] went on to state that KING has a habit of throwing names around, and it is believed he is very influential in the Republican party.

[He] also indicated that he does not understand how KING has as much money as he does to spend. KING does not actually live at the Penthouse apartment in The TWIN TOWERS, but uses the apartment for parties and occasionally stays at the apartment. [He] stated that he had talked to a realtor … who indicated that KING apparently attempted to purchase a residence approximately five years ago and, at that time, had trouble coming up with a down payment for the house. It seemed strange to [him] that in five years KING has come into as much money as he spends. At a neighboring complex, the Orpheum Tower, Officer Hoch learned that tenant Larry King sublet an apartment to a young man who was a disc jockey at the Max bar. King had told the building manager that he was renting the apartment as a place to stay when he worked late, so that he didn’t have to travel out to his suburban home. Hoch asked the Orpheum manager if she knew any particulars or had heard any type of information about LARRY KING, as it seemed very strange that he would rent an apartment in the ORPHEUM TOWER and is presently renting an apartment at The TWIN TOWERS. [She] indicated that she did not know any specifics about LARRY KING; however she stated that she has heard rumors that he is a very heavy drug dealer, and that she has heard this from more than one individual. … [She] stated that she has also heard that LARRY KING is a homosexual and has a preference of young men or boys. She was fifteen-year-old Loretta Smith*, who lived with her mother and brother in Omaha. At the time Carmean talked to her, Loretta was hospitalized at Richard Young Hospital, where she had told a therapist, in the words of Carmean’s report, about “incidents in which she has been photographed nude or partially nude as well as instances of devil worship.” SMITH initiated the conversation by indicating that approximately five or six years ago when she was nine years old she went to a party with some friends much older than her. There, she met a white male … who coaxed her into modeling for him…. [He] offered to take SMITH home if SMITH would pose for some pictures….

SMITH then spoke of occasions when she went to the North Omaha Girls Club on Lake Street, with friends of hers whom she identified as NELLY and KIMBERLY WEBB. There, she discovered that they were also “modeling”…. SMITH stated that those field trips consisted of the girls being taken to a photographic studio where pictures were taken of them either nude or partially clad…. SMITH also stated that she has not spoken to or knows the whereabouts of either NELLY or KIMBERLY WEBB, not having seen them for approximately three years…. She stated that a number of adults, whom she referred to as leaders from the North Omaha Girls Club, both male and female, were engaged in the photography of nude children. She also indicated that a number of prominent individuals were involved, including doctors and lawyers although she indicated they used code names and that she could provide no real names for these individuals. SMITH also indicated that the adult leaders who took these photographs used threats against her and others to get them to participate in these photographic sessions. She stated that she had been told on occasion that her entire family would be killed as well as her if she refused to participate in these activities. Loretta told Officer Carmean that she “began participating in what she termed devil worship with other juveniles and adults. She stated that she was approximately IDY2 or 11 years old when she started attending these rituals,” which sometimes included nude photography. Those participating \"were given something to drink which she stated, tasted like apple juice but which she thought contained some kind of a drug…. SMITH indicated that NELLY and KIMBERLY WEBB, had also reported these activities to Police in the past but that nothing had been done. She stated that the WEBB girls had told the superintendent of Fort Calhoun Schools whom she identified as a Mr. FINCH, and stated that it had been reported to him first but the girls felt that since nothing was done that he must have been involved also. During the course of Reporting Officer’s interview with LORETTA ISABEL SMITH concerning child pornography activity, as well as devil worship, she mentioned the name of LARRY KING as being a participant and supporter in these activities.

Asked how she knew this, SMITH stated that she is a friend of … the daughter of GARY WEST. (WEST is reportedly the manager for MAX’S, a predominantly homosexual bar located south of CENTRAL STA-TION at 1415 Jackson Street). SMITH stated that she has been to the WEST residence several times, and that GARY WEST is a homosexual, as well as an alcoholic. She stated that when he does become intoxicated, he talks about his certain activities with LARRY KING, and indicated that he is into the use of controlled substances (i.e. cocaine) for personal use, as well as for sale, and that he owes LARRY KING a lot of money for this…. SMITH initially told Reporting Officer that she had been to the Wirt house on one occasion, in which she saw three or four teenage males engaged in oral copulation. … It became apparent, when SMITH began talking about KING and WEST with a lack of specificity, that she didn’t wish to go into much detail with Reporting Officer, at this time. Reporting Officer told her to consider recalling as much information as possible, and that she and Reporting Officer would talk again at a later date. On July 5, Loretta did telephone Officer Carmean and gave him the address and phone number of King’s house on Wirt Street. Carmean drove by the house and called the number. The phone was answered “King Company.” At the house, Carmean wrote in his log, he “observed on a gray awning … the name KING in black script lettering.” During 1988, as Loretta Smith grew to trust the doctors, nurses, and other personnel at Richard Young Hospital, she revealed more detail about what she and the other children had been subjected to. Her case file is summarized in a report for the Legislature’s Franklin committee (by Jerry Lowe, 1989), which gives the dates on which Loretta talked to hospital staff: August 19, 1988.The hospital notes indicated that Loretta was asked to give a chronological account of involvement in what is described as a devil worship cult and that Loretta agreed to do this. Loretta indicated that she didn’t really know what was happening and that she became involved very gradually. She indicated that when she was approximately nine years old she was going to the Girl’s Club in Omaha and that a guy named Ray would take her and four or five other girls at the Girl’s Club on outings….

He took them to a building that according to Loretta looked abandoned and asked the girls if they wanted to go in which they all agreed to do. Loretta indicated they sat and talked for a while and then Ray provided a joint and all of the individuals got high. She indicated this activity continued for about three or four weeks and then Ray took them to a party. Loretta indicated that at the party there were about ten men all in their mid-thirties and that initially they sat around and talked with the girls about their problems. Loretta indicated that all the people got wasted and that the men at the party made them sleep around and that the girls did not have a choice of who they slept with…. then in order to get out of the house she did begin going to the parties again and they lasted for another six months …. [O]n one occasion she threatened to tell her mother that the men were having sex with her and that they knew she was only nine but the men indicated that they would kill anyone who told about the activities …. The men started taking the girls to what the men described as power meetings. Loretta advised she was ten years old. She indicated that candles and other weird stuff were at the power meetings. According to Loretta, one of the individuals on one occasion told the girls that the room was going to spin for a while and it did and she realized later that it was drugs that the men had given them. Loretta advised that about eight months later she was put through her first test. Her and the other girls were taken to a building in Omaha where … she was locked in a room with a little girl which she described as a Caucasian infant. At about midnight, Loretta indicated that the men came into the room, took the little girl away from her and told her that she could achieve power by killing something that she really loved. Loretta described that they then cut the little girl’s head off, stuck it on the wall and made her sit in front of it.

At [another] meeting Loretta indicated devil worshipping was practiced and that another small boy was sacrificed. Loretta and the other girls were in the other room and she could hear the little boy screaming …. She then indicated the child was fried and eaten by the girls. Loretta indicated she refused to take part in this so that the men beat her for two days. At additional meetings Loretta indicated the men told her and the other girls that they must sacrifice for power and described three incidents where further sacrifices took place. The first a one-year old white female had her head taken off by a saw, the second a four-year old white male was hung on the wall and darts thrown at him and the third an Indian female, three or four years old, had several parts of her body cut off after which it was ground and poured on the girls and they also were made to drink the remains of the child….

Loretta indicated that she freaked out, was screaming and hitting the walls…. [She said] the cult members were wearing what she described as clothes which had upside-down crosses on them and that the leader always wore a long black cape with gold rings shaped like a skeleton head…. To the expert eye of Foster Care Review Board Executive Director Carol Stitt, when she received the reports from Loretta’s caseworkers, the girl’s testimony appeared highly credible. Stitt explained before the state Legislature’s Executive Board, on December 19, 1988, “[O]ne of the things that you want to keep in mind, as horrifying as this is when you review it, this girl is very concrete about who was present at these homicides, what was happening, dates, she gave a lot of specific information and in working with children one of the ways you know this is not a global fantasy is the more details they give you.” The information given to hospital staff and to the Omaha police by Loretta Smith overlapped and corroborated what was already in the hands of authorities from the children from the Webb household, and from Margo Georgiu and her daughter. From three separate cases, involving pornography, child abuse, and ritual murder, children’s testimony and other evidence converged on Larry King. In July 1988, Omaha police officers in the Robbery and Sex Unit received an unexpected visit from their boss, Chief of Police Robert Wadman. According to the officers’ own account, related by Nebraska Foster Care Review Board official Dennis Carlson in testimony to the Legislature’s Executive Board, they took precautions to keep Wadman out of their work on Larry King. [Officer Carmean] told me some things which I found to be somewhat startling. I asked if he was interested in information regarding Larry King and he said, yes we are, we’re conducting what he called a supersensitive investigation of Larry King and he said this investigation was so supersensitive that they were not even using the steno pool in the Omaha Police Department. They were handwriting their police reports, and he also told me that Chief Wadman had come to their unit and directly asked if they were investigating Larry King…. Investigator Carmean told me, we lied to the Chief and we said, no, we are not investigating Larry King.

SHILLING that she only gave Officer CARMEAN general information, … [but] that she had no problem talking with Officer CARMEAN. Reporting Officer told DR. SHILLING that sometime during the week of 04 July 1988 this Reporting Officer will assign Officer CARMEAN to revisit Loretta at the hospital in order to build up some rapport and possibly obtain more specific information. Loretta was making more allegations against Larry King and others and these were allegations of the most serious nature. She was reporting that she had witnessed homicides. Investigator Carmean was contacted by myself on one, possibly two or three, occasions …. I’d tell him that this girl’s making more allegations, that she’s opening up, she’s telling additional information, she’s beginning to relate better to her case workers and social workers, would you please go out and re-interview this girl? … After Investigator Carmean received the information from the Foster Care Review Board, the information that I hand delivered to him, he never went back to interview Loretta Smith. In one of my telephone conversations with Investigator Carmean, I remember telling him that this girl was now reporting homicides, and he said, yes, I need to get out there and re-interview this girl. … [O]ne of my concerns Senator is the conduct of the Omaha Police Department. I don’t know what’s going on up there, I’m not familiar with the players in the Omaha Police Department, but I know that I hand delivered material to an investigator. … Investigator Carmean and Investigator Hoch left my office and they seemed sincere, they seemed that they were going to investigate these allegations and later it was as if air had been let out of a balloon, that all of a sudden they had no interest in even re-interviewing a girl who was saying that she had witnessed homicides and I just don’t understand it. … I would like to add something that was highly unusual in this case. Loretta’s psychiatrist contacted the police in Omaha and asked them to come, Loretta’s personal care worker, Ken Stoner, contacted the police, [Richard Young employee] Kirstin Hallberg contacted the police, as well as Adrienne Hart, who is Kirstin’s supervisor.

All those people had made contact and nothing was being done…. When I called [the sexual assault unit], they said he’s no longer here and that’s when they told me that he was with Research and Planning …. I finally … got him and I mentioned his enthusiasm at the outset, and that from what I had developed in terms of creditable information being given to me, I felt he’d been transferred because he was getting too close to something and his superiors did not want him to continue. So there was a silence, then he kind of chuckled, he said, well, no, uh, I wanted this transfer. I’ve known of Carmean for years and he’s not the type of officer who’d want to be put into an office where he’s the only one there, in fact that might have been the creation of the department. Didn’t even have a secretary. Prior to Officer Carmean’s assignment with Research and Planning, he was serving as an investigator with the Robbery and Sex Unit under the command of Lt. Guy Goodrich. While in that assignment, Officer Carmean was involved as an investigator and did participate in looking into matters involving allegations that Larry King was involved in some sexual improprieties with young people. The investigation never did come close to supporting the allegations sufficiently for a charge to be considered against Larry King. In August 1989, Chief Wadman dismissed out of hand the criminal, satanic horrors that Loretta Smith and other children had described to authorities. On Omaha radio station KKAR, the city’s chief law enforcement officer chalked up concern about these allegations to the fact that some Omahans have a “prurient interest of child abuse, of child sexual abuse, those kinds of things. . . . I think that the media attention to that element of things is inappropriate.” Robert Wadman has sworn under oath that he barely knew Larry King, that he “had very few social contacts with Larry King.” That’s not what King says. In April 22, 1989 interviews with King and Wadman, Frank Brown of TV-7, Omaha, questioned them about an incident in which Wadman intervened at King’s request, to order the release of a suitcase seized in a drug raid. King had indeed been cleared, with the blessing of Robert Wadman. The legislative Franklin committee’s record of Wadman’s own testimony to this effect dates from October 13, 1989.

Besides Wadman, the speakers in this transcript are committee counsel John Stevens Berry and Robert Creager, and Wadman’s attorney, Kent Whinnery. WADMAN: We had a situation where we were advised that there was a possibility of child pornography involving-no, it came in as child pornography case. What happened is that there was a photographer who was taking photographs of young women, and in the course of that set of circumstances, a mother with her daughter called and filed a complaint with the police department, and the complaint involved a situation where her daughter was approached by the photographer to be photographed, and the photographer extended an invitation to this young woman’s mother to come with her. shots of adolescent girls. Nelson described King not as his landlord, but as his “boss.” The investigating officers had compiled and filed accounts from several people about the lavish spending by King on Nelson’s and other apartments, about his comings and goings in Mercedes Benz cars, and other evidence of an unexplained leap in King’s income, and about the common knowledge that King was involved with drug dealers and was a homosexual who “liked young boys.” Wadman, who had approached his officers with such curiosity about any investigations of Larry King that they might pursue, swore under oath, that he knew nothing about any of that. The Nebraska Foster Care Review Board, which is not a law enforcement agency and is not equipped to investigate crimes, let alone prosecute them, in 1988 found itself by default the main recipient of reports of abuse from children and from case workers, which attested to the existence of an organized child exploitation ring in Nebraska, and stretching far beyond. Expressing frustration and alarm that the Omaha Police had failed to investigate reports of child murders and other serious crimes, even after many urgent phone calls from personnel at Richard Young Hospital, FCRB Executive Director Carol Stitt on July 13, 1988 met with Nebraska’s Republican governor, Kay Orr, to seek help. Governor Orr told her to “do whatever is necessary” to secure an investigation. On July 20, Stitt wrote to Attorney General Robert Spire, to request that his office, the state’s top prosecuting agency, enter the case. For the first time, somebody openly pulled together the testimony of Nelly Patterson Webb, Loretta Smith, and other children, whose reports of abuse all cited Larry King. “Pursuant to the Nebraska Child Abuse Statutes, the State Foster Care Review Board is making a report of allegations", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:22:cb9134dea248", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5728, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "told her to “do whatever is necessary” to secure an investigation.

She noted that in December 1987, FCRB had reviewed the allegations about a child prostitution ring centered on the Webb family’s foster home. Then: On 5/17/88, the Foster Care Review Board received a phone call from Kirsten Hallberg … who is a previous employee of Uta Halee Girls Village and currently works for Richard Young Psychiatric Hospital in Omaha. She was aware of Nelly and [her youngest sister] Kendra’s reports to the Review Board. Ms. Hallberg told me about three Uta Halee girls, a 20-year old young man at Richard Young, and three youths at Boys Town who all reported inappropriate activities with Larry King of Omaha. She also reports that at a recent child exploitation conference in Kansas City a detective from Kansas City … asked her when the Nebraska authorities were going to do something about Larry King. When Dennis and I were in this meeting it became clear to me that if Mr. Howland had ever read the materials we delivered to him in July, it was a long time ago. He didn’t know major players’ names in the case…. Dennis did some rather tough questioning and it became clear to both of us that nothing had occurred. The file was just a mess. I grabbed the file from him. Reordered it. … Dennis and I both left that meeting, I mean, I can speak for myself, and I felt full of despair and I felt like all the optimism that we had had that something was going to happen, to not only help the kids who’d been abused, but to stop this from occurring to other kids, and many of the kids that I’m aware of were State wards, was not happening. Nothing was happening …. Now we see that we were just being put off, “Yeah, we’ll get out there,” and “Yeah. we’ll do this,” and “Yeah, we’re on top of it,” but really none of the officials had organized their investigation. I … don’t know what if anything either the Omaha Police Department or the Attorney General’s office actually did. . . .

I … talked to Loretta Smith’s case worker at Richard Young Hospital on November 22 and she told me that the last person that interviewed Loretta was Officer Carmean and that took place on June 28, 1988. On November 30, 1988, Stitt again attempted to contact the governor, to set up a still more urgent meeting, because of the failure of the attorney general’s investigation to get off the ground. The governor’s staff scheduled a meeting for the following week, but canceled the appointment the next day. The governor, according to her office, was “not willing” to meet, as Carlson recorded in his daily notes of December 1. COUNSEL: Now, the conclusion I draw, after reviewing that information, is that you really didn’t do anything between July and late November, except to collect some extraneous pieces of information about Mr. King’s business interests and perhaps about … his wife’s citizenship status. That’s my conclusion from reading the reports. On December 20, 1988, Attorney General Robert Spire was quoted in the Lincoln Journal saying that his office had “acted promptly and professionally” on all the “sensitive information” received on child abuse six months earlier. Yet the Nebraska State Patrol, the agency that would be called upon by the attorney general in such an investigation, conducted its very first investigative meeting on the case on December 19, 1988, the day Spire was boasting to the Lincoln Journal about his alacrity! Stitt turned to still another agency, the Douglas County (Omaha and surroundings) Attorney’s Office, and requested a protective order for Loretta. When the Douglas County attorney filed the order, however, it said that Loretta was making bizarre statements, that she had been on the streets for two weeks, and that she was suicidal! Not only were these allegations untrue, but they could help ensure that Loretta be discredited in any future court appearance. SENATOR CHAMBERS: But if that’s in the court record, in the petition, an official document and the child winds up deceased then and if the result of [sic] a suicide then everybody would have had prior notice that this child is suicidal, if you would, by that report, by that petition and the court order.

SENATOR CHAMBERS: Now this is some information that I have and maybe you don’t, are you aware that Lynne [sic] Crnkovich has had information given to her by certain professionals about some of the things that these youngsters have been talking about and making allegations and she chose to do nothing. Were you aware of her involvement in that regard? Vlahoulis, the part-time sleuth from the Attorney General’s Office, later told Franklin committee investigators about another time Loretta ran afoul of Crnkovich. According to Vlahoulis’ conversations with Crnkovich in January 1989, Father Val Peter of Boys Town “had been approached by Loretta Smith and … she complained to him that the F.B.1.and Crnkovich had intimidated her to such an extent while she was at Richard Young Hospital that she had not provided them with all the information that she knew.” At the December 19, 1988 Executive Board meeting, Senator Loran Schmit asked Carol Stitt what effect the gross mishandling of her case might have on Loretta Smith. Stitt answered, “I’d like to say if the State continues to handle the case the way they’ve handled it, everything that this perpetrator has told them is being reinforced. That he has the power, there’s nothing they can do, nobody’s going to help them, and that certainly has been what’s happened so far.” Inaction by the authorities, a blind eye to children’s pleas, failure to prosecute, a rush to cover up-all this was happening in the heartland state of Nebraska. To understand how this could be, requires a good look at state politics during the mid-1980s, especially the Robert Kerrey administration of 1983­ 1987. Early in the decade, the signs went up, billboard-size with flashing neon lights, that Nebraska was now, more than ever, a “wide open state,” to use the terminology of the organized crime-controlled political machines in various parts of the United States during the 1920s and 1930s. Mafia control in those days was so tight in some cities, that opposition newspaper editors were gunned down in broad daylight. A June 1991 article in the Minneapolis Star- Tribune recalled, about the history of Minnesota, “Alvin Karpis, onetime Public Enemy No.1, once said, ‘Every criminal of any importance in the 1930s made his home at one time or another in St. Paul. … If you were looking for a guy you hadn’t seen in a few months, you usually thought of two places-prison or St. Paul. If he wasn’t locked up in one, he was probably hanging out in the other.’” In order for the city to have this status, veteran St. Paul Pioneer Press reporter Nate Bomberg has said, “Everybody", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:25:bb6e4120014c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5731, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 26, "text": "once said, ‘Every criminal of any importance in the 1930s made his home at one time or another in St. Paul. … If you were looking for a guy you hadn’t seen in a few months, you usually thought of two places-prison or St. Paul.

You can’t have an underworld without an overworld…. You can’t have the rackets unless you have the mayor, the chief of the police, and the county attorney in your comer.” 1983 was a banner year for Nebraska’s building its credentials as a modem such safe haven for crimes and perversions. That was when the state seized Commonwealth Savings, forcing its owners, the Copple family, to ante up any and all company and personal assets to help redeem depositor losses. It was the first year of Bob Kerrey’s term as governor of Nebraska. In 1990 , as the price tag for cleaning up failed savings and loan institutions nationwide soared into the hundreds of billions of dollars, one of the loudest critics ofthe Bush administration’s handling of the matter was freshman Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska. An Omaha World-Herald headline captured the clashes: “Kerrey, Fitzwater Trade Allegations Over Handling of S&L Crisis.” White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater cautioned Kerrey that as many Democrats as Republicans were involved in the S&L fiasco, and then admonished him in personal terms. According to the July 16-22, 1990 Omaha Metro Update, Fitzwater “added that if Senator Kerrey is bent upon making S&L a campaign issue, it’s one that could work against Kerrey. The White House apparently has some files on Commonwealth Savings and State Security Savings, but no details were given.” Kerrey knows about his vulnerability. Soon after the exchange with Fitzwater, the senator got himself interviewed by a friendly World-Herald reporter, to come clean about the events of 1983-84. Under the headline “Kerrey: My Errors in Insolvencies Will Not Diminish S&L Scrutiny,” he admitted what he had fiercely denied at the time-that his key adviser on the Commonwealth and State Security crises was his close friend, business associate, and chief financial adviser, Bill Wright. “Regarded by some as one of the cleverest and most ambitious financial operators in the state,” according to a brochure from the Lincoln-based Concerned Citizens for Responsible Government, Wright was also a major shareholder and the president of State Security Savings. This relationship, Kerrey now said, may have led to “appearances of impropriety,” but this all happened because “I was new to politics.” For informed Nebraskans, Kerrey’s confession was a bombshell, as the Metro Update observed: “But what Kerrey-faced with the absolute imperative to get his own past behind him if he is to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:26:0c20324eca6f", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5732, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 27, "text": "the state,” according to a brochure from the Lincoln-based Concerned Citizens for Responsible Government, Wright was also a major shareholder and the president of State Security Savings.

It is especially so for those whose depth of knowledge takes in the entire fabric of the Kerrey Administration: Commonwealth Savings Co., State Security Savings, Kerrey’s own panoply of private business dealings, and, finally, the creation and uses of the Nebraska Investment Finance Authority.” According to information published in the Metro Update and other documentation, those implications are that Kerrey and Bill Wright used the powers of state government to: 1) loot State Security’s depositors of at least $4 million and as much as $10 million, 2) deprive the depositors of Commonwealth of at least $40 million, 3) set up a new state agency, with the sole apparent purpose of giving Kerrey and his cronies millions of dollars in low interest loans, 4) cheat farmers out of $200 million in subsidized loans, and 5) peddle junk bonds to investors who thought they were getting high-grade state bonds. The voluminous evidence of these activities can be found in a 1986 state Senate investigation, which I chaired, of the failures of State Security and an Omaha bank, the American Savings Company; in 1988 brochures of the Concerned Citizens for Responsible Government; in the Omaha Metro Update of July 16-22, 1990; in a set of three tightly documented reports submitted to the Nebraska Legislature in 1990 by a group of depositors from the failed Commonwealth bank, led by Reuben Worster of Lincoln and veterinarian Dr. Melvin Bahensky of Grand Island; and in a 1991 tort claim filed by myself as attorney and on behalf of Commonwealth depositors. According to his own account, Bob Kerrey entered politics to make money. In September 1981, as he was contemplating a run for the Nebraska governorship, Kerrey lamented to businesswoman Dana Saylor Robinson, that in business, “You have to know someone or cater to this or that politician, to get anything. The only way you are going to be able to make any money is to be in politics.” Late one night in the last week of 1982, Democratic Governor-elect Kerrey and Bill Wright summoned Republican Paul Amen, the state banking director, to a meeting to ask him to stay on in the new administration. Anticipating the request, Amen brought with him “our highly confidential, secret, sensitive list of problem institutions,”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:27:203e42f113fe", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5733, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "or cater to this or that politician, to get anything.

Anticipating the request, Amen brought with him “our highly confidential, secret, sensitive list of problem institutions,” as he later told my legislative committee when we were looking into the State Security and American Savings failures. In 1986, testifying before my committee, Amen was asked if he hadn’t felt a little strange showing the governor this list in the presence of Wright, whose own bank was on it. Amen replied, “No, Senator Harris, I didn’t even think in terms of that. I thought in terms of the fact that Bill Wright was the Governor’s principal adviser and the Governor had wanted him present at the particular meeting.” Wright was a prominent lawyer in Lincoln, a member of a wealthy, established family, and one of the rising stars in Nebraska politics during the 1970s. State Security, which he and associates acquired in 1978, in a highly leveraged buyout, had made many loans to businessman Bob Kerrey. Wright became the guiding force behind Kerrey’s gubernatorial campaign, headed his transition team, and served as the governor’s personal counsel. His law firm, Wright, Rembolt, and Ludtke, soon became official adviser to the Nebraska State Banking Department. On October 31, 1983, while Banking Commissioner Amen was on the East Coast negotiating for a purchaser to buy the troubled Commonwealth bank, Governor Kerrey suddenly issued a late-afternoon press release which said, “We are monitoring the activities of Commonwealth; we are looking at that institution with more interest than we are the other institutions which we monitor.” the Lincoln Star of November 1, [1983] Kerrey himself was quoted as saying that he was barred by law from publicly indicating how serious the Commonwealth situation might be. That is to prevent a public official from creating a run on a financial institution. Yet, by his own words on television and in the newspapers, Kerrey caused exactly that result.\" Commonwealth could have filed for reorganization under the bankruptcy code, to protect its depositors in the wake of the run. But Kerrey forestalled that action by securing a legal opinion from his appointees at the State Banking Department’s legal counsel-Bill Wright’s law firm-that bankruptcy should not be allowed, but that the state should seize the bank. By statute, Commonwealth also should have had ten days to find new capital, before being seized. The bank had at least two offers-the one Amen was working on, and one from a local group of investors.

S.E. Copple was willing to sell his controlling stock in the bank to this local group for $1 , in return for an infusion of $8–10 million in capital, in order to save the bank. The bank, as Commissioner Amen later testified to the Legislature, would have been saved. Some $50 million of depositors’ funds would have been preserved as well. But Kerrey’s press release, the resulting run, and the governor’s refusal to allow Commonwealth to be purchased after its seizure, preempted that possibility. The failure of Commonwealth, the biggest collapse of a financial institution in the history of Nebraska, was a human tragedy of major proportions. Many of its depositors were elderly people, who had their life savings in Commonwealth. When it collapsed, some of them were left without even money to buy food. By 1991, eight years after the collapse, one-third of the depositors have died. Many of them died from heart attacks or strokes, within the first 90 days after their bank’s doors were shut. Seven families with retarded children had put their life savings in the bank, to care for the children after the parents die; that money was all gone. Throughout 1983, the State Banking Department pressured Commonwealth president S.E. Copple to put up over $8 million of his personal assets and those of his son Marvin, to secure unsecured loans that Commonwealth had taken from other banks. In one instance, a multi-million dollar property got pledged, to secure an approximately $750 thousand loan. These were debts to, among others, Bill Wright’s State Security Savings and the National Bank of Commerce, owned by Kerrey’s associate Jim Stuart. Now, after seizing Commonwealth, Kerrey’s administration pressured the 88-year-old man to dispose of whatever personal assets he had left, including his residence, to “pay back depositors.” The bulk of Copple’s substantial assets, however, were no longer available to the depositors. They had already been taken by Kerrey’s friends. The Copple family was descended from some of the first pioneers in Nebraska. It had a tradition of fierce independence from the state’s financial establishment, whence Kerrey received campaign funding. The Copples’ bank had been a source of liquidity for farmers and small and medium-sized entrepreneurs. When Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker doubled interest rates to nearly 20% , in the fall of 1979, many Nebraska banks, including Commonwealth, landed in trouble. But there was a decision to attack the Copples, while sparing institutions tied to Kerrey.

But there was a decision to attack the Copples, while sparing institutions tied to Kerrey. The brouhaha over Commonwealth’s collapse diverted attention from State Security Savings, which Amen testified had been in worse shape than Commonwealth. State Security escaped the kind of pressure applied to the Copples. Rather, Kerrey’s permission for State Security to remain open until July 9, 1984 made possible its “milking and draining” by Bill Wright and other bank officers, in the words of our 1986 Senate investigation. (That investigative report was unanimously adopted by all members of the legislative committee by which it was prepared, Republicans and Democrats alike, including some of Governor Kerrey’s previously staunchest supporters.) Then, State Security was allowed to file bankruptcy, contrary to the standard set for Commonwealth by Wright’s law firm via the State Banking Department. Wright’s double standard was glaring. It was Wright, who took State Security intofederal bankruptcy, which shielded it from possible attempts by local officials to investigate its affairs or to protect depositors. Yet Bill Wright’s law firm, acting as official adviser to the Banking Department, had prohibited that same course from being followed by Commonwealth, by issuing its opinion that such a declaration of bankruptcy by Commonwealth would be illegal. Wright’s bank had loaned businessmen Jerry Joyce and Robert Rentfro, the owners of Shoppers Fair, millions of dollars for other projects. It threatened to foreclose on all those loans, unless Joyce and Rentfro sold Shoppers Fair for a million dollars below its assessed value. When Joyce and Rentfro prepared to sue, State Security looked for another arrangement. Ultimately, Shoppers Fair was delivered to the Kerrey group, in return for State Security writing off $3 million of Joyce/ Rentfro debts. State Security financed the purchase by AIG with a loan at 4% under the prime rate. Those depositors lost millions in other financial swindles, which reveal the brutality of the Kerrey group’s actions, masterminded by Bill Wright. Wright and others gained control of State Security in 1978 by purchasing its stock, through a holding company they owned, with a very preferential loan from First National Bank of Lincoln (FirsTier Bank, after its 1984 merger with Omaha National Corporation); the loan required no personal guarantee and carried no personal obligation, meaning that if it went “bad” and the company folded, Wright and his partners had no obligation to repay. Ultimately, they did not repay it.

Ultimately, they did not repay it. Having gained control of State Security, they sold its most valuable asset, a downtown Lincoln office building, to themselves (using a disguised corporate name) for one fourth of its actual value. Since the depositors really owned the equitable value of the building, this transaction alone robbed them of a small fortune. Adding insult to injury, Kerrey’s friends then effectively sold the building back to the selfsame depositors, using a long-term lease. The new owners leased it to them at the actual value, four times higher than what they had just paid for the building! Nothing was done. The disgust of Senators over such patent corruption shows up in the transcript of a subsequent hearing. Senator Higgins: am sick and tired of this pussyfooting around with these boys.\" Senator Schmit: \" … the statute will have expired and the people that needed to be protected will have been protected, that is putting it very bluntly.\" We called Kerrey himself as a witness, and instructed him to bring his personal financial statements. According to the Metro Update, “Kerrey said he resented the request for his bank records. He parried the request by saying that the committee was essentially saying, ‘It is OK if your banker tells us everything they know about you.’ Kerrey eventually did consent to appear before the committee. Highlights included his denial of improper influence by William F. Wright. Key decisions of the administration were based upon advice from the Department of Banking [whose counsel was Wright’s law firm] and other official channels, Kerrey testified.” Kerrey’s AIG deal was already a scandal when it transpired, in 1983. Talking about his business affairs to my legislative committee in 1986, the governor claimed that he had taken every politician’s routine precautions: “I prepared and executed a business trust that naturally moved all the assets physically that I owned, all the business assets, away from even indirect control.” But somehow this did not prevent Kerrey from personally signing the papers to set up AIG. If it was supposed to be a typical blind trust, to shield a public official from knowledge of how his assets are being managed, Governor Kerrey’s trust had at least one eye open. Metro Update described it, “Kerrey’s blind trust: It was his sister, Jessie, and her husband, Dean Rasmussen, Kerrey’s very active partner in Prairie Life, the restaurants and other business deals. How can you have a blind trust with a bunch of partners you see maybe every day? You maybe eat dinner with them.

How can you have a blind trust with a bunch of partners you see maybe every day? You maybe eat dinner with them. Or they come over from time to time?” In November 1983, Kerrey acted quickly to shield himself and his associates from investigation during the uproar over the collapse of Commonwealth. On November 5, 1983, news media reported what was an apparent leak from administration sources, that Republican Attorney General Paul Douglas, who normally would have handled the Commonwealth investigation, was involved in improper Commonwealth loans. Douglas was a long-standing friend of the Copples. With impeachment proceedings under way, Douglas resigned. On November 15, 1983, Kerrey fired Banking Director Paul Amen and replaced him with John Miller, whom he had appointed to the State Liquor Control Commission in June. Miller admitted he had no knowledge of the banking business, telling the press, according to the Metro Update, “I can’t even balance my checkbook.” The Legislature’s Banking, Commerce, and Insurance committee, then chaired by this writer, Senator John DeCamp, was prepared to investigate the Commonwealth collapse, which came under its purview. But Kerrey handpicked a special new committee for the job. In a November 21, 1983 letter to the governor, I protested Kerrey’s actions: “Governor, it would be most unfair and unreasonable to expect your own people, Mr. Domina, Mr. Miller and yourself, for example, to investigate yourselves since you are the administration officials in charge of the Banking Department and since the Attorney General’s office is the attorney with the responsibility of providing the legal guidance to the Banking Department and to you.” The ostensible investigation by this made-to-order committee turned out as expected. A 1990 report to the Legislature by Reuben Worster of Lincoln and other Commonwealth depositors characterized its findings: “The conclusion of the Domina Report was filled with speculation and ‘Who Dunits’ and the final analysis determined that Kerrey was an innocent bystander, Amen and [his assistant in the Banking Department] Lake exercised poor judgment, and Douglas was guilty of a multitude of crimes surrounding the failure of the financial institution.” Although Commonwealth had been looted before its collapse, Worster’s group charged that post-seizure actions planned by Kerrey were even more egregious. In their threevolume report, these Commonwealth depositors argued that Kerrey had tried to establish, through changes in law and personnel, the ability to devalue Commonwealth’s assets by 50% and then sell them to individuals of his choice, with loans financed by a new, Kerrey-appointed agency, the Small Business Development Authority. Although this alleged scheme attributed to Kerrey bogged down in legislative resistance, Commonwealth assets", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:32:9cd082498425", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5738, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 33, "text": "before its collapse, Worster’s group charged that post-seizure actions planned by Kerrey were even more egregious.

Although this alleged scheme attributed to Kerrey bogged down in legislative resistance, Commonwealth assets did get inexplicably devalued by 54% , and did wind up in the hands of Stuart and other Kerreyconnected creditors, Worster’s group has charged. Commonwealth depositors got paid only $8.5 million by the state, against their $50 million in losses. There was no reason for them to have lost a nickel. The bank had assets, mainly in real estate, then valued at $50–60 million. The Commonwealth property at 40th & Old Cheney in Lincoln, for instance, would have been worth $35 million if properly developed, according to an estimate given in 1985 by state-appointed receiver John Queen, in front of depositors’ representative Dr. Breiner and attorney John Robinson. At the fire sale after Kerrey’s liquidators devalued Commonwealth’s assets, choice properties, such as 40th & Old Cheney and the Commonwealth Building, went to Jim Stuart’s National Bank of Commerce. In 1982, the fortunes of Prairie Life Center, [businessman] Kerrey’s planned sports center in Lincoln, were at a low ebb. His managers were saying in published accounts in the Lincoln press that the project was dead. It would not fly, they said, because interest rates made it financially impossible. It was announced that subscribers to membership had their downpayments refunded. And there was one additional area of lending; loans could now be made to commercial enterprises. Suddenly, Kerrey’s enterprise, Prairie Life, which couldn’t fly in 1982, could soar in 1983. Suddenly, it became economically feasible. The senator and his partners got a loan of $2.55 million, some 4 percentage points under the going rate…. After the bill to set up NIFA passed, Kerrey appointed all nine members of its board, including Bill Wright. One of NI-FA’s very first loans was to Prairie Life. Four days after approval of this loan to Kerry’s project, Lancaster County Republican Chairman Randy Moody wrote to Senator Yard Johnson, chairman of the Legislative Council Executive Board, about the obvious conflicts of interest. “This insider deal seems a slap in the face of the taxpayers and business community of the state of Nebraska,” Moody wrote. “It’s obvious the governor has taken advantage of his elected position to line his pockets and he, his sister and brother-in-law [partners in Prairie Life] are laughing all the while.” This writer went to former Sen.

John DeCamp, who spearheaded NIFA into existence in 1983 as head of the Banking Committee. What, the Omaha Metro Update asked Def.arnp, has NIFA acomplished that it could not have accomplished as three separate agencies, even if the agencies had to be amended in some way, except to make the type of loan that went to Kerrey and his partners and that, of course, allowed Kerrey to appoint the original board? DeCamp said he could think of nothing. DeCamp is a Republican. He was once close to Kerrey but he said they are not close now. He knows NIFA as well as any legislator, past or present. And he can think of no reason for its existence other than to make a new class of loan and to allow Kerrey to appoint its board. In 1986, NIFA marketed a $200 million bond issue, for the avowed purpose of funding low-interest loans to Nebraska’s distressed farmers. Kerrey negotiated a deal with New Yorkbased junk bond peddlers Drexel Burnham Lambert, for Executive Life Insurance Company of California to market the issue. (Executive Life failed in 1991 due to its Drexel-linked losses.) Drexel and associated firms earned their fat fees, the value of the bonds collapsed, and not one dollar out of the $200 million ever reached a Nebraska farmer! According to a federal law suit filed in April 1990 by holders of the devalued bonds, the main purpose of the financing was never to provide funds to farmers, but to provide \"inexpensive funds to Executive Life for reinvestment, .. in junk bonds …. While the actions of Kerrey and his associates outraged legislators and tens of thousands of depositors who suffered, there was deafening silence from Nebraska’s major press, the Omaha World-Herald, the Lincoln Journal, and the Lincoln Star, The Metro Update of July 16-22, 1990 gave some insight into why: John Gottschalk, an important World-Herald figure in the business sense since 1975 and publisher of the newspaper since last January, has invested through his daughters in Kerrey’s ventures since Kerrey’s earliest days in business in the early 1970s. The daughters, now ages 15 and 23, own a $50, 000 share in the Prairie Life Center in Omaha. From covering up financial swindles, it was a short step to covering for prominent businessmen who were involved in organized drug peddling or for politicians and publishers with a weakness for young children. Reviewing the Commonwealth case and the Franklin Credit Union scandal side by side, it is striking how the casts of characters overlap.

Reviewing the Commonwealth case and the Franklin Credit Union scandal side by side, it is striking how the casts of characters overlap. Key personnel in the Kerrey-appointed apparatus, who snowed the Commonwealth depositors, will intervene again as Franklin unfolds. The state regulators in charge of the Commonwealth receivership were John Queen and Robert Kirchner. Deputy receiver under Queen was one Kent Johnson, Commonwealth’s former comptroller and the state’s star witness against S.E. Copple; Johnson was to be indicted in 1990, for stealing over one million dollars of Commonwealth depositors’ funds, during the receivership. Queen and Kirchner will get a federal contract to analyze the Franklin Credit Union in 1989. On this new assignment, they will hire Johnson once again. Kirk Naylor was special prosecutor for a grand jury probe of Attorney General Paul Douglas and his ties to Commonwealth; Douglas’ resignation cleared the decks for Kerrey’s men. Jerry Lowe was a Lincoln police officer, without prior training in financial investigations, assigned to go through the records of Commonwealth. As the first counsel and investigator, respectively, for the Legislature’s Franklin committee, Naylor and Lowe will quit suddenly in 1989 in what some senators see as an attempt to torpedo the committee. Naylor will argue that Richard G. Kopf was legal counsel for the special legislative committee set up on Commonwealth, bypassing the Legislature’s banking committee. Prior to this starring role, Kopf was a country attorney of no significance in a country town called Lexington, Nebraska. As a United States magistrate-Lincoln sources insist the appointment was a reward for the Commonwealth job-Kopf will issue, and seal, the order that closes Franklin’s doors in 1988. An order from Kopf will get Larry King out of town at a critical moment in 1990. Kopf will preside over the federal grand jury that indicts victim-witness Alisha Owen later that year. And finally, surprise of surprises, on August 27, 1991, Kopf will vault ahead of a host of qualified attorneys to be in the lead position for appointment as a new federal judge. On Friday, November 4, 1988, four days before George Bush was elected President of the United States, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) swooped down on the north Omaha headquarters and branches of the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union and its affiliate, the Consumer Services Organization, and shut their doors.

At the time of the raid, the Franklin Credit Union listed $2 million in deposits, of which $1.2 million was in certificates of deposit. Yet within a week of the doors being padlocked, claims were filed for $15 million in CD’s. Ultimately, close to $40 million was determined to be missing from this credit union that claimed to have a scant $2.6 million in total assets. The obligations were listed on a second, secret set of books. In Nebraska’s unicameral Legislature, a handful of senators moved to begin a probe into what happened to the Franklin money. The two main initiators of this legislative investigation, the one that would persist when law enforcement balked, were Senator Ernie Chambers, Democrat of north Omaha, and Senator Loran Schmit, Republican of Bellwood. Senator Chambers represented the district where the Franklin Credit Union was founded in 1968, by community activists, with the proclaimed goal of making credit available for businesses and individuals in the African-American community of north Omaha. (It was by qualifying as a “low income credit union,” that Franklin could sell certificates of deposit to nonmembers, the means by which it swindled millions.) Larry King became its manager in 1970. As Schmit’s friend and personal attorney, I shared with him my own recollections about how I had noticed the two faces of Larry King, which I later summarized in writing: “I had personally been a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1984 and 1988 and been a witness at the massive spending and luxury at the Larry King parties in both Dallas and New Orleans, and as chairman of the legislative Banking Committee had observed with a jaundiced eye the Franklin operation, which no information could be obtained on because it was a Federal Institution.” “Can’t,” Haberman explained. “Not if you are going to be a good Republican. You are from Nebraska and this is a party being put on by a Nebraskan to honor another black Nebraskan, DuBois Gilliam, who is going to be getting one of the highest appointments any black person has ever gotten in government. You’ve got to be there.” It was the most impressive party I have ever witnessed. The attendance by top politicians was remarkable; names and faces you only hear or see on television were there in number. At the center of the excitement was Larry King. Draped over him like a blanket throughout the evening was a heavyset woman, who 1 learned was Maureen Reagan, the president’s daughter.

Draped over him like a blanket throughout the evening was a heavyset woman, who 1 learned was Maureen Reagan, the president’s daughter. From what I saw, this party had to have cost far more than the one or two hundred thousand dollars I have heard as an estimate. At a public meeting in 1990, I recalled my thinking at the time: “I got to wondering: Here’s this little credit union, and here’s Larry King, obviously in the highest reaches of the Republican Party…. And I just wondered, how does he do this supposedly on a salary of $16 thousand a year?” Such conspicuous consumption as I had witnessed, earned Larry King the tag “flamboyant” in just about any mention of his name. The NeVA’s civil suit against King, filed November 14, 1988 in the wake of the raid, put some price tags on his lifestyIe. It itemized $4 million of King’s personal expenditures, paid out of credit union funds during the previous thirteen months, including: $1 million in American Express bills, $148, 000 to Old Market Limousine, $70, 000 to Floral Concepts, $61, 000 to Mastercard, $39, 000 to Citibank, $37, 000 to himself, $27, 000 to Omaha Jewelry, and so on. As the disclosures began to flow, on how King’s $2 million dollar credit union had tens of millions of dollars in deposits unaccounted for, and on the secret second set of books, I suggested to Senator Schmit that he talk to some other legislators about investigating whether some state laws were violated. Why was I concerned? Because, from my experience as chairman of the Banking, Commerce, and Insurance Committee of the Legislature, I knew that with all the regulatory controls existing for a federally insured institution, it was impossible for such a theft to occur without cooperation by higher up officials. Larry King could only have accomplished this massive theft with the help or cooperation of regulatory officials or politicians at the highest levels. That meant that institutions of government must have been compromised. At the three and a half hour Executive Board hearing on December 19, 1988, Carol Stitt, Dennis Carlson, and Burrell Williams of the Foster Care Review Board summarized the abuse complaints centered around Franklin’s top officer. They presented their files on the Webb foster home and on Loretta Smith. CARLSON: The nature of these allegations are something that is going to shock the Committee.

Both reports talk about the Omaha Girls Club, both reports mention a specific individual who is the superintendent of schools…. SENATOR REMMERS: [T[he question that came into mind, it’s been in my mind since you’ve been testifying and I think you’ve answered part of it just now, is you’re talking about about these abuses from children from Boys’ Town and Girls’ Club and so forth, now is there a common thread that goes over here to the Credit Union deal that we are investigating? In other words to the Franklin Credit Union? Is there a common thread there that kind of leads to that? Stitt also clarified what she had written in her June 1988 letter to Attorney General Spire, about a Kansas City connection of Larry King. She testified that she had cross-checked with the Kansas City detective, who reportedly inquired of Kirstin Hallberg about when Nebraska was going to crack down on King. The officer, said Stitt, “confirmed that Larry King had been there, had contributed money to a group home and when he left, three boys came forward and said that they had been abused by him while he was there.” The Executive Board also received from the FCRB the handwritten report by Julie Walters, on her interview with the teenaged victims during 1986. In the December 21, 1988 Omaha World-Herald, reporter James Allen Flanery recounted a telephone interview with Walters at her home in another state, in which she told him how their testimony had seemed at first “too bizarre to be true.” But the more experience she gained with troubled children, Walters added, “working in probation, I’m more sure than ever that there is more truth than not in their accounts. The conclusion I reached was the kids I spoke with were not lying.” What the senators heard at the closed December 19, 1988 meeting shook them to the bone. “The information brought tears to my eyes,” Schmit said, according to the Lincoln Journal. “I do not cry easily and I was not the only", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:38:e40ca391f86a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5744, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 39, "text": "experience she gained with troubled children, Walters added, “working in probation, I’m more sure than ever that there is more truth than not in their accounts.

People were not contacted that should have been. Leads were not followed up that should have been followed up. My feeling is that the whole thing is being sat upon and nothing was done.” The question of a cover-up of Franklin-linked crimes came up at the outset, in this way. Omaha Police Chief Wadman and state Attorney General Spire offered a lame protest. “Every step that should have been taken was taken,” Wadman told the Journal. Spire said, \"We did receive some sensitive information in July. My office acted promptly and professionally and nothing was sat on. I am confident that law enforcement-both federal and state-is doing its job in the situation…. The Legislature’s Franklin committee hired its first investigator, former Lincoln policeman Jerry Lowe, in February 1989. Attorney Kirk Naylor came on as Special Counsel. On February 15, Lowe sent a memo to the committee on the results of his first comprehensive evaluation of the case, including its handling by law enforcement. Lowe wrote: This matter is indeed a complex and complicated one, commencing with the closing of the Franklin Credit Union … and mushrooming into a situation where additional allegations (other than the financial improprieties) have arisen, including influence peddling, child abuse and neglect, child sexual abuse, pornography, substance abuse, homicide, and inaction and possibly malfeasance on the part of law enforcement agencies, public agencies, and public officials for events dating several years back. More importantly, there seems to be a growing public perception that many of the affected agencies and/or officials are participating in a coverup…. The task which the Committee has undertaken will not be an easy one…. In this and other early reports, Lowe made clear that every aspect of the Franklin case was politically hot. Larry King had become wealthy and influential thanks to quite a number of “big people,” he commented. Moreover, Lowe reported, there were indications that King was involved in guns and money transfers into Nicaragua, of involvement by the CIA, and possibly “a White House connection.” There appeared to be “some type of connection between the money missing [from Franklin], the crisis in the Savings and Loans, and the funneling of money to Haiti and Nicaragua.” Testifying on June 22, 1989,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:39:86e5794916f3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5745, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 40, "text": "Larry King had become wealthy and influential thanks to quite a number of “big people,” he commented.

Just as his office had dallied in the face of Carol Stitt’s plea for action on complaints against Larry King the year before, Spire now said about Franklin-linked child abuse, that \"based on conclusions and reports of the FBI, the Omaha Police, and the Nebraska State Patrol, all three of those have concluded that the reports do not have substance. While the Legislature’s Franklin committee was getting started at the end of 1988, the NCVA selected a firm called Financial Advisory Group, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, to make its own determination about what had happened to Franklin’s missing millions. FAG was a partnership formed by John Queen and Robert Kirchner, whose earlier appointments included the one they got from Governor Kerrey-state regulators to oversee the liquidation of the Commonwealth Savings and Loan. In their 1989-1990 audit of Franklin Credit Union, Queen and Kirchner would conclude that Larry King spent nearly all of it on flowers, limousines, gold watches, and his generally extravagant lifestyle. Even as he proceeded with the audit of Franklin, Queen was serving during 1990 as deputy receiver for Commonwealth, overseeing the liquidation of the bank’s remaining assets and the disbursement of the proceeds. On August 14, his chief assistant in the receivership, Kent Johnson, was arrested by the FBI for stealing over a million dollars in Commonwealth funds. Although Queen’s co-signature was on every check Johnson wrote to steal the money, Queen claimed that his name had been forged. His career, in any case, was tightly intertwined with Johnson’s. Johnson worked for him in the Commonwealth receivership, on the Franklin audit, and at an Omaha corporation he owned, Phoenix Sign Corp. This was a venture Queen launched by buying up the assets of Globe Neon, a bankrupt firm. One of Queen’s fellow holders of a $50, 000 share of Globe Neon before it folded, was none other than Larry King! A private consulting firm headed by Omaha residents John Queen and Bob Kirchner, both formerly associated with the receiver for Commonwealth Savings in Lincoln, Nebraska, was retained by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), in early 1989 and given the responsibility to trace all the funds flowing into and out of the Franklin Credit Union. . ..

Schmit had the experience of a previous investigation, involving drug-related matters and the State Patrol, which ended up with him and other senators, including myself, being sued by some of the individuals investigated. He wanted to make sure that he made no error that would cause any legal liability for him. Even though we had won that earlier suit against us, Senator Schmit wanted to exercise all caution, to protect himself from lawsuits. Therefore, like many other state and national politicians, he quite properly had private legal counsel-me. In the spring of 1989, after the Franklin committee had been conducting investigations for some time, Senator Schmit sought my legal advice. He wanted to know the legal liability involved, if he supported a planned report of the committee, which was to suggest that there was child abuse committed by prominent individuals-not to be named-which had not been properly investigated by agencies of government. I gave him the same advice then, that I would give now: “Accusations of child abuse are the worst accusations you can make against an individual. That is because, no matter what the truth of the matter, once the accusation is made, it will never be able to be rubbed completely off, even if the individual accused is as innocent and pure as can be. Therefore, before you sign your name to anything that suggests that there is serious child abuse or before you suggest that an agency of government has failed in its duty to find or investigate child abuse, make sure you have the smoking gun that establishes that is what actually occurred. Not just for your legal protection, but because that is the right thing to do. To falsely accuse of child abuse is a terrible thing. To cover up child abuse, is worse than falsely accusing.” The year was 1984, early January. I had announced my intention to run for the United States Senate. As chairman of the Legislature’s Banking Committee, I was actively seeking to investigate the collapse of Commonwealth Savings, which had just occurred.

I had announced my intention to run for the United States Senate. As chairman of the Legislature’s Banking Committee, I was actively seeking to investigate the collapse of Commonwealth Savings, which had just occurred. In an Associated Press listing of the ten most powerful people in Nebraska, as ranked by media editors and publishers, I was number 5, behind the governor, U.S. Senator J.J. Exon, Omaha World-Herald publisher Harold Andersen, and University of Nebraska President Ronald Roskens. Polls showed me as the leading candidate for the Republican senatorial nomination. Then, I received a message from Republican Party leaders. It was simple: “GOP strategists at the highest levels believe this is the year the Republicans can beat J.J. Exon. Opinion poll analysis shows that such a victory can only come, if the candidate is a woman and has no political ‘baggage.’ (Remember, 1984 was the year of Democrat Geraldine Ferraro’s candidacy for U.S. Vice President, the ‘Year of the Woman’ in politics.) Republican leaders are fearful that you, John DeCamp, will be able to win the primary, but because of ‘baggage’ and controversiality, you will not beat Exon in November. Therefore, Republican leaders ask you to withdraw from the primary. If you do not drop out voluntarily, you will have to be stopped some other way. And stopped you will be, because this race means so much to Republican leadership, at the highest levels in Washington.” Shortly thereafter, a tenant in one of my apartments, who was delinquent on her rent, lodged an anonymous complaint to the Nebraska Department of Social Services. She charged that I and my wife had “abused” my young daughter when she was five years old. A picture in a family photo album, showing my daughter in a pose like the Coppertone baby ads, was the basis for the complaint. But a County Attorney, Mike Heavican, took matters into his own hands. Heavican was on the Republican search committee for a senatorial candidate, which ultimately picked a woman with no “baggage,” and she lost to Exon. He also was someone whose name had come up as my Senate Banking Committee attempted to start probing the Commonwealth and State Security matters, as someone who may have granted illegal tax favors to involved parties. Heavican’s action also exemplified how a public position can be abused. It comes as a shock to most Americans, that the lowliest county attorney has absolute immunity when he files complaints or charges against somebody, even if he does so knowing them to be false. His automatic immunity is supposed to protect the prosecutor, as an institution of government, from being deterred from effective action by the specter of future lawsuits.

His automatic immunity is supposed to protect the prosecutor, as an institution of government, from being deterred from effective action by the specter of future lawsuits. The abuse of this institutional privilege can be terribly destructive. Months of investigation resulted in a legal opinion from Judge W.W. Nuernberger, that there was no child abuse. Nuernberger concluded that if Mr. and Mrs. John DeCamp were guilty of child abuse, then so were a lot of families and so was the late President Kennedy, and perhaps every family in Nebraska would have to destroy its photo albums, if I were considered guilty of anything. While the investigation was under way, media coverage continued to smear my name with the charges. I maintained that the phantom child abuse was concocted by Heavican, using the County Attorney’s office, for the political purposes of knocking me out of the Senate race and stopping my Commonwealth/State Security investigation. Six years after these horrible events, my suspicions were confirmed. … Roland Luedtke, a former lieutenant governor and the mayor of Lincoln from 1983 to 1987, launched his own review of the charges. “The report that came back to me was that [DeCamp] was pure as the driven snow,” Luedtke said, but, he added, whoever may have had it in their mind to get rid of DeCamp “accomplished their purpose.” Senator Schmit offered an amendment to the committee report, written by himself, which stated, in essence, that at this point in the investigation, the legislative committee did not have the smoking gun that would establish the truth of any of the child abuse allegations or the failure of institutions of government. In July 1989, a controversy broke out on the Franklin committee, over Schmit’s amendment and the course of the investigation. Some members maintained that Senator Schmit was not doing enough to follow up the child abuse. Schmit rejoined that the information gathered thus far by Lowe, while useful, was mostly second-hand, and that the committee should follow the advice he had been given by a friend in law enforcement: “Follow the money trail.” There is almost no important crime that can be committed, said Schmit, echoing his friend’s advice, without spending money, and spending money leaves a paper trail. It should be possible to move from hearsay to courtadmissable evidence such as checks, credit card receipts, and flight manifests.

I was told repeatedly that people were afraid to divulge any information, not only because of retribution of the alleged perpetrators, but also because they feared they would be publicly discredited by the Omaha World-Herald. People were also becoming discouraged by the lack of progress made thus far on the investigation and they translated this to mean “cover up.” Initially, the reports which Mr. Lowe had generated were reviewed in detail. It was evident that while there were a large amount of reports generated, that very little of substance had been gained by him regarding firsthand information. It was then decided that, while secondhand information had been valuable in that it presented an idea of the possible scope of abuse going on, that it was more important to locate individuals who had actually been abused and participated in the various activities that comprise this case. Caradori did find victims who would talk. Four of them allowed him to videotape their stories, in nearly 30 hours of sessions during late 1989 and early 1990. These interviews contained detailed allegations of sexual abuse, drug usage, pornography and other crimes by prominent Omaha citizens. Implicated, among others, were individuals already named by Nelly and Kimberly Webb, Brenda Parker, and Loretta Smith, as abusers or pornographers: Rusty Nelson, Deward Finch, Larry King. What these victim-witnesses related became the central matter of the Franklin case, but nobody except for a few law enforcement personnel, state senators, and grand jury members has viewed the Caradori tapes. Snippets were aired on television in Omaha. With their contents largely unpublicized, the tapes became a target of speculation and denunciation, rumor and doubt. Ms. Owens [sic] was informed of the purpose of our visit and was asked for her cooperation in the matter. Ms. Owens indicated, after a three-hour interview, that she had been heavily involved with various individuals in Omaha, including former members of the Franklin Credit Union. She indicated that she was also involved with other minors involved in pornography and homosexual acts involving various people in Omaha. Several of the individuals she mentioned were Alan Baer, Harold Andersen, and also former Police Chief Robert Wadman, who had participated in many parties. It should be noted that Alisha also indicated that Mr. Wadman is a pedophile.

As she later described to the legislative Franklin committee, she was extremely reluctant to get involved at all. After Caradori left, she contacted the prison psychiatrist, who directed her to Superintendent Lawrence Wayne. He advised her to tell the truth and to cooperate with the Franklin committee. Upon arriving from out-of-state on the above date, this writer received word that Alisha Owens had called this writer in an attempt to reach me regarding a meeting that I had conducted with her previously. Upon receiving this information, arrangements were made to speak with Alisha by telephone. ’ \" Alisha went on to state that she did not relate to me all of her experiences during the first time that we had met because she was “unsure” of this writer. She stated that she now wanted to come forward with the information that she had previously withheld. Specifically, she indicated that she was one of the minors involved in flights to other states, and she knew of other minors who were on these flights also. After pursuing many leads, on October 30, 1989, this writer contacted Alisha Owens at the Women’s Reformatory in York Nebraska. I spoke with Alisha for approximately three hours, during which time she indicated that she had been heavily involved in pornographic and sexual activity with various individuals in Omaha, including former personnel of the Franklin Credit Union. During this discussion with Ms. Owens she initially indicated that homosexual activities also occurred involving Alan Baer, Harold Anderson [sic] and Robert Wadman. During the course of the statement, Alisha stated that she first became involved with Larry King in August of 1983. Alisha was 14 years old at this time. She indicated that she met Larry King through some boys from Boys’ Town, among them Mark Powers*. Mark had invited her to a party that next Friday night. This first party was held in August of 1983 at a Twin Towers penthouse. Alisha arrived with Troy Boner and Mark Powers at approximately 10 : 00 p.m . in a car that Troy was driving. Present when they arrived at the party were Larry King, Bob Wadman, Alan Baer, Harold Anderson, and other adults that Alisha did not identify at this time. . ..

Mark Powers had told Alisha prior to going to the party that there would be marijuana, alcohol, and so much cocaine available at this party that “she would think it’s snowing.” … Alisha stated that the party was held at Alfie Allen’s apartment in this building …. Alisha observed Larry King and Larry (Last name unknown [Lnuk], black youth) going into one of the bedrooms. She observed later when the black youth emerged from the bedroom that he was tucking in his shirt and fastening his pants. Alisha also observed Alfie Allen going in and out of the bedroom numerous times. She observed a young boy approximately 14 years old sitting on Harold Anderson’s lap. She then observed this boy and Harold Anderson going into one of the bedrooms. On the above evening, Robert Wadman told Alisha that she was pretty and asked her if she was wearing anything underneath her clothing. He asked her if she was wearing a bra. Sometime around 10:00 to 12 : 00 p.m. ., she was sitting on his lap. He indicated to Alisha that he knew she wasn’t a virgin and he then felt her breasts. He told her that she had nice breasts. He felt her genitals and unzipped the zipper to the jumpsuit she was wearing. She asked him to stop and he grabbed her wrist very tightly and twisted her wrist. He then removed her clothing and asked her if she knew what fellatio was. He said that he would show her what it was. He then instructed her to perform oral sex. Robert Wadman’s pants and underwear were down. He pinched her on the breasts. She was kneeling on a cushion on the floor and he was stroking her hair and her breasts, while she was performing oral sex, and he was also grabbing her head and forcing her to perform oral sex on him…. After this sexual activity, she began to cry and went to the bathroom where she vomited. Wadman then told her that he would buy her a new dress. . . . While at the French Cafe, Wadman gave her this dress and said that he wanted to show her the wine cellar. … She removed her clothing and put on the dress.

He then began touching her and she was crying because she was afraid that he would rape her. He masturbated and ejaculated on her. When he ejaculated, she physically drew back which made Wadman very angry…. She told me that a photograph was taken of her at a later party while she was tied up. It is probable that the photograph was taken by Rusty Nelson. She describes Rusty Nelson as having blond hair, average build, approximately 27 years old, and that he has acne scars on his face…. Reference group sex, photos were taken of the group sex encounters by Larry King and the photographer, Rusty Nelson. She mentions that her hands were handcuffed and her feet were tied up…. She also discussed the activities of Harold Anderson. She said that he likes young boys and that his “regular” boy is named Jeremy (Last name unknown) and that he was approximately 14 years old when she witnessed them together. She said that Harold Anderson gives money to boys and that she has seen young boys performing oral sex on him. She stated that she has witnessed Danny King performing oral sex on him. . .. I asked her to elaborate on the superintendent she mentioned as attending the “parties.” She said that he lives approximately 40 miles from Omaha, is gay, older, balding, has bad teeth, and stands approximately 6’. She stated that this individual had sex with Troy Boner at the Twin Towers apartment and that he gave money to Troy for this…. Alisha also describes a forced sexual encounter which occurred at the French Cafe in August of 1985. Present were five boys from Boys Town, Tom McKinney [sic], and Judge Theodore Carlson, among others. Larry (Lnuk) told her that “someone is waiting downstairs and you’d better be good.” She performed oral sex on Judge Carlson, and the encounter lasted approximately 20 minutes…. The first private flight that Alisha was on occurred in March of 1984…. The plane landed at a small airport in California…. Upon their arrival, Danny and Alisha were taken to an Embassy Suites type motel, and two businessmen came into their room. One man had sex with Danny, and one man had sex with Alisha. They received no money. Please note that she said that Larry King had ordered her to take this trip.

When Alisha was asked who participated and who was aware of the transportation of kids across state lines for sexual purposes, she said that Larry King and Alan Baer were aware of this. It is probable that other adults were also aware of this. She stated that Bob Kerry [sic] knew about these activities and that Larry (Lnuk) had told her this. Larry (Lnuk) also indicated that Bob Kerry knew about the closing of the Franklin Credit Union before it fell. Other issues discussed regarding Bob Kerry consisted of Alisha’s statements that she had a friend who works for Dixon and Dixon law firm who is responsible for maintaining the keys to the file room. Her name is Jackie Compton, and she has told Alisha that there are various documents with Bob Kerry’s signature on them that relate to the Commonwealth ordeal. This is explained in detail in the first video taped statement. … In late June of 1983 I attended a meeting at the state with Florence Davis, the McArthur children’s worker, and Lloyd Linquist, the permanency planner. Basically, the purpose of this meeting was to tell me that the state would not change their minds and that they felt they were in a better position to judge what the McArthur children needed, and that they were going to proceed with adoptive plans of placing the children with the Webb family in Fort Calhoun. A few days later I went with Florence Davis to the Webb home, as Florence thought I would feel better about the placement if I had the opportunity to meet the Webbs. Quite to the contrary, after meeting with Mr. and Mrs. Webb, I was more concerned than ever as I did not feel that this was a proper home for these three children…. Something that I think is extremely suspicious is that about the time that the King mess was surfacing, Florence Davis suddenly left the state, almost overnight, and supposedly is living in California. A short time later, Lloyd Linquist went on sick leave and was gone for many months. And then about the time he was to return, he also resigned. While he was on leave I understand that he took a trip to Tahiti. I think personally that Lloyd Linquist and Florence Davis know a lot about the situation regarding the abuse of these children and they should be found and questioned….

One time when Florence was working for the state, I believe before she became a supervisor, I noticed that she declared bankruptcy while she was living in her new condo and had her new car. However, after that whenever I would see Florence it seemed like she was dressed extremely well and did not appear to have any monetary worries, although I am not a friend of Florence’s and I did nothing with her socially. Lloyd Linquist also was impeccably dressed, although someone told me that he had only rented a room at the Grace Bible Institute and actually didn’t even have an apartment. … I thought it was interesting that Lloyd could take trips to Europe which I know that he did in the years that he was a permanency planner, and other exotic vacations on the salary that he was paid by NDSS. During the second video taped statement, [Alisha] again discussed the pornography aspect of this case. She said that Rusty Nelson develops his own photographs and that he would more than likely have the negatives of the group and individual pornographic photos, possibly to blackmail Larry King at a later date. She reiterated that Rusty Nelson and Larry King would “direct” these photographic sessions. She said that she would cry and try to get out of participating in these sessions, but she would be “slapped around” if she didn’t participate…. She again discussed the parentage of her child. She said that she is 99.9 percent sure that her child is Bob Wadman’s, and that conception occurred in August of 1984. She had sexual intercourse with him on August 8th, August 10th, August 17th, and August 22nd. All of these sexual encounters occurred at the Starlight Motel, with the exception of August 10th which occurred at the Twin Towers apartment. … Owen provided Caradori the name of Troy Boner as a victimwitness who could testify on the same events. After beginning a search for Boner, Caradori received a telephone call from him at 4 : 40 a.m . on November 25, 1989. From 4 : 30 p.m . later that same day, until 10 : 22 p.m ., Troy Boner told his story. Since it was apparent that Troy had met Alan Baer before meeting Larry King, I asked him when he first met Alan Baer.

He said that he first met him in August of 1983 through a friend of his named Tim Prescott*. He said that Tim picked him up in Alan Baer’s car and told him how he could make some money. Tim took Troy to Alan Baer’s residence in the Twin Towers which Troy stated was apartment #201…. He said that he walked back to Alan Baer’s apartment later that afternoon at Alan Baer’s request. Alan met him at the door in a yellow Ralph Lauren bathrobe. Alan Baer asked him to get undressed. (Troy stated that he thought he was going to get $50.00. ) He started undressing in the hallway and Alan Baer asked him to go into the bedroom. Alan Baer then got undressed and a sexual encounter ensued, including mutual masturbation and oral sex. After this sexual encounter, they took a shower together and he received $400.00 in fifty-dollar bills. Alan Baer told him to call him that next Tuesday. On February 5, 1984, Alan Baer took Troy and another young kid to Des Moines, Iowa. The other boy’s name was Shawn (Lnuk) and he was approximately 12 to 13 years old. They drove to Des Moines in a tan Mercedes, which Troy thought might possibly be rented. They stayed at the Savoy Hotel in downtown Des Moines. Troy and Shawn stayed in the room at the hotel while Alan Baer attended some business meetings. The three of them had several sexual encounters while in the hotel. At one point, Troy left the hotel and upon returning found Alan Baer asleep holding Shawn. Corroboration: Check for a tan Mercedes possibly leased! rented to Alan at this time. Check to see if Loni Boner did file a missing persons report at that time. Who was Troy’s girlfriend at that time? Check her and her mother to see if they did pick up Troy in Des Moines. Check the hotel records at the Savoy Hotel for that time period…. Larry King then had Troy move into the Travel Lodge Inn. . .. During this three weeks, Larry would stop by at various times, usually in the afternoon, for sex with him. They would perform oral sex on each other, and Larry King performed anal sex on Troy. Larry King also wanted Troy to urinate on him in the bathtub, which he did…. In May of 1985 he [Troy] talked with Danny King about how Danny could make some money.

Troy had also told Alan Baer about Danny King. Troy then took Danny to Alan’s apartment at the Twin Towers during which time Alan Baer asked Danny some questions about himself. Alan Baer then told him [Troy] to leave. He waited for approximately three hours before Danny came out of the apartment, and Danny showed him $300 that he said Alan Baer had given him. Danny said no sexual activity went on, but Troy stated that he later found out that Alan had anal sex with Danny. In June or July of 1985, he went to a party where a 15­ year old boy was in the center of the room with his pants down. An adult male was inserting beads into the young boy’s rectum. Other adult men were seated around the young boy masturbating. Troy was ordered at this party to play with the young boy’s genitals. He stated that he thought the adult male who was inserting the beads into the young boy’s rectum was a police officer. An individual named Mark* (Last name unknown) had told him that this adult male was a police officer. The alleged police officer masturbated on the young boy in the center of the room …. When asked for further information about Bob Wadman, he stated that he likes to have sex with young kids and that in addition to Alisha Owens, there was another young girl he was involved with identified as having the last name of Hovel *, who was a runaway from Chicago. He stated that the last time he saw this girl was in May of 1986. He said that [the] reason he went on this flight was to have sex with an individual named Ron Gilbert. He stated that Ron Gilbert is a movie producer for a television series. He stated that he received no money for having sex with Ron Gilbert, and that he and Larry King also had sex while on this trip…. The next trip occurred in a private plane to California.

He stated that he believes that these two kids were “sold.” … On December 4, 1989 and December 5, 1989, I took Troy to the Omaha, Nebraska, and Council Bluffs, Iowa, areas in order to identify the various locations he made statements about in his videotaped statement. See Exhibit PH-I for the photographs and his identification of these locations. See T-18 for the daily reports covering these two days. It is apparent that there are some discrepancies between the statement of Alisha Owens and that of Danny King, however this writer feels that Danny was heavily involved with drugs during this time period and wasn’t quite sure as to certain details. As a matter of fact, Danny did not know what month follows December. … In April of ]984 Danny met Larry King at A’s residence. Cocaine was used by A and Danny. LK and Danny then went into the bedroom. Danny was lying on the bed and LK had anal sex with Danny. It hurt Danny and Danny made him stop. Danny then gave LK oral sex but spit LK’s ejaculation. LK then hit Danny with a shoe on the side of the head because he did not swallow it. Danny received no money for this occurrence…. At a press conference on December 18,1989, Senator Schmit announced that he had obtained videotaped testimony from three victim-witnesses in the Franklin case. It had been viewed by himself and the other members of the Franklin committee, Senators Bernice Labedz, Dan Lynch, Jerome Warner and Dennis Baack. “Members of our committee are dismayed,” Schmit wrote in a letter to Attorney General Spire, released at the press conference, “by the fact that no state or federal investigative bodies interviewed any of these new witnesses we have, even though they were discovered by our investigative efforts after a fairly short time and with a very small budget. … It is the opinion of all committee members that the activities described and the personalities involved scream out for action, whether statute of limitations problems are involved or not. . . . As a result of the new evidence and new investigations, we have all become very, very concerned.” By December 1989, local, state and federal law enforcement had received copies of the videotapes of Alisha Owen, Troy Boner, and Danny King. Some officials, notably Douglas County Sheriff Dick Roth, said they believed the victim-witnesses. After watching five hours of the tapes, the Associated Press reported", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:52:a107a9910e5d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5758, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "scream out for action, whether statute of limitations problems are involved or not. . . .

Some officials, notably Douglas County Sheriff Dick Roth, said they believed the victim-witnesses. After watching five hours of the tapes, the Associated Press reported in February 1990, Roth “said he found the witnesses’ statements to be credible.” But there was no apparent move toward prosecutions. In the spring of 1989, after the first child abuse stories surfaced, I recommended to Senator Loran Schmit that he go directly to the FBI in Omaha to discuss the very serious allegations being made against Police Chief Robert Wadman by various individuals. This was before anybody even knew that Alisha Owen or other victim-witnesses existed and, of course, before Alisha Owen’s allegations against Robert Wadman were made. In brutal language and with the most somber demeanor possible, Mr. O’Hara made it clear that probably his closest friend in the world was Police Chief Robert Wadman, and that anyone who would dare to accuse Robert Wadman of impropriety had better realize that in accusing Wadman, they were effectively taking on Nick O’Hara and the FBI. There was tension in the air. I made a point of saying that I also was sure that all these accusations-whatever they were-had to be nonsense. I pointed out that my experience as a public official, a senator for sixteen years, made me appreciate the fact that it is easy to accuse a public official and darned difficult for one to defend himself, since the accusations are immediately put on the front page of the paper and broadcast as the lead story on the evening TV news. But, as if to make a point that both I and Senator Schmit had better understand how serious it was for anyone to come to the FBI and raise questions about Robert Wadman, O’Hara had us sit down and provide him information about ourselves, as ifwe were the ones being accused and investigated, proceeding exactly as one might expect the FBI to do with someone the FBI was investigating. It was only after Caradori’s first tapes had been turned over to law enforcement agencies, that leaks of what was on them began to reach the public and became the subject of widespread discussion. Articles began to appear in the Omaha World-Herald. aimed to discredit the witnesses and intimidate any other potential child victim-witnesses from testifying or coming forward with information. Gary Caradori was even more vehement on the need for protection. “Unless they get into a protected environment, where Alan Baer and Larry King and Robert Wadman are not able to get to them and scare them,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:53:2bf2d0eeec2d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5759, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 54, "text": "what was on them began to reach the public and became the subject of widespread discussion.

Gary Caradori was even more vehement on the need for protection. “Unless they get into a protected environment, where Alan Baer and Larry King and Robert Wadman are not able to get to them and scare them, I can tell you the kids will fold. They will do whatever those guys order them to do. They will fold, or they will end up dead,” Caradori hammered at Senator Schmit. “You have to do something to protect them.” “You cannot and should not do anything to use committee funds or committee personnel to provide protection for these kids,” I told Schmit. “Otherwise, you and the committee may be accused of impropriety and tampering with witnesses, and who knows what else. Painful as it is for me to tell you this, you have to find some other legal channel to provide protection for the kids. Whether that channel is the courts or a judge or whoever, it is something that either the lawyer for the kids should be doing, or some institution of government vested with the power and responsibility to do those things should be doing. But you, Senator Schmit, should not personally get involved in any way, shape or form in providing money or assistance or protection for these kids, nor should the committee, in my opinion.” Senator Schmit shared his concerns with other members of the legislature, who were hearing the rumors and who had their own resources for finding out information. Key among them was Senator Jerry Chizek of Omaha, chairman of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee. He was very tight with Douglas County Sheriff Dick Roth. In early January 1990, as stories of what was involved in the Franklin case spread through the streets of Omaha, Senator Chizek took it upon himself to set up a very secret, private meeting among Senator Schmit, Sheriff Roth, a representative of the Douglas County District Court, Judge Corrigan, and himself. I was asked by Senator Chizek and Senator Schmit to attend the meeting. I was glad to come, for the purpose of providing legal guidance to Senator Schmit, so that he did not engage in trying to solve the problem of protection for the witnesses in an illegal, if well-intentioned, manner. As the talks progessed, Sheriff Roth used a phrase that had special meaning to me. “I will tell you one thing,” he said, “Nick O’Hara of the FBI and Robert Wadman are closer than nineteen is to twenty. Everybody in law enforcement knows that. I know it especially well. Closer than nineteen is to twenty. That makes it almost impossible to get anything done or to arrange", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:54:1a02d4feeeb0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5760, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 55, "text": "the problem of protection for the witnesses in an illegal, if well-intentioned, manner.

That makes it almost impossible to get anything done or to arrange any witness protection through the feds. I will try to help in any way possible, but I am not sure anything can or will be done. These people involved are just too powerful. They carry enough weight in this community to do what they want and get away with it.” The net result of the secret meeting with Sheriff Roth and Judge Corrigan of the Douglas County District Court was nothing. The plan was for Judge Corrigan to explain the situation, including the fact that fellow district court judges were the subject of some of the accusations, to the other dozen district court judges. Then a plan might be worked out, for witness protection under the auspices of the court. A couple of weeks after that phone call, reporter Kathy Rutledge of the Lincoln Journal telephoned me at night at home. She said she understood I had been in touch with Loretta Smith, and she wanted to know all about the matter. It was clear from the beginning of the conversation, by the tone of her voice and her accusatory questions, that Kathy was intent on doing a hatchet job on me. I corrected Rutledge again and again. I pointed out to her that if I had done the things she was saying or implying that I did, such conduct would be a violation of legal codes of ethics and would subject me to penalties, including even revocation of my license to practice law. I urged that she not even write a story about this, for the protection of the young lady involved. If she insisted on writing a story, I said, she should at least tell the truth and not distort facts. A few days later, a lawyer working in my office, John Goc, walked into the office carrying the Lincoln Journal and talking loudly: “What are you trying to do, DeCamp, get yourselfdisbarred? What are you going around talking to this reporter for? When the Bar Association sees this, you can bet you’ll be in trouble. I hope you have a good explanation. You’re going to kill your lobbying business with this kind of story.” That is approximately what John Goc said to me on January 18, 1990. I ran down to get a copy of the newspaper, knowing already what Kathy Rutledge must have done.

I ran down to get a copy of the newspaper, knowing already what Kathy Rutledge must have done. Determined to get herself a headline story and lots of attention, she had to distort the truth. Just as I feared, every negative and distorted impression was conveyed by her story. Six days later, I would be notified by the Bar Association that I was under investigation, as a result of the Rutledge story. Even before that happened, I was confronted by Omaha World-Herald reporter Bob Dorr on the telephone, demanding that I answer questions about Franklin, such as what I knew, where I got my information, how I got the name of this Franklin witness, what secret information I had, and why I was conceal­ ing things. His drift was the same as Kathy Rutledge’s questions. I also prepared a documented reply to the Nebraska Bar Association inquiry, to prove that the conduct related by Kathy Rutledge in her article had not occurred. I was able to submit affidavits from two employees in my office, who swore that it was Loretta Smith who contacted me, and not vice versa. I also obtained an affidavit from a friend of Loretta, who knew me and my wife from when we had helped her, on request from her minister, several years earlier, and who was the person who advised Loretta to call me. Within hours after presentation to the Bar Association of this documentation, the bar investigation was terminated. I was cleared of any impropriety or wrongdoing. The Lincoln Journal ran a second story on the matter, after the DeCamp memo was issued, in which Rutledge attempted to correct the falsehoods and deceptions in the first story. In any case, I filed a slander and defamation lawsuit against the Journal for that first story, which lawsuit is still in the courts. Senate Resolution which triggered the investigation, I find what is occurring by both the Press and Institutions of Government nothing short of criminal. The Press quietly and carefully covers up, either thru ignorance or artifice, while the various institutions of Government repeat the old Commonwealth/State Security game of “let the statute of limitations run” on those that should and could be immediately prosecuted and investigate and study and “ask for more information.” The World Herald and Lincoln Journal want to know where I get information on Franklin.

Stop on any street corner in Omaha; go into any coffee shop; have a drink in any bar in Omaha, or if you are lazy, walk around the Capitol Rotunda in Lincoln and simply listen to the discussions. Here is what you will learn: Now, having said these things and reported these allegations, am I afraid of being sued by these powerful personalities. Absolutely not. Remember that rule you newspaper folk live and die by and crucify others by. If you have forgotten, let me repeat it for you: truth is a defense. And, since these are all public figures, we also know that absent any malice, and I have none, truth is definitely a defense. . .. Finally, a close friend of mine, who is a prominent reporter in Nebraska and whom I agreed not to name in this book, came to me privately to say that an agreement had been reached among the various individuals I had named in the memo, and others, for Peter Citron to be the one to sue me. The purpose would be to destroy me in full view of the public, and to repudiate the DeCamp memo. Truth put a crimp in that plan. Not long after the message was delivered to me, Peter Citron was charged with sex crimes involving male minors in the Omaha area. It seems that some parents, who knew their children were hanging around Peter Citron, were shocked to see him named in the DeCamp memo. They responded by asking their children, whether or not there was any truth to the allegations, with respect to Citron. One after another, the boys began to pour out the truth to their parents. Omaha World-Herald. Our small population, vast expanses, and the cost of maintaining a daily newspaper in this day and age, all guarantee that the World-Herald is the news source for this state.

Why all this effort? Because, tragically, the people who control the World-Herald appear to have a strong vested interest in suppressing the truth. Whether it is Peter Citron, past publisher Harold Andersen, or underlings who have their positions only because of Andersen, their linkage to Franklin dictates that they use the best tool available, the World-Herald, to tell the public what they want them to believe. Because of its virtual monopoly as a news source, something repeated often enough by the World-Herald may attain the status of truth in the minds of those who read it. In the case of Franklin, the paper has repeated a simple theme, shaped by its top personnel-that the Franklin sex scandal, pedophilia and drug abuse stories were trumped up. Senator Schmit, was functioning in an irresponsible manner, allowing leaks to the press and to others. In editorials and on the news pages, the World-Herald repeatedly condemned Senator Schmit for supposedly leaking information. Then they attacked me, for supposedly obtaining information from Senator Schmit and leaking it. In an unsolicited phone call from him, Fenner gave me details about Franklin’s secret accounts. In retrospect, I believe he wanted-through me-to throw cold water on the questions that were heating up in Omaha, about the role of Franklin monies in the Iran-Contra money-laundering schemes. At the time, I asked Fenner if he wanted me to share his information with Senator Schmit, which he did. On 8 January 1990m× office, Phone took a phone call from a young lady herself as ).

Upon having Mr. Bonacci meet me in an interviewing room, Bonacci related to this writer that he knew Troy Boner, Danny King, and Alicia [sic] Owen. He further advised that he had been a victim of Alan Baer, Peter Citron, and Larry King, and had some knowledge of Bob Wadman, Harold Anderson, and ajudge who he later on referred to as Carlson. During the next few hours, he related some of his knowledge reference Peter Citron, Alan Baer, Larry King, and also Bob Wadman. The subject stated that he had been on at least 1-200 trips and had been involved in extensive homosexual activity as a child and as a young adult, with his homosexual activity starting when he was approximately 8-10 years old. The subject then stated that between the years of 1982 and 1986 he had probably been on at least 200-300 trips. The subject stated that he made at least 15-20 trips to various parts of California, a couple of trips to Washington, D.C., and also trips to Des Moines, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Austin, Houston, Dallas, St. Louis, Miami, Pasadena, Tampa, Lincoln, and Grand Island. Some of those trips he thought involved politicians from Washington, D.C., however, he didn’t know anyone by name because of his young age. The subject stated that he was taken to the Omaha Police Department sometime in March and was talked to by Omaha Police Detective Mike Hoch, during which time Detective Hoch was very hard on Bonacci, and after finishing up with the police interview, he told Bonacci, that, reference Larry King, he was afraid he might prosecute him (Bonacci) as there would be no attempt to give him formal immunity. When questioned about Alan Baer, he stated that he first met him in the “Milk Run,” an area near and surrounding the Correctional Center. He stated that he was approximately 12 years old and that this occurred possibly in 1979. He stated that Alan Baer would pay him $20 for oral sex. He stated that the last time he had sex with Alan Baer was, he believed, around November 15, 1989, in Alan Baer’s apartment in the Twin Towers …. Other information received from Paul indicated that he had tried to get away from these people on many occasions, and in his attempt to escape them he did attempt suicide.

Paul Bonacci indicated that he was really very scared of being threatened. Other information gained during the interview: Bonacci stated he knew when Alisha Owen got pregnant because a young individual by the name of Chris told him that it was probably Bob Wadman who got Alisha pregnant. Further, he stated that there was another individual who he had spent time with in the Twin Towers by the name of Bob Morino, Apt. #4H, Twin Towers, Omaha, Nebraska. Also, there was another young boy sexually abused by Alan Baer by the name Peter Fells*. He stated that this individual might have moved to Tennessee, however, he was not sure. He also stated he made two trips to Washington, D.C. with Larry King-just the two of them alone. He stated that while in Washington. D.C.. he had sex with other people. He thought they were part of the Republican Party because Larry King was trying to hard to in with the higher ups\" in the Republican party. He stated that he heard the name of one of the individuals with whom he had sex as Frank. He thought he might be a senator or governor or some state official. … In or on July 26th I went to Sacramento, Ca. King flew me out on a private plane from Eppley Airfield [in Omaha] to Denver where we picked up Nicholas, a boy who was about 12 or 13. Then we flew to Las Vegas to a desert strip and drove in to Las Vegas and to some ranch and got something. Then flew on to Sacramento. We were picked up by a white limo and taken to a hotel. I don’t remember the name of it. We meaning Nicholas and I were driven to a area that had big trees, it took about an hour to get there. There was a cage with a boy in it who was not wearing anything. Nicholas and I were given these tarzan things to put around us and stuff. They told me to f— the boy and stuff. At first I said no and they held a gun to my balls and said do it or else lose them or something like that. I began doing it to the boy and stuff. And Nicholas had anal sex and stuff with him.

We did this stuff to the boy for about 30 minutes or an hour when a man came in and kicked us and stuff in the balls and picked us up and threw us. He grabbed the boy and started f—ing him and stuff. The man was about 10 inches long and the boy screamed and stuff and the man was forcing his d−− into the boy all the way. The boy was bleeding from his rectum and the men tossed him and me and stuff and put the boy right next to me and grabbed a gun and blew the boys head off. The boys blood was all over me and I started yelling and crying. The men grabbed Nicholas and I and forced us to lie down. They put the boy on top of Nicholas who was crying and they were putting Nicholas hands on the boys ass. They put the boy on top of me and did the same thing. They then forced me to f— the dead boy up his ass and also Nicholas they put a gun to our heads to make us do it. His blood was all over us. They made us kiss the boys lips and to eat him out. Then they made me do something I don’t want to even write so I won’t. After that the men grabbed Nicholas and drug him off screaming they put me up against a tree and put a gun to my head but fired into the air. I heard another shot from somewhere. I then saw the man who killed the boy drag him like a toy. Everything including when the men put the boy in a trunk was filmed. They took me with them and we went up in a plane.

About two hours later the men or Larry King came in and told us to go take a shower since we had only been hosed off at some guys house. We took a shower together and then were told to put on the tarzan things. After we were cleaned up and dressed in these things we were told to put on shorts, socks and a shirt and shoes and driven to a house where the men were at with some others. They had the film and they played it. As the men watched they passed Nicholas and I around as if we were toys and sexually abused us. They made Nicholas and I screw each other and one of the men put the dead boy’s penis in mine and Nicholas’ mouth. I didn’t want to write this because the man forced me to bite the boys’ penis and balls off. It was gross and I saw the film where it happened and started freaking out remembering what they made us do afterwards to the boy. They showed us doing everything to the boy. I was there for about 5 days attending parties but only recall cutting my wrist which is why I stayed two days in a hospital under a name I can’t recall. Some guy paid for me. Inother testimony, Bonacci said that Larry King was smiling and laughing the whole time the film was being shown, and that “the men with the hoods” were a Satanic group which planned to use the dead boy in some sort of ceremony. He also named the director of the snuff film, whom they had picked up in Las Vegas, as “Hunter Thompson.” We found no credible evidence of child sexual abuse, interstate transportation of minors, drug trafficking or participation in a pornography ring by King or other Franklin officials or employees. To the extent that homosexual relations occurred involving such employees or officials, the evidence we were able to uncover showed these exchanges to be voluntary acts between persons above the age of consent. Yes, Larry King had diverted credit union funds for his personal gain, but “it is our opinion that federal authorities are better able to pursue matters regarding this misappropriation of credit union funds, and we strongly recommend that they continue to do so.” And although “we also found probable cause to believe that King, on numerous occasions, used money or items of value to ‘entice,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:63:65e776dccd2d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5769, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 64, "text": "uncover showed these exchanges to be voluntary acts between persons above the age of consent.

Evidence also showed that these witnesses received substantial amounts of money or other valuables in exchange for sex…. Therefore, we believe Baer committed the offense of pandering, and we have handed down an indictment against him for that offense. Peter Citron, another of the five I named, appeared before the grand jury and was found to have had “inappropriate sexual contact with male minors,” but again, “no connection has been found to link Citron with the Franklin Credit Union ….” Citron had already been indicted and convicted for these contacts in a separate court process. The other two people indicted were the victim-witnesses, Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci. These young people had suffered, admitted the grand jury, but that had nothing to do with Franklin: “We think that Owen might have been sexually abused during her early years, but not by the people and in the way she has alleged.” As for Bonacci, “according to his testimony, he was a child victim of repeated sexual abuse by persons not associated with the Franklin investigation.” Accusing them of lying to the grand jury during May and June of 1990, the jury handed down indictments against Owen on eight counts of perjury and against Bonacci on three counts. The grand jury noted that in a May 1990 interim report, it had recommended “that the Washington County Attorney charge Jarrett Webb with third degree sexual assault of a minor,” namely Nelly Patterson Webb. Where Nelly had reported organized abuse and prostitution, however, she was not to be believed: In early 1986, Nelly began to expand her allegations by charging that she had been taken by King on flights to other cities such as Chicago and Washington, D.C. where she was “put on display”", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:64:ad712a4b65f0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5770, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 65, "text": "that in a May 1990 interim report, it had recommended “that the Washington County Attorney charge Jarrett Webb with third degree sexual assault of a minor,” namely Nelly Patterson Webb.

We interviewed a number of witnesses who traveled extensively with King, and a few made what must have been embarrassing admissions about engaging in sexual contact with King on some of these trips. However, no witness before the Grand Jury could confirm in any way that Nelly Webb or any other children were ever transported for any illegal purposes and we found no evidence to support these claims. Addressing other dimensions ofthe Webbs’ house of horrors, the grand jury offered its opinion that it was “unfortunate that so much time elapsed between the first allegations of abuse and the time that the last children were removed from the home.” It then faulted Carol Stitt of the Foster Care Review Board for writing to the state attorney general so promptly about Loretta Smith’s reports, instead of first making more inquiries on her own! But Attorney General Spire had “appropriately passed the information on to [Law Enforcement chief] William Howland,” and any delays past that point must have been due to Howland’s heavy workload, in the jury’s opinion. Loretta Smith, who testified before the grand jury, had “suffered more abuse and neglect than anyone should ever have to endure,” but “the perpetrators of such abuse may never be known.” In any event, “the Grand Jury found no evidence to substantiate any connection between King, or any Franklin personnel, and the alleged illegal activities described by the girl.” It casually mentioned that, according to the OPD, there were “over 500 known pedophiles in the Omaha area.” (Since the U.S. Department of Justice estimates that a typical pedophile molests 77 children before he is caught, and most are never caught, a contingent of 500 pedophiles would be abusing thousands of children every year!) caused us [grand jury members] to be greatly concerned. This individual, Robert W. Andresen, a white male, $6 5 \"$ , 325 lbs., has been known to coerce males (including male minors) to his residence. Once he has taken a male there, he may sexually assault and/or pornographically photograph the young man.

Having painted that bloodcurdling portrait, the grand jury dismissed the matter with a wave: “Unfortunately, because the victims refused to testify against him, we could not indict.” In reality, Andresen figured in the taped testimony of Troy Boner and Danny King to Gary Caradori, which the grand jury neglected to say. The grand jury charged that the “hoax” was spread by certain “rumormongers”; among these, it named two child care workers, to whom the victims had begun to speak. In the opinion of the grand jury, “Perhaps never in the history of Douglas County has the discordant multitude played so feverishly upon the rumor pipe as in the allegations of sexual misconduct rounding Franklin.” All those who had pursued the allegations, such as Senator Schmit and the Franklin committee, Senator Chambers, this writer, members of the Concerned Parents, and a free-lance journalist named Michael Casey, came under attack from the grand jury. But, in a striking variation from normal grand jury procedure-to either indict an individual or not to name him at all-this jury cleared, by name, all the prominent alleged abusers, including Judge Theodore Carlson, Harold Andersen, former Game and Parks Commissioner Eugene Mahoney, Omaha Mayor P.J. Morgan, and Omaha lawyer Thomas McKenney. As for alleged abuser Chief Robert Wadman, the jury observed, “We now look upon Owen as the perpetrator and Wadman as the victim.” According to the grand jury, one of the perpetrators did not even exist: “Owen repeatedly referred to a bodyguard and enforcer of King’s nicknamed ‘Larry the Kid.’ We believe this muscular, black male, in his late teens or early twenties, to be a fictitious character.” The report did not explain, how a fabricated personality could have appeared in reports from at least four different children over a period of three years. Loretta Smith told about a person named King Horse, who was at parties and rituals she attended in 1985. Alisha Owen testified that Larry King’s “henchman” was a black youth named “Larry (Lnuk)”, also known as Kings Horses. Danny King said “Larry, Jr.” was King’s righthand man. And Paul Bonacci reported that a black man he called “Larry Little King” would carry out threats on Larry King’s behalf. There are citizens who believe that prominent individuals, allegedly associated with this case, are automatically guilty because of their public stature. They also believe that the public stature of these individuals allows automatic protection and the power to cover up situations.

They also believe that the public stature of these individuals allows automatic protection and the power to cover up situations. While we agreed that this was a possibility, our investigation found nothing to substantiate any of these allegations. There is no evidence of a cover up. The Douglas County grand jury said it “spent the most time” and “the majority of our fact finding and deliberative effort,” on refuting the videotaped testimony assembled by Gary Caradori. It concluded, “There is no doubt after reviewing all relevant evidence, that the story of sexual abuse, drugs, prostitution, and judicial bribery presented in the legislative videotapes is a carefully crafted hoax, scripted by a person or persons with considerable knowledge of the people and institutions of Omaha, including personal relationships and shortcomings.” We have scrutinized Caradori’s investigative techniques. In too many instances individuals Caradori interviewed were “fed” items of information. He led his witnesses and the videotapes were stopped and started at suspicious intervals with the substance of the witnesses’ stories changing. Caradori stated that he thought it was his job to find the leads and it was someone else’s responsibility to follow them up. We believe to the contrary. We think that Caradori stood to gain professionally and personally from the outcome. Caradori spent more time supporting the allegations rather than verifying the same. Caradori worked from a sensational base. If there appeared to be something that would be scandalous, he was interested in following it through. If it was just a routine matter, he was not willing to invest the necessary time or effort. In October 1990, Karen Ormiston, the employee of Caradori’s investigative firm who was with him at the videotapings, passed a polygraph test administered by Chris Gugas, a professional polygraph specialist from San Diego who was President of the National Polygraph Association. The questions to which she answered “no,” were: “1. During Gary Caradori’s interviews with the Franklin case victims, did he ever threaten anyone in obtaining information from them? 2. To the best of your knowledge, did Gary coach any of the alleged Franklin case victims on what they should say in their interviews? 3. Did Gary and you advise any of the four victims at anytime to fabricate their stories?” To the question, “Were all the statements given to you and Gary by the four Franklin case victims completely voluntary?” she answered “yes.” Gugas concluded, “[I]t is the opinion of this examiner that Ms. Ormiston answered all of the above relevant questions truthfully,” One of Caradori’s close associates said after his death, “We never thought these tapes represented", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:67:72d3b15f007d", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5773, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 68, "text": "should say in their interviews? 3.

They are important, but the Franklin case has been turned into a debate on the tapes.” The collaborator was talking about the investigation’s reach into high political circles and into Washington D.C., but the point applies also to the use of the tapes themselves. The bad faith of the grand jury’s dismissal of Caradori’s work comes even more into relief, if contrasted with the reams of evidence in the investigator’s files, which the grand jury apparently failed to consider. By no means satisfied with the taped statements as they stood, the meticulous Caradori listed, at the end of each interview precis, dozens of leads for follow-up and cross-checking. A small excerpt demonstrates his exhaustive investigative agenda: The jury’s report says that it “heard live testimony from 76 witnesses” in all. Caradori’s notes on the Alisha Owen and Troy Boner tapes alone, list over 75 people to be interviewed during follow-up, not counting Alisha and Troy. Caradori’s evidence, the originals of which occupy a whole locked room at the statehouse, comprise cross-indexed binders, boxes of files, hundreds of hours of audiotapes as well as the videotapes, and a list of 291 potential witnesses in all. The grand jury had a full set in its possession. Phone calls against the jury’s findings poured into a local TV station, as reported in the Omaha Metro Update of July 30: “The day after the grand jury report hit on Tuesday, July 24, an ‘unscientific’ viewer phone-in poll by Omaha television station KETV Channel 7 indicated 10-1 viewer dissatisfaction with the grand jury report. More than 3,000 responses were tallied.” The jury claimed-without having called me to testifythat I had “issued [my] memorandum for personal political gain and possible revenge for past actions against [me].” I filed a civil suit, charging that the jury’s statements “were malicious, intentional, negligent and done in … violation of [my] clearly established constitutional and statutory rights.” The legislative Franklin committee’s official response to the jury’s report raised a question which the jury had carefully left unanswered. “We assume from their choice of wordscarefully crafted hoax,” the Franklin committee said, “that the Grand Jury was persuaded that the testimony of the witnesses corroborated each other, and included facts and circumstances which were readily verifiable and attested to by other witnesses. Otherwise, it could not be logically deemed ‘carefully crafted.’ If it", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:68:54c68fa52f11", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5774, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 69, "text": "clearly established constitutional and statutory rights.” The legislative Franklin committee’s official response to the jury’s report raised a question which the jury had carefully left unanswered. “We assume from their choice of wordscarefully crafted hoax,” the Franklin committee said, “that the Grand Jury was persuaded that the testimony of the witnesses corroborated each other, and included facts and circumstances which were readily verifiable and attested to by other witnesses. Otherwise, it could not be logically deemed ‘carefully crafted.’ If it was carefully crafted, who crafted it and when?” In addition, the committee observed, “Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci are charged with perjury and Troy Boner and Danny King are not. As we see it, the victims who stand by their story are charged with perjury, while those that have admitted to false statements before the Committee [in the videotaped testimony] are not. That makes little sense to us. Either all of them should have been indicted or none of them. The message is mixed and appears to favor encouraging the recanting as a way to avoid the hazards of criminal prosecution. It also tells persons they can lie under oath to Legislative Committees, so long as they change their story before they get to court.” The Omaha World-Herald, whose society columnist Citron stood convicted of child molestation while its former publisher, Andersen, was whitewashed in the grand jury report, leaped to the jury’s defense. “Grand Jury Did Its Job; The Insults Are Intolerable,” blared its lead editorial on July 29, 1990. Loran Schmit is frantically rewriting history as he urges the public to believe that his Franklin committee doesn’t deserve the criticism it was given by the Douglas County grand jury. . . . Senator Schmit, you and other people connected with the committee haven’t been putting evidence together properly since the day committee investigator Gary Caradori made the videotapes that became part of the Franklin story. . . . Schmit clearly had his mind made up on the credibility of many of the stories on the videotapes. By June, still sticking by his view that the stories were believable, he was insinuating that “money is being spent” to block the indictments of prominent people. The more such statements were repeated, the more some Nebraskans believed the wild tale of a sex-and-drug ring and cover-up involving Omaha individuals and institutions. The World-Herald evidently hoped that the “wild tale” about prostitution and a cover-up had been laid to rest by the grand jury. The more that became known about that panel, however, the more obvious it was that the grand jury itself, guided by prosecutor Samuel Van Pelt, was adding to the cover-up, and had systematically leaked sensitive information, buried crucial evidence, and threatened witnesses. A grand jury can be the best or the worst device to uncover crime. First, everything in a grand jury is supposed to be secret.

A grand jury can be the best or the worst device to uncover crime. First, everything in a grand jury is supposed to be secret. Second, the prosecutor in charge of the grand jury can do about as he pleases, in presenting or screening information. If a corrupt or incompetent prosecutor is in charge, the result will correspond to his behavior. Third, if the grand jury is controlled by corrupt forces, as I believe this one was, then they may use the grand jury as a means to find out what people know about the matter under scrutiny, by calling them as witnesses, without any of that information becoming public. Then such information can be used to assist in a cover-up. The so-called recantations of Troy Boner and Danny King appear to be a case in point. Nebraska may have the worst laws in the United States, on the use of the grand jury system. They contribute to corruption and cover-up, rather than proper investigation and indictment. At an October 14-15, 1991 hearing in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Paul, Minnesota, this fact was exploited by the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, which was defending Douglas County Prosecutor Van Pelt and the grand jury foreman in the Franklin case, Michael Flanagan, before a threejudge panel that was questioning them. The state’s argument was that the poor quality and ambiguity of Nebraska state laws on the use of grand juries at the county level should exempt the prosecutor and the foreman from responsibility for any errors or wrongdoing committed by the grand jury. Concern that the grand jury was rigged arose even before it was chosen, just as soon as retired judge Van Pelt was named as special prosecutor for the Franklin case at the county level. On March 12, 1990, the Lincoln Journal ran a letter from 43 neighbors of the late Cairo, Nebraska farmer and political activist Arthur Kirk, in which they termed Van Pelt “a hired gun for the state.” The group charged that Van Pelt had covered up the 1984 death of Kirk at the hands of a State Police SWAT squad, which they called murder. In that case, they wrote, “Van Pelt simply took the statements of the perpetrators, put them in his report and exonerated them of any wrongdoing. He did exactly what he was paid and hired to do.” Gross irregularities in Van Pelt’s investigation of Kirk’s death were noted by Senator Ernie Chambers and others at the time. The police, for instance, claimed that Kirk fired first.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:70:afae3710f287", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5776, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 71, "text": "of Kirk at the hands of a State Police SWAT squad, which they called murder.

The police, for instance, claimed that Kirk fired first. If he had, their claim to have fired in self-defense might have held water; yet no ballistics tests were done to see if Kirk had fired his weapon at all! Kirk’s wife charged that she had been used by the state police to lure Kirk out of his house, so he could be gunned down. “I came to realize that they had used me against my own husband. I had been used as a decoy,” she was quoted in Lindsey Williams’ 1987 book, Where’s the Food? Despite glaring contradictions in the SWAT team’s story, Van Pelt found that the police had acted in self-defense. The World-Herald retaliated against the Cairo citizens’ letter, with an all-out defense of Van Pelt. The March 17, 1990 lead editorial, “Van Pelt’s Report on Kirk Followed the Evidence,” lamented, “The sad fact of the matter is that some people cling to wild, sensational rumors and conspiracy theories even in the absence of any rational basis.” Van Pelt’s behavior during the Franklin grand jury was no rumor, but a matter of record. Three people who testified before the grand jury-Paul Bonacci, Alisha Owen, and a young woman called “Jane Doe”-subsequently charged that Van Pelt intimidated them and attempted to force them to change their testimony. ROSENTHAL: Well, I was to the extent that I was allowed to. You see, in my opinion they just never asked her any questions at all…. And I think at one time, without getting into it, they asked her do you want to say anything? She says, I’m sorry you never got to the point in three days. It was always go around the circle and it was always accusatory more than trying to get the facts out and let the chips fall where they may. They never gave her an opportunity to go into them, you see. OWEN: I-you know, as I said before, they never talked to me about 1983 and 1984. They don’t even know what happened. They-they send me into this grand jury, they are calling me a perjurer and they have never even asked me what happened.

The fact that I know about the bunion or the knot on his little toe and he has hair on his toes, you know, I can tell you exactly how the hair patches on his feet are, it would be a gross injustice if that was suppressed in the grand jury. I think that would-that would be absolutely a crime. Because in the United States today when it comes to those kinds of cases, a lot of times the only way that a victim can actually prove that they were abused is by identifying key marks on that person’s body that no one else would know. A way to call me a liar and a way to say she’s not telling the truth would be to suppress that, would be not to watch-I made you a tape describing Rob’s body. For the grand jury, I consider that a key piece of evidence. For that to be suppressed I think is a crime. I think that that is willful, knowledgeable suppression of evidence. And to have that done by a prosecutor, I think that’s a crime and that’s a deliberate cover-up. According to Jane Doe, Van Pelt told her how to testify and why, revealing information about the Grand Jury proceedings that others had been charged to keep secret. … Van Pelt was said to make some references to Jane Doe’s past, including some illegal activities that were blocked out of the transcript, that could have been interpreted by her as a threat to her. She said in the interview, were some things that I had done in my past that I was afraid he was going to charge me with….

A co-founder of the Concerned Parents group, Cosentino told Chambers she was repeatedly harrassed by Van Pelt’s assistant Terry Dougherty outside the jury room. The jury’s sole interest, it seemed to her, was to tie her to Michael Casey, a journalist whom the grand jury was to build up as an orchestrator of the “carefully crafted hoax.” Numerous questions asked by Mr. Van Pelt and Mr. Dougherty, seemed to be accusatory and began with phrases like, “Did you tell Carol Stitt … (Foster Care Review Board) and”Did you tell Jerry Lowe … \" (former Franklin investigator). I found myself on trial for reporting leads to the proper authorities. I was questioned relentlessly about Michael Casey, who seemed to be the focus ofMr. Van Pelt’s prosecution. I had only met Mr. Casey on two occasions, neither of which were interviews. Mr. VanPelt and Mr. Dougherty seemed to try over and over again to form some relationship between myself and Mr. Casey which simply did not exist. And it’s also sort of interesting, of course, I appeared before the grand jury. I had about 25 minutes for a statement the first time, and they had about that many questions. Mr. Van Pelt said they didn’t have any further need for my appearance up there. And I thought that was sort of strange in view of the fact that we spent a year and a half at this, we have spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours, and the Franklin committee could answer all their questions. And I might, without revealing anything that was asked, might add that most of the questions that were asked of me, I think [Franklin committee counsel] Mr. Berry is here, had little or nothing to do with the scope of the investigation. The grand jury explained that its failure to subpoena Larry King was due to the probability that King would have invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. In other cases, it was fine with Van Pelt to call witnesses who would take the fifth, as he indicated to Jane Doe in the exchange reported by the Nebraska Observer: On the return trip home, Mr. Van Pelt told Jane Doe about the “easy day” coming up the next day. When she asked why, he disclosed to her that the witness would “plead the Fifth.” She said, \" told me that he was a homosexual and that he had sex with little boys. And that they would indict him on that, so the fact is that he had to plead the Fifth so he would not get indicted.\" Van Pelt said it would be an easy day “because he", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:73:b1d6586c2550", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5779, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 74, "text": "Jane Doe about the “easy day” coming up the next day.

He appointed Douglas County Assistant Attorney Robert Sigler. Sigler was very familiar with the Franklin case; he was the prosecuting attorney when Alisha Owen was sentenced to five years in prison for passing $700 in bad checks. He had handled the child molestation trial of World-Herald society columnist Peter Citron. After Citron’s conviction, Sigler maintained that the Citron case had never been linked with the Franklin investigation “in the beginning, middle, or end. That’s not what this case is about.” He told the World-Herald. “It had nothing to do with Franklin, the evidence uncovered didn’t show any link. That’s a big misconception.” BONACCI: With Larry King I’ve traveled a lot of times to Kansas City, and that was usually by car. But we used to go up to Sioux City, Iowa and we used to take a-there was a chartered plane. It was called KAM Air or something. And they used to fly us up to Sioux City and we’d stay at a hotel that was right on the river. And he had a boat and stuff we used to go on all the time. And he-we used to go up there for having sex and stuff. … Before he joined the Douglas County prosecutor’s office, Sigler had worked for an Omaha law firm, where he handled the legal affairs of Charlie Rogers, a former lover of Larry King who died an apparent suicide in 1989. In the days before his death, Rogers told friends that he was very afraid of what King would do to him, and that if anything happened to him, to contact Robert Sigler. The Douglas County grand jury said it “spent a considerable amount of time investigating all aspects of Rogers’ death,” but concluded it had nothing to do with Larry King.

Sigler’s friend and associate in the law firm, Gerald Moran, later also joined the Douglas County attorney’s office. In 1991, he ran the prosecution of Alisha Owen for perjury. From the outset, Paul Bonacci presented a huge obstacle for the Douglas County grand jury. Since Bonacci refused to recant what he had testified to Caradori, Van Pelt’s jury was compelled to indict him for perjury, in order to maintain that the story of Franklin-connected abuse was a carefully crafted hoax. It was difficult to see how Bonacci could have participated with Owen in the fabrication of such a hoax. Caradori did not even meet him until May 10, 1990, and took his videotaped statement for the Franklin committee on May 14-five days after Owen finished testifying before the grand jury. Bonacci’s recollections corroborated Alisha’s on many points, although he told Caradori that he thought the last time he had spoken with her was in 1986. Bonacci was perhaps the most pathetic witness to appear during the entire proceedings. . .. He has been diagnosed as having multiple personalities, and his psychiatrist doubts that he can tell the truth. His many inconsistencies and contradictions render his testimony unbelievable and necessitate his indictment for perjury. This tortured formula contained not one, but two contradictions. Obviously, a person who was medically incapable of telling the truth could not also be guilty of perjury, or deliberate lying under oath. The second error, however, was to cite the alleged opinion of “Bonacci’s psychiatrist,” who did not appear as a witness before the grand jury. It was a stretch even to apply this label to the doctor in question, Dr. Beverly Mead, since he examined Bonacci on behalf of the Omaha Police Department. But where Dr. Mead did testify, before the Franklin committee, he said he believed Bonacci to be telling the truth! Dr. Judianne Densen-Gerber, New York-area psychiatrist, lawyer, child abuse expert and member of the International Society of Multiple Personality and Dissociative States, has described the ailment Bonacci suffers from, Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). It is not a psychosis, she said, but a neurosis, that results from a defense mechanism in the mind of a child seeking to protect himself from “unimaginable atrocity.” Virtually all MPD victims were severely abused starting before they were six years old, with tortures such as being hung upside down and having hot objects stuck inside them, or being forced to participate in the murder,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:75:71f771094e2c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5781, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 76, "text": "and Dissociative States, has described the ailment Bonacci suffers from, Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD).

A child subjected to such terrible emotional and physical pain has no possibity of escape from this “emotional Auschwitz,” so his mind, in self-defense, invents another identity at the moment of abuse and suffering. Through this mechanism, the child victim can imagine he is someone else, looking at the pain and betrayal from the outside, as if it were not actually happening to him. As the victim grows older, these different personalities survive in the victim’s mind, each having its own age, name, memories and characteristics. Multiple Personality Disorder is familiar to many people from Flora Rheta Schreiber’s book Sybil, about the first MPD victim who ever reintegrated her personality through psychoanalysis. “Sybil,” tortured since infancy by her mother, first sought a psychiatrist’s help as a young woman in Omaha, Nebraska. DENSEN-GERBER: I think it would be very difficult for Mr. Bonacci to lie…. Being a multiple personality there is no need to lie, you switch [personalities] …. First of all, Mr. Bonacci’s story is an average story for someone in Mr. Bonacci’s circumstances. There is nothing that Bonacci told me that I haven’t heard from other patients or individuals. He has no elaborations and he often says I don’t know. He does not fabricate or he does not try to provide answers which most people do because they want to please. He doesn’t even give you the impression that he wants to please. SENATOR SCHMIT: I have several questions of Dr. Mead.

Finally, the credibility of Paul Bonacci is bolstered by his own action in April of 1986, two years before there was a Franklin case, when he reported to the Omaha Police Department and to officials of his high school, that he was abused by Harold Andersen, Larry King, Alan Baer, and others. Henry Rosenthal, then Bonacci’s attorney, spoke to the Franklin committee about this on June 21, 1990. ROSENTHAL: I talked to his people at school, you know, because I-I had some severe doubts about this fellow telling me about that. But his problem-one day he went kind of outer space in school and they thought it was drugs and it really wasn’t. This stuff was really starting to work on him. He just did not want to recruit anymore for Mr. Baer. ROSENTHAL: But I talked to the school officials. You are talking about assistant principal at school, how many people, 4,000 students. I talked to his head counselor and they said it’s absolutely true. They phone the police department and said he’s in the hospital, are you going out to interview him? “No, we have closed the case.” When he mentioned those prominent people, those people [school officials] told me you could just see like they closed their eyes and their books and was gone.

The Union Pacific and Kiewit Foundation were depositors in and contributors to the Franklin Credit Union . Wearing crown and long train is former Nebraska and Parks Commissioner Eugene Mahoney, King of Ak-Sar-Ben for 1991. One of the most powerful politicians in the state , Mahone y was investigated by Gary Caradori. Jill Cutshall, 9 years old, was kidnaped from her home in Norfolk, Nebraska in 1987. She was never seen Investigator Roy trace David Phelps, who was convicted ofabducting for sexual abuse. In 1991 , Stephens investigated and confirmed leads provided by Paul Bonacci on other major kidnaping and abuse cases. Senator Schmit warned the Franklin committee at the outset, not to expect to breeze through an investigation like this. “No one person,” he told the Executive Board session of December 12, 1988, “could have masterminded this without the compliance and the acquiescence and cooperation of a number of people, some of whom had to be in official positions…. I do not want anyone to say I want to be on this committee, then all of a sudden say, wait a minute, I don’t want to walk through that mine field with you, because that is what it will very likely prove to be.” Senator Chambers, who represented the black district of north Omaha where Franklin was headquartered, agreed: “What Larry King is doing is the tip of an iceberg and he’s not in it by himself. One thing I told the Attorney General … is that I don’t want Larry King to commit suicide and I don’t want any accidents that will take him out. What he’s doing he has not done by himself and couldn’t do by himself.” Larry King himself bragged about his connections. “I felt that I could call anyone in this city,” he told the TV interviewer who questioned him about favors from Chief Wadman. In a September 7, 1988 interview with the Omaha weekly Metropolitan, before the Franklin Credit Union scandal broke, King was more expansive about his friends: They were the key to my success. I had really great, great people who were counselors and teachers, who were over some of the major companies in the city. And I would go to them and ask them what they thought I should do and sometimes they would come and sit down or send someone out to talk with us.

I called him once years ago when we were in a crisis and he said, “I’Il be there at 7:30 tomorrow morning.” And so he was. So I have to say the Omaha power structure has some of the best people to work with. They’ll help you if they’re convinced you want to help Omaha. They don’t tum their backs: they have never done it to me. And I appreciate it because I like being a part of what makes this city grow, and this country. Days and even weeks after the raid, some of Franklin’s backers were still defending King. The World-Herald of November 9, 1988 quoted its own publisher, Harold Andersen, Ken Power of US West Communications, and Lyn Wallin Ziegenbein of the Kiewit Foundation, in praise of King. “Until the day it closed, Franklin was performing a useful purpose,” Harold Andersen said on November 30, 1988. Yet someone making even a casual inquiry-such as a businessman might be expected to do before he contributed or deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars in a credit unionwould quickly hear the kind of warning Boys Town social worker Julie Walters did, when she asked around about King. They would have heard he was a dangerous man, and they would have heard about pornography, drugs, and pedophilia. Some, at least, of these “great people” from the major companies, had to know precisely what they were doing when they sponsored Larry King. In Gary Caradori’s files is the transcript of a February 12, 1989 phone conversation with Sheila McGuire, aka Sheila Calder, former manager of the French Cafe, who had moved to the West Coast. This night spot, partly owned by Larry King, was named by victim-witnesses as a center of sexual abuse. Alisha Owen told Caradori that “Sheila Calder would arrange parties at the French Cafe during the afternoon when the cafe was closed.” We had parties in my apartment above the French Cafe. Larry King would wine and dine potential investors downstairs at the Cafe. When the French Cafe closed about 1 AM, King and his man called Parking Lot Bob-who worked for him (and was our coke connection)-would bring people upstairs to my place. If Larry King investors wanted drugs, booze, children or hookers (male or female) we’d get them.

One time, when this guy Irv from NYC wanted Sandrawho was about 12 or 13 years old and getting her 1st period, Larry intervened when Sandra refused. King pulled out a roll of $100.00 bills and gave Sandra 5 of them. King then pulled out a small gram of coke and gave that to Sandra. Sandra finally agreed and went off to bed with Irv. King took good care of the local and out of town high rollers. If you had the money to invest at Franklin, King would cater to your most deranged perversion. And, let me tell you another thing. The boys in the board rooms around Omaha are s—ing in their Brogans. If this case gets cracked open the list of involved will read like Who’s Who. King and his crew have ruined a lot of childrens’ lives. Two years after the raid on King’s credit union, as the legislative Franklin committee’s original term drew to a close, an old hand in Nebraska politics reflected on the events of the past 24 months. “The Omaha business community,” he said, “the Ak-Sar-Ben crowd, has really closed ranks behind Alan Baer, Andersen and the rest of them. The word has gone out: layoff the Franklin investigation. Most of the Senators are terrified. These guys make and break political careers. They give a lot of campaign money, and many of the Senators get what are generously called ‘consulting fees,’ or sometimes positions-no-show jobs, really-with the big firms up there. That’s the way it’s done. It’s not uncommon for a big company to have more than one Senator on a $50, 000 retainer.” Visit the Omaha Public Library to look up the boards of directors of big Omaha companies, and you will find names that are listed on board after board. Take a few of those-say, Walter Scott, Jr., chairman and CEO of the construction giant, Peter Kiewit and Sons Corporation; Charles “Mike” Harper, chairman and CEO of the $20 billion per year food conglomerate ConAgra; Michael H. Walsh, CEO of Union Pacific Railroad, a major force in Nebraska for over a hundred yearsand ask the librarian to help find information on these men.

The reply will likely be something like what one library staffer told a friend of mine in 1991: “These are businessmen all right, but they are intensely secretive. We have very little on them.” For over a century, the Omaha business community has been organized around the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, a quasifreemasonic social organization, centered on a racetrack and fairgrounds in Omaha. Spell “Nebraska” backwards and you get its name. Founded in 1895, Ak-Sar-Ben functions as a sort of central committee of the corporate elite, and a self-perceived oligarchy for the city. Every year Ak-Sar-Ben celebrates a ritual coronation of the “King of Ak-Sar-Ben,’ generally an older corporate executive, and his Queen, generally the younger wife or daughter of another man in the club. The king for 1990 was Mike Harper of ConAgra. Here, and at debutante balls and other affairs organized for the younger generation, the lords and ladies of Ak-Sar-Ben establish their social pecking order. The rituals and”den shows\" mimic ceremonies from different lands, real and invented, and always pagan. Past Ak-Sar-Ben festivity themes included: “The Roman Hippodrome,” “King Arthur’s Wild Goats,” “Trouble in the Tropics,” and “Hi-Jinx in Hades.” Sometimes the men and boys of Ak-Sar-Ben paraded in women’s clothing, or dressed as Egyptian goddesses. Ak-Sar-Ben’s clout is so legendary, that Omaha Mayor P.J. Morgan, himself a member of the Ak-Sar-Ben social set, could make political hay by a demagogic attack on it. In 1990, during a squabble with Ak-Sar-Ben over where a new stadium would be constructed, Morgan blustered, “Frankly, I’m just sick and tired of a small handful of people who think that they can control this city and county without regard to feelings, sentiments and desires of the honest, hard-working people who are the real foundation of this city.” Sensitive to this widespread perception, ConAgra’s Harper, speaking as chairman of Ak-Sar-Ben’s Board of Governors, replied in a special World-Herald column on December 9, 1990, “Ak Knights Don’t Control City.” Just because the individuals and corporations on Ak-Sar-Ben’s board had given over $50 million to various causes over the past 20 years, wrote Harper, ticking off a list of most of the public facilities in Omaha, that did not mean they had clout. “I am at a loss to see how contributions to reputable charities can be associated with political power.” Harper’s own company flaunted its political power over the city and the state, just a few years ago.

The city acquiesced. Later the same year, when the Nebraska Legislature was on the verge of removing personal property tax exemptions on purchases of jet airplanes and mainframe computers, Harper put out the word to the legislature: Change the tax bill, or ConAgra leaves Nebraska.

The Franklin Credit Union had two boards. The small, governing board included Larry King, Jarrett Webb and James C. Hart, Jr., the secretary, who were named as child abusers by victim-witnesses before the Legislature’s Franklin committee.

One of its biggest financial contributors in recent years was the department store heir and child abuser, Alan Baer. Catering for Ak-Sar-Ben was Gary West, bartender from the Max gay bar. This situation will be like the Nazi regime after it failed, nobody saw Hitler. nobody knew who Hitler was, but one kid once saw an old man who one time knew a guy who talked to a guy who saw a car drive by with curtains on it and somebody said Hitler was in that car. That’s the way this is going to be, nobody knows anything, nobody has seen anything, nobody knows why investigations in the past, by the federal government, were terminated. Sure enough, over the next months one board member after another would appear on the pages of the World-Herald, to deny he had really had anything to do with Franklin. Virtually nobody from the powerful firms that channeled funds to Franklin and advisers to its board, was ever questioned by the Franklin committee about his relations with the credit union. Once again, according to one veteran politician, the whiff of a ConAgra payoff was in the air: Those who helped cut short the Franklin investigation would receive campaign funding from ConAgra, and those who pursued it would not. At 1400 this writer arrived at the Massachusetts Mutual Insurance Company located at 90th and Dodge, Omaha, Nebraska, and contacted Mr. Joe Barker. Mr. Barker then did admit to writing policies for Larry King and his family. He stated that as far as he knew, he handled all of Larry King’s life insurance. Mr. Barker stated that he had known Larry King for many years. He was not certain how they met, however,they did share some duties on church committees and possibly several other boards…. When my questioning startedto center around social gatherings,Mr. Barker indicated with a nervous gesture that yes, he had been to some social events with Larry King, but that everything was always “on the up and up.” He stated that throughout his friendship with Larry, everything was always “straight” and that he had never seen anything out of the ordinary. In other cases, Franklin Advisory Board members were one step removed from personal contact with King.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:83:1ce724ab5fa7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5789, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 84, "text": "and possibly several other boards….

In other cases, Franklin Advisory Board members were one step removed from personal contact with King. One person from a company would sit on the board, while somebody else was more directly in touch. The law firm Byrne & Randall (credit union board member Carolyn Rothery) fit this pattern. Joseph Byrne handled much of King’s legal business early in his career, and King used Byrne as a personal reference on credit applications, according to a February 17, 1989 report by Jerry Lowe. Byrne’s partner, Gary Randall, was the lawyer who negotiated Jarrett and Barbara Webb’s way out of trouble in 1986. Erickson, Sederstrom, Leigh, Eisenstatt, Johnson, Kinnamon (credit union board member Leo Eisenstatt) was retained by King and the credit union for various matters. Quoted by James Traub in a December 1991 article in Gentlemen’s Quarterly, Leo Eisenstatt recalled, “The Kings came to our house for dinner, and we went to their house. We were one big, happy family.” An employee of Erickson, Sederstrom, Leigh, Eisenstatt, et al., Jay Derr, came to the attention of Caradori and the Franklin committee, in connection with King’s sexual escapades. Caradori received reports from at least two sources, that Derr had taken a private flight with King to the 1988 Republican National Convention, where King organized one of his sex parties. In his notes of March 29, 1990, Caradori reported a local law enforcement officer receiving “a call from the DEA in D.C. requesting help on Jay Derr.” Then Paul Bonacci testified about him before the Franklin committee on June 12, 1990. Harold Andersen was King’s biggest backer in the Omaha business community. He chaired Franklin’s Advisory Board and co-chaired its fundraising drive, starting in 1983. These money-raising efforts lost some of their luster in 1989, when it was revealed that the money was used to build an addition to the credit union, the most prominent feature of which was a bedroom. The retreat was equipped with “a brass bed, a fluffy white comforter, a stereo and a television,” according to former Franklin employee Noel Seltzer, quoted in the March 5, 1989 Lincoln Journal. Others said King used it for afternoon trysts with his homosexual lovers. Andersen claimed that he did not know there was a bedroom in the addition he raised the money for, but Seltzer had a specific recollection, reported in the Village Voice: “When the addition opened, credit union employees say, Andersen gave guided tours of the new building. ‘He always walked by the door and it", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:84:ba34b34a0ebc", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5790, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 85, "text": "to former Franklin employee Noel Seltzer, quoted in the March 5, 1989 Lincoln Journal.

We did.’” Seltzer told the Lincoln Journal, that during Andersen’s opening-day tour, “the door to the bedroom was open, … although it was kept locked after that and the room was off limits to employees.” This man that the World-Herald has pussy-footed around and tried to hold up as a role model for our children, a leader in our community, is a gross insult to us … and I get tired of seeing World-Herald headlines about the leader of the credit union, things that try to indicate that he typifies what our community is…. In the community there is outrage that the appearance seems to be to try to keep this man looking like a decent, upstanding citizen. One of the pictures you’ll see is where he was catering something for one of the Christ Child centers in Omaha to make it look like he’s a great guy. You’ll see an article that talks about how generously he gave for AIDs research. If I’m stealing your money, it is easy for me to be generous with that money. In the black community $100 for the Boys Club, $100 for the Girls Club. For a gay outfit in Washington, D.C., $123, 4000 at a pop…. So the reason I’m saying this is to indicate that I believe that the World-Herald tried to cover up. It was company policy to protect the pedophiles, admitted World-Herald reporter Gabriella Stem in 1990. Asked why the World-Herald did not print information Stem herself had discovered about a young homosexual tied to Alan Baer, Stern shouted, in the presence of other reporters in the statehouse corridor, that “we have to protect the little fag because he would lead to the big fag,” namely Baer. (When I mentioned Stern’s exclamation, on a radio station KKAR program, World-Herald publisher Woody Howe called me to deny Stern said any such thing. But Stem herself confirmed to me that she had. Soon afterwards, she left the World-Herald to work for the Wall Street Journal.)

I conducted my first successful election campaign, from Vietnam where I was an infantry captain, without ever setting foot in the United States. The publicity about that was important to my election, but there was another, secret powerful factor. Senator Gene Mahoney had become arch enemies with the senator I was running against, Bill Wylie. I chanced to fit perfectly into Mahoney’s plans against Wylie. Gene Mahoney would demand that you be his “boy,” once he put you in office. He might not call on you very often, but when he wanted your vote or your support on something, you had better deliver. I did not deliver, early on, because we disagreed on a major matter. As a result, I am supposed to spend the rest of my life doing “penance for Uncle Gene.” It is a common joke among political folk in Nebraska, that if you cross “Uncle Gene,” you will have to “do penance.” Immediately west of the Louisville State Park is a little camp near there with a half a dozen cabins in it. And Mr. Mahoney’s is the far west cabin in that group right up against the river. … We took that car down there and went up with the keys to leave the, to identify the car, so here’s the keys. And the door swung open and as I recall there was no screen or anything on it. And there stood a large, heavyset, fleshy, young black man absolutely in the buff with nothing but a big smile on his face. Information was obtained that Mr. Mahoney has a cabin at the west end of Louisville Park. [The source] also stated that some sexual activities may have occurred there. He stated Harold Andersen was real close with Gene Mahoney and his name had come up on several occasions. The name, Nate Foley*, was mentioned. He stated he knew for a fact that Gene Mahoney had propositioned him in the past and showed him some photos…. [He] informed this writer that Mr. Foley did get very upset at the time when he was propositioned by Mr. Mahoney. He also stated that possibly Mr. Foley did get a promotion to keep his mouth shut about the incident.

During his time with the Commission, he stated that Eugene Mahoney always travelled with young individuals, i.e. late teens or early 20s…. Whenever Mahoney would travel, especially with his aides, they always had to stay in the same room or cabin with Mahoney. He stated that on numerous occasions Harold Andersen had also travelled with Mahoney, which may have been to promote the State Games [sic] and Parks Commission, and also for fundraisers. This park isn’t quite done but it’s got a major residence in there with an apartment above and below. Mr. Mahoney to this day, you know he’s not affiliated with the Game Commission, lives in the upper half when he’s around. The lower half, 10 and behold, has a beautiful blond, blue-eyed young male there that Mr. Mahoney found at about 18 or 19 years of age. And he is kept there at state expense. He’s the highest priced park superintendent in the state even though when he came in there he had absolutely no credentials. He’d never worked in a state park and didn’t know anything about managing people or the wildlife or anything. With the help of Harold Andersen and Lincoln Journal-Star publisher Joseph Seacrest, over a two-year period, Mahoney raised more than $10 million for the new Mahoney State Park. According to Caradori’ s confidential informant, “There’s an assumption that there’s some Franklin Credit Union money that went into that place.” To identify where the park money came from, he said, Mahoney, who was appointed Nebraska Game and Parks Commission director when Democrat Exon was governor and who was appointed by Republican Gov. Orr to the OPPD post, said he reluctantly would seek election to the post next year. “I really hate campaigning,” said Mahoney, a former state senator from South Omaha. As essential to Franklin as Andersen’s fundraising and publicity were, the credit union could not have functioned for a single day without the complicity of Nebraska’s largest bank, FirsTier. Before coming to Franklin, Larry King had been a management trainee at Omaha National Corporation, one of the institutions that merged into FirsTier in 1984. “There would sometimes be a million dollars coming in in the morning and a million leaving in the afternoon,” said one person familiar with the investigation. “The amounts were astounding, and remember this is a $2.6 million credit union. There is no conceivable way in the world that FirsTier was not fully aware of what was happening, as far as gross irregularities.” FirsTier would cover for", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:87:a500dad82a45", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5793, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 88, "text": "at Omaha National Corporation, one of the institutions that merged into FirsTier in 1984. “There would sometimes be a million dollars coming in in the morning and a million leaving in the afternoon,” said one person familiar with the investigation. “The amounts were astounding, and remember this is a $2.6 million credit union. There is no conceivable way in the world that FirsTier was not fully aware of what was happening, as far as gross irregularities.” FirsTier would cover for Franklin when the credit union overdrew, as one disgruntled FirsTier official told former Franklin employee Noel Seltzer. Senator Chambers charged in early June of 1989, that the large volumes of Franklin transactions, occurring in such short periods of time, should have raised suspicions about the nature of its business. This was just business as usual, protested the officers of FirsTier. Bank Vice President Donald Petersen told the Lincoln Journal on June 5,1989, “Franklin Credit Union had acommercial account with FirsTier Bank Omaha that was no different from our standpoint than other commercial accounts. We clear incoming and outgoing items for our customers, but the customer is ultimately responsible for each transfer in their account.” During Franklin’s heyday, the board of FirsTier Bank and FirsTier Financial Services was a who’s who of the Omaha business community. On it were pedophile Alan Baer and Knight of Ak-Sar-Ben Walter Scott, Jr., the Kiewit Construction chairman who was known in the business community as “one of the real powers” in FirsTier. The Legislature’s Franklin committee heard testimony from a former Franklin employee, implicating two Union Pacific executives in the recruitment of “young kids for Larry King’s friends.” Robert Andresen, the pedophile whose brutality was so heavy-handed that even the Douglas County jury mentioned (but did not indict) him, worked for Union Pacific. So did the foreman of the grand jury! The Douglas County panel was headed by citizen Michael Flanagan, an employee of Union Pacific Railroad for 27 years. Given that Union Pacific personnel were implicated in the matters under consideration, there would have been a conflict of interest for any UP employee sitting on the grand jury. In the case of Flanagan, there was more to it than that. In the summer of 1990, while the Douglas County grand jury was sitting, I received a call from a person who identified himself as an executive at Union Pacific headquarters in Omaha. He declined to give his name, saying, “I am too old to start over. I have too much vested in a good salary, position and pension. But I do not feel I can sit idly by.” He defended Union Pacific as a company that was good to its employees and, he thought, good for the country. But it had been taken over by a homosexual element, which tolerated, condoned and encouraged a code of sexual conduct he felt was abhorrent.

But it had been taken over by a homosexual element, which tolerated, condoned and encouraged a code of sexual conduct he felt was abhorrent. Even this would be no one’s business, he said, unless it was being imposed on people, using the power of UP in Omaha and Nebraska. At first, I thought the man might be trying to make an issue of some minor homosexual relationship, and I told him I was not interested in “bashing” homosexuals. I said that I didn’t care what adult men did with their sex lives, so long as they do not abuse and hurt children. I could have told him, but I didn’t, that my own brother had died of AIDS in California just the year before. My brother was a homosexual; he was also one of the best human beings on the planet. My caller’s carefully chosen words quickly dispelled the notion that he meant insignificant incidents, and led me to ask, “Are you talking about the head of Union Pacific, Mr. Walsh?” While the information he provided satisfied me that my concern about Walsh might well be valid, the caller made it clear that this was not the immediate point of his contacting me. “I believe if you will check out a former very young male Union Pacific employee named Pike*,” said my caller, “you will discover that Mr. Flanagan made improper sexual advances upon him, and he complained to Union Pacific officials. A financial settlement was reached by Union Pacific and the young male individual was paid a substantial sum of money by Union Pacific to keep quiet, go about his business, and find other employment.” The Grand Jury Foreman, Michael Flanagan, should not have been allowed to be Grand Jury Foreman because he himself, Michael Flanagan, had been recently involved in an incident in which he, Flanagan, was accused of pandering and in which he, Flanagan, and his Company, Union Pacific, had reached a civil settlement to suppress such incident and satisfy the demands of the individual making the complaint against him. Thus, the Grand Jury Foreman was being literally asked to indict other individuals whom Bonacci was identifying for the very things that he, Flanagan, had been accused of and reached civil settlement to avoid like indictment and prosecution. Further, Flanagan himself violated his Grand Jury duties by sharing Grand Jury information with other individuals, including lawyers and others he met with on a regular basis almost every day following Grand Jury proceedings at Union Pacific Headquarters in Omaha, and receiving advice and guidance", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:89:21f51854e644", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5795, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 90, "text": "Jury Foreman was being literally asked to indict other individuals whom Bonacci was identifying for the very things that he, Flanagan, had been accused of and reached civil settlement to avoid like indictment and prosecution.

One of King’s earliest boosters was the wife of a man with an unrivaled reputation for shrewd investments-Warren E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Based in Omaha, Buffett is the second biggest stockholder in the Washington Post and a controlling power in ABC-TV. In 1991, he acquired large blocks of stock in American Express and Wells Fargo Bank. When Salomon Brothers faltered in August 1991, the owner of 13% of its stock-Buffett-stepped in as interim chairman. With $4.4 billion to his name, Buffett is ranked by Fortune magazine as the 24th richest man in the world, and in the United States is among the top five. In Omaha, the Buffett mystique gains from the fact that there are two hundredsome “Buffett millionaires,” who made their fortunes by investing through Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett favors the multiplication of money, but not people. He contributes to groups advocating radical population reduction. His Warren Buffett Foundation lists hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to Negative Population Growth, the Association for Voluntary Sterilization, Planned Parenthood, the Population Council and Population Institute, the Sex Information and Education Council, and Federal American Immigration Reform. Negative Population Growth members, according to the group’s literature, “believe that a drastic reduction in total population size represents the only viable option consistent with human survival.” NPG wants the United States, and then every country, to enact programs to drop the U.S. and world population to one-halfits present levels within 90 to 100 years. Buffett contributes approximately 7% of NPG’s total budget. Language about Buffett, and his own, abounds with references to his “cult.” A 1991 Washington Post write-up of his annual shareholders’ meeting quoted guests along those lines: “It’s like worshipping at the altar of the high priest of finance….”; “He has a very large, cultish following.” Buffett himself has called his management staff “magicians.” Said Steve Forbes of Forbes magazine, talking to National Public Radio about Buffett, “He’s not Moses, but they read what he says as if it were written on tablets. . .. Buffett’s economic forecasts are more listened to, than Papal Encyclicals or the State of the Union message.” In 1974, when stocks were at a low, Buffett told Forbes he felt “like a sex maniac in a harem,” wanting to buy.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:90:da3a8f262955", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5796, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 91, "text": "following.” Buffett himself has called his management staff “magicians.” Said Steve Forbes of Forbes magazine, talking to National Public Radio about Buffett, “He’s not Moses, but they read what he says as if it were written on tablets. . ..

Backing from Buffett’s socialite wife, Susie, came early in the rise of Larry King. Susie Buffett was a volunteer at the credit union in its early days. According to the Lincoln Journal-Star of March 19, 1989, King “liked to tell the story of a woman coming to the credit union to see him and being told to return at 7:00 the next morning because he was so busy. The woman was Susie Buffett, wife of billionaire Warren Buffett, and she did come back to offer her help at the credit union.” For years, it has been part of Larry King lore in Omaha, that the Buffetts hosted a tenth wedding anniversary party for him and Alice. James Traub’s December 1991 Gentlemen’s Quarterly article served as a platform for Warren Buffett to deny he had a role in that affair, and to insinuate that perhaps the party never happened: “In 1978, King asked Susan Buffett if she would be willing to host his and Alice’s tenth-anniversary party at her house…. Susan said yes, but her husband said no.” Paula Albert, a close researcher of the Franklin scandal who has interviewed several people who attended the anniversary party, commented that the Buffettffraub account was carefully worded. Buffett avoided an outright assertion that the party didn’t take place, but “you’d be left with the thought that it never happened, if you didn’t know anything.” Buffett told Traub, “I knew that King was a phony…. It was like he had a big sign on his head that said, ‘PHONY, PHONY, PHONY.’” These protestations prompt the question, why, if Buffett saw so clearly that Larry King was a fraud, he did not alert his friends at FirsTier, or the World-Herald. Buffett is a director emeritus of one of the institutions that merged to become FirsTier, and he served on the World-Herald board. Larry King returned favors, by hosting a fundraiser for Buffett’s son Howard, when Howard ran for Douglas County commissioner. Warren Buffett may have done some more private socializing with Larry King, if a former Omaha city employee is correct in his report, that when Larry King was crowned “Queen” at The Max gay bar, Warren Buffett was his escort. “This is what his cousin Barbara Webb told me,” said the source. “She said the people, they were mad, because Larry brought his son and his wife there.” The Wall Street Journal feature reported", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:91:781a8ac6eb28", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5797, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 92, "text": "Howard ran for Douglas County commissioner.

Buffett shares his home with a companion named Astrid Menks, “alternating his time between the two women.” According to the Journal, Buffett met Menks in 1977, when Susie brought her home from the nightclub where Menks was a waitress-the French Cafe. Buffett and King shared an interest in Boys Town, which to many Americans evokes the 1938 movie starring Spencer Tracy as Father Flanagan, the priest with the heart of gold whose orphanage, Father Flanagan’s Home for Boys, straightened out many an errant youngster. Known today as Boys Town, it is an incorporated village on the west side of Omaha, with extensive land and plush facilities, and an endowment of $460 million. The orphanage is therefore a major power in the Omaha financial world. It has begun a $25 million nationwide expansion program, and will have youth care facilities in seventeen cities by 1992. The chairman of its finance committee is Union Pacific’s Michael Walsh. In 1972, Warren Buffett executed a maneuver around Boys Town, which is not fully understood to this day. His own Sun newspaper ran a series of articles, that targeted Boys Town for having too large an endowment. The Sun wrote, “members of the board of directors of Father Flanagan’s Boys’ Home generally seem little concerned that the institution has amassed a net worth of more than $200 million while going to the public twice a year with a plea of poverty.” Of the cited $200 million, $125 million was the “liquid endowment.” The articles prompted a major shake-up and purge of personnel at Boys Town. Buffett is believed to play some significant role with the orphanage today, perhaps in his specialty-investment advice. An inquiry with Boys Town was referred to the in-house attorney for the orphanage, who, in answer to the simple question, “What is Mr. Buffett’s precise role with Boys Town?” spent 25 minutes in two phone calls, not quite denying, but also carefully never confirming, that Buffett had a role with the facility. At any rate, Buffett has not complained lately about the size of Boys Town’s endowment, although it is much larger now than it was in 1973.

At any rate, Buffett has not complained lately about the size of Boys Town’s endowment, although it is much larger now than it was in 1973. Foster Care Review Board Executive Director Carol Stitt’s July 1988 plea to Attorney General Robert Spire, for an investigation of child abuse, included that youth care worker Kirstin Hallberg “told me about three youth at Boys Town who all reported inappropriate activities with Larry King of Omaha.” On March 29, 1989, her colleague Burrell Williams told investigator Jerry Lowe, “that on several occasions in the past he had heard of kids transported from Boys Town and the north Omaha Girls’ Club to functions allegedly linked to King.” Boys Town youth care worker Julie Walters, when she interviewed the Patterson Webb girls in 1986, reported her findings about Larry King and Boys Town youth, to the orphanage’s executive director, Father Val Peter. According to an FBI and Nebraska State Patrol interview with the girls’ foster mother, Kathleen Sorenson, “Walters related Nelly’s statements to Father Val Peter. … Val Peter then stated that Boys’ Town would conduct its own discreet investigation into Nelly’s statements.” Peter apparently did nothing, as Carol Stitt informed the legislature’s Executive Board on December 19, 1988: “It has been brought to my attention that no such investigation ever took place.” Sorenson stated that an unspecified time in the summer of 1988, Julie Walters spoke to two prominent black males and one black female at Boys’ Town confirming Nelly Webb’s statements about Larry King. Sorenson could not recall the names of these individuals. The individuals were either employees or associates of Boys’ Town. These individuals told Walters not to ask questions about King “because it could be dangerous.” Julie indicated that she subsequentlyhad a conversationwith Val Peter regarding the yellow Tojan including discussions that several Boys’ Town teachers, including those as having the last names Barksdale, Wilson, and Gary, had been seen driving the automobile.Julie indicatedthat when she brought the matter of the Tojan up to Father Peter, that he had initially denied any knowledge of the automobile, however, later on indicated that it was his belief that Omaha people couldn’t accept black male teachers at Boys’ Town and blamed the information regarding the Boys’ Town black male teachers driving the Tojan, on racism. Father Peter called me (Hallberg) and expressed an interest in Loretta’s case and said he felt that Boys’ Town could offer her “a safe place to heal.” When I commented that she probably wouldn’t feel too safe if she saw “the yellow Tojan,” he (Peter) said that he heard it had “been around” and then quickly changed the subject.

Julie indicated that she later learned that Val Peter had given an individual by the name of Dave Shanahan, who is the Director of Admissions at Boys’ Town, the responsibility of conducting, what Julie described, as a staff practice investigation of the Tojan automobile and the accompanying references to Boys’ Town personnel riding in it. Julie indicated that she was uncomfortable about Shanahan investigating this as she expressed the personal opinion that she does not trust Shanahan. Julie indicated that Shanahan was a white male in his early forties and a long time employee of Boys’ Town and indicated if she had to describe Shanahan she would describe him as being an individual with a good ole boy mentality who was not interested in the truth as much as making sure that nothing of a negative nature involving Boys’ Town came out of the investigation. Omaha author Steve Bowman, who is preparing a book on the Franklin Credit Union for release in 1992, discovered as he interviewed Boys Town grads, that King’s activities there were scarcely anomalous. “You would keep hearing the same thing, over and over again,” Bowman said of the graduates, many of whom were homosexually involved with Larry King. “They would invariably say, ‘I first discovered my homosexuality during counseling at Boys Town.’” An Omaha native said his new novel describing a youth’s painful upbringing in a boys’ home, including many homosexual encounters, is based on his eight years at Boys Town. Jimmy Cheshire, 44, of Yellow Springs, Ohio, said in an interview that “Home Boy” accurately depicts life as he saw it at Boys Town from 1955 to 1963 when he graduated as class valedictorian…. Cheshire said homosexuality was “rampant” at Boys Town while he was there. “Everybody I knew was involved in it. After graduation, no one talks about it,” he said. In my opinion, one third of the Boys Town counselors were pedophiles. The only reason they were there was because kids were there. A lot of kids were seduced“…. Cheshire said he did not find any adults at Boys Town who were”reliable.\" “There were some brutal people, some sick people,” he said. “The children turned to each other’ for support.” Working relations between the credit union and the orphanage were in order as of a December 13, 1979 letter from Franklin employee Joel Rogers, one of King’s homosexual lovers, to Boys Town Deputy Director for Development William E. Ramsey: “Mr. King, Mr. Larson, and myself are", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:94:6d3e216118f8", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5800, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 95, "text": "kids were seduced“….

Ramsey: “Mr. King, Mr. Larson, and myself are appreciative of your visit yesterday, and look forward to working with you and the Father Flanagan Boys’ Home.” The extent of the planned collaboration is not known, but at one point Franklin was paid $15, 000 to do a study on the relocation of people who lost their houses because of an expansion of Boys Town. Boys Town boys could get jobs at Franklin. King hired Brandt Thomas*, a 1984 graduate, to work at the credit union, according to a July 5, 1983 report from Doyle and Carol Gillespie, Boys Town family teachers. They also noted that “Brandt has moved in with his employer, Mr. King.” Thomas was still under care of the school, and his change of residence was sanctioned by the highest official at Boys Town, then-Executive Director Father Hupp. His March 26 1983 letter to Brandt’s mother, Lila Thomas*, was summarized by legislative Franklin committee researcher Jose J. Soto: “This letter from Father Hupp advises Brandt’s mother of steps to take before Brandt moves in with Larry King.” Hupp even attended the party King threw for Thomas, after the boy moved in. Ifhis liaison to Boys Town were insufficient for his purposes, Larry King had the Omaha Girls Club as a hunting ground. Victim-witnesses consistently said both institutions were tapped by King to find candidates for sexual abuse. In an April 14, 1989 report, Jerry Lowe summarized what he heard from Loretta Smith: Loretta furthermore told Carmean that many of the people who were taking the [pornographic] photographs were leaders of the north Omaha Girls’ Club and included prominent people who used code names. When I asked Loretta what the code names were she indicated simple names like Mary, Jane, etc. She had told Carmean that doctors and lawyers were involved and when I pressed her on this she indicated at one of the photographic sessions she saw some files and someone said something to her about one of the men working in chambers. Caradori’s investigation showed that King’s control of the Girls Club was a matter of public record, for anybody who bothered to look. Checking the incorporation papers at the Secretary of State’s office, Caradori discovered that the Girls Club was incorporated in December 1973, with Larry King as its president, \"to promote … the health, social, cultural, vocational and character development of girls…. One of the three incorporators was Franklin officer Mary Jane Harvey,", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:95:fb38dba42269", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5801, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 96, "text": "one of the men working in chambers.

The Omaha corporations that bankrolled Larry King and Franklin are also the major sponsors of youth organizations in Nebraska, such as Boys Club, Girls Club, Boy Scouts, Boys Town, Uta Halee Home for Girls, and others. These corporations donate millions of dollars per year to these organizations, as the annual reports of the recipients show. Many executives of these firms sit on the boards of the youth care facilities. Is it possible that some of these corporate leaders sit on the youth boards, for the same reason that Larry King founded the North Omaha Girls Club? Why, for instance, did the notorious pedophile Alan Baer join the board of the Boys Club? And after the extraordinary publicity over his pedophilia in 1989 and 1990, and his indictment for pandering, how is it conceivable that in 1991 Baer was still on the board of Boys Club?

Buffett I very pleased to formally advise you that the Board of Trustees of Union Pacific Foundation has approved a grant in the amount of $2, 500 to the Consumer Services Organization J Inc. for 1980, which represents the second installment of a grant of $12, 500 , payable in five equal installments in 1979-83, inclusive. to assist your organization in helping individuals with consumer related problems. In December 1990, Senator Schmit recalled an incident from almost exactly two years earlier, before the Franklin committee was officially established. “It was rather strange,” Schmit said, “the first day that I decided to introduce the resolution [for a legislative investigation], while the resolution was being drafted, I was cautioned by an unknown person by telephone, that I was advised not to pursue the investigation, because it would lead, I was told, to the highest levels of the Republican Party. And I responded, that the investigation would go where it went.” In the Republican Party, King had a meteoric rise. He sang the Star-Spangled Banner at a National Black Republican Council event in 1982, where President and Mrs. Reagan were guests of honor. By 1984, it was the GOP’s national convention that heard the national anthem from Larry King. There in Dallas, he hosted his extravagant party at Southfork Ranch, where I saw Maureen Reagan draped over King all evening like a big blanket. In 1988, at the Republican national convention in New Orleans, King sang again. He made a ten-minute “get-out-thevote” video on behalf of Bush, for the 1988 campaign. The Omaha Star, newspaper of the city’s black community, chronicled the rise in politics of Larry King. In his “Political Viewpoint” column of November 24, 1983, Ernest E. Bryant explained why King was unable to stand for re-election as chairman of the Nebraska Frederick Douglass Republican Council. Chairman King has accepted a position in the Reagan/Bush re-election campaign.

Chairman King has accepted a position in the Reagan/Bush re-election campaign. He was appointed by National Black Republican Council Chairperson LeGree Daniels, who was named Chairperson of the Black Voters for the Campaign, in the Reagan/Bush ’84 re-election bid. She has appointed King as coordinator of all the activities to bring out the Black vote. In brief this means that Mr. King will be responsible for meeting with the Party officials and the Black Republican leadership within each of the 17 targeted states. He will coordinate the efforts of these groups in support of the Reagan/Bush campaign…. Mr. King will also be traveling to the 17 targeted states when President Reagan does, to draw state party officials and Black Republican leadership together. King’s backers in the Omaha business community have plenty of ties to Washington, since Nebraska has been a favorite stomping ground for the national GOP. Although its population is just 1.6 million, the concentration of corporate wealth in the state makes it a priority for fundraising, with the attendant political and business back-and-forth. Peter Kiewit and Sons, for instance, contributed $100, 000 to elect Richard Nixon, and later got the contract to build the subway system for the nation’s capital. During the 1990 gubernatorial campaign, George Bush called Republican Kay Orr’s reelection bid the most important race in the country; Bush visited Nebraska three times. (Orr lost.) On the morning of February 7, 1990, Larry King was making plans to attend one of those fundraising events in Omaha, featuring President George Bush. Out of the blue, U.S. Magistrate Richard Kopf suddenly ordered King to be taken to a federal psychiatric facility in Springfield, Missouri, for “tests.” Senator Chambers reacted to King’s abrupt disappearance, as reported in the March 17, 1990 World-Herald: “State Senator Ernie Chambers said Friday that he believes that Franklin Community Federal Credit Union head Lawrence E. King was ‘whisked’ out of Omaha ‘in a hasty, almost clandestine way’ last month so he could not attend an event at which President Bush spoke. Chambers said that a trial of King could prove embarrassing to ‘powerful people at the national level.’” I was informed that LK was sent to Missouri for observation because the Secret Service had discovered that he had purchased a ticket to Governor Orr’s breakfast with President Bush. LK was approached at a local floral shop, and was rushed to court by the Secret Service, or at their demand. This was so sudden, that LK’s attorneys were unaware of what was going on.

At the Dallas convention in 1984, King threw his splashy party at Southfork Ranch, remembered by me and many other delegates as an unparalleled extravaganza. According to several victim-witnesses, he also arranged some private events during the convention. They recall being flown to Dallas, to be sexually used by convention-goers. Gary Caradori mapped the recollec­ tions of the Webb foster children, in his notes of February 28, 1990: During this visit [the children’s aunt] Marcy informed [social worker] Joanie that [the youngest Patterson Webb sister] Kendra had told her she had been transported around the country several times, she thought to Texas and Louisiana. Marcy remembered Texas in particular, and a Republican Convention because one of the children, possibly Kendra, had a book of matches from Texas and that is how the children had known where they were at. Joanie stated she remembered that the children had been exploited sexually in Texas, and she indicated that it was [the] feeling this activity had been occurring for several years. I was later to learn from Paul Bonacci, that he was also at the famed Southfork party. He described it for me in exact detail, some seven years after the party took place. He had been there for the purpose of providing sexual favors for people Larry King wanted to accommodate, satisfy, or compromise. Paul said he was one of a troop of teenaged boys and girls, whom King had shipped to Dallas for his purposes. I have talked to Paul repeatedly about this party. I have listened to his description. Only by having been there, could someone describe the setting the way Paul did to me. Because I was there myself for the party, I am certain that Paul Bonacci was there and did not invent his story or his description of the party. This was, it happens, just one of Paul’s leads into matters surrounding Larry King and Franklin that I could personally check out and know the boy was telling the truth. Not because somebody told me he was telling the truth. Not because somebody said he passed a lie detector test on the subject. But because I was there and saw a part of it, and saw the exact same things this boy did. King’s parties were designed to bring in everybody, from the innocent to the top-ranking businessmen and politicians.

King’s parties were designed to bring in everybody, from the innocent to the top-ranking businessmen and politicians. I personally attended the two largest parties he ever threw, as did many Republican officials. As a guest at the party, you would not know from the outer glitter, what sordid activity was going on behind the scenes. I am sure that was the character of many of Larry King’s parties, particularly the political events. Outwardly, they had the appearance oflegitimacy, with prominent people in attendance, from mayors to presidents, from businessmen to congressmen. “When Larry entertained, it was a hot ticket,” said a public relations man King hired, quoted by Rick Hornung and Michael Casey, in the February 28, 1989 Village Voice. “Virtually every high-ranking black member of the Reagan Administration had been out to lunch, over for drinks, or at a dinner party. The food and drink were first rate, as was the mix of peopleblack, white, Republican, Democrat, young, old.” For King, the emphasis was on the young. Spence’s activities made banner headlines in the Washington Times on June 29, 1989: “Homosexual prostitution inquiry ensnares VIPs with Reagan, Bush.” Spence’s access was so good, that he could arrange nighttime tours of the White House for his clients. The Times added on August 9, 1989, that Spence “hinted the tours were arranged by ‘top level’ persons, including Donald Gregg, national security advisor to Vice President Bush. . . .” Spence, according to friends, was also carrying out homosexual blackmail operations for the CIA. According to a Washington, D.C. investigative journalist who researched the Spence ring, “The way we discovered Larry King and this Nebraska-based call boy ring, was by looking through the credit card chits of Spence’s ring, where we found King’s name.” Another investigator, with personal knowledge of the call-boy rings operating in Washington, put it this way: Carol’s notes also have a reference to Larry King running guns and money into Nicaragua…. Carol’s notes on Dec. 21, 1988 reflect that she talked with Flanery and in addition to the Nicaraguan info he was also now talking about CIA involvement and provided info that yesterday (Dec. 20) the FBI quit cooperating with him…. Carol’s notes next jump to Feb. 6, 1989, where she talked on the phone with Flanery and Flanery told her that the appropriate people didn’t want to believe any of this and who was ever going to prosecute it.

Apparently Flanery told Carol he was close to resigning and the reasons he didn’t think anyone wanted to do anything was because of the possibility of a White House connection, the connections to a number of big people, and the fact that the investigators wanted badly to confine this all to the money. Also many white people made Larry King, he did not happen on his own. Apparently Flanery told Carol he was uncomfortable on the phone, his editor was distressed, and things he had written were continually edited, he wanted to get his by-line off the article printed the 9th among other things…. Flanery also expressed concern to Carol that if he didn’t get off this story he worried about being compromised. Squelching interest in an Iran-Contra connection to Franklin was also a topic of the hour, in that phone call I received from National Credit Union Administration official Fenner, back in the early months ofthe legislative Franklin probe. “Why would the head of the NCVA be wanting to talk to me?” I wondered out loud, when my secretary said that Fenner was on the line. “So tell me,” I said, “just what is at the bottom of it? If it is not laundered money involved in the Iran-Contra scandal, what the blazes is it? And how could Larry King get away with this, without you or somebody else knowing what was going on? Looks to me as if he had to have one heck of a lot of powerful political protection at the highest levels.” “Homosexuals,” Fenner said, “Franklin financed the biggest group of homosexuals any state has ever seen. A lot of awfully powerful and prominent personalities involved. But probably not anything you can do anything about. As far as politicians go, it does not seem to go to the very top, as some of the rumors suggested.” Former political associates of King, sources on Capitol Hill, and intelligence specialists suggest that Larry King was one of dozens of owners and directors of savings and loans and other financial institutions, used by the CIA to help finance covert operations. From their information, a picture takes shape. S&L managers, allegedly including King, would secretly lend CIA operatives bundles of depositors’ money, supposedly on a 30-day basis. In some instances, hundreds of thousands and even millions of these dollars would be flown out of the United States, to destinations such as Switzerland and the Bahamas. The money would be invested for profit in shortterm high-yield financial instruments or other overseas hotmoney schemes.

The money would be invested for profit in shortterm high-yield financial instruments or other overseas hotmoney schemes. Before federal auditors could notice any money missing, it would be returned. Some of the profit would be used to payoff the cooperating financial officer and other intermediaries. The rest was funneled into slush funds for covert operations. But the CIA would not always return the money. In 1990, a U.S. congressional committee was forced to investigate allegations that the CIA’s financial machinations had been a factor in the collapse of several S&Ls. In an explosive series of articles in the Houston Post, investigative reporter Pete Brewton wrote that during “an eight month investigation into the role of fraud in the nation’s savings and loan crisis, the Post has found evidence suggesting a possible link between the Central Intelligence Agency and organized crime in the failure of at least 22 thrifts, including 16 in Texas.” U.S. House of Representatives Banking Committee hearings on the Franklin Credit Union, held in 1989, did place Larry King in the right locations for covert operations. They established that during the 1980s, King traveled several times to Jamaica, where Lt. Col. Oliver North and other Iran-Contra principals transacted a lot of banking. They heard testimony that Franklin’s chief accountant, Tom Harvey, together with his mother Mary Jane Harvey, made several trips to Switzerland, in the time period millions of dollars disappeared from the credit union. Direct ties of Larry King to persons and institutions active in Iran-Contra are a matter of public record. In 1987, according to the World-Herald, King donated $25, 350 to Citizens for America, a group that sponsored speaking tours for Oliver North and Contra leaders. CFA was a key public relations group for Iran-Contra; King was a founding member and one of its largest contributors. A former security guard for King has sworn that he saw North attend at least one of King’s parties, a party at which children were also present. Since he was stationed outside, he has no knowledge of what might have happened inside. “I just thought it seemed kind of curious, the whole set-up,” he said. Another of the PR firm’s partners was Max Hugel, formerly deputy director in charge of covert operations, under the late William Casey at the CIA. Hugel earned the post for services rendered to the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign. Larry King met Hugel back then, since one of Hugel’s responsibilities for the campaign committee was out-reach and liaison work with minority groups.

Larry King met Hugel back then, since one of Hugel’s responsibilities for the campaign committee was out-reach and liaison work with minority groups. Brought to the agency by Casey in 1981, Hugel lasted only a few months at the CIA and was forced out under a cloud of scandal. King had a third friend at Carmen, Carmen and Hugel-Ambassador Gerald Carmen, the father of David. “What was Larry King doing with Ambassador Carmen?” reflected a Washington intelligence specialist, “It was the diplomatic pouches …. Larry had even been lobbying for his appointment as an overseas ambassador.” According to a Washington Times report of December 15, 1988, King did seek an ambassadorial apointment. One source specified that he wanted to represent the United States in Jamaica, where his wife, Alice, was born. During the height of Iran-Contra activities, 1984-86, Ambassador Carmen was in the right place to have served as bag man. He was U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland from 1984 through August 1986. The United States ambassador to Switzerland in that period was Faith Whittlesey, who was depositioned by the congressional committee investigating Iran-Contra. Oliver North’s multiple secret bank accounts were located at Credit Suisse. When Carmen left the diplomatic service in 1986, Carmen, Carmen and Hugel was and remained deeply involved in Nicaragua. According to the intelligence newsletter Unclassified (December 1990-January 1991), “the Carmen group under a National Endowment for Democracy contract, handled the U.S. activities of the Violeta Chamorro campaign in the Nicaraguan elections.” The sometimes expansive Larry King used to talk fondly about his friends. In a Sept. 7, 1988, interview with the Metropolitan King said, “I know some of the people I admire aren’t very popular. Ed Meese. The late Bill Casey of the CIA. And I love former Chief Justice Burger. Those are the people I really like to talk to. Bill Casey…. I just thought so very highly of him.” Larry King adored Bill Casey, but what about one of Casey’s predecessors at Central Intelligence-George Bush? Ever since July 23, 1989, when the lead editorial in the World-Herald said that “one child … is said to believe that she saw George Bush at one of King’s parties,” King’s connection with Bush has been a frequently asked question about the Franklin case. Anxiety on this account has run especially high in Omaha’s black community, where in December 1990, one young lady stood up at a public meeting and proclaimed, “I think George Bush is involved in this child abuse case, and that is why all these people have", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:103:37b765702303", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5809, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 104, "text": "World-Herald said that “one child … is said to believe that she saw George Bush at one of King’s parties,” King’s connection with Bush has been a frequently asked question about the Franklin case. Anxiety on this account has run especially high in Omaha’s black community, where in December 1990, one young lady stood up at a public meeting and proclaimed, “I think George Bush is involved in this child abuse case, and that is why all these people have been dying.” Inside investigators of Franklin, and the Webb case before it, know that Bush’s name came up at the very beginning, and it came up more than once. The July 1989 World-Herald column, in an attempt to discredit this and other victim-witness testimony, attributed the mention of Bush to a person “under psychiatric care,” meaning Loretta Smith. In reality, the report was from Nelly Patterson Webb. Nelly also told Walters that one frequent party-goer with King was a boy named “Brent,” the one who was “flown to another city somewhere” after a falling out with King. Walters did not have the resources to cross-check this information with the life of Brandt Thomas, the Boys Town resident who had moved in with Larry King. Franklin credit union files contained a letter signed by King, in his capacity as Youth Affairs Committee advisor for the National Black Republican Council, listing Thomas as one of two national contact people for NBRC campus chapters. Three years later, with an investigation of abuse by King and the Webbs finally under way, Nelly was interviewed again. Speaking to Franklin committee detective Jerry Lowe, she repeated her account of the Chicago party, and said that Bush and the two men he arrived with appeared to have left the affair with a young black man she called “Brandt.” Of course, as I have made clear, mere attendance by a politician, be he the president or any other office-holder, at a Larry King party does not mean that person knew of or was involved in Larry King’s sordid activities. Almost every top Nebraska Republican, including myself, attended the two largest parties King ever hosted, the ones at the Republican national conventions in 1984 and 1988. There is a psychologist in Omaha who used to work for the CIA. In response to a direct question by an Omaha psychiatrist regarding George Bush’s private life, this psychologist reported hearing rumors when Bush was head of the CIA, that correspond directly with one of the inferences made by Nelly Webb, and commented to the psychiatrist, how do you investigate your boss?\" I was informed that Roskins [sic] was terminated by the state because of sexual activities reported to the Regents and verified by them. Mr. Roskins was reported to have had young men at his residence for sexual encounters.

Mr. Roskins was reported to have had young men at his residence for sexual encounters.

When Harold Andersen’s reputation sagged in the fall of 1989, due to his unconcealed association with Larry King, his friends at the Nebraska Society ofD.C. staged an awards dinner in Washington to polish his image. George Bush sent a testimonialletter in praise of the adviser to the U.S. State Department and occasional horseshoes-player at the White House. Bush wrote about Andersen and his wife: “These two outstanding individuals have spent countless hours serving the city of Omaha and the state of Nebraska. Throughout Harold Andersen’s career with the Omaha World-Herald, he has made that fine paper an example of journalistic integrity. In addition, he has been a vigorous promoter of efforts to improve the quality of life in his community.” Gray is the chairman and CEO of Hill and Knowlton, one of the two biggest public relations firms in the world, with such blue-chip clients as AT&T, IBM, Xerox, and DuPont. CBS-TV’s 60 Minutes has called Hill and Knowlton “by far, the biggest, most influential PR firm in Washington,” adding that “critics accuse them of being an unelected shadow government.” Gray played a role in Ronald Reagan’s 1976 presidential campaign and, in 1980, he was deputy director of communications, reporting directly to Bill Casey. On the strength of his connections in the new administration, he left Hill and Knowlton to set up his own PR firm. Within a year, Gray and Company secured over $9 million in billings from a clientele including Warner Communications, NBC, GTE, Mutual of Omaha, the American Trucking Association, the American Iron and Steel Institute, and the governments of Canada and Turkey. In 1986, Hill and Knowlton bought out Gray and Co.; Gray became chairman and CEO of Hill and Knowlton. Gray’s own sexual proclivities were the subject of an article in the July-August 1982 issue of The Deep Backgrounder, entitled “Reagan Inaugural Co-Chairman Powerful ‘Closet Homosexual’?” The Deep Backgrounder tabloid featured exposes of homosexual networks in Washington, D.C.; its contributing editor was former senior CIA official Victor Marchetti.

When Wilson and fellow agent Frank Terpil got caught running guns abroad, Gray tried to deny his connection with Wilson. “Yet ten years before,” according to Peter Maas’ book Manhunt, “in a top secret Navy review of Wilson’s intelligence career, Gray described Wilson as a person of ‘unqualified trust,’ with whom he’d been in contact ‘professionally two or three times a month’ since 1963.” According to fugitive ex-CIA officer Frank Terpil, CIAdirected sexual blackmailing operations were intensive in Washington at about the time of the Watergate scandal. One of those operations, Terpil claims, was run by his former partner, Ed Wilson. Wilson’s base of operations for arranging trysts for the politically powerful was, Terpil says, Korean agent Tong Sun Park’s George Town Club. In a letter to the author, Terpil explained that “Historically, one of Wilson’s Agency jobs was to subvert members of both houses [of Congress] by any means necessary…. Certain people could be easily coerced by living out their sexual fantasy in the flesh…. A remembrance of these occasions [was] permanently recorded via selected cameras…. The technicians in charge of filming … [were] TSD [Technical Services Division of the CIA]. The unwitting porno stars advanced in their political careers, some of [whom] may still be in office.” Gray’s associate Wilson was apparently continuing the work of a reported collaborator of Gray from the 1950s-McCarthy committee counsel Roy Cohn, now dead of AIDs. According to the former head of the vice squad for one of America’s biggest cities, “Cohn’s job was to run the little boys. Say you had an admiral, a general, a congressman, who did not want to go along with the program. Cohn’s job was to set them up, then they would go along. Cohn told me that himself.” Gray maintained his intelligence connections during the Reagan Administration, according to an affidavit filed with the Southern District of Florida Court on December 12, 1986, by Attorney Daniel Sheehan for the Christie Institute. The affidavit states that when CIA chief Casey, national security adviser Robert McFarlane, and NSC staff member Lt. Col. Oliver North were devising a method to circumvent a congressional ban on arming the Contras, they turned to Gray and Company. Lauded by the Reagan and Bush Administrations as a showcase for the privatization of social services, Covenant House had expanded into Guatemala as a gateway to South America.

Lauded by the Reagan and Bush Administrations as a showcase for the privatization of social services, Covenant House had expanded into Guatemala as a gateway to South America. According to intelligence community sources, the purpose was procurement of children from South America for exploitation in a pedophile ring. The flagship Guatemalan mission of Covenant House was launched by a former business partner of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, Roberto Alejos Arzu, who had ties to the CIA, according to the Village Voice of Feb. 20, 1990. The Voice quoted Jean-Marie Simon, author of Guatemala: Eternal Spring, Eternal Tyranny: “It’s like having Idi Amin on the board of Amnesty International.” A top source of money for Covenant House has been Robert Macauley, founder of Americares, a service organization implicated in channeling funds to the Contras. A close friend of the Bush family since Connecticut, Andover and Yale days, Macauley has George Bush’s brother Prescott on the Americares’ board. Father Ritter was a vice president of Americares, at least until he had to resign from Covenant House in February 1989, and spent weekends at Macauley’s estate in Connecticut, according to a former Covenant House employee. All the way back in 1984, a Franklin teller named Edward Hobbs tried to blow the whistle about the embezzlement of funds from the credit union. He addressed a memorandum to his employers, and traveled to Lincoln, the state capital, to brief state banking officials on its contents. National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) examiners saw Hobbs’ memorandum later that year. The memo covered evidence of embezzlement, and information Hobbs had, that promotions at Franklin were based on doing homosexual favors for its manager, Larry King. 1 got the whiff of a Washington connection, when 1 first inquired about Franklin. As I explained it at a public meeting in December 1990, “I first noted something a little funny with the credit union when a good friend of mine and sometimes adversary on occasion, named Ernie Chambers, complained that the major financial institutions weren’t making loans into the black community, that they were red-lining, in other words making sure the financing couldn’t go into the black areas. As I began to investigate, I tried to find out information on … [Franklin]-what was it doing to get loans there? … I found out that all the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t get information because, I was told, that was none of my business and if I didn’t like it, to talk to the Feds and if you talk to the Feds you could find out nothing.” The tough thing with this, Mr. Berry, is that we have the FBI who conducts", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:107:f00855ac039b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5813, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 108, "text": "tried to find out information on … [Franklin]-what was it doing to get loans there? … I found out that all the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t get information because, I was told, that was none of my business and if I didn’t like it, to talk to the Feds and if you talk to the Feds you could find out nothing.” The tough thing with this, Mr. Berry, is that we have the FBI who conducts an investigation and basically says the same things that we have said. If the FBI, are they now linked to this cover-up in some way? Should the Justice Department be investigated as somehow or another assisting in this “cover-up?” Wadman said it, but in this case it’s true. The Justice Department, acting through the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Omaha, emerges from the record of the Franklin investigations not so much as a party to the cover-up, but as its coordinator. Rigging grand juries, harrassment of witnesses, incitement to perjury and tampering with evidence-federal personnel were seen to apply all of those techniques in the Franklin case. Lt. [Bill] Goodrich spoke of the Larry King investigation and stated that he (Goodrich) had been in contact with a federal agency that was also investigating King. To the best of Officer Berney’s recollection, Lt. Goodrich said that the federal agency was concerned that our child pornography/ abuse investigation might hamper their investigation. Officer Berney told me that although he wasn’t sure, it was either directly stated or he (Berney) got the impression that we were to either \"slow down or back off’ in our investigation so as not to impede the federal case. In 1988 and 1989, according to testimony to the Legislature’s Franklin committee, the FBI claimed to be interested in Franklin money issues, but not child abuse. Dennis Carlson ofthe Foster Care Review Board testified to the Franklin committee, citing state Assistant Attorney General William Howland, that U.S. Attorney Tom Thalken had said “that the federal authorities were investigating Mr. King…. But he said basically their investigation was confined to the money issues, and they were not specifically investigating allegations of child abuse.” Moreover, as advertised in a May 12, 1990 article in the World-Herald, the FBI had been looking at Franklin since 1987, for over a year before it was closed! The FBI men could hardly have been unaware of the Franklin ambiance, not to mention the bedroom in the new addition, and the evidence shows that they were not. It was reported in the Lincoln Journal in December 1988, as summarized by Jerry Lowe for the Franklin committee, that “an ex-employee who is not identified said that when FCU shut down, FBI agents immediately began asking questions regarding child pornography, drugs and the lifestyle of Larry King.” a large amount of pornographic material was taken out", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:108:9d6ad815ae96", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5814, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 109, "text": "been unaware of the Franklin ambiance, not to mention the bedroom in the new addition, and the evidence shows that they were not.

I was told that if Friedrichs* or any of the other people working for the CPA firm that was contracted by the government would say anything, that they would automatically lose their jobs. The Douglas County grand jury proclaimed on July 23, 1990, that the allegations and evidence of Franklin-linked child abuse were a “carefully crafted hoax.” Its report implied that the perpetrators were Alisha Owen, journalist Michael Casey, and the late Gary Caradori. According to testimony of Alisha Owen and her parents before the Franklin committee, the FBI had this line already in March of 1990, before the grand jury even started sitting. giving a proposal from the FBI that if! recanted my story then nothing would happen to me, I could possibly get out of prison and no charges would ever be brought against me. Such as, if I recanted my story, they wouldn’t charge me with perjury, they wouldn’t charge me with lying, they would just drop the whole thing, they would write letters to the judge asking for my sentence reduction so I could get out of prison. And ifand in this deal I would have to say that Gary Caradori and Mike Casey came to me, they set this whole thing up, they told me what to say, we got scripts, we were promised monetary values. And I would be taken care of. DONNA OWEN: This would have been on Tuesday, I believe. If Tuesday is April 25, then it would have been Tuesday, April 25, 1990. It would have all-that was brought up then, but it was also brought up earlier, in March. Because at that time, I called Senator Labedz and I said, do you realize that this is what is happening and I want to tell you this because I think when all is said and done it’s not going to just be this man Mike Casey, they are going to say that Gary Caradori was in on it and that members of the legislative committee were in on it. And she was very concerned and she immediately went to get Senator Schmit and I talked with him about it also. And that would have been in March.

In the early evening of Wednesday, July 11, 1990, several telephone calls were received at our home by an individual identifying himself as “Troy.” Different individuals answered the telephone and took the message from him. I was either talking to other visitors at our home or in no shape to come to the telephone. In any event, if necessary I can supply names of the parties who can attest to the fact that a “Troy” called for me during that evening. I got back on the telephone and told him I would try to contact Senator Schmit or Karen [Ormiston). He said he’d be at [phone number) but only for a short time. He said he was going to be “on the move” or something to that effect. He further stated, “I’Il go to anyone who’ll listen. I’ll go without my lawyer. I’m gonna come clean.” The next day I did not hear anything on the television or the radio and I really felt that Troy had probably backed away. That evening he called me again. He said, “Sandie, I tried, I tried. I went to Mickey Mott and. . (FBI agents). They laughed at me. They said they spent too much time and money on this case now for me to change my story. I also went to Frank Brown [Channel 7 TV] but he said he didn’t want to take a statement because of my Grand Jury testimony.” I was extremely upset because the timing certainly left much to be desired. I opened the closed door and noted two FBI agents, Karen Ormiston, and our security director, Joe Hebenstreit. They were all seated in the office. I said, “I don’t think I need to introduce myself. What are you doing here? I can’t believe this.” The smaller individual stammered a bit and looked at Karen and said, “Who … who is this?” “She’s Gary’s widow.” He then halfway stood up and extended his hand as if to shake mine and expressed his/their sympathy. The whole ordeal was extremely unprofessional. He then looked over his shoulder at the other agent, gave him a smirk, and shook his head. He identified himself as Mickey Mott. … I then asked them directly whether Troy Boner had tried to speak with them on the previous day. Mr. Mott said, “I can’t confirm or deny that.” I indicated that I did deserve an answer. Mr. Mott then said, “Yeah, he came to the office but we can’t waste our time with him.

He has lost all credibility.” State Senators Loran Schmit of Bellwood and Bernice Labedz of Omaha said Troy Boner told blatant lies when he said he did not come to Schmit’s office last week and when he said he didn’t recant what he told a Douglas County grand jury …. Schmit said at least eight people were in his office last week when Boner, in essence, recanted his recantation and said that what he had originally told Caradori was the truth. Six of the eight appeared at a press conference Thursday, including four-Schmit, Sen. Labedz, Caradori associate R.I. Nebe and Jody Gittins, an attorney who works in Schmit’s office-who said they heard Boner’s comments directly…. The six at the press conference Thursday said Boner was in Schmit’s office both July 16 and July 17, the day of Caradori’s funeral. Under pressure, Boner reasserted that what he told Gary Caradori was not true. His new lawyer, Marc Delman, insisted that his client had lied to Caradori. A specialist in child abuse cases when he worked in the Douglas County Attorney’s Office, Delman was now better known for defending pornographers. Since Boner was penniless, many people in Omaha wondered if Alan Baer or another patron had given him the money to hire Delman. There is no credible evidence for us to believe that funds or individuals connected with the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union were involved in the sexual exploitation of minors, the interstate transportation of minors, the interstate transportation of minors for sexual purposes or the trafficking in controlled substances. The FBI, as Boner said, had threatened Boner into recanting his videotaped statement, which enabled the Douglas jury to return its “carefully crafted hoax” verdict, and set the pattern for the federal grand jury. Federal officials in charge of the latter, in particular Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Thalken, attempted to terrorize Alisha Owen into recanting as well.

Over and over and over and over again. I have not heard the word perjury so many times in my entire life than that day….

Rosenthal was Alisha’ s second lawyer. He succeeded Pamela Vuchetich, who had conveyed to Alisha the FBI’s offer of a deal, from Vuchetich’s friend Mickey Mott. In her Franklin committee testimony of June 11, 1990, Owen reported another incident involving Vuchetich and the FBI, which appeared to be an attempt to craft some evidence of the “carefully crafted hoax”: They had Troy call me in the beginning of March. He called me in the afternoon and I got on the phone. . .. Pam had told me that Troy had recanted his statement about Danny. She never told me he recanted his statement about me. And you know, maybe I was naive, maybe I was just dumb, but I never once thought he could do that because, I mean, I had all this evidence, you know, and I mean, I’m the one that-you know, that told them about Troy and others. It never dawned on me that he would ever do that, recant about Danny. And I know Troy sleeps until 4:00 or 5:00 at night, so I started to think oh, my God, he’s in Omaha for a week, it’s 3:00,2:30 in the afternoon, somebody must be at his house making him do this. And I thought this must be a taped phone conversation. I was-I was literally scared. I thought either they sat down a lot of money in front of him or else somebody has got a gun to his head making him say this. So I asked him, why are you doing this? And he-and he said, Alisha, I’m scared, I don’t know what to do, tell me what to do. And then he asked me, quote, unquote, do you think we’re going to get any money? And I-I stopped for a second and I said, I don’t give a damn about any money, you know, just tell the truth. That’s what I said, quote, unquote. Excuse my French. But I just-just tell the truth. He said, what should I do? And I said, just tell the truth. And he kept trying to make these leading statements, Alisha, what should I do?

And after I got off the phone, I tried to get ahold of Pam. Well, Pam is sitting down in the FBI’s office with them making that call. Tried to get hold of Pam, Pam is not around. So I was upset enough and I was worried enough that possibly somebody was sitting there with a gun that I called Gary. And I thought, okay, if anybody is going to be able to do anything or know anything, Gary will know or he’ll be able to find out. I called Gary. And Gary said, Alisha, Troy is sitting down at the FBI’s office right now. So okay, I knew that the FBI was the one that prompted him to that call…. So Gary told me that it was the FBI. And Gary said to me at that time, Alisha, maybe you should start wondering why your attorney is spending so much time with the FBI. Against Alisha Owen’s specific instructions, she reported, Vuchetich turned over to the FBI a file that Alisha maintained on acquaintances from her past. Vuchetich had suggested she assemble this information. In it were the names of some people, like former boyfriends, who could be expected to be bitter toward her. At approximately 1415, this writer received a telephone call from Alisha Owen. She talked about the FBI hinting to her that if she changed her story that they would insure that they would “g after” this writer and Mike Casey for “fabricating” an investigation. She informed me that she had not fabricated any part of any story and that she was sticking to the story she told me, and that she wished me well. For my own protection, I tape recorded the telephone conversation which lasted approximately 30 minutes. One of the most important things that I thought he told me was the fact that when they first went into the investigation of Larry King, he was talked to by the FBI and he told them mostly everything that he told me about the sexual abuse and so forth. And then he said he was told by the FBI, we’re going to advise you it’s best for you that you keep your mouth shut. And I said, say that again, and he repeated it so I could write it down.

Briefly, Sue told this writer that the FBI and a member of the State Patrol were harrassing her brother and trying to get him to talk about things that he just didn’t know about. She stated that her brother is extremely scared. He wants to tell the truth, however, he felt extremely uncomfortable with the FBI and State Patrol investigators. She stated that a Phillips and FBI Agent Coulter were very harsh with her brother. Approximately 2.5 years ago she was inspecting the home of Jarrett and Barbara Webb for a renewal of their license. She felt the environment was not right and wrote a letter to DSS in Lincoln. She received no response. After a couple of months, she wrote a letter to the Omaha Police Department regarding this same situation with the Webbs. She was then contacted by the FBI. In the meantime she had tried to do some research on her own, but evidently files were missing. CARADORI: I do, but I can’t-you know, I have nothing to base it on.

The legislative investigator found that the FBI interfered with material even before he got to it. One afternoon in late 1989, Caradori and Karen Ormiston spent several hours at YNR Airlines in Sioux City, Iowa, photocopying flight manifests of Larry King’s charter flights. At other airlines, staffers had already confirmed to Caradori, that King took underage boys and girls with him on charter flights. At YNR, children’s names were listed for the flights-proof that King was transporting children around the country as the Webb girls, Alisha Owen, Paul Bonacci, and others had charged. The owner of YNR made a phone call, and prevented Caradori from leaving with the records, some of which had yellow FBI tabs attached to them. Since the Franklin committee had only limited, in-state subpoena power, Caradori requested the NCVA to subpoena the records, tum them over to him, and not mention this to the FBI. NCVA general counsel Robert Fenner agreed. Caradori never got the records, but someone else apparently did. Caradori told a friend, that he saw some of the FBI stickers from YNR, in a notebook carried by FBI agent Mickey Mott. The FBI maintained that there was no proof whatsoever that King had transported children; the Douglas County grand jury lamented, that it was a pity charter companies did not keep flight manifests, so no trips could be verified. There must be some kind of provision which allows the State of Nebraska to retain its information so that there is not a probable cover-up when this stuff is turned over to the federal level. It is my sincere hope that the federal agencies cannot just walk all over the state agencies, especially since we have given them everything we have yet we have been allowed to see nothing that they have. This in itself has not only prolonged the investigation, but it has also been a major factor in that the FBI does seem to get to our leads since they do have a lot of manpower. I do feel that the leads turned over to the FBI have effectively been stonewalled as it pertains to this investigation. The FBI’s eagerness to discredit the victim-witnesses may be based on more than just an institutional commitment to protect former Omaha FBI chief Nick O’Hara’s friend Chief Wadman, or Assistant U.S. Attorney Thalken, or higher-ups in Washington.

A look at life inside the Bureau, including its Omaha branch, shows why. In August 1990, black FBI agent Donald Rochon settled his suit against the FBI for racial discrimination. A highly decorated veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, Rochon joined the FBI in the early 1980s. According to the settlement, Rochon, who worked in the Omaha FBI office in 1983 and 1984, will receive more than $1 million over his lifetime, and have his $500, 000 in legal expenses paid. In his suit, Rochon charged Omaha FBI personnel with sexual perversion. Some of the details are recorded in a “Motion of the [U.S.] Attorney General for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffs [Rochon] ‘Chicago Claims,’” filed on September 13, 1989 in Washington, D.C. After his Omaha assignment, Rochon had moved to Chicago, where the harassment continued. In response to his telephonic complaint, a signed sworn statement was taken from Rochon on July 3, 1984. In his statement, Rochon described a series of acts or events which he alleged were evidence of sexual deviance by SA [Special Agent] Dillon and other SAs assigned to the Omaha office. Specifically, Rochon alleged that he had “personally observed” Dillon “French kissing” SA Agent Terry 1. Bohle, a male, at a going-away party for SA Bohle, and that he likewise had “personally witnessed” Dillon “exposing himself in the Omaha office during a regular work day to numerous Omaha employees, both male and female.” In addition, Rochon said that he had heard reports that Dillon had allowed Bohle to urinate into his mouth and to “urinate into a beer bottle, [from] which he subsequently drank;” and that Dillon had been observed “picking out the deodorant block in [the] men’s urinal and placing this block in his mouth.” Rochon further alleged that Dillon appeared preoccupied with homosexual sex, kept homosexual pornography at his desk, and had frequently spoken in the office of homosexual acts. Another agent backed up Rochon’s account of Dillon’s allowing Bohle to urinate into his mouth. In an official response, Dillon protested that SA Bohle only “accidentally” did urinate on him on one occasion. He added that he, Dillon, had not exposed his penis in the office, as Rochon charged, but merely his buttocks. The Bureau defended Dillon’s possession of pornographic homosexual literature, as necessary for his investigation of homosexual prostitution. But Rochon’s claims of discrimination and harassment were so well substantiated, that the FBI chose to settle.

But Rochon’s claims of discrimination and harassment were so well substantiated, that the FBI chose to settle. In October 1983, the FBI announced it had investigated a male prostitution ring in Omaha. Apparently one of the agents on the case was none other than SA Dillon. U.S. Attorney Ron Lahners commented privately at the time, “This thing is so big and involves so many prominent people around this state.” The investigation was expected to bring high-level indictments, but never did. One Nebraska insider said recently, “There is no doubt that the pedophile networks investigated in 1983 overlapped those of Larry King; in fact King himself was probably looked at at that time.” Boys Town,\" according to a law enforcement source who knew Dillon then. Years later, Caradori received allegations that some priests associated with Boys Town, in particular Father Pat Henry and Father Fiala, were pedophiles; Father Henry was sent to Bolivia when child abuse scandals surfaced at Boys Town in the mid-1980s. Donald Rochon was a successful agent, part of whose responsibility while in Omaha was to find missing children. He once was commended for finding a kidnapped girl within one day of beginning work on the case. Inevitably, as a black agent, he would have developed ties in the black community in north Omaha, where Larry King’s pedophilia was notorious. Many of the boys King used as prostitutes were black, and were recruited from Boys Town, where the alleged pervert SA Dillon seemed to have friends. Would it have been just a matter of time until Rochon found himself investigating SA Dillon, and others in Dillon’s clique? One thing was established for certain by Rochon’s court documents: Dillon was the ringleader of the harassment operation which drove Rochon from Omaha, and most of the rest of the Omaha FBI office covered up for Dillon. At the time of his death, Gary Caradori was known. to be pursuing two tracks-the Washington, D.C. connection, and satanism. A satanic magazine was seen by a farmer at the site of Caradori’s plane crash in rural Illinois; the magazine disappeared without a trace, and without further mention by the news media or the National Transportation Safety Board. The testimony of two victim-witnesses who did not know each other, Loretta Smith and Paul Bonacci, placed King in the middle of such activity. Smith’s testimony was apparently so sensitive, that the Douglas County Attorney’s office made an unprecedented appeal to the presiding judge of the Douglas County Circuit Court, Judge James M.

(When I became Paul Bonacci’s attorney, this judge failed in an attempt to prevent me from representing or assisting Paul, which would have left him to be represented by a public defender. Eventually, Judge Murphy had to disqualify himself from the case, as a result of his attempt to injure me.) In 1988 an Omaha girl, who was an inpatient at Richard Young Hospital, described a number of gruesome cult activities which she claimed to have witnessed between the approximate ages of 9 and 12…. According to the girl, she became involved in a cult where older male members sexually molested her and killed infants and children to establish their dominance over other cult members. A Nebraska woman now in her forties, who calls herself “a little wild” in her youth, tells how she was approached at age 15 and asked if she were a virgin. A virgin was needed, it was explained, for certain occult ceremonies. When it appeared she might go (she didn’t), she was told, “Don’t be surprised at the wealthy and powerful people you will be seeing at the ceremony.” There is angry-and serious-talk among Nebraska ranchers about helicopter-equipped devil cultists and fertility ritualism …. Since spring, 21 cases of cow or horse mutilations have been authenticated in a five-county area and some observers think the number should really be about 50. But it is difficult to determine the cause of death of a yearling after five or six days in open country. According to testimony from Paul Bonacci, Larry King had been recruited to a satanic cult by December 1980 at the latest. In his written history, Bonacci described how King picked him up after school one day in December, “and took me to the Triangle which is in a wooded area in Sarpy County. I witnessed a sacrifice of a human baby boy. Everyone was chanting and it was a yearly ritual around the time of Christ’s birth to pervert the blood of Christ. They used daggers and cut the boy and filled a cup with his blood and mixed urine in it and forced all of us to drink from the cup and chant ‘Satan is Lord Lucifer our King. Realm of darkness come now empower us your slaves.’ Then they all began to chant some weird sounds and I got scared and was threatened I’d become the next sacrifice if I told anyone about it.” Bonacci said", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:119:31b352f9792b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5825, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 120, "text": "pervert the blood of Christ.

Mrs. Sorenson decided to speak out about what she had learned from children in her care. Together with her eldest foster daugher, a survivor of ritualistic abuse, she spoke at public forums around the state, gave radio and television interviews, and appeared on Geraldo Rivera’s nationally televised special on satanism. This is the report Kathleen Sorenson gave on a Christian TV interview program aired in Nebraska in 1989, based on her experience with over 30 children who spent months or years in her home. We got involved and learned about this subject because we were foster parents and worked with a number of children. And several years back, several of the children began, after a period of time and building up trust, began to talk about some very bizarre events that had happened in their past and they were frightening and very confusing. I really didn’t know what to think. We went to the police, and we went to social services and there was really nothing anyone could do. These children we worked with are now adopted, in safe homes, and probably would never have talked had they not felt able to trust the people they were living with. There are certain things that are in common in the childrens’ stories when we talk about devil worship…. There are things that come up in every single story, such as candles. They all talk about sex. Sex is without a doubt a part of every area of this, all sorts of perverted sex. That is what you will first hear, about the sex, about the incest, and it is so hard to believe. But once we get that, we have learned that we can go on and ask and find out … and it will involve pornography; that is always part of it. Part of the reason is that they can use that to threaten the children. “We have pictures, we will show the police if you talk.” It makes the children feel that they are in great danger, and they are all very frightened of the law. They talk about the garish", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:120:595b9a95797e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5826, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 121, "text": "But once we get that, we have learned that we can go on and ask and find out … and it will involve pornography; that is always part of it.

They talk about the garish makeup that the people in the group wear, they talk about singing that they didn’t understand. Obviously that is chanting, and that has come up in every one of these stories, and none of them call it chanting. There will be dancing. Most often that will involve sexual acts. There will always be a leader and they will be very frightened of the leader. These children, from a very young age, and I am talking about children who came out of birth homes, the family they were born to, worshipped the devil. That’s all I can share, and I don’t pretend to be an expert. All I can tell you is what the children have told me. My husband and I say, we know things we shouldn’t know. That’s true, and I thought very carefully before I agreed to do the program, because we have heard so much, and it is so ugly, and so frightening, that you hesitate to tell it to people. It’s very heavy to know. I don’t want people running around looking in their closets and not leading normal lives. You don’t want to think you are giving people ideas. I don’t want people to say, if a child starts to talk about some of this, “They probably saw it on that show Kathleen did.” But we’re hearing more and more. And it is becoming very, very out in the open, and I think it’s time for people to know that this is not fun and games; this is not something that we can laugh at-or ignore. The children I have talked to have all had to murder before the age of two. That is something beyond anything I could comprehend. But in some way, whether with the help of an adult’s hand over theirs, by having them practise, by getting them excited to be part of the adult scene, they do murder. And the evil thing that happens is, that they really believe that they want to. They want to do what the older people are doing, and they are praised for that. And that becomes their goal, to be like the adults. There is a little part in them, that natural good, God-given part, which knows that it is wrong. But in a group, and in the excitement of everything, they want to do that. They enjoy the sex.

Children are capable of enjoying the sex. I didn’t know that. Well, why would they fight against it? A child will eat a bag of candy if you give it to them. They will take part in these things willingly. When they get out and begin to talk, it is very difficult for them to realize, we didn’t realize it at first, that they actually wanted to do it. They are told they will never get out, no one will ever believe them, that there is no freedom, that “the law will get you,” they are hopeless before they get someone willing to listen. They are threatened with death. Every time a child is killed in their group, they are told, “If you tell, this will happen to you.” They have every reason to believe that. So even when they are into the [foster care] system, and with another family and begin to feel somewhat safe, they still expect these people to show up on the doorstep. They believe that these people know everything they are doing, everyone they’re talking to. One teenager told me that she had been told, that if she ever got married, that they would fool her, it would be one of them and she wouldn’t know it ahead of time. They set them up to fail in every area. As you listen to us talk about these things, there will be a natural part of you which will deny much of what you hear, and believe me, we did too. I would like to share this with you, partly in the children’s words, so that you can hear the things that they said that nobody could make up, that no child could know. That’s what eventually convinced me, along with the deep emotion. The grieving, screeching damage and hurt that they cry out with as they talk. The children I will be talking about, these are all children that I personally talked to. They are today between the ages of 5 and 17. When they talked they were between the ages of 5 and 15. When these things occured to them, they were between the ages of, well birth, but of when memory enters in, I would say a year and a half to eight. So we are talking about very small children….

We are talking about children forming consciences at that time, learning right from wrong. These children do not know. They come out and do not know what is right. They are confused. What they did before, that they were rewarded for, is such a horror to anybody else, that they are shunned. And most often they have been in multiple placements, they will go to a home, they will steal, they will lie, they will hurt animals. One little guy would sharpen pencils and try to stab people. I don’t mean poke, I mean stab. People don’t like that in their homes. They don’t have any idea what it is, they just think, “We have a weird kid.” Many are sent to psychiatric hospitals where they are labeled psychotics, schizophrenics, and who would want them in. I praise God that he brought so many of them into my life. and through our home, and that there are other families like ours, it is just a movement of the Holy Spirit, the only way I can explain it. … I will begin with the first stories that we heard, which will seem horrible to you, but are very mild to me, because we have progressed and heard far worse things. The first story is about two little boys who were 7 and 9 when they talked, and they told about sexual abuse at one point, and were very grieved. We talked about good and bad touching and we thought we really had gotten to the bottom of it, and then that afternoon the little one began to cry, and when we couldn’t get the answer from him, the older brother said, “He is probably crying because he was in the room, when they killed his friend.” That was the first one we know about. And as they described that, they talked about that particular victim being brought into a room, hands and arms tied, mouth taped, and how there had been x’s marked on his body, on his vital organs. That was bad enough. Within a very few weeks we learned that it was not the adults who had killed that child. It was this oldest boy, who was talking. The next person that we talked to was a little boy, who was very borderline mentally. He had language problems, it was very hard for him to explain himself. And when he began to come out of it, everyone was startled the way he talked.

And when he began to come out of it, everyone was startled the way he talked. We were real sure, we knew he had not been around these other children and heard anything, but we began to question ourselves, \"Are we asking strange questions. Is there something odd about us which makes children come and dump these things on The part which made me believe this child’s story, he talked about different babies being killed, but this particular one being stabbed, he curled up in a fetal position, he was 9 years old when he was telling the story. He curled up in a fetal position, and his eyes got real glazed, and he said, “They cooked that baby on the grill.” And I thought, he has really flipped out. I mean, I didn’t know. And he said, “Oh, gross, it smelled like rotten chicken, or rotten deer.” He then went on to tell us how they would cut out the heart, or cut off the sex organs, and save them in the refrigerator. A very typical thing that these kids talk about. They worship the sex organs…. They kept it for another ceremony. I asked him where the bodies went. I did not get any answers from that child about what happened to the bodies, but the other two boys, who I spoke about first, eventually, they talked about throwing the babies in the fire. And I asked about that, “You mean they were dead when they threw them in the fire?” And the littlest one said, “No, no. Them was alive and them threw them.” And by this time we were really getting freaked out. What were we going to do? How can you help these kids? Where do you find a therapist who can deal with this? … But God set up a support system. Other families were helping us, and that really helped. The next child I will share about, and I am going sort of by categories here, how we learned, and the types of killings, this little girl is II today, she was 9 when she first talked. It was a very painful thing when she first started to share the sex things.

She began to draw pictures of cats, and the cats all had tails that were on the other side of the page, or their leg was someplace else. As we began to work with her and talk, she said that she had had to kill a pregnant cat. She first said that they had killed a pregnant cat. We said how did you know it was pregnant. Well, she could not explain that, but as we got into it, she confessed that she had had to kill the cat. And I asked her. Now you tell me, does a kid know that? If I ask a kid how do you kill a cat, do you think they will say that? Those are the kinds of details these children tell us. Later, and they eventually cut the cat open, and that was how they knew the cat was pregnant. And they eat parts of the cat, and the feces and the blood. And again, this was just the beginning. It progressed, and the next time she had to kill a baby, the same way-put the knife in the bottom and twist. The baby was alive and he was screaming. And that child hears that, to this day, and has nightmares and flashbacks. And they cut the baby open, and they ate the baby. They do this, so there are no bodies left, and they bum what is left and grind up the bones. And she talked about pouring gasoline on the bodies and burning them in the back yard. And I used to think that was nuts, but I have heard it enough times now that I know it must be so…. The most horrible story about fire that I have to tell, and this is extremely, extremely disturbing, it was a little girl, she was a teenager when she was telling me.

She was a very small child. They would take in children, probably pre-schoolers, and they would hang them from the rafters in this bam, and there would be as many as five or ten hung in a row. They would be fully clothed, which is unusual, because frequently they are naked. The children, like this girl, were all given candles. And you can picture the ceremony as she described it. And the candles were lit. Then the adults would go forward and would pour liquid from a cup on each of the children’s clothing, which was obviously gasoline or kerosene. And then they would give a signal and the others would have to go forward and set the children on fire. When they were done they would cut them down. The first child that this girl had to kill was a cousin, a little cousin. What does that do to you? But you couldn’t object, because the children that objected were killed. Frequently, she said, people would come in families, not knowing that their child would be sacrificed, and she described the screams when they realized that their child had been killed…. This child, about two years ago, just fell to the ground at Christmas time, everyone thinks that Christmas is such a wonderful time. And she confessed that she hated Christmas, she couldn’t wait until everything was put away, because all she could hear was babies crying. Christmas is the time when the most babies die. And she covered her ears and cried for 2% hours, and screamed, “Stop it, stop it, stop it! Talk to God and make him stop it!” All she could hear is the screams and the babies crying…. Christmas for the children I have talked to, has been one of the worst times. I have had three children tell me about a very similar ceremony, and I will kind of merge that and tell you how it went. They were taken to a church, and all the children, it is a very festive occasion, and they are taken to the front of the church, and a small child is now brought in, two of them talked about babies and they put them on a platform.

And at some point they hand all of the children knives and then they are all hacking, and slashing until the baby is dead, and then they all celebrate because the child Jesus is dead. Fonner FBI abuse specialist Ted Gunderson evaluated the accident in which Kathleen Sorenson was killed as a satanic contract suicide. The other driver didn’t die, but well could have; in satanic lore, a person who loses his life in such a contract murder/suicide will be reincarnated with more power, granted by Satan. Kathleen was driving on a long, narrow stretch of road between Fremont, Nebraska and her home in Blair. At least several people knew the road she would be on, and at what time. A car was traveling in front of her, which was possibly the “spotter” car used in such a situation. Another car, coming from the opposite direction, crossed the center line and rammed into Kathleen’s car, killing her. Both the young woman driver and her husband had prior arrest records for cruelty to animals, a common marker for satanism. One of the most potent weapons of the satanists is the inability of the average person to comprehend such hideous events as described by Kathleen Sorenson. A few years ago, if anyone had recounted something like her testimony to me, I would have recommended that they be hauled off to the loony farm. Today, I have no doubt that much-maybe all-of it is true. I have been confronted with documentation of a world I did not know about or believe existed. I want to say one thing. I would not want the committee to disband. I think: that that is not in the best interest of the average Nebraska citizen for the reasons that I have said. I would also not want the material to be turned over to any other commmittee.

The first human defense mechanism against untenable horrific facts is to say that they don’t exist. I’ve been in this field for an awfully long time. I should have realized that’s what these three patients were telling me. It was so horrific for me to contemplate. Taking a twoyear-old child and placing it in an open uterus, in a dying woman. To have this child covered with blood. I used denial myself after all these years…. [This] has occurred, according to Sorenson, in Nebraska, and now she’s dead. And the same thing that is described, this ceremony, was described by Bonacci as occurring in Nebraska. She reviewed her prison interview with Paul Bonacci, conducted the previous day: 1) He has an extraordinary memory for detail, making him an invaluable witness, 2) He does not lie, 3) He has precisely described satanic rituals used by international cults which it were impossible for him to have known, unless he participated in them. Oh, he calls one personality a computer chip in his head. He keeps it together by this meticulous obsessive attention to detail. So that he can give you times and dates that I have never seen in any other child abuse case. I have never seen a child who could do this kind of thing. . .. So that he is an unusual witness…. He doesn’t fabricate, he’ll say “I don’t know,” if he doesn’t know…. And then you have, what I think that you may have here. You have an internationally-connected cult. In which persons move from one place to another and [have] very set rituals and are busy attempting to bring about a force of evil of the anti-Christ. Now he knew such things, as for instance, let me give you an example. In discussing the C[aesarean]­ section, which was done here in Nebraska, the Triangle. When he was there the girl was fifteen, as he describes her two year old son had to have sex with her prior to her death, prior to the hysterotomy or C-section…. The two year old had sex with his mother. The mother was a believer, he states that she was not tied down, though she was drugged, and a lot of them had drugs. The baby was removed and the blood drained, the chalice passed, the high priest urinated in the chalice, in the blood. Because part of the way of the reverse Christian belief is to take the blood and defile it. But only the high priest may do it.

The next thing that he said is that the child would not stop crying and so they eliminated that child as well. And ate the flesh. And the mother died and she was also eaten by the cult. And I said, “well, what happened to the bones and teeth?” And he said that they were ground in a machine. Which is one of the ways that they do do it. He described it extremely well. Occasionally you have to ask a question in a matter of fact way. So instead of saying was there anything done with any body part that was unusual, I said “Who ate the eyes?” Because part of this ritual is the eating of the eyes. And because the concept is that when you eat the eyes of the fetus or the new born, you gain sight, that’s a Celtic Druid ritual which has been taken by these individuals. And without a change in voice or anything else he said Malachi ate the eyes…. And I said but you were supposed to eat the eyes [as the third-ranking member in the cult]. And he said I was out of favor and was not permitted to eat the eyes…. But I have to tell you the detail that he knew about how the rituals are conducted have convinced me he has been at ritual events. There is no other way that this child could know. Freeing America from the influence of those who protect and engage in official corruption-from drug dealing to pedophilia, from abuse of public office to protection of satanism-will depend on people who put fear behind them and stand for human dignity. The lives of four fighters who didn’t quit, even under frightening conditions, give hope and encouragement for the fight to defeat the pedophile rings. I asked their friends to talk about these four people. I have incorporated their observations with some of my own. Two years ago, if anyone had told me, John DeCamp, that a person could have several distinct, real personalities within one body, I would have thought they had been reading too much science fiction, or living with Alice in Wonderland.

Then, the Douglas County Grand Jury indictment of Paul Bonacci brought me deeper into the Franklin case, and the suffering of its victims. Paul Bonacci called me shortly after he was indicted, and I agreed to visit him in the jail where he was incarcerated for touching another boy on the outside of his pants. Meeting with Paul, I have spoken to several of his personalities. Three psychiatrists who have examined him concurred in the diagnosis of Multiple Personality Disorder, brought on by horrible, traumatic abuse when he was a child. My first act with respect to representing Paul Bonacci was to have him write down everything he could remember, about individuals who had abused him, from his earliest boyhood. An excerpt from what he wrote appears in Chapter 10. In that document and in Paul’s letters, his handwriting will vary, depending on which personality is in control. Bonacci was sentenced to five years in prison in 1989, for molesting a young boy for whom he was baby-sitting. Apparently one of Paul’s homosexual personalities was in control of him during the incident, in which he briefly put his hand on the outside of the young boy’s pants, an activity stopped when a remorse-stricken Paul reasserted control. Despite testimony from family friends and church members, that this was out of character, and despite its being a first offense, the Omaha court “threw the book” at Paul. This was before Gary Caradori first interviewed Paul, but the Franklin case had broken, and it would have been known to those to whom it mattered, that Bonacci could be a key Franklin witness. Throughout his childhood, Paul fought desperately to survive hell. He was brutalized continuously. Once when he was very young and it was discovered he was going to tell about the abuse, he had hot metal shoved into his mouth. Now, Paul is in a fight for his life, and for the life of others. A person who, until quite recently, was involved in a life very immoral and dangerous to others, is now motivated to an effort to live by love and a sense of justice. In a letter from prison, to a friend, Bonacci talked about his desire to serve others: “I’m a 23 year old man who loves God and wants to do the right thing to prevent other children from being abused. I’m against anyone harming a child in any way. I’m only wanting to see the men stopped from hurting others. They can kill me. I’m ready to die for what’s right.

If by my death I can prevent a child from being abused, I’d do it.” In his written report on his victimization, Paul said, \"I have in the past cowered and given up. I no longer can cower and give up, instead I must stand firm and with truth go forward and fight against the men and the evil they have done to myself and other young people. ‘[P]erilous times shall come, for men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such tum away. For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.’ 2 Timothy 3:1-9. “This scripture just about says it all about the men who have used me and others. They can continue to deny these things before men, but the day will come when they will stand before God and He will know all and then they cannot deny…. I have continued to speak the truth and for doing so I am now being put down as a liar. The only liars are those who continue to deny the terrible sins they have done. Also Troy and Danny who at first told the truth and then began to lie to save their own butts from indictments which everyone with a brain could see coming for the victims. I will stand firm in my faith and trusting in the Lord to show the truth in the end.” Paul has repeatedly been placed in situations of danger while in prison. He has been moved to different facilities, contrary to agreements worked out by me as his attorney. He was given food to which he was allergic, while his weight dropped, and he was denied a blanket for months. He has had no medical help for his Multiple Personality Disorder, induced by what Paul Bonacci’s commitment to saving other children is evident in his willingness to be interviewed by investigators of child abuse.

In order to remember details, Paul must go through the difficult process of allowing his different personalities to come forward and speak. If one personality can’t remember, another might. The personalities were originally established, one by one, at the exact moments of psychological terror when Paul as a defenseless child was physically attacked. Some of the personalities are very young children, some are girls, some are boys, some are men. The process of calling them up, of assuming these different identities, often involves intense pain for Paul. If he didn’t care, he wouldn’t go through these difficult interviews. Alisha’s strength and determination have become famous among her supporters in Nebraska. People who meet her now, often remark that she is motivated by love. One woman said that the first thing Alisha ever told her, was that she is strong in her religious faith and that she must and will do the right thing, “because the Lord will be here with me” through what she knows will be a long ordeal ahead. Alisha Owen has been told she will have to serve a minimum of ten years, seven months of her sentence, even with “good time.” Alisha’s daughter, Amanda, has been inconsolable; until she saw Alisha in the courtroom at the sentencing hearing, she was convinced her mother was dead. At sentencing, Alisha read a statement, in which she blamed state prosecutor Gerald Moran, the World-Herald, and two of the men she accused of abusing her, Robert Wadman and Harold Andersen, for clouding the issues and fueling a climate of innuendo against her. “I couldn’t change my story when the FBI asked me to,” she said, “because I can look into the mirror and know I am telling the truth. Children ask for justice, while adults plead for mercy. Your honor, I stand before you here today and I ask for justice.” Even while she was a repeated victim of abuse, Alisha was an excellent student and a youth leader in her church. She is known as an intelligent and well organized person. During her trial, courtroom observers were impressed by her close attention and participation in all aspects of her legal defense. Meanwhile, the prosecution attempted to portray Alisha as an immoral person since childhood, the way a rapist’s lawyers often try to depict the rape victim as a slut who invited and possibly deserved abuse. This courtroom performance reduced Alisha to tears several times.

This courtroom performance reduced Alisha to tears several times. Even through her first months in jail, through the grand juries’ denunciation and indictment of her, through its repetition by the World-Herald and CBS News, and through her long trial and sentencing, Alisha’s supporters say, “her faith and strength have amazed us. She is always honest, loyal, and even maintains her sense of humor. Alisha maintains she will not give up until these perpetrators give up-and she won’t give up!” Even though a court-appointed psychiatrist said that Alisha did not tolerate well being alone, during 1990 and 1991 she was held in solitary confinement longer than any other female inmate in the history of the Nebraska penal system. A friend of hers said, “Her determination was unchanged by being in solitary.” When she was 17, Alisha was discarded as a sexual object by the pedophiles. At that point, she was in a position to have become a trusted, and very wealthy, member of organized crime networks. Someone serving as a “mule,” or youthful courier for criminal drug runners, would have narcotics worth hundreds of thousands of dollars pass through her hands. When Alisha started to talk to Franklin committee investigators, many deals were offered to her to make her stop. But her disgust and concern over what was happening to other children prevailed. Schmit has farmed all his life. He is the father of ten children, a grandfather, and has served in the Nebraska Legislature for twenty-three years. His work in the Legislature, on agricultural and water resources development in the state, is described by long-time associates as being of “legendary proportions.” Senator Schmit has chaired the Agriculture, Public Works, and Natural Resources committees of the Legislature. He was a member of its Executive Board for eighteen years. In January 1991, when the Franklin committee was decommissioned, the newly elected Legislature stripped Schmit and its other members of key positions; Schmit lost his chairmanship of the Natural Resources committee. Senator Schmit has worked as a crop duster. Of his more than 40,000 hours of flying time as a pilot, a majority has been in the dangerous occupation of low altitude crop dusting and seeding, in both fixed-wing craft and helicopters. His personal knowledge of aircraft boosted his certainty, that his investigator Gary Caradori’ s violent death was not accidental. Schmit has a longstanding reputation as a last resort for people trying to help children in trouble.

As Franklin committee chairman, Schmit often stayed at his office late into the night, to pursue the investigation of the pedophile ring. After Caradori was killed, and the Franklin committee no longer had a professional investigator, Schmit remarked, “Gary had this remarkable knack of just putting on his casual clothes and going out to places where people had information and just sitting down with them and gaining their trust. That’s how he brought in all these facts in the investigation. I know I can’t do it like Gary did, but when I hear that someone has information for us I just put on myoid clothes and go wherever I need to go and sit down with them, and try to get that information myself. Gary would have done it much better, but I try.” This senator, who often starts speeches by saying, “Well, I’m just a farmer, but here’s what I think,” is a plain-spoken man. The image before him, of setting the pace for the people of his state, and of keeping the faith with his martyred investigator, has proven Loran Schmit to be a man of courage. He has withstood threats and harassment. At the height of the Franklin committee investigation, a piece of gallows humor around the state house was to ask, “Who wants to go start Schmit’s car tonight?” Unhappy about what he regards as a do-nothing attitude of a majority of state senators toward child abuse, Loran Schmit recently asked, “When does it happen that we cross the line and the passivity of the Senate makes us co-conspirators with corruption? We have to take action, and stop this abuse once and for all.” During Alisha Owen’s trial, FBI agent Rick Culver testified that Caradori’ s work for the Franklin committee was worthless. Former Police Chief Robert Wadman, posing as the wronged party, sued the state for damages, charging that Caradori’ s investigation caused him mental anguish. Wadman’s claim against the state was turned down, and the lawsuit dismissed. Mary Caradori has commented, that there were no such slanders of her son while he was alive. She calls him “a gentle, smiling man, a great man and the greatest investigator Nebraska has ever had.” The man the World-Herald now smears as a Keystone Kop, she notes, was the youngest person ever to qualify as an investigator for the State Patrol.

He was universally liked and respected, and he was “so bothered by what he was finding in the Franklin investigation that he just couldn’t give it up.” Mary Caradori says that the accusation that Gary wanted to make a movie out of the Franklin case was a lie. She is angered by the Douglas County grand jury’s suggestion that tape breaks in Caradori’s videotaped interviews of victim-witnesses concealed his coaching them. “He would stop the tape when the kids would start to break down,” she said. “He would always leave them their dignity. That is the kind of man he was. And he knew that they were victims of slavery and a Satanic cult. He knew that if the perpetrators aren’t brought to justice, they will not stop.” A former Nebraska state patrolman, who later opened his own private investigative company, Caradori was known as a resourceful investigator. George Zahn, plant manager at the Monfort of Colorado meatpacking plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, told the World-Herald that Caradori \" ‘did a very good job for us,’ providing security and handling some investigations for Monfort for about seven years. ‘He works any and all hours,’ Zahn said. ‘It doesn’t make any difference to him. He’s a person you can trust.’ \" Lincoln private investigator Edward H. Itzen, president of Metropolitan Protection Service, added, “I’ve never heard anything but good about him.” Caradori once traveled to East Germany and found a woman’s father, 39 years after they were separated. He rescued young girls who ran away from home and became caught up in prostitution in Las Vegas or California. Franklin committee counsel John Stevens Berry told the World-Herald, that Caradori is “the kind of guy who can check out the cat houses and find the child and get the kid out of there.” Gary Caradori’s widow, Sandie, was his high school sweetheart. They had two sons. AJ., the younger, was an avid baseball fan, like his father. Departing for the All-Star Game, his grandmother recalls, AJ. was overjoyed that he would finally get to see his favorite big league players in person. “He was a wonderful little boy.” Mary Caradori during his speech to a rally held by the Nebraska Leadership Conference in Lincoln in March 1991. He thanked her “for the gift of your son and grandson, who died for what is right.” Senator Schmit, to applause, declared that it is imperative to “leave no stone unturned,” to find out why Gary and AJ. died.

He thanked her “for the gift of your son and grandson, who died for what is right.” Senator Schmit, to applause, declared that it is imperative to “leave no stone unturned,” to find out why Gary and AJ. died. Larry King is in prison, but not for child abuse. Under a plea bargain arrangement finalized with federal prosecutors on June 17, 1991, King is serving a IS-year sentence for embezzlement, conspiracy and making false financial record entries. Since the Douglas County grand jury deferred to the federal authorities, and since there was no trial of King on the federal embezzlement or any other charges, the evidence ofchildprostitution and abuse perpetrated by King was never presented in any court. Jarrett Webb did not stand trial. In a calculated display of concern, the Douglas County grand jury recommended in May 1990, that Webb be indicted by Washington County prosecutors for “third degree sexual assault of a minor,” Nelly Patterson. On December 26, 1990, however, Washington County Judge David Quist dismissed the charges against Webb, ruling that the statute of limitations had run out on acts committed in 1985. In Nebraska, cases of abuse of children under sixteen years of age are supposed to receive an automatic extension of the statute. But although Nelly had reported abuse that began when she was nine years old, the judge ruled that the assaults in question were not prosecutable because they occurred two days after the girl’s sixteenth birthday! Alisha Owen was convicted of lying when she said she was sexually used by Robert Wadman. I will allow the articles and statements of others to deal with this, since I have, at Alisha’s request, now agreed to represent her free of charge. I do not want to say anything here that would jeopardize Alisha or my ability to help her. But I can say, that Alisha Owen’s trial took the strangest turns I have seen any trial take. Suffice it to say, that I believe she had the most extraordinary trial there ever was in Nebraska. I have not a shadow of a doubt that her story is true, like Paul Bonacci’s. I had seen it coming. As we moved closer to the commencement of Paul Bonacci’s perjury trial, I said many times to all who would listen, “I guarantee you that Paul Bonacci will never go to trial. They will either kill him, or dismiss the charges. We are ready for trial. When we have the trial, the entire picture of crime, drug dealing, pedophilia and child abuse, and even this satanic cult activity, will come out, with all the personalities associated with it.

Wadman asserted that “Caradori led witnesses, fed witnesses,” while Boner pronounced that “the whole thing was just a lie,” and that “Caradori convinced me to do it.” The narrator stated, “Caradori’s motives remain unknown.” The impact on Alisha Owen’s trial, of such a presumably authoritative national TV show passing judgment on the Nebraska case, was devastating. Although the judge expressly ordered the jurors not to watch the program, a good number of them did, and several reported that it was the main topic of discussion in the jury room the next morning! In articles on July 20 and 21 and a lead editorial of July 26, 1991, the World-Herald attacked victim Owen, Senator Schmit, and myself as “bacteria that cause a plague,” and ridiculed the legislature’s investigation as a “Keystone Kop” affair. The editorial, entitled “The Lessons of Franklin,” denounced all and sundry-Senator Loran Schmit, myself, the Legislature, the Omaha news media, Douglas County Sheriff Dick Roth, and the general public-whosoever had ever intimated that the children might be telling the truth-for “damaging the reputations of innocent people.” Never again, the editorial intoned, should the Legislature exercise its rights to oversee law enforcement in the state. Neither the Franklin case nor the hideous kind of activity it involved, however, are over with.

The World-Herald itself demonstrated as much, in a July 20, 1991 article appearing side-by-side with one of its denunciations of the Franklin investigators. Under the headline “Male Hustlers Move In When Workers Leave,” the paper trumpeted that prostitution and child abuse were here to stay. The article quoted Sgt. Ken Bovasso of the OPD: “Male prostitution has been occurring at 16th and Jackson for years. . . . I don’t think you can stop it . . . it will continue to happen.” (This was the same Sgt. Bovasso who supervised Officer Irl Carmean’s work with Loretta Smith, which abruptly terminated. He is also the Bovasso charged in the civil suit filed by this writer, with having subjected Paul Bonacci “to long hours of brutal interrogation involving threats, intimidation, [and] physical and mental abuse … purposely designed to prevent him [Bonacci] from disclosing any information he had regarding the conduct of prominent Omaha citizens.”) Witnesses interviewed by the World-Herald described the expensive cars driven by the men who pick up young boys, and said that between “tricks” the boys shoot up drugs and discard the hypodermic needles on the sidewalk. I did indicate to Henry that these kids were only a small part of this case, and that the bulk and real intent of this case was to determine why OPD, and the NSP had insisted that they had thoroughly investigated these allegations and concluded that there was no merit to these allegations. I also indicated that the end result of this case should be to determine where the monies earned from kiddie porn, child prostitution. and drug activity, were going to. Failure of the various law enforcement agencies to follow up on these allegations which they had received from several years back was also discussed. Again, I stated that the statements of the kids was [sic] very important, but these kids were but a small part of the frightening reality and extent of the “bigger picture” of this case. Gary and I have always maintained that these kids were not the case-they were only a small part of it. For instance, where does all the money go that is earned by child prostitution and kiddie porn, and what is it used for? Why is the FBI and/or others trying so desperately to cover all this up?

The Franklin investigators had lifted a comer of the rug, under which could be glimpsed a national and international organized crime syndicate, engaged in pedophilia, pornography, satanism, drugs, and money-laundering, and protected, as their own limited investigation began to show, by federal authorities. I debriefed Paul Bonacci at length, as did private investigator Roy Stephens, in preparation for the perjury trial that was not to be. Through his many personalities, each with its own distinct, partial recollections, Bonacci provided new evidence on child kidnaping, pornography, and murder taking place in the United States and abroad. The Franklin case was just one part of what he knew. The North American Man-Boy Love Association, or NAMBLA, figured prominently in what else Bonacci could recall. The motto of NAMBLA is “Sex before eight, or it’s too late.” One of its leaders is named David Thorstadt. Two of Bonacci’s personalities, Sean and Christopher, have “Thorstadt” as their last name. Bonacci reports that he was brought into contact with Thorstadt through two Omaha men, that he traveled with Thorstadt to New York, and that he witnessed NAMBLA-organized auctions of children. I can even recall when and where I remember you from. Tell me if I’m wrong in which I know you wouldn’t remember me. It was in New York on December I believe the 28th or 29th, 1982, it was a Tuesday or Wednesday (not important). It was a news conference at I believe the Holiday Inn. I had to wait for David [Thorstadt] with a friend. When he got done he told me that wicked old witch Gerber was someone he had to fix somehow. Early Sunday morning, September 5, 1982, 12-year-old Johnny Gosch went out on his Des Moines Register paper delivery route, as usual. Only that Sunday, he never came home. For nine years, his parents have searched the country for him. Most evenings, and weekends when they were not on the road to check out leads, they sold candy bars in local shopping centers, to finance the search. In late 1990, the Gosches got the first major break in years, because of what Paul Bonacci had to tell. I had noted that one of the events Paul described reminded me of the case of Johnny Gosch, which I had read about years earlier.

I had noted that one of the events Paul described reminded me of the case of Johnny Gosch, which I had read about years earlier. I went to the library, and confirmed the similarity of the details of the case, with what Paul said. I then contacted the Gosch family. They advised me that they had had their fill of false leads from people who claimed to know something about their missing boy, and people who claimed to have information for sale but did not seem genuinely interested. But a couple of weeks later, Mr. Gosch did come to Omaha. Noreen Gosch told the World-Herald. that paper reported on July 22, 1991, that Bonacci knew “some incredible things” about the case. For instance, “There were photographs taken of Johnny prior to the kidnaping. We know this because a woman reported it to police. We’re convinced Bonacci saw those pictures. He accurately described the location, which is not far from our home. He described many things about the pictures which we have never publicly talked about.” Bonacci also described a mark on Johnny Gosch’s body, which the Gosches had never publicized. Roy Stephens is an Omaha-based investigator and a founder of the Missing Children’s Foundation. A former safecracker who went straight, Stephens was named “Outstanding Man of the Year” for 1991, by the Nebraska Jaycees, for his work in recovering children. Roy is remembered in Nebraska, as the man who did what the police and other investigators were unable to dolocate and cause the conviction of the kidnaper of Jill Cutshall, the Norfolk, Nebraska girl who disappeared in 1987 and almost certainly was murdered, though her body was never found. Stephens was cited as the leading child finder in the nation, in an article in the 1991 summer supplement to Forbes magazine: “The best in the business in that field, according to a survey of his peers, is Roy Stephens … who has recovered some 50 missing children over the last five-and-a-half years,” said G. Gordon Liddy of Watergate fame, now a private security consultant in Florida. PB: Well, we got up at, oh, before the sun got up.

PB: And then I heard them talking to somebody else at the car, but I don’t know who it was cause we stopped. He was talking to somebody asking for directions; asking where some place was. And it sounded like there was more than one kid. It sounded like there was a couple of them there. And then we went around the block and he let me out of the trunk and told Mike to, he says, if you don’t do what I say, I’m gonna shoot you. He has a gun he pulled out and pointed at me and says, you do what I say or I’ll shoot you. We drove around…. PB: Down low, kind of sitting on the floor. And then Emilio, I guess, I don’t know what he did, but he, Mike told me, he says, when the car slows down, he says, when you feel the brakes jerk, he says, I’ll grab him and you just hold him down. And so it happened quick. It’s like we went up, I felt the brakes jerk, and I saw the door fly open and I saw Mike jump out and the next thing I know there was somebody, you know, he grabbed the boy and he’d thrown him in and my job, you know we were supposed to do is just hold him down and gag his mouth so he couldn’t yell or nothing. And then after we had, just, like two seconds, just spun off, tore off, got out of there. Two other people were involved in the kidnaping, one of whom was a local contact. Bonacci named them all. According to a July 18 article in the Des Moines Register, “Stephens has told the family, sources say, that [Bonacci] identified the Des Moines ‘contact’ from a photograph. The suspected contact, said [Noreen] Gosch, has been under suspicion by the family for some time.” Furthermore, “Gosch said Stephens told her the same ring may be involved in other kidnapings in the region, including the suspected abuction of Des Moines Register carrier Eugene Martin, 13, in south Des Moines in 1984, and more recently, that of Jacob Wetterling in St. Joseph, Minn.” Bonacci described a network of safehouses, where the pedophile ring stored kidnaped children before selling them. He said he met Johnny Gosch again several years later, and provided a detailed description of the farm on which Gosch was being", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:141:2ac5f2ac9b59", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5847, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 142, "text": "the same ring may be involved in other kidnapings in the region, including the suspected abuction of Des Moines Register carrier Eugene Martin, 13, in south Des Moines in 1984, and more recently, that of Jacob Wetterling in St. Joseph, Minn.” Bonacci described a network of safehouses, where the pedophile ring stored kidnaped children before selling them. He said he met Johnny Gosch again several years later, and provided a detailed description of the farm on which Gosch was being kept in Colorado and of Gosch’s new “parents,” a homosexual man and a lesbian in their thirties. After Gosch once attempted to run away, Bonacci reported, they branded him on the buttocks with the same brand used on horses and cows on the farm, of which Bonacci drew a picture for Roy Stephens. PB: Him, no, him he’d kidnap boys or girls. Main thing he’d kidnap was boys, though, ’cause he said he’d get more money for them. Emilio used to tell me all kinds of things like how they could get away with kidnaping kids and sell them out of the country. He said most of the kids were sold in Las Vegas at a ranch he took me to one time for an auction. I went with him to Toronto several times where boys were sold. I saw a few girls once in a while. He said virgins could bring as much as $50, 000 . They called the boys toys, used toys brought in money but not as much…. Most boys were sold out of America cause it’s harder to find them. The men who bought them had planes and could transport them easily. Despite the astonishing new information from Paul Bonacci on the Gosch kidnaping, West Des Moines police “have not interviewed Bonacci and have no plans to do so,” according to the July 21, 1991 Des Moines Sunday Register. “We are aware of what’s going on,” said Lt. Gerry Scott, in charge of the Gosch investigation. “We’re not going to reinvent the wheel. This has been investigated in Nebraska. When things need investigating, here, they will be investigated.” Kathleen Morris investigated and began to prosecute a ring of child molesters centered in the town of Jordan. Child victims had testified about satanic rituals and the filming of children in sex acts. “The case involves the largest adult-juvenile sex ring in Minnesota history, authorities said,” reported the Minneapolis Star-Tribune on November 18, 1983. At least 30 children told police they had been molested. Morris brought indictments against 24 adults. People magazine of October 22, 1984 summarized, “The village harbored rings of adult sex abusers who incestuously victimized their own children and other children during ritualistic sex parties involving sadism and bestiality. Some of the children described a bizarre sexual variation of hide-and-seek in which children who were ‘found’ were taken to a bedroom and abused.” The", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:142:612fc5e33114", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5848, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 143, "text": "the Minneapolis Star-Tribune on November 18, 1983.

Some of the children described a bizarre sexual variation of hide-and-seek in which children who were ‘found’ were taken to a bedroom and abused.” The children told of witnessing three ritualistic murders. Child care workers and psychologists found the children highly credible. Psychologist Michael Shea, who treated some of them, told People, “Children are not able to fantasize in such graphic detail about sexual acts which are outside their experience. And they certainly can’t be coerced, or bribed or brainwashed into making statements about their parents.” Minnesota psychologist Susan Phipps-Yonas, who also interviewed some of the children, told the Star-Tribune that she fully believed their reports: “It’s not just the details that make them convincing, but the [emotional] effect behind the stories. They’re extraordinarily upset when they recount these things. They’d have to be world-class actors to be so convincing if it wasn’t true.” Phipps-Yonas speculated that since the children talked about large sums of money changing hands, organized crime was likely involved. Morris indicted the ring’s chief figure, 26-year-old James Rud, on 108 counts of child abuse. His parents, Alvin and Rosemary Rud, and his 17-year old brother were also indicted, as were several other people from the Valley Green Trailer Park, 35 miles outside of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Most of the abused children also lived in the trailer park. Like the Franklin investigators in Nebraska, Morris came under savage attack from media and the political establishment in her state. Under pressure, she ultimately turned the investigation over to state Attorney General Hubert “Skip” Humphrey, Jr. To the horror of many, Humphrey soon released a 29-page report titled “Scott County Investigations,” which closed the case, citing “insufficient evidence.” Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich then appointed a commission to investigate Morris! Humphrey named one of his political cronies, lawyer Kelton Gage, as “independent counsel” to present evidence against her. Among the children who testified against the couple was their 6-year-old boy, Tony, who told the court that his father had sodomized him and his brothers. Although the boy was confused over the meaning of the sexual terms, when a defense attorney asked if he feared that his father would abuse him again, the boy looked across the courtroom at Bentz and replied, “You won’t do that no more, right?” During the grueling cross-examination, defense attorneys succeeded in shaking some of the young witnesses’ stories by hammering away at dates, places and word meanings. However, a 12-year-old girl steadfastly refused to waver from her testimony. When a defense attorney accused her of lying, she snapped: “You’re just helping", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:143:c73799a282ec", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5849, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 144, "text": "when a defense attorney asked if he feared that his father would abuse him again, the boy looked across the courtroom at Bentz and replied, “You won’t do that no more, right?” During the grueling cross-examination, defense attorneys succeeded in shaking some of the young witnesses’ stories by hammering away at dates, places and word meanings.

When a defense attorney accused her of lying, she snapped: “You’re just helping Bob and Lois [Bentz] to get out of this stuff, this child-abusing stuff, I’m not lying, you guys are. It’s the truth, they hurt us.” Later she rushed tearfully into the arms of a social worker. On other occasions, Bonacci described ritualistic abuse and the sacrifice of a boy at a place near Bakersfield, California. The details of his testimony, including names, are consistent with the 1983-1985 investigation by Kern County, California Sheriff Larry Kleier into satanic ritual abuse there. Despite attempts by the state attorney general, John Van De Kamp, to discredit the Kern County investigation as based on “hearsay” and “hysteria,” a grandjury indicted seven people on 377 counts ofpornography, child abuse and drug possession. They were convicted in a 1986 trial and sentenced to a total of 2,600 years in prison, but a state appeals court overturned the convictions in 1990, on grounds of “egregious prosecutorial misconduct.” Several months after becoming Paul Bonacci’s attorney in the summer of 1990, I remarked to a friend, “You know, the more I find out about this case, the more I am absolutely convinced that drugs are a major part of it. Everywhere you turn, there are drugs, and on a huge scale. The kids report Alan Baer involved in bigtime drugs from California, Larry King has been reported as a major pusher, and Wadman’s name has been strongly linked to drugs.” Through the use of young boys and girls, Larry King was able to have a nationwide drug transportation network. It interfaced perfectly with his ability to compromise and blackmail politicians or businessmen. Having cocaine available could make it easier for Larry King to entice prominent people, after they got drunk, and then high on the drug, into sex with a teenaged girl or boy. My community is ravaged by drugs. We see the Omaha police picking up kids from 14 to l8-years old with a half an ounce or less of these narcotic substances and that is supposed to be fighting the drugs. These are nickel and dime pushers, not suppliers, not mid level suppliers. A few days ago the Douglas County Sheriff got together with some of the county sheriffs, one was from Sarpy, and they made a raid and they got a pound and a half of heavy drugs, some money and some weapons. They didn’t tell the Omaha police. And I talked to the Douglas County", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:144:420b7abfd7eb", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5850, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 145, "text": "less of these narcotic substances and that is supposed to be fighting the drugs.

They didn’t tell the Omaha police. And I talked to the Douglas County Attorney and I told him I was glad they didn’t tell them because had the Omaha police been notified this drug bust would never have occurred, they would have told the individual, they would not have gotten a substantial amount of the drugs. These nickel and dime people in my community that they are arresting don’t have the connections or the money to bring the amount of drugs into the City of Omaha that are coming. And certainly the little piddling amounts that are picked up by the police have no meaning or significance. When we wanted, as a community, to help organize and work with a task force of black officers to address the drug problem and the gang problem, Chief Wadman fought it tooth and nail and did not want it, wanted to deny that the problem existed. And I said the only reason that a police official would be opposedto this kind of actionis because he knows something or he’s part of it. One of Caradori’ s informants stated that Wadman was instrumental in bringing the drug-trafficking gangs, the Los Angelesbased Bloods and Cryps, into Omaha. According to a June 19, 1989 report by Caradori’s predecessor at the Franklin committee, Jerry Lowe, members ofthe Bloods and Cryps were identified by local police as driving Larry King’s car. As soon as awareness dawned, that sexual and ritual abuse of children was happening in Nebraska, and that it was being protected from within the political and law enforcement establishment, a resistance movement on behalf of the children took shape. In her famous interview on Geraldo Rivera’s TV special on satanism, Kathleen Sorenson identified her group as Believe the Children. Later, friends of Kathleen were active in the Concerned Parents group, which urged that the testimony of Loretta Smith and others be investigated on its merits, instead of dismissed out of hand. Against the shroud of cover-up, imposed by the World-Herald in its treatment of the Franklin case, some newspapers showed the integrity to keep all aspects of the case alive in Nebraska.

Foremost among these has been the Nebraska Observer, published by the Nebraska Citizens’ Publishing Group and edited by Frances Mendenhall. While most of the national press dropped the Franklin story, in the summer of 1990, Executive Intelligence Review sent an investigative team into the state to report on the case first-hand. Its July 27, 1990 article, “FBI covers up child abuse, murder in Nebraska,” brought a rain of denunciations on the pages of the World-Herald, which made much of the fact that EIR was founded by the jailed economist and presidential candidate, Lyndon LaRouche. After an initial “no comment” from an FBI spokesman, Nick O’Hara’s successor at the Nebraska-Iowa office of the bureau, Charles Lontor, took to the pages of the World-Herald on August 13, to denounce such talk of coverup as “nonsense,” and to say that the FBI did “not wish to become involved in a futile public debate with them [EIR] or anyone who may choose to support their efforts.” It was my view, that the Franklin cover-up was so massive in Nebraska, that it could not be broken just inside the state. In 1991, the case did receive attention in the Italian weekly Avvenimenti and in Pronto, published in Spain. Both articles came from Italian journalists Giovanni Caporaso and Massimiliano Cocozza Lubisco, a team that has produced many stories for Italian television. After their own May 1991 investigative trip to Nebraska, they wrote about the kidnaping and sale of children as “the market of horrors.” They quoted Paul Bonacci and Roy Stephens at length. I was glad of the presence of other international observers, who came when the Schiller Institute, founded by Helga Zepp-LaRouche in 1984 and based in Washington, D.C. and Laatzen, Germany, organized an ad hoc human rights fact-finding mission to Nebraska. In response to a Schiller Institute appeal, nine people from five U.S. states and three foreign countries constituted themselves as the Citizens’ Fact-Finding Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations in Nebraska. Among them were the Reverend James Bevel, former close associate of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., an Austrian leader of the European Citizens’ Initiative to Protect Life and Human Dignity, the president of the Ukrainian Political Action Committee of the United States, and a clinical psychologist from Canada. They came from October 11 to 17, 1990, and during that week, interviewed many witnesses, visited the Omaha FBI office, watched hours of videotaped testimony from child victims, and read mountains of documents. The Citizens’ Fact-Finding Commission issued a report that denounced the “torture and murder-in-progress” of Paul Bonacci, and said that there was so little recourse through the law left in Nebraska, that an international spotlight needed to be shined on the systematic “violations of human rights” there.

After these findings were published, one hundred fifty clergymen, civil rights leaders and other community leaders from throughout the United States signed a “Letter to the Citizens of Nebraska,” which endorsed the findings and called on the Senate Franklin committee to pursue its investigation “at all costs.” The World-Herald refused to print the Commission’s findings and the endorsement letter, even as a paid advertisement. In an October 20, 1990 article by Bob Dorr, the paper attacked the independent fact-finders as “LaRouche Investigators.” There and in subsequent articles, Dorr called upon the expertise of so-called “anti-cult” specialists from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) of B’nai B’rith and the Cult Awareness Network (CAN), in attempts to rebut the Commission’s work. Rev. Bevel came in for particularly strong attack by such defenders of the cover-up. But as I watched him work and saw his dedication, I learned more about faith, hope, charity and truth from this one dedicated individual, than from all the priests, pastors and rabbis I have known. Rev. Bevel cared about one thing-children. Children were being abused and were going to be abused, unless something was done. The more Bevel worked, the more he was condemned by the World-Herald for his efforts in the black community, particularly, to expose the sins. Rev. Bevel and others found there was a tremendous unspoken support among the people of Nebraska, for the victims of the child abuse ring. Radio call-in polls showed that Nebraskans, by margins of up to ten to one, do not agree with the way prosecutors have handled the Franklin case or believe that the witnesses are hoaxers. During 1991, a newly-formed citizens’ group called the Nebraska Leadership Conference mobilized a large number of people, hundreds of whom traveled to Lincoln for several large conferences. At two of the conferences, detailed background presentations on the exploitation of children and on the Franklin cover-up were made by knowledgeable people from many different institutions and organizations in Nebraska. At a third, outof-state specialists on satanic cults were given the opportunity to educate Nebraskans on the scope of the problem. The conferences turned into mass meetings, which rallied support for the victim-witnesses. After Alisha Owen’s conviction, Frances Mendenhall’s Nebraska Observer devoted its July 12, 1991 issue to a dissection of the flaws in Alisha’s trial, and related matters.

One article was, “Owen Trial Was a Far Cry from Justice,” in which Mendenhall reviewed such key issues as the contradictory behavior of Troy Boner and the lack of any demonstrated basis for the central claim of the prosecution, that Alisha Owen was motivated by a desire for publicity. Other headlines included, “Evidence the Owen Jury Didn’t Get to See,” “Common Misconceptions About the Owen Trial,” “Caradori Widow Questions Fairness of ‘48 Hours’ ,” and “Bonacci Recalls Early Trauma,” which drew out the implications of dropping the charges against Paul. Many demonstrations of support for Paul Bonacci and Alisha Owen were held in Lincoln and Omaha, outside the facilities where they have been imprisoned. A group called the Children’s Civil Rights Committee was active in these, and also began holding weekly prayer meetings in Omaha, in December 1990. The Children’s Civil Rights Committee has been instrumental in efforts to reinstate the Legislature’s investigation into the Franklin case. Another group that played a key role in 1990 and 1991 efforts to crack the Franklin cover-up, by lobbying and literature distribution, was the Commonwealth Depositors Committee, led by Reuben Worster and Dr. Melvin Bahensky. A respected veterinarian, now in his eighties, Bahensky is legendary for his spirit and tenacity in fighting to expose the wrongs in the Commonwealth and Franklin cases. He always maintains, that they are one and the same. In October 1991, the Nebraska State Parole Board voted 5-0 to parole Paul Bonacci, who has been serving a five-year sentence since 1989. On Hallowe’en, soon after a scathing World-Herald editorial against the decision, the board reversed itself. As Bonacci’s attorney, I responded with the following press release: From beginning to present, Franklin has been a cauldron of cover-up skillfully executed by powerful and wealthy thieves and pedophiles. Punishment, destruction and even elimination of those who would expose or try to correct the evil wrought by these individuals is the reward of child victimwitnesses and any who would aid those children. World-Herald they have systematically turned lies into truth and truth into lies. A “free” Paul Bonacci would continue to provide information which helps expose individuals and offenses involved in this cover-up. So, one way or another, they intend to eliminate Paul Bonacci-no matter what it takes. That is my very real fear. Therefore the World-Herald intimidated an already frightened and beleaguered parole board into effectively reversing their original proper decision to allow this youth out of prison.

Meanwhile, the visible payoff to the Parole Board will be a glowing editorial in the Omaha World Herald. If I still had the luxury of believing, as I once did, that the allegations of drug abuse, child abuse, pedophilia, theft and satanic cult activity were exaggerated imaginings of some overactive child and adult imaginations, then I would not have to do anything about Franklin. I could still be enjoying an income of $400, 000 per year as a lobbyist, without having to work too hard, instead of being financially strangled as clients are intimidated away from hiring me, because of the Franklin connection. At the height of the legislative Franklin investigation, when the Douglas County grand jury was also going full bore, I received a phone call in the middle of the night, from a close friend of mine in Omaha, who wanted to warn me that my life might be in danger. It was approximately a week after Gary Caradori died. “I don’t know,” answered Mary Kay Evans, a former campaign chairman of mine. “As you know, I am close to one of the University of Nebraska Board of Regents members, Dr. Robert Prokop. He called me and said he did not particularly like you or really ever get to know you, but that he felt he had an obligation, morally, to warn you.” “He simply told me he was with the police, riding around talking to individuals on the street-which he does once a month, he said-and he learned that you were supposed to be the target of an assassination, because of your Franklin involvement and trying to force the investigation there. And he said that if I cared about you, that I should call you so that at least his conscience would be clear.” Prokop was stern and nervous. “We really don’t know each other,” he said, “but I feel I have a moral obligation to tell you that when I was with the police last night, one of the very reliable informants we talked to advised us that you, John DeCamp, were supposed to be the ‘first hit,’ instead of Gary Caradori. In other words, Mr. DeCamp, you were supposed to be eliminated first and then Gary Caradori if that was necessary. Now that Caradori has been killed, I was concerned that maybe they will go ahead", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:149:6d3d1ea24252", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5855, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 150, "text": "I feel I have a moral obligation to tell you that when I was with the police last night, one of the very reliable informants we talked to advised us that you, John DeCamp, were supposed to be the ‘first hit,’ instead of Gary Caradori.

Now that Caradori has been killed, I was concerned that maybe they will go ahead with the next hit, which means you.” First, I have absolutely no doubt, that prominent individuals, whom everybody in Omaha is familiar with, and many of whom have been named during the investigation, have engaged in long-term activity involving drug peddling and drug abuse, child abuse, and pedophilia, with particular attention to the abuse of young boys. That in the case of Larry King and the cadre of people he dealt with closely, boys and girls like Paul Bonacci, Troy Boner, Danny King, and Alisha Owen were used as drug couriers for a national program of illegal narcotics marketing. They were “throwaway” kids. Because they were teenagers and younger when they were doing this activity, they provided a perfect insulation blanket between the real drug czars, like Larry King or Alan Baer, and the law. Larry King was able to read people and compromise people through their weaknesses. And Larry King knew whom to cater to and to compromise. Compromise the heads of institutions. Cater to the secret sins of a law enforcer, so that when you need protection, that official is not in a position to do anything but sit and watch your illegal activities. Cater to the weakness for drugs, or 13-year-old girls, or 9-year-old boys, and then blackmail as required. So, let me conclude my saying simply this: Bill Colby, you were right. It is too big. I am too small. They are too rich and powerful, and go up too high in business and government, for me to touch them or do anything about it. Yes, it is something that I should have abandoned long ago and faced up to the fact that good does not always triumph and that evil, with its many faces, does sometimes succeed. 5. Newt Copple. A confidential informant for Caradori and his investigative firm, Copple was a key behind-the-scenes activist fighting the cover-up of the Franklin case. Son of Commonwealth Savings owner S.E. Copple, businessman in his own right, an ex-champion wrestler with no prior health problems and parents who lived into their late eighties and nineties, Copple suddenly “died in his sleep” in March 1991, at the age of 70.

Some of what follows, I probably should have said some time ago. Now, the prospect of Bobby Kerrey holding the highest office in the land means that I, who am knowledgeable about Kerrey in a way that probably no one but the closest of his cronies is, have no choice but to speak out. I could say much more, but I think the following episodes, in addition to what I have said in Chapter 6, are enough to shed important light on Bobby’s character. Bobby had just returned from Vietnam with one and a half legs and the Medal of Honor and was trying to sort out his physical pain and mental bitterness toward the Vietnam experience. I came back from the Nam about a year later and went almost directly into the Nebraska Senate as one ofthe youngest state senators in the United States. Bobby had been aNavy lieutenant on special duty in Vietnam with the SEALS. I had been an Army infantry captain in the south, in the Mekong Delta, on special assignment to John Paul Vann and a program called CORDS, which was run by then Deputy Ambassador to Vietnam, William E. Colby. Colby would later become head of the Central Intelligence Agency, under Presidents Nixon and Ford. I functioned as an infiltrator and analyst for CORDS, which in fact was more CIA than anything. Officially, CORDS was the pacification program. But that’s another story. One of the first things I did in Nebraska, following my return from Vietnam, was to sponsor a legislative resolution, which some viewed as a war protest, but which in reality was an attempt to open dialogue on the Vietnam War issue and to educate the politicians in the United States as to what was really occurring in Vietnam. For the first time in its lOO-yearhistory, the Nebraska Legislature voted not to allow any discussion on a resolution. It also forbade any hearing on the resolution to be held within the walls of the Nebraska State Capitol. This was how volatile this issue was back in 1971, and how adamant the elected officials in Nebraska were against anybody daring to question the propriety or value of the Vietnam War. “Yeah,” I muttered angrily, “these bastards think they can suspend the First Amendment by some vote of this legislature that effectively says the Vietnam War does not even exist. No wonder they call them hayshakers. They love to wallow in their own ignorance. Sad thing is, they might actually learn something about the Vietnam War-they might even learn to understand why there are war protests.” Don Walton bent over my desk and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:151:ef84dd7085a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5857, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 152, "text": "the propriety or value of the Vietnam War. “Yeah,” I muttered angrily, “these bastards think they can suspend the First Amendment by some vote of this legislature that effectively says the Vietnam War does not even exist. No wonder they call them hayshakers. They love to wallow in their own ignorance. Sad thing is, they might actually learn something about the Vietnam War-they might even learn to understand why there are war protests.” Don Walton bent over my desk and whispered in my ear, so no one standing around would hear. “The way I read that resolution the Legislature just passed,” Don said, “was that they were not allowing any discussion on your resolution to occur inside the walls of the State Capitol. I did not see anything in that resolution that said you could not hold a hearing outside the Capitol, on the front steps.” On the day of the hearing, the Capitol steps were barren of people, except for more law officers, undercover police, FBI agents, and CIA operatives than had ever been assembled in Nebraska at one time. The only senators who dared to come sit on the steps of the Capitol to participate in the hearing and listen to testimony were: Senator Terry Carpenter, the firebrand from Scottsbluff, who had gained national attention by nominating a non-existent “Joe Smith” for President at the Republican National Convention years ago, to mock the nomination process at conventions; Senator Ernie Chambers, who has gained state, national, and international attention for his unwavering defense of the rights of African-Americans; Senator Pol. Morgan, now Mayor Morgan of Omaha; Senator Wally Barnett, who later became Nebraska State Fire Marshall; and myself, Senator John DeCamp. It was the most moving sight of my life. There they were, several thousand people marching on the Capitol, covering the street for blocks behind the leaders. Men in wheel chairs who had lost limbs or worse in Vietnam; combat veterans who came back shattered in spirit or mind, who had been cynical about everything but afraid to express it; students from the University of Nebraska by the thousands; and businessmen and housewives by the hundreds. The event turned out to be the largest hearing ever held by the Legislature, up to that time. As ideas were shared, those who supported the war and those who opposed it, including many on both sides of the issue who had fought in it, came together for the first time and communicated. It was awesome. In 1982, when Bobby was running for governor, his participation in the event became an issue with potentially damaging political consequences. At that time, I discussed the matter with Bobby, as he sought to minimize the damage his opponent, Governor Charles Thone, was doing to him for having attended and thrown away his medal.

I remember Bobby’s pleading discussion with me in my office at the Capitol, as the issue heated up. I had publicly admired and praised him for his participation because, back in 1971, it was a sign of courage. Now Bobby pleaded, “For God’s sake, you’re killing me. Just let the issue drop. Besides, I don’t think I was even there.” He declared that he had been in Peru visiting his brother at the time of the hearing, so he could not have been there. Recently, I decided to see what records there were of that special hearing, twenty years ago, where Bobby now said he was not present. In the files of the Lincoln Journal, I found a May 6, 1971 article, which identified Congressional Medal of Honor winner Bob Kerrey as one of the main speakers at the rally. The article said, “A Nebraska native and Vietnam Congressional Medal of Honor winner, Robert Kerrey, in a prepared statement said that the ‘Viet Cong or North Vietnamese troops are angelic compared with the ruthless Americans.’” Over the next several years, we had little contact. Bobby entered the restaurant business and-with a little help from a law I helped amend, that let an individual obtain more liquor licenses than were allowed until then-began to do quite well. He became a significant personality in Lincoln, the state capital. Meanwhile, I was having more legislative success than I had dreamed possible. It is quite something, to look back at the headlines from that era, in the same World-Herald that today is trying to destroy me for defending the Franklin victims: \" ‘Gladiator’ DeCamp is Tall in Capitol Arena: Fast-Moving Senator Wields Vast Influence“-from March 26, 1978.”Kingpin or Carpenterlike, John DeCamp Wields Power in Legislature“-from April 1978; here, C. David Kotok chronicled what he called my”rise to legislative kingpin.\" My influence on events was such, said Kotok, that “The 1978 Legislature even has been dubbed ‘the DeCamp session’ by some.” The authors of those two articles, Kotok and Frank Partsch, today write most of the World-Herald’s editorials, many of which have viciously attacked me. Bobby and I next had quite a bit to do with each other in 1982, during the Nebraska gubernatorial race. I was there when the state’s leading powerbrokers anointed Bobby as the next governor, in fact it was I who suggested they anoint him.

I was there when the state’s leading powerbrokers anointed Bobby as the next governor, in fact it was I who suggested they anoint him. That is a fascinating story, but let me first give a little necessary background. Starting in the mid-1970s, a debate over the structure of Nebraska’s banking industry emerged as the issue which would dominate state politics for a decade. Officially dubbed “Multi-Bank,” the issue was a turf battle of monumental proportions, over who was going to own the banks in Nebraska, and what competition was going to be allowed in the purchase of existing banks. On the opposing side were the “Big Banks,” particularly those based in Omaha, the state’s largest city. Nebraska law forbade holding companies, which could own many banks. If holding companies were allowed, the big banks would naturally start buying up a lot of small banks-“Multi-Bank.” That was the issue. In 1976, I won the chairmanship of the Senate Banking Committee, which controlled banking, finance and insurance in Nebraska. That is, I thought I won it. I know today that I was merely the bright young legislator selected by powerful men in business and politics, to aid their efforts to change the banking structure in Nebraska. In 1978, the banking forces I supported determined that we had likely assembled enough senators in the recent election, to pass the Multi-Bank structural changes. But we had to be sure that if we passed the legislation, we could get it signed by the governor. A veto would be fatal. It was possible to get a majority of votes to pass the legislation, but electing enough senators to override a governor’s veto might take two or three elections, or forever. Accordingly, at a very private meeting between a Nebraska congressman named Charles Thone; the state’s then-premiere lobbyist, Jim Ryan; Omaha National Bank President and CEO John Woods; Omaha National Vice President Don Adams; and myself, certain agreements were reached. The meeting was held at John Woods’ personal residence in Fair Acres, Omaha, in a quiet “servants’ quarters” outside the main house. The understanding was clear, that we would work to make Charles Thone governor. And Charles Thone, who said he strongly believed in our Multi-Bank bill, gave his iron-clad pledge that he would sign it, just as soon as we could “put it on my desk.” Charlie liked being governor. Charlie was cautious. Charlie did not want to do anything that made anybody unhappy. The last thing Charlie needed after being in office for a couple of years, was to have a controversial issue on which he had to play King Solomon, which would make one or another", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:154:d337a0625d53", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5860, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 155, "text": "said he strongly believed in our Multi-Bank bill, gave his iron-clad pledge that he would sign it, just as soon as we could “put it on my desk.” Charlie liked being governor.

The last thing Charlie needed after being in office for a couple of years, was to have a controversial issue on which he had to play King Solomon, which would make one or another powerful group hate him, no matter what he did. Multi-Bank was exactly that. The two contending groups of banks financed almost all major political races in Nebraskaon both sides-for almost a decade. Politicians would pledge their support to either the Independents or to the Big Banks, led by Omaha National (later to merge with First National of Lincoln to become FirsTier), as the first step toward running for public office, particularly for the Legislature. Some politicians came to believe that they would never really have to cast a vote on the issue, because there would never be enough votes to get the bill passed. Therefore, they could promise to support Multi-Bank, without having to worry about a final vote or signature on the bill. Charles Thone was apparently one of those. As long as the bill never reached his desk, he could promise till the cows came home that he would sign the bill, but he would never be held accountable. But on a fateful day in 1980, something happened in the Legislature that nobody dreamed possible. It had never happened in the first one hundred years of Nebraska history. There was a tie vote, 24 to 24. Nebraska’s unicameral Legislature has 49 Senators, but on this day, Senator Ernie Chambers decided to sit on his hands, rather than vote for what he regarded as one bunch of evil-doers against another. Then, in an act of dubious legality, Lieutenant Governor Roland Luedtke cast the deciding ballot in favor of the Big Banks. Never before had a lieutenant governor voted on anything. Inthe next year’s legislative session, the Big Bank forces came back with guns blazing. Led by me on the floor ofthe Legislature and in the Banking Committee, we marched the legislation slowly but surely through three legislative votes and to a final showdown with Governor Thone. We had a bare majority, but nowhere near enough votes to override a governor’s veto. The facts were these: 1. That if Charlie signed the legislation he would be politically dead, because … 2.

As Charlie, we and everybody else knew, it would almost certainly be defeated, because the voting public was inclined to support the Independents. Charlie would be done for. To my suggestion that they seriously consider supporting me for Governor, the answer was unanimous. I was too controversial. I had too much political “baggage.” I would not like being governor. I was too effective as a legislator and besides, as everybody knows, except for signing bills, the Governor of Nebraska is not as powerful as independent legislators. The vocal head of the pro-life group, Senator Bernice Labedz of Omaha, was more than just another state senator and more than just another pro-life leader. She was the matriarch of the Democratic Party. She was close friends with both of Nebraska’s U.S. Senators, J. James Exon and Edward Zorinsky, for each of whom she had worked as office manager. Her support for a candidate guaranteed tens of thousands of votes. Bernice wanted to support Bobby Kerrey, but she was not going to support anybody who was not pro-life. Bobby knew he needed to do whatever he had to, to win her support. Only with Bernice on board, and with the backing ofthe Big Bankers, could Bobby do the impossible-win election as a Democratic governor, in a solidly Republican state. In the months ahead, your advice and support will be critical to my ability to provide new leadership for our State. Your courageous leadership in advancing respect for human life, promoting a strong family and a decent society, has been an inspiration to me as well as thousands of our fellow Nebraskans. Since becoming a candidate for Governor, I have consistently stated my opposition to abortion. As recently as May 14, 1982, in both the Omaha World-Herald and the Lincoln Journal, I stated, “I find abortion to be morally repugnant.” It was in the Omaha World-Herald on May 14, 1982, that I also stated clearly that my position was not “pro-choice.” I believe there are many important challenges that face us over the next few years. Reducing the number of abortions in our State and working with you toward the elimination of the need for even a single abortion will be of a highest priority. I am confident working in partnership with you in the years ahead will be one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.

Bobby’s first substantive act in his presidential campaign was to repeat a pattern I had seen during the years I worked with him. He repudiated everything he had previously said on the subject of abortion, acknowledged that he had been essentially fibbing in his pro-life statements, and admitted that he had given the previous false commitments purely for the purpose of getting elected. Campaigning in New Hampshire, Kerrey was quoted in the October 17,1991 World-Herald, regarding his letter to Senator Labedz: “It was a political act, yeah, and an act about which I feel very little pride…. The whole issue of not just abortion but many of the other emotional issues in 1982 were extremely difficult. I didn’t know what public policy was for certain, should be for certain, and-as a result-I was all over the map.” The Multi-Bank legislation was not Governor Robert Kerrey’s only foray into state banking law. In 1983-84, the state’s banks were experiencing severe problems. In the summer of 1984, Kerrey called a special legislative session to deal with these problems, but specified that it would not deal with the most notorious of them, Commonwealth, whose collapse he himself had precipitated with his infamous press statement of October 31, 1983. Kerrey’s new proposal was for a special form of interstate banking, in which only one out-of-state banking group would be allowed to take over Nebraska financial institutions. It would be arranged so that this single out-of-state group, a Coloradobased combine with which Kerrey’s associates were secretly working, would quietly take over Commonwealth and State Security, in return for the interstate banking monopoly. I met with Bobby. We talked intensely. I made clear that I would support a competitive and reciprocal interstate banking proposal, which I thought would help all Nebraskans, not one that would be used to bail out individuals involved in what I felt was corruption. I mentioned for the first time to him, face to face, the role of his friend and adviser Bill Wright. When we ended our discussion, I thought Bobby would abandon his idea, and accept an interstate banking proposal along my lines. A legitimate interstate bank bill, however, could not be used by Bobby and his friends for their personal purposes, related to Commonwealth and State Security. From that standpoint, Kerrey, directed by Bill Wright, had to push through his peculiar form of interstate banking. They had their votes lined up. It required 25 of the 49 to pass the legislation. Most senators knew less about the legislation than a sow knows about Sunday.

Most senators knew less about the legislation than a sow knows about Sunday. But by using the most traditional political methods, carrot and stick, the Kerrey adminstration had gotten commitments from twenty-six senators. They were ready to roll. Roll they did, using the most powerful lobbyists and the heaviest pressure the administration could put on. Through a technicality, I was able to stop them dead in their tracks. I invoked a procedural ruling, which forced them to have thirty votes to ever get to a vote on the bill itself. They had twentysix votes, not thirty. Bobby was angry. I thought for a minute. Bobby was riding as high as any governor ever had in Nebraska. Movie star Debra Winger was now living in the mansion with him part time. All Nebraska was in love with Bobby and Debby. Camelot was here, and Nebraskans were lapping it up. There were pictures of Bobby fluffing up a pillow, smiling and saying, “Just fluff up your pillow and dream about it”-his response when asked what it was like to date Debra Winger. Later, when I returned to Lincoln from Dallas, I learned from a close friend of mine and of Bobby, a prominent lobbyist, that immediately after the legislative vote in which I stopped his banking proposal, Bobby stormed out of the Governor’s office and down to the doors just outside the Legislature, where he yelled out a threat: When I was an infantry captain in Vietnam, the phrase “dead meat” was well known. It was what a soldier, usually an enlisted man, threatened an officer with just before “fragging” him. “Fragging” was a live grenade tossed into the tent, living quarters, or restroom facility of another soldier, most commonly an officer. Live grenades usually kill or maim people. Bobby knew that. His foot was most probably blown off by a live grenade that either the enemy threw or, as he himself has indicated, one of his own men accidentally dropped near him. Originally no one dreamed Bobby would be recommended for a Medal of Honor. Recently disclosed records show that as the Pentagon attempted to “popularize” the war, the word came down to create more heroes, to recommend more wounded for medals. Since there were more places to fill on the list, Bobby’s name suddenly popped onto the bottom of it. This may be a crude way of putting things, but since the Medal of Honor is being cited by the press as the apparent best evidence of Bobby’s qualifications to be President, it is legitimate to discuss", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:158:daf21a9dc425", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5864, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 159, "text": "show that as the Pentagon attempted to “popularize” the war, the word came down to create more heroes, to recommend more wounded for medals.

This may be a crude way of putting things, but since the Medal of Honor is being cited by the press as the apparent best evidence of Bobby’s qualifications to be President, it is legitimate to discuss it. And I do not think Bobby would deny this. In 1984, Bobby knew that this lobbyist would deliver the message that I was “dead meat,” which he did. It occurred to me that I might be dealing with an emotionally disturbed individual. I had no doubts, as to how important the legislation was to help bailout and cover up the State Security scandal, in which Bobby and his friend Bill Wright were involved. And I knew how detrimental such legislation would be to the rest of Nebraska’s million and a half citizens. “As far as I am concerned,” I told Bobby, “I have no reason to go after you. You have already been hurt enough, by having to drop out of the Governor’s race. I have no reason to pick on you, because it was really Bill Wright who masterminded the State Security swindle, though you obviously played a role in it. I am not out to hurt you. We both have been hurt enough and blamed enough.” “Bobby,” I said, “I told you before that I think State Security was one terrible scandal, with thousands of victims. I believe absolutely Commonwealth was a cover-up for State Security. But I don’t think you were the main perpetrator of it. Sometimes we can be the victim of our own friends,” I told him, somewhat charitably. get in so deep before we even know it, just a degree at a time, trying to help this guy or protect that one from embarrassment. That’s what got Nixon in Watergate … trying to protect his friends. I truly believe Nixon did not know what the blazes was going on, but he was already in so deep, he had to take the fall for all the others because he was the ‘officer in charge.’ Then I was pressured and begged, by the highest elected and unelected officials of the Republican Party in Nebraska, to “trash” Kerrey during his U.S. Senate race, by making public everything I knew about him. Governor Kay Orr herself appealed to me to speak out. I refused, not just once, but again and again. With hindsight, I believe I should not have stayed silent.

Ultimately, someone hired a writer named Jack Hart, to go through the records of my legislative investigation and write a series of articles to establish the extent of the Commonwealth! State Security scandal and the culpability of Robert Kerrey. Hart’s articles were essentially accurate, as far as they went, and I have quoted from them in Chapter 6. Because too much is at stake. Patterns associated with Kerrey from his earliest days in public life, which were accentuated in the Commonwealth/State Security affairs, are being repeated now in the Franklin matter, and have the possibility of being amplified onto the national level, if Robert Kerrey became President. 1. Abuse of public positions for one’s own financial benefit. This is an invariant of Kerrey’ s career, from his first appearance in student politics at the University of Nebraska in 1964-65, where he was censured by the Student Council for pocketing profits from a Student Council program he was in charge of. We saw the same thing again in Commonwealth/State Security and the NIFA loan scam. 2. Shifting political position 180 degrees with the prevailing winds. When it was fashionable to be against the Vietnam War, Kerrey led the parade. When it became a political liability, he chucked his opposition overboard, and lied about it. When he needed votes and he could get them by denouncing abortion, he did so. When he thought the best way to get votes was to be pro-abortion, he embraced that position. In the lead-up to the Gulf war, Bobby was strongly against it. When it was clear that the war was popular, Bobby decided he had been “uninformed” before and switched his stance. While governor, he danced to the tune called by them and by Bill Wright. Today he is controlled by a small circle which includes: John Gottschalk, publisher, Omaha World-Herald, and Kerrey business partner; William Wright, the individual who milked State Security’s depositors of millions; Joe R. Seacrest, owner and publisher, Lincoln Journal newspaper; Bill Hoppner, his Chief of Staff who was effectively governor during the first years of Kerrey’s administration, until he left the state to go work for Bill Wright in California; and Warren Buffett, billionaire from Omaha and the new CEO of Salomon Brothers. These are the men who will tell Bobby when to open his mouth, and what to say, so much so that I will make a prediction: Look for Bobby to start taking stands for population control. His financial angel Warren Buffett is a fanatic on the issue, and funds the most radical population reduction groups in the country. 4.

His financial angel Warren Buffett is a fanatic on the issue, and funds the most radical population reduction groups in the country. 4. Operating with the protection of a corrupt press. The press can tum truth into falsehood, and lies into truth-such is its power in Nebraska, and also nationally. The media should be the ultimate check and balance of our other institutions of government in this country. Three times in my short life-the McCarthy era, Watergate, and Iran-Contra-it was the press that finally exposed the truth and kept our Constitutional system of government in place, rather than the institutions of government themselves that are assigned that purpose. In the case of Commonwealth and State Security, Robert Kerrey had a relationship with the two major news sources in Nebraska, the Omaha World-Herald and the Lincoln Journal, that guaranteed presentation of a distorted and false picture of Commonwealth and State Security. His personal and business relationships with the owners and publishers of the Lincoln Journal guaranteed that truth would be sacrificed to convenience. And his business and personal relationship today with the World-Herald publisher guarantees even more certainly that same result from the World-Herald. Lest anyone doubt the latter, consider the “open mike” inci­ dent of November 1991. Kerrey found himself on a podium in New Hampshire, sitting next to fellow-candidate Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Not realizing a microphone was on, he told Clinton a dirty joke that was offensive to lesbians and homosexuals, whom he has otherwise supported. Some of the nation’s press attacked him for his crudity. But here is how the World-Herald, run by his business partner Jack Gottschalk, covered it in an editorial entitled “Kerrey, Too, Deserves Apology.” Bob Kerrey is right when he says he shouldn’t have repeated the crude story he told Bill Clinton in a private conversation in New Hampshire. Nonetheless, it would be unjust if this stupid, minor, blown-out-of-proportion incident were to hurt Kerrey’s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. The World-Herald gave a tortured argument, that Kerrey was only telling Clinton the joke as an example of jokes which should not be told. At that, I had to laugh, because of a sense of deja vu. It was one unforgettable thing about politicians close to the Kerrey administration, that they habitually used a dirty or racial joke to open a conversation. Bill Hoppner, now chairman of Kerrey’s presidential campaign, was the master of masters, when it came to telling the raunchiest sexist or ethnic joke.

And this particular joke, Bobby Kerrey himself told years before, only then he used my name instead of Jerry Brown’s! Everybody suspected-but now we know, don’t we? It really was the World-Herald directing the Franklin Grand Jury. For doubters, read the 20 November 1991 editorial titled, “Kerrey, Too, Deserves Apology.” That’s right, Bob Kerrey tells dirty jokes about lesbians, and gets caught. Immediately, the World-Herald decides that Bob Kerrey is the victim because the evil people dared to catch him committing his dirty joke routine. As I told People magazine in their November 25, 1991 profile of the candidate, Bob Kerrey has a magical ability, to make s— smell like apple butter. Charisma? He has more than anyone I have known. I think he imitates Jack Kennedy even better than Jack Kennedy at times, in the way he speaks and smiles. I have seen Robert Kerrey resort more brilliantly, successfully, and often than any other politician, to what I call the Pre-emptive First Strike Confession. If you are about to be compromised or tarnished by your own record, act swiftly, before a scandal develops. Make a tearful confession to a friendly press conduit about your “youthful indiscretion” or your “regrettable shortsightedness.” Take something that could and maybe should destroy you politically, and tum it into an asset. When Bobby needed to clean up his image on banking matters in order to attack George Bush’s handling of the S&L crisis, he staged a confession to Kotok of the World-Herald, that yes, perhaps, being new to politics and all, he had relied a tad too much on the advice of Bill Wright in the Commonwealth/State Security affair. Was he killed because of his involvement in Franklin? I don’t know. What I do know, is that Bill Colby was the heart and soul of the Franklin investigation. Although at a certain point he warned me against investigating the case further, it was he who relentlessly pushed to publicly expose what had already been discovered, when everyone else, including, at times, myself, wanted to call it quits. Without him, this book would never have been written. In the new, final chapter of this second edition, I tell much more about my relationship to Bill Colby, who was, in my estimation, one of the greatest patriots this country has seen, from the time that he served as our country’s Deputy Ambassador to South Vietnam (but, in reality, as CIA Station Chief), and recruited a young combat infantry captain", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:162:34523da47df3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5868, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 163, "text": "else, including, at times, myself, wanted to call it quits.

Your best interest,” he argued, “may well be in publishing what you know and are able to prove, rather than keeping those facts secret. Whether you ever sell a single book or not does not really matter. Putting your information on the public record is what is important. That way, there is no logical reason to harm you or your family, to suppress some truth you have already documented. That is probably your real life insurance policy in something like this Franklin situation,” Colby had advised me. Now, four years later, without a single dollar spent in advertising or promotion, over 50,000 copies of this book have been sold nationwide. I am convinced that this is why I am alive today, although I did receive a warning in September 1996, through reliable sources, that I am targeted-i-vjust like they got Colby.\" There have also been innumerable attempts to disbar me. Although I have thus far been able to defeat every one of these attempts, they keep coming; to silence me through disbarment is, for those trying to hide the truth on Franklin, the equivalent of assassinating me. So, the battle continues, both in the Franklin case per se-about which I include stunning new material which proves the truth of Part I of this bookand in the new cases in which I have become involved. As a result of the first publication of The Franklin Cover-Up, as an attorney, I have become involved in some of the most famous legal cases now occurring in these United States, from cases involving the militia movement, to the Oklahoma City bombing, to the notorious Gordon Kahl shootout with U.S. Marshals, about which documentaries and movies have been made, to appearances before the U.S. Senate on all of these matters, including Ruby Ridge and Waco. I have appeared on all of the national TV networks, and on many national shows, such as Nightline with Ted Koppel, Good Morning America, CNN’s Burden of Proof, America’s Most Wanted, and others.

So, I say, as I dedicate this second edition of The Franklin Cover-Up to my friend and mentor, William Colby: “Thanks, Bill. You were right, so right it terrifies me. I told the truth, just as you instructed. Now, as a result of the publication of the original Franklin Cover-Up, I have ended up in situations, where, once again, the truth must be told on some explosive new issues, whose consequences rival those of Franklin, for the future of this country.” Thus, this new edition contains eight dramatic new chapters (and an epilogue): The Franklin Investigation, and Cover-up, Continue; Four Years Later-Where Are They Now?; Troy Boner Steps Forward; Drugs and the Monarch Project; From Montana to Oklahoma City; The Oklahoma Bombing; The U.S. Justice Department Murder of Gordon Kahl; and InMemoriam: Bill Colby. This concluding chapter will reveal more about Colby’s role in Franklin, and his very last instructions to me, two weeks before his death. Finally, the last word on the Franklin cover-up is delivered in the epilogue-not by me, but by the nineteenth-century novelist Herman Melville. Besides his famous Moby Dick, Melville wrote short stories. A high-ranking personage involved in the Franklin case, told me that one of these stories contained the ultimate secret behind the Franklin cover-up. When the first printing of what you have just read appeared in May 1992, I was threatened with countless law suits by individuals named in the book. I was told by their attorneys, from some of the most prominent law firms in the state and in the country, that “We will destroy you in court.” As it turned out, although there have been numerous attempts to disbar me, only one law suit for libel and slander was ever launched as a direct result of the book-and that was a suit I launched and won, as I will relate. “This book is the most libelous and slanderous book I have ever read. The individuals who have been slandered in this book will definitely be filing legal actions to stop distribution of this book and against Mr. John DeCamp personally. That is certain. This book will be stopped and Mr. DeCamp will be proved to be a liar and made to pay damages.” “I agree with certain things these people and their attorneys attacking me are saying. I agree that the things described in this book are horrible.

I agree that the things described in this book are horrible. If anyone had said these things about me, I agree that I would sue them. I believe if there is anything false in this book or if they believe I have not told the truth in this book, that they should sue me. In fact, I welcome their law suits, because that will help develop the truth. I personally believe I have been most careful and cautious in the way I have handled matters, and only written about those things I can absolutely document.” The only major lawsuit for libel and slander arising from this book was my suit against Atlantic Telecast, owner of a television station in Wilmington, North Carolina, WECT (Channel 6). I charged that statements made on a WECT news broadcast on November 12, 1992, attacking me and the book, were false. I demanded a retraction and public apology. WECT’s attorney further advised me that the station had investigated, in part, by talking to U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska, who was running for president of the United States at the time, and who had visited Wilmington, and met with representatives of the TV station. Further investigation, he claimed, was conducted by talking to the new Wilmington police chief, a man named Robert Wadman-the former police chief of Omaha, Nebraska, who had come to Wilmington in the early 1990s! After hearing this, I gave a simple demand to WECT: “Rest assured I am ready to prove everything I wrote in my book. I hope you are ready and able to prove your claims made on TV. I give you three weeks for further investigation, and then I will move forward aggressively on my lawsuit against you. At that time, I will seek not only an apology, but substantial monetary damages.” Shortly thereafter, a settlement agreement was reached which stipulated: (l) WECT TV would broadcast a retraction and public apology to me on its news broadcasts, and would issue a press release to the same effect; (2) WECT would pay me money damages and other financial benefits; (3) All other details of the settlement, other than those stated above, would be kept confidential for the benefit of the TV station.

My lawsuit intersected a fierce political battle between Chief Wadman, upon whom WECT had relied for its information, and his own police department, particularly with an officer named Sgt. Robert Clatty. Sgt. Clatty is the Wilmington Police Department’s expert on satanic ritual abuse of children, and is one of North Carolina’s recognized experts as well, with published works on the subject. Chief Wadman, on the other hand, claimed that there was no such thing as satanic ritual abuse; he attempted to make it impossible for Sgt. Clatty to carry out his work, and, at one point, suspended him. The publicly waged war between Chief Wadman and his wide array of defenders in Wilmington and across North Carolina, and Wadman’s adversaries, led primarily by Officer Clatty, went as high as the State Legislature. From 1992 until roughly mid-1994, it divided the city of Wilmington, and even the state of North Carolina. The outcome of the war between Chief Wadman and his own force was that in early July 1994, a secret meeting was held with city officials and Wadman’s attorney. On July II, 1994, Wadman resigned as police chief. Although city officials refused to comment on what had transpired in the meeting, Wadman himself admitted in a television interview later that month, that he had been ordered to resign from the Wilmington Police Department. In May 1992, shortly after the first edition of this book was published, Monsignor Robert Hupp, who had been the head of Boys Town from the late 1970s through the decade of the 1980s-the critical time in question for the Franklin case, contacted me and asked to have a meeting, at which he specified that witnesses must be present. I anticipated that his purpose was to attack me, and to deny what I had written about Boys Town. When I asked Monsignor Hupp how this ever could have happened at Boys Town, he looked at me and told me, so apologetically, “I am like the wife who did not know, and was the last to find out. And when I finally did suspect something and tried to act, the Archbishop [Daniel Sheehan] elected to do nothing about it, when I asked him to help. And then, when I came upon something horribly evil, I found public officials and the Church would do nothing-apparently terrified at the damage it would do to the Church and to the entire city of Omaha,” Monsignor Hupp said. He then described an incident in 1985, in which a young boy named Shattuck, who lived in Elkhorn, Nebraska, had been sexually abused and then killed. The Monsignor told me that he was certain who had killed the boy, a man he identified as", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:166:1bdc4e6aae06", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5872, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 167, "text": "I came upon something horribly evil, I found public officials and the Church would do nothing-apparently terrified at the damage it would do to the Church and to the entire city of Omaha,” Monsignor Hupp said. He then described an incident in 1985, in which a young boy named Shattuck, who lived in Elkhorn, Nebraska, had been sexually abused and then killed. The Monsignor told me that he was certain who had killed the boy, a man he identified as a member of the Catholic clergy in the Omaha Archdiocese. Monsignor Hupp provided precise detail which he said proved beyond any doubt, that the particular individual he named was, in fact, the child’s murderer. “The Church is plagued by these sexual abuse problems across the country and by the devastating publicity the clergy abuse incidents have caused,” Monsignor Hupp explained. “The Church’s reaction to these sexual abuse problems is, in most cases, to immediately get the clergy member involved out of the state and, if possible, out of the country, and hopefully into treatment. I know that may not be right, but it is a difficult situation to deal with, and simply moving the priest or the brother out of the state or country has been the traditional approach by the Church in America to addressing the problems. In this case, where an innocent child was murdered and where 1 know that a member of our clergy has done this, I felt I had a moral obligation overriding all other things, to bring the situation to the attention of the appropriate authorities. And I did,” Hupp concluded. So, what happened as a result of Monsignor Hupp’s actions? Apparently, nothing. Each year on the anniversary of the child’s murder -now almost ten years-the media talks about the case as being “under investigation,” and street rumors persist Γ_(Q)koout the Catholic clergyman-the one Monsignor Hupp h .ielieves killed the child-who was shipped out of state for treatment right after the murder. Shortly after that discussion, in a controversy that received national press attention on how resources should be used at Boys Town, Monsignor Hupp was removed from his post. He now lives quietly in a home in West Omaha, Nebraska. Monsignor Hupp has shown incredible courage, as he has continued to provide me direction and assistance in the Franklin investigation and related matters. Monsignor Hupp is not some 13-year-old kid whom the cops say they cannot trust or believe. On the contrary, he is one of America’s most famous and nationally honored clergymen; the author of two best sellers; a former Presidential Appointee as Special Ambassador to the United Nations; and the former head of America’s most famous child care institution (Boys Town).

In mid-1993, after The Franklin Cover- Up had been circulating for almost a year, the British-based TV station, Yorkshire Television, sent a top-notch team to Nebraska to launch its own investigation of the Franklin case. Yorkshire had a contract with the Discovery Channel to produce a documentary on the case for American television. They spent many months in Nebraska, and also traveled this country from one end to the other, interviewing, filming, and documenting piece-by-piece the Franklin story as I had told it in the book. They spent somewhere between a quarter-million and one-half million dollars investigating the story, deploying probably a thousand times the resources and abilities that I personally had. Over the year that I worked with them, I was amazed at team’s ability to gather new documents and witnesses which kept opening up new and frightening facts about Franklin. They were a crack team. In the final weeks that they were in Nebraska, they expressed their certainty that they would win awards for this documented horror story of government-sanctioned drugrunning involving children; government-sanctioned abuse of children; and government protection of some of this country’s most powerful businessmen and politicians, who had been the chief actors in the Franklin story. Finally, the big day came. Their documentary was to air nationwide on the Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994. It was advertised in the TV Guide and in newspapers for that day. But no one ever saw that program. At the last minute, and without explanation, it was pulled from the air. It was not shown then, and has never been broadcast anywhere since. For instance, the team had interviewed Troy Boner. Sometime after that grand jury was over, Troy, guilt-stricken because of his lying over Gary Caradori’s death, contacted me and told the truth about what had happened. This is recorded in a remarkable affidavit (see Chapter 20). The Yorkshire TV team spent a small fortune to confirm Troy’s charges. They flew Troy to Chicago and paid for a lengthy polygraph (lie detector) test at the Keeler Polygraph Institute. With the results of that test, the Yorkshire team was so convinced that Troy was telling the truth, that they featured him in their documentary. 1. At the time the Yorkshire TV team and the Discovery Channel were doing the documentary, they had no idea how high up the case would go into Government, and what major institutions and personalities in this country, would be found to be linked to the Franklin story.

Ultimately, the documentary focused on several limited aspects documented in this book, and developed them much more extensively than I ever had the resources or abilities to accomplish. 2. These areas which the documentary focused on, were: (a) the use and involvement of Boys Town children and personalities in the Franklin Scandal, particularly Peter Citron and Larry King’s relationships to Boys Town; (b) the linkage of Franklin to some of this country’s top politicians in Washington, and in the U.S. Congress, with particular attention on those who attended parties held by Larry King at his Washington mansion on Embassy Row; (c) the impropriety of these politicians and businessmen and compromising of these people by Larry King, through drugs and using children for pedophilia. 3. When the broadcast tape was sent to the United States, Customs officials seized the documentary and held it up as being “pornographic material.” Attorneys for Discovery Channel and Yorkshire TV were able to get the documentary released. Then, the lawyers went through the film for months, making this or that change or deletion, so that the documentary ultimately advertised to be shown on the Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994, would survive any claims of libel or slander that any of the individuals identified in the documentary might attempt to bring. The lawyers had cleared the documentary for broadcast. 4. During the several months that the documentary was being prepared and advertised for showing, major legislation impacting the entire future of the Cable TV industry was being debated on Capitol Hill. Legislation, which the industry opposed, was under debate for placing controls on the industry and the contents of what could be shown. Messages were delivered in no uncertain terms from key politicians involved in the Cable TV battle, that if the Conspiracy of Silence were shown on the Discovery Channel as planned, then the industry would probably lose the debate. An agreement was reached: Conspiracy of Silence was pulled, and with no rights for sale or broadcast by any other program; Yorkshire TV would be reimbursed for the costs of production; the Discovery Channel itself would never be linked to the documentary; and copies of Conspiracy in Silence would be destroyed. “As essential to Franklin as [Harold] Andersen’s fundraising and publicity were, the credit union could not have functioned for a single day without the complicity of Nebraska’s largest bank, FirsTier ….

Every dollar that went into Franklin Credit Union-the missing $40 million was no exception-went into its account #153-7-353 at FirsTier.” In October 1994, evidence released through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) proved exactly how right I was. These FOIA documents showed that some of the same attorneys who had threatened so loudly to sue me, together with the FirsTier Bank with which they were associated, had reached a financial settlement with the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), in which they agreed to pay the NCUA $10 million in damages for their role in improprieties involving Franklin. The attorneys had to come up with over $6 million, and First Tier itself, over $3 million. Despite the fact that the FirsTier case was the biggest malpractice settlement in the history of Nebraska, and despite the fact that the settlement involved very prominent individualsincluding former Republican Governor Charlie Thone and attorney Jay Derr-the story received almost no coverage in the press, that is, before the FOIA material became public. Then, the World Herald jumped in with a huge editorial in October “Some defendants, including banks and a law firm, have agreed to pay more than $10 million to the NCUA to settle the claims. They admitted no wrongdoing. They said they acted to avoid prolonged litigation. Their position is understandable. Litigation is expensive. Moreover, this particular litigation ran the risk of creating a false impression. … The impression could have taken hold that a wide circle of legal and financial advisers sat on the knowledge that King was looting the credit union…. Such an impression would have been false.” There was, indeed, “a wide circle of legal and financial advisers” in on the looting of Franklin, just as I had charged, and whom I name in Chapter 12, “The Omaha Business Community.” Finally, some of them, at least, had to pay for it. Nor was this the only multi-million dollar scam to be exposed in the wake of the first edition of this book. In Chapter 6, I described another big money scheme that intersected the Franklin case-the looting of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, in which I filed a claim on behalf of the Commonwealth victims. To my surprise and joy, I succeeded beyond all my expectations in this case-until a strained interpretation of our state Constitution was put forward by Nebraska’s Supreme Court. Then, the matter was taken to court by certain unnamed individuals (concerned citizens), who claimed that they did not want their tax money used to pay", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:170:d96bfc77a3ff", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5876, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 171, "text": "big money scheme that intersected the Franklin case-the looting of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, in which I filed a claim on behalf of the Commonwealth victims.

Then, the matter was taken to court by certain unnamed individuals (concerned citizens), who claimed that they did not want their tax money used to pay these Commonwealth victims. Nebraska has a unique section in its State Constitution which forbids the state from using any tax dollars for purposes of extending the credit of the state or granting a gift. The result: that which the Claims Board, and the Legislature and the Governor all agreed the Commonwealth Savings Bank victims were entitled to because of the failures of the Government in Commonwealth, was taken away by the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska. The Court claimed that Nebraska’s Constitution forbids paying the money to the victims, because they were only victims of moral wrongdoing, rather than legal wrongdoing. And John DeCamp, who would have become a multi-millionaire out of the case because I had done it on a contingent fee basis, ended up with nothing but the certain knowledge that I had established the truth as I have written in this book with respect to Commonwealth Savings Bank and certain of the personalities who are today so prominent on the national scene-Senator Bobby Kerrey, for example. Besides Yorkshire TV, the most notable among the electronic media which became interested in the Franklin story was the TV program, America’s Most Wanted (AMW). In several episodes, AMW opened up a whole new dimension on just how high up politically the story went and how wide it reached across the country. For instance, a young boy named “Jimmy” who had been branded by pedophile perpetrators-like you would brand a steer with a hot iron-cautiously came forward to a nationally broadcast request by and verified many of the events Paul had described, including a secret hiding place for concealing children located in Colorado, precisely as Paul had said. Investigation by AMW in preparing subsequent episodes of the program, began turning over more and more rocks, providing still more proof of the story told by Alisha Owen and by the other victim-witnesses. AMW even featured a one-hour special on one of the most important kidnappings on which Bonacci had given details, that of Johnny Gosch, the Des Moines, Iowa, newspaper boy who had disappeared a dozen years ago. Gosch’s parents, John and Noreen, had repeatedly met with Bonacci and become convinced of the truth of Paul’s description of the kidnapping and of Paul’s own participation in it. At a press conference reported in the World Herald April 7, 1992, John and Noreen Gosch had declared: “Paul (Bonacci) told my wife", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:171:aa5e3c8fdeb0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5877, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 172, "text": "of the most important kidnappings on which Bonacci had given details, that of Johnny Gosch, the Des Moines, Iowa, newspaper boy who had disappeared a dozen years ago.

At a press conference reported in the World Herald April 7, 1992, John and Noreen Gosch had declared: “Paul (Bonacci) told my wife and I things that we’ve never told anybody.” “We are going to slow it down a bit on the Franklin story,” Sparrow told me, “until you can get a break in the courts or get some responsible law enforcement to follow up some of the leads we have provided them. I don’t know how to exactly say this, but I am beginning to understand what you are up against when it comes to certain law enforcement not wanting to pursue this story,” Sparrow continued. “Well,” Sparrow continued, “you must be aware of the fact that America’s Most Wanted works extremely close with the FBI. In fact, without them we would not really be able to have a program. We really have never had any major disagreements in all our programming because we can’t afford to. Our success requires their cooperation and we are a tremendous benefit to them, which they could get nowhere else. But we are running into some severe problems on this Franklin thing. It is the first time that the FBI is refusing to cooperate. And, they are making it very clear that they want us off of this story- particularly anything to do with the FBI.” As I told Paul several weeks later, “You have done a tremendous service for this country in the work you did on the Franklin case, on its nationwide links and on its drug dealing and political implications, and particularly, by proving so many of the things in question, including even arranging to have Paul Bonacci polygraphed by some of the nation’s best experts to prove his truthfulness. I full well understand your sensitive situation and your relationship with the FBI and the problems this entire case causes for you, because the essence of Paul Bonacci and the children’s claims is that the FBI, for whatever reasons, is refusing to do anything about this case and is itself part of the cover-up.” I told Paul Sparrow that I accepted his definition of his duty: to provide an entertainment program to the American public; that requires the complete cooperation of the FBI, rather than an adversarial relationship. I have continued to maintain contact with Paul Sparrow and America’s Most Wanted, and maintain the highest admiration for Paul and his work. But he has done his job.

I have continued to maintain contact with Paul Sparrow and America’s Most Wanted, and maintain the highest admiration for Paul and his work. But he has done his job. Now, it is up to myself and other Americans, and particularly law enforcement, who had the opportunity to see the America’s Most Wanted programs, to do something about it. AMWhad turned up boatloads of new evidence on the Franklin case, and on the kidnapping of Johnny Gosch. The FBI, in response to this new evidence, officially stated that Alisha Owen was a convicted liar, and that Paul Bonacci was a convicted child molester. Their response to the October 1993 requests of Troy Boner and his mother to join the Federal Witness Protection Program, so they could safely provide further evidence on Troy’s affidavit statement, was to not only deny the request but to threaten Troy with prosecution on charges of perjury, if he attempted to change the fabricated story that had helped convict Alisha Owen. Still another revelation confirming the Franklin story surfaced with the apparent forced retirement of FBI head William Sessions in 1994. In Chapter 14, “Cover-up Phase III: The FBI,” I discussed the case of the African-American FBI agent Donald Rochon in Omaha. Rochon had alleged, in his lawsuit against the FBI, that, in addition to harassing him, FBI agents in the Omaha office were involved in all sorts of sexual perversions, and these same agents were also “investigating” homosexual prostitution rings involving Boys Town. As I had reported, it was only a matter of time until Rochon discoveredif he had not done so already-that his FBI tormentors were deeply involved in the Franklin affair itself. The FBI agreed to settle Rochon’s suit by paying him $1 million, and to reimburse his legal expenses of $500, 000 . Later, in 1994, when the press was hounding Sessions as to what, if anything, he had done during his term as FBI Director, Judge Sessions defended himself by recalling his “successful” handling of the law suit of the former FBI agent Donald Rochon, which, he said, he had been able to settle, without it damaging the FBI. Sessions said that the horrible allegations Rochon had made in his lawsuit were in fact true, and that a public trial would have damaged the Bureau. He, Sessions, had prevented this disaster by settling out of court. In Chapter 14, “Cover-up Phase III: The FBI,” I reported how, in October 1989, John Stevens Berry, counsel for the State Senate Franklin Committee grilled Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman as to why the Omaha Police Department was dismissing the reports by child victim-witnesses of horrific abuse, and of other crimes.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:173:6e70c9f087cd", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5879, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 174, "text": "made in his lawsuit were in fact true, and that a public trial would have damaged the Bureau.

Wadman replied: Now, four years later, I am even more certain of these charges. Not only has information continued to pour in on the Franklin case which strengthens me in that conviction, and not only has the Justice Department turned its back on a high-level request to re-examine the whole Franklin case (see Chapter 25), but, in case after notorious case entirely unrelated to Franklin, Justice Department personnel appear as liars, perverts, frameup artists, and even-assassins. An increasing number of citizens view the United States government with suspicion, even hatred. Though there are no doubt other branches of the government where corruption flourishes, there is no question in my mind that the stench of evil which emanates from Washington, originates in the socalled Department of Justice, particularly in its permanent bureaucracy. I have documented that case with respect to the Franklin cover-up, and the average citizen may have become aware of it in the massacre at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in August 1992, where it is now generally acknowledged that the Justice Department, through its FBI marksmen, murdered the 14-yearold son and wife of Randy Weaver. The same thing happened in Waco, Texas in 1993, when the Justice Department directed the slaughter of 86 people, based on false reports from “informants” out of Melbourne, Australia, associated with the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith. I think by now, although the major news media alternately blacks him out, or slanders him, most people in the country know something about the economist and several-time Democratic Party presidential candidate, Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. After all, he did get a very respectable 600,000 votes in the Democratic presidential primaries in 1996, averaging 10% or more of the vote in each state in which he ran. And, while people may have heard that he is a “convicted felon,” they probably have no idea of what actually happened. On December 16, 1988, Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. and six co-defendants were convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, eleven counts of mail fraud, in the alleged amount of $294, 000 in unrepaid loans; LaRouche was convicted on one additional charge, of attempting to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. LaRouche was then 66 years old; it was obvious that the very harsh sentence of 15 years he was given, meant that the Justice Department intended for him to die in jail. In 1991, I first had a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:174:63d6ad6deb75", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5880, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 175, "text": "co-defendants were convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, eleven counts of mail fraud, in the alleged amount of $294, 000 in unrepaid loans; LaRouche was convicted on one additional charge, of attempting to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. LaRouche was then 66 years old; it was obvious that the very harsh sentence of 15 years he was given, meant that the Justice Department intended for him to die in jail. In 1991, I first had a chance to examine a small portion of the six volumes of evidence his attorneys filed with the court, proving his innocence. I must say, notwithstanding all that I had already been through on the Franklin case, I was shocked-no, “stunned” is a better word-by what I read. I remember saying to colleagues at the time, “Oh, my God, if they can do this to LaRouche, who is a well-known, if controversial, political figure, in this blatant way, there is no one in the country that they won’t simply frame up.” The U.S. Justice Department had not a shadow of “evidence” to convict LaRouche, nor any of his associates, one of whom, Michael Billington, was sent to jail in Virginia for 77 years! In fact, the evidence showed-in the government’s own documents released under the Freedom of Information Act-as LaRouche’s attorneys contended, that “The U.S. government knew at all relevant times, from 1979 to the present day, that Lyndon LaRouche and his co-defendants were innocent of the false charges for which they were convicted.” The only crimes committed in the “LaRouche case” were the massive illegalities of the U.S. Department of Justice in their zeal to remove LaRouche from the political life of this country. It later turned out, as LaRouche’s associates found out from FOIA appeals, that LaRouche’s latest troubles started when his longtime political enemy, Henry Kissinger, wrote a letter in 1982 to then-FBI director William Webster, asking Webster to go after LaRouche. But, already back in 1973, as other FOIA documents from the FBI’s own files showed, the FBI had authorized the Communist Party of the United States (which it basically ran, through its “informants”) to “eliminate” LaRouche-that is, to kill him outright. I was not the only one to get a whiff of a big-time frameup. Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, with whom I had had some contact during the Franklin case, and who was LaRouche’s appeals lawyer, wrote a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, in which he said, “I believe it the LaRouche case involves a broader range of deliberate and systematic misconduct and abuse of power over a longer period of time in an effort to destroy a political movement and leader, than any other federal prosecution in my time or to my knowledge.” And, as of August 1996, 721 U.S. state legislators (and thousands more federal parliamentarians and other dignitaries around the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:175:1933e37c034a", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5881, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 176, "text": "appeals lawyer, wrote a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, in which he said, “I believe it the LaRouche case involves a broader range of deliberate and systematic misconduct and abuse of power over a longer period of time in an effort to destroy a political movement and leader, than any other federal prosecution in my time or to my knowledge.” And, as of August 1996, 721 U.S. state legislators (and thousands more federal parliamentarians and other dignitaries around the world) had signed an open letter calling for the exoneration of LaRouche which denounced, in no uncertain terms, his frame-up. LaRouche is out of jail, and going strong, but he has still not been exonerated from the stain of a phony conviction, nor compensated for the five years stolen from his life, nor for the untold damage done to his political movement. In 1979, the Justice Department accused Demjanjuk of being the notorious “Ivan the Terrible,” the Nazi mass-murderer who killed countless Jews at the Treblinka concentration camp in Poland. Demjanjuk’s lawyers later proved-again, from the Justice Department’s own documents-that the department knew, almost from the very beginning, that Ivan the Terrible had already been proven to be someone other than Demjanjuk. Still other documents showed that the Justice Department knowingly accepted a forged J.D. card from the Soviet intelligence agency, the KGB, to frame Demjanjuk. Finally, with the full knowledge that he was innocent, the Department of Justice had Demjanjuk extradited to Israel to be executed. It was only due to the extraordinary courage and tenacity of his Israeli lawyer, Yoram Sheftel, that the Cleveland autoworker was finally acquitted. Then, on November 17, 1993, the U.S. Sixth Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, Ohio, issued a stinging rebuke to the Department of Justice, in an 83-page decision overturning Demjanjuk’s denaturalization. The Court charged that the Department had committed “prosecutorial misconduct” and “fraud upon the court,” in obtaining the conviction. On January 27, 1988, then-Congressman Mervyn Dymally placed before the House of Representatives a shocking document. It was an affidavit sworn by an FBI agent, Hirsch Friedman, concerning an FBI policy named Operation Fruehmenschen (German for “primitive man”). According to Friedman’s testimony, “The purpose of this policy was the routine investigation without probable cause of prominent elected and appointed officials in major metropolitan areas throughout the United States. It was explained to me that the basis for this Fruehmenschen policy was the assumption by the FBI that black officials were intellectually and socially incapable of governing major governmental organizations and institutions.” The figures backed up Dymally and Sawyer’s charges. Between 1983 and 1988, 14% of all political corruption cases targetted black officials, though they comprised only 3% of U.S. officeholders. From 1981-1983, roughly half of the 26 members of the Congressional Black Caucus were targets of federal investigation for indictments.

In magnitude, this is as if 204 members of the (largely white) 435-member House of Representatives were under investigation at anyone time! On this overall Justice Department corruption, I was very heartened to see a resolution from the National Black Caucus of State Legislators (NBCSL), which they had passed at their 19th Annual Legislative Conference, held in Birmingham, Alabama, from November 28 to December 2, 1995. The resolution referred to the two-day hearings which the Schiller Institute had sponsored in Virginia on August 31 and September 1, where a distinguished panel of legislators and international legal experts (including prominent members of the NBCSL) came together to examine Department of Justice corruption regarding the above cases and others. The NBCSL said, in its “Resolution 20: A Call For Congressional Hearings To Investigate Misconduct by the U.S. Department of Justice”: “BE IT RESOLVED…That this body, the 19th Annual Legislative Conference of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators, join this independent and distinguished panel of :mdividuals, in demanding that both Houses of the United States Congress exercise their oversight responsibility and conduct investigative hearings to examine these allegations of gross misconduct by the Department of Justice…and urge our colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to do the same.” Alisha Owen was convicted of perjury on June 21, 1991. In February, she went to prison to begin a IS-year sentence. This is notwithstanding the fact that the Nebraska Supreme Court expunged the report of the Douglas County Grand Jury from all official records, because the report violated all laws relating to such proceedings. This Grand Jury had indicted Alisha in the first place, claiming that the children’s charges of abuse were a “carefully crafted hoax.” The Omaha World Herald, however, had extolled the Douglas County Grand Jury report, complaining that the Supreme Court had condemned it. At my own expense, I have continued to provide legal assistance to her in the appeals process during the last four years. But, I did not represent Alisha at her original, hasty 30-day trial, and the problem in defending her subsequently is, that if things were done wrong at the trial level, either by the defendant, or by the defendant’s lawyer, it is difficult, if not impossible, to correct that problem at the appeals level. The only way to do that, is to prove to the court that the defendant did not receive adequate assistance by counsel during the trial­ otherwise the appeals attorney is limited to the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:177:8a648b21481e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5883, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 178, "text": "at her original, hasty 30-day trial, and the problem in defending her subsequently is, that if things were done wrong at the trial level, either by the defendant, or by the defendant’s lawyer, it is difficult, if not impossible, to correct that problem at the appeals level.

Troy Boner came under such onerous pressure from the FBI, that he recanted all that he had told the State Senate’s Franklin investigator, Gary Caradori. This recantation was the key factor in the Douglas Grand Jury’s “findings” that all the children had lied. In 1993, Troy engaged me as his lawyer. Before he did so, however, I asked him to write an affidavit, telling the story as he actually knew it to have actually happened. In this affidavit (printed in the next chapter), he reasserted his original story, which he had also told the Yorkshire TV crew. He has now dropped from sight, no doubt terrified about the threats that the FBI and others delivered to him, were he to tell the truth. First, as part of our discovery process in the suit, we were able to locate a vast store of pornographic materials, which were in the possession of the Douglas County Court. These had been held by Peter Citron before Citron was arrested. However, the court imposed such strict rules on our being allowed to see the material, that we were able to review only 1% of the material-before the court ordered it destroyed! The more we began to pour over Citron’s materials, the more we discovered that huge amounts of them, as identified in the official court inventory provided to us, were missing. So, we immediately went to court-which took additional time-to hold hearings and to subpoena officials, to try to locate the missing materials and find out how these materials could disappear, despite strenuous security measures. The official in control of the materials simply declaimed: “We admit there are huge amounts of pornographic materials missing, but we are not the ones who hid or destroyed or took them, and we do not know who did.” Additionally, I could only view the materials in the presence of guards and of the Clerk of the Federal Court, at his convenience, and behind security doors, and with notice given to all other attorneys in the case to be present if they so desired. All this security was, as I was told, for the protection of the pornographers involved-which seems strange, even in this bizarre case.

Arrayed against me in this civil rights lawsuit on behalf of Paul Bonacci are lawyers from across the United States, from a dozen or so of the highest priced law firms in the country. One of them is Ed Warin, a former United States Attorney from Nebraska during the time much of the Franklin matters were occurring, who represents Alan Baer. The reality I, and particularly Paul Bonacci, must face in this lawsuit is this: These defendants have unlimited money, power, and resources. Paul has no resources and I have limited time and resources and a family to support and a living to earn. “Paul, there was truly an angel on your shoulder during these continuing days of depositions. I do not know of a single person who could have stood up to the questioning that you were put through and survived. If I had any doubts about your story before the depositions, I absolutely have no doubts now that you were and are telling the truth, and are possibly the single most important person in America who can document some horrible acts by some of our top government officials and government agencies. And though your particular case may not produce anything financial for you, the information you have laid out will one day be the starting point for major investigations of certain government agencies and their practices which have been concealed from the American people. You Paul Bonacci, are the living history book, for example, for a program called ‘Monarch’ and someday the American people must and will have access to that story.” Senator Loran Schmit was, as chairman of the State Legislature’s special committee investigating Franklin, a pillar of courage, without whom little or none of the truth would ever have emerged. The forces involved in the Franklin cover-up made sure he lost his 1992 race for the Senate, after having served for 24 years. They also bankrupted him through phony lawsuits. With my help, he defeated all these legal assaults, but the suits, along with the incessant attacks by the World Herald, took a toll. Senator Schmit now works as a consultant in Lincoln. Alan Baer paid a fortune to his attorneys and managed to get his charge reduced from felonies to a single misdemeanor for which he had to pay a $500 fine. Alan Baer has now become the major promoter for the gambling industry in Nebraska.

In 1996, Baer and gambling syndicate supporters spent millions of dollars to win a position on the ballot for a proposal that would have given the gambling syndicates power to allow any type of casinos or gambling enterprises into the state that they would choose; and power to regulate the new casino operations. The release may be one reason why, when on Oct. 25, the syndicate went to get its expected order from Judge Kopf, he was nowhere to be found! It turns out he had checked himself into Bryan Memorial Hospital, with what was claimed to be a possible heart attack. When all deadlines for signing the order had passed, Judge Kopf remarkably recovered and was released from the hospital to resume his duties on the bench. U.S. Assistant Attorney Thomas D. Thalken, the federal prosecutor on top of the Franklin case, who had himself been named by investigator Gary Caradori’s informants as being involved in pornography, moved ahead of five other candidates, to be appointed in October 1992 to replace Kopf as the new U.S. Federal Magistrate. Gerald Moran, Douglas County Prosecutor, also moved ahead of a host of others and was appointed a District Judge in Douglas County. His assistant, Robert Sigler, who had been described by Paul Bonacci as being in the middle ofthe Franklin affair, took over Moran’s job of prosecuting Franklin-related victim-witnesses, particularly Alisha Owen. Under immense pressure from the F.B.I., Troy Boner recanted the testimony he had provided Gary Caradori, about the criminal activities of some of Omaha’s elite citizens. His recantation was crucial to the Douglas County Grand Jury’s findings of July 1990, that all the charges of child sexual abuse and related criminal activity was a “carefully crafted hoax.” I am making this affidavit freely and voluntarily and for the protection of myself and my family now and in the future; second, because it is right to do; and finally, because I want to undo some of the damage and injury I have caused and to help force legitimate and honest investigations of such matters as my brother’s death, Gary Caradori’s death and all circumstances surrounding my allegations herein, particularly the allegations that I lied to the grand jury and at the Alisha Owen trial but that such lies were caused by others including particularly the F.B.!.

I, and my mother and family, are exhausted from living in fear of death or injury as a result of my personal involvement in the Franklin matters which ended up in my testifying at the Grand Jury hearings as well as at the Alisha Owen Trial. I lied at the Grand Jury hearings and I lied at the Alisha Owen trial. I lied when I “recanted” my original testimony to Gary Caradori. I lied because I truly believed and still do believe that it was a situation where I must either “lie or die,” and at the insistence primarily of the Federal Bureau of Investigation officials who were dealing with me at that time, specifically Mr. Mott and Mr. Culver. The purpose of this affidavit, very simply, is to provide John De Camp the information he requires to file an action seeking protection for me and for my family from various individuals and the F.B.I. so that my true story can be told without fear of death or injury to myself or my family and so that others in a similar situation to myself can also come forward safely and tell their stories which I believe will prove very clearly that what I am saying in this affidavit is true. I am also certain now that only by telling the truth as openly and publicly as I can will I ever stand a chance of providing protection for myself and my family for the future. I have asked John De Camp to do whatever is necessary to seek Witness Protection, including Federal Witness Protection if possible, for myself and my mother and my pregnant fiancee and child-to-be. Yes, I know full well the very great risk I run by taking this action but I and my mother and family can not go on the way we are and I can not live with myself unless I take this action. The exact opposite is true. Never have I spoken with John De Camp prior to this and he has never contacted me directly or indirectly. I had a friend of mine contact John De Camp several weeks ago and bring him to a meeting with me and my family at a secret location. At the time, John De Camp did not even know he was coming to meet me or my family. He thought he was being brought to meet a girl who needed representation on some matter.

We both agreed-with my entire family presentthat anything said at the meeting could not and would not be recorded or ever used against me or to hurt me by John De Camp if I did not want to go ahead with this action. He agreed. I proceeded, along with my mother, to detail for John De Camp the fact that I had lied; why I had no choice but to lie; and many other facts. I then asked John De Camp whether he would represent me in helping to correct matters. I told him I went to him not because I liked him or knew him but because I felt he was the only honest one in this entire mess who could and would do something about my situation and who would not back down when the going got tough and who would “stick by me thru thick and thin if I (Troy) was telling the truth absolutely.” He promised to do this so long as I told the truth and would agree to comply with any lie detector or other truth test he or any legitimate investigative officials might ask for no matter what and so long as I and my family were doing this action not for money damages but for our safety and to get the truth told and myself and my mother and other kids protected. John De Camp also told me that he could not and would not represent me and my family in this effort if he, De Camp, believed that I was lying or if he believed he had any conflict of interest between myself and any other clients of his, specifically Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci. After researching and investigating what I, Troy Boner, had told him, De Camp said he would represent me and my family on a Pro Bono basis seeking only such compensation for representation as a Court might provide him. He also agreed to assist in any way he could personally in helping procure a secure and safe environment for me and my fiancee and child-to-be and to procure such other assistance for us as was possible thru social agencies or other groups or government agencies able to assist me and my family.

I have included this information in this affidavit at his, De Camp’s, request, to answer in advance questions he said others would ask. What I told Gary Caradori in the original taped interviews Gary had with me was the truth. It is still the truth. From about age 14 to 17 I was seriously involved in sexual and drug and related activities with a wide range of individuals but primarily and specifically Alan Baer, Larry King, Robert Wadman, Peter Citron, Eugene Mahoney, and others of prominence and wealth whom I will identify for any legitimate investigative officials who seriously wish to correct the problems and stop the conduct these individuals are and were engaged in rather than cover up that conduct. It has been repeatedly publicly stated that my story and the stories told by Alisha Owen, Paul Bonacci, and a large number ofother young people not previously identified who were simply intimidated from talking or who were ridiculed, were a “Carefully Crafted Hoax.” The stories were not a hoax. The only carefully crafted thing that occurred was in fact the cover-up of the facts and the subsequent conviction of Alisha Owen and the original Grand Jury Investigation. In short, there was a carefully crafted cover-up by the very people who were supposed to be exposing the conduct of these people rather than covering it up. And, yes, I was a very, very critical element in that cover-up but that participation by me was done because of threat and promise made to me primarily from the F.B.I.. and Mr. Mark Delman, the attorney arrangedfor me by others. I repeat. The original story I told on taped interview to Gary Caradori was in fact substantially the truth and substantially accurate. I say substantially because I am sure on some points I exaggerated and on some points I did not remember exactly the date or place or time of this or that event or particular person or persons involved. But, specifically, the material and substantive facts about the (1) Parties that took place at Twin Towers; (2) the use of myself and other children as drug courifor Alan Baer and Larry King; (3) the involvement of Alisha Owen at the parties and as a drug courier also and her involvement with former Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman; (4) my relationship with Alan Baer sexually and otherwise as well as the involvement of a number of other children with him; (5) Wadman’s presence and participation at these parties in question; (6) my delivering", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:183:f82b0b634707", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5889, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 184, "text": "place at Twin Towers; (2) the use of myself and other children as drug courifor Alan Baer and Larry King; (3) the involvement of Alisha Owen at the parties and as a drug courier also and her involvement with former Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman; (4) my relationship with Alan Baer sexually and otherwise as well as the involvement of a number of other children with him; (5) Wadman’s presence and participation at these parties in question; (6) my delivering Alisha Owen personally to Bob Wadman on several occasions; (7) my involvement sexually as a boy with Eugene Mahoney, the former Game and Parks man; (8) Peter Citron’s presence and involvement in the parties and related sexual activities and filmings, were all true, correct and accurate on the material facts. And, contrary to what the F.B.I. and others tried to get me to say and what I did say and in saying did lie about under pressure and threat and promise from the F.B.I. and others, Gary Caradori did not intimidate, threaten, coach, make up things or in any way improperly or falsely portray the information I provided him. He simply asked me to tell the truth, no matter what it was, and that is essentially what I did with him. He told me that was the law; that I had to report these things about Child Abuse under the state laws. But that was the only pressure of any kind he applied. And I know now it is the state law and all I want to do is comply with that law without fear of me or my family being hurt or killed for having complied with that law. After telling my story to Gary Caradori, I was assured that it was most important that everything I knew be kept absolutely secret. That I should talk to no-one or reveal what I had provided Caradori or the Legislative Committee. Everybody, including Caradori and the Committee and the Feds told me this. I know now that this was the stupidest thing I could do and that my following their very instructions to conceal things in fact made me and my family subject to and victims of later threats and intimidation. That is one of the main reasons that I have definitely determined that I will now conceal nothing from any legitimate investigative source-including the press. I am certain that had the press really known what was happening and all the facts that they would have done a far better investigation than others and would not have allowed the cover-up to occur. I will explain later why I now believe this to be the case. In my first contact with the F.B.I., the F.B.I. officials, particularly Mickey Mott and Mr. Culver, made it clear to me that (1) They were only interested in disproving everything I had told them; that (2)", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:184:0e889840db59", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5890, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 185, "text": "the press really known what was happening and all the facts that they would have done a far better investigation than others and would not have allowed the cover-up to occur.

In my first contact with the F.B.I., the F.B.I. officials, particularly Mickey Mott and Mr. Culver, made it clear to me that (1) They were only interested in disproving everything I had told them; that (2) they were taking the position that “…we know you are lying and we are only trying to figure out why and who is your leader who is having you lie”; and that (3) “if you will tell us you are lying then we will let you off the hook but if you insist on sticking with the story you told Caradori, then we will stick you in prison for a long, long time. What you told on your tapes to Caradori can land you in prison for twenty years each on a lot of different charges of perjury. If you insist on sticking with your story, you will go down.” When the F.B.I. dealt with me, they made it clear that they had the power to put me in prison-whether my story to Cara­ dori was true or not-and the power to put Caradori and others in prison including Alisha for providing the information we did to Caradori. And they made it clear that was what they intended to do unless I “recanted” my original story to Caradori and the Legislative Committee. The F.B.I. in conjunction with my new attorney, Marc Delman, who was arranged for me by others including particularly Frank Brown of the Television Station in Omaha, made it crystal clear to me that my only hope of staying out of prison was in “recanting” my original story to Gary Caradori, even though my story to Caradori was and is the truth. To make a long story short, I was put into the following situation by the F.B.I. and my attorney, Marc Delman, and I am confident in my own mind that they knew exactly what they were doing although I still do not understand all the reasons why they wanted me to lie or who they were doing this for: I had to lie to stay out of prison and I had to say that the truth was a lie and that the lies they wanted me to tell were the truth. So, when I went before the Grand Jury, at the insistence and instruction of Marc Delman and the F.B.I., I told the Grand Jury what the F.B.I. and Delman wanted me to tell the Grand Jury which is that the story to Gary Caradori was a “hoax.” But, as stated, the exact opposite is true.

Some time after my testimony to the Grand Jury, Gary Caradori was killed. I have no proof but I do believe he was deliberately killed. But, someone else will have to determine this because I acknowledge I have no information to prove or disprove this. Immediately after Gary Caradori was killed, and because I did believe he had been killed as part of a coverup and as a result of my lies to the grand jury, I immediately called his home (from the Red Lion Hotel) at which time I spoke to his wife Sandie and told her I had in fact lied to the Grand Jury and that I was going to help straighten it out now. She suggested I go to Senator Schmit and provide him that information. This I immediately did and told Senator Schmit personally in his office that I had lied to the Grand Jury and that what I told Gary Caradori was the truth and that I only lied out of fear that the F.B.I. and others, particularly my attorney Marc Delman, would hurt me or my family and particularly because they promised me they would put me in jail if I did not say what the F.B.I. and Delman wanted me to say which I, and I am sure they also knew was a lie. I also met Senator Bernice Labedz at the Caradori funeral and agreed I would meet her and Senator Schmit for lunch immediately following the funeral at which time we would go over my alleged “recantation” and I would provide her and the Committee all the facts. At the funeral, however, the F.B.I. agents, particularly Mickey Mott made it clear to me thru their actions that they knew what I was up to and gave me the clear impression that I was in “great danger” if I went ahead and met with the Legislative Committee and tried to tell them the truth. So, immediately following the funeral, I told my mother, who was with me, that we were not going to the meeting with the Senators and I was going to stick with my lies to the Grand Jury because of what I feared the F.B.I. or others associated with them or whom they were protecting would do to me or the members of my family. Later, Senator Labedz called me and asked why I did not show up at the meeting.

Later, Senator Labedz called me and asked why I did not show up at the meeting. At first I pretended like I did not know what she was talking about because by this time I was really scared especially because of Caradori’s death. Then she said she knew I was scared. So I was honest and I remember I flat told her I was “scared” and could not do anything now. She said she felt sorry for me and that she understood. Then, Marc Delman and Mickey Mott saw Senator Schmit say on T.V. that I had been in his, Schmit’s office, and that my “recantation” had been false. They both called me. Even though Marc Delman knew I had been at Schmit’s office and that what Schmit was saying was the truth, he, Delman, asked me whether the conversation had been taped or whether there was any other record of my having been in Schmit’s office to talk to Schmit. I told Delman there was no tape or any other record I had been with Schmit & that I had not signed anything. So, acting on Delman’s instructions I publicly lied and denied any meeting or discussion with Senator Schmit and Delman publicly did the same and suggested Senator Schmit was lying. Delman then instructed me to deny that I was in Schmit’s office and to simply imply that Schmit was lying about all these things. Delman’s exact words to me were, “It’s your word against his … as long as there are no tapes.” Mickey Mott the F.B.I. man also met again with me and again made it clear that if I told the truth-in other words, if I recanted my recantation-that I was in big trouble and would go to prison and for the first time Mickey Mott said something I interpreted then and now to have been a direct and personal threat that later came to pass. When I told Mickey Mott and Culver the F.B.I. people one time when I was feeling a bit cocky about their threats to me that Alan Baer and others “could n01 afford” to do anything to hurt me now because too much publicity was focused on me and that they could not afford the risk of doing anything to me, Mott right away told me that they probably would not do anything directly to me, that instead “they will do something to a family member.” And, of course that is what happened shortly thereafter after I had met with Schmit and talked", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:187:696940403fc3", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5893, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 188, "text": "to me that Alan Baer and others “could n01 afford” to do anything to hurt me now because too much publicity was focused on me and that they could not afford the risk of doing anything to me, Mott right away told me that they probably would not do anything directly to me, that instead “they will do something to a family member.” And, of course that is what happened shortly thereafter after I had met with Schmit and talked to Sandie Caradori and when the F.B.I. and Delman and Baer and others thought I might break away from them, the F.B.I. and Delman, and tell the truth and confirm that I had lied when I testified to the Grand Jury. I am completely certain in my own mind, which I believe a decent and honest investigation will show, that my brother Shawn was killed as a message to me to stick with my lies and not to back down because they were afraid I might back down and tell the truth at the Alisha Owen trial. After Shawn got killed, I had no doubt at all that they really were as dangerous as I had originally feared; that they would do anything and kill anybody to keep the truth contained and to keep me lying for them; and I complied with every request they wanted me to do or say with respect to the whole so called Franklin thing. Before the Alisha Owen trial I was carefully rehearsed by the F.B.I. as to what I would say and what questions would be asked and then after rehearsing everything with the F.B.I., I was taken over to Mr. Moran the prosecutor to go thru the Rehearsal again. I do not know whether Mr. Moran knew I was lying but for sure the F.B.I. had to know because they were the ones who forced me to “recant” in the first place and threatened me with prison if I did not. Additionally, the F.B.I. themselves had actual pictures of me and other prominent individuals in their possession including particularly Alan Baer (1983 picture of he and me in very pornographic sexual acts) as well as checks from Alan Baer to me. So, they had to absolutely know I had a relationship with him and that they were forcing me to lie when I denied such relationships. Additionally, the F.B.I. had seized photos and tapes involving among others myself and a Mr. Andreasen and Larry King. These were video tapes of a party. And I know from having seen tapes at Peter Citron’s house that the F.B.I. had access to tapes which clearly documented much of the conduct and the personalities I and other kids had identified as having occurred but which later I lied about before the Grand Jury and again at the Alisha Owen trial when I claimed-again to satisfy the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:188:035d8385c99e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5894, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 189, "text": "and tapes involving among others myself and a Mr. Andreasen and Larry King.

I do not know what the F.B.I. ever did with these pictures of me and Baer, for example, but I know they had them because I saw them. So, they, the F.B.I. had to know the real truth all along and had to know what they were doing when they forced me to lie. I am also sure that there are other pictures which would prove the things we kids told Caradori. Why do I say this? Because, the one thing I remember above all else is that these people like Baer, Mahoney, Citron, Andreasen, King, always loved to have pictures of themselves and others, particularly the kids, in weird sexual poses. I know the first thing that the F.B.I. and Marc Delman and others involved in these Franklin and related matters will say when I submit my affidavit is something like: “You can’t believe these kids and you can’t believe Troy Boner now. If he lied once, he will lie again. He’s a drug addict. He’s a sex pervert. Who are you going to believe, these kids with their wild stories or respectable people like Alan Baer or the F.B.I. or Attorney Marc Delman? Besides, these kids were as guilty or more guilty than anybody else. They were using the drugs and they were selling their bodies and they were getting paid well for it and they did it all voluntarily.” Or something like this is what they will say. I have heard it before. But, let me give the other side of that story. Yes, we kids, from early age, sold our bodies. We became drug addicts. We got lots and lots of money from these people. But today we are ruined because of that. And we were turned into sex perverts and drug addicts by these people. In my particular case, just like a lot of other young boys, I was directly turned into a true drug addict by Alan Baer. He was the one who first taught me to mainline and who first directly injected heroin directly into my veins-same as he did to a lot of other boys. He was the one who made me a prisoner of drug addiction to where he could completely control me and use me to deliver drugs or deliver sex or anything else. Sure, he paid me well, but he also destroyed me", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:189:794d62ce0581", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5895, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 190, "text": "directly turned into a true drug addict by Alan Baer.

Sure, he paid me well, but he also destroyed me in the process. It was Alan Baer who first injected me with a “speed ball”, for example. A speed ball is a heroin/cocaine mix that zips you up immediately but brings you down mellow. And it was Marc Delman, my attorney arranged for me by others who claimed lowed him more than $500, 000.00 for work he did protecting me, when what he really was doing was having me lie to protect others. But to those who really want the truth it really is all there for you to find out if you will only check on the things that are available. And the truth is the truth whether it is told by us street kids whom you may not want to believe or the richest and most powerful people in Omaha who you think you have to believe. Same with a lie. I. Marc Delman wrote my script for the [TV] program 48 Hours wherein I claimed that the entire story of myself and the other kids was a “hoax.” He promised me ten or fifteen thousand [dollars] for this. I got virtually nothing. 48 Hours told me that they had “paid my attorney.” There should be records on this. I think Marc got about $10, 500.00 for doing that. And as everyone knows, the 48 Hours program was played on television just before the Alisha Owen jury began their deliberations. Marc Delman also claimed that I had not met with Senator Schmit to tell the truth and I followed his instructions in denying it also. This sure can be checked out. There were people who saw me with Schmit. Same with my contact with Senator Labedz. III. Lots of kids, other than myself and Alisha and the ones who tried to come forward and tell the truth, know about Alan Baer, Larry King and the major drug dealing activity they and other prominent people were involved in. But, as long as they are scared for their lives because of what happened to Alisha and me, they are not going to say anything.

IV. But, maybe the most important thing that any honest investigator should do is to ask me, Troy Boner, or any of the other kids such as Alisha or Paul Bonacci, to take polygraph, lie detector, tests side by side on the same questions with the people we are accusing of these things. Example, ask Alan Baer if he shot mainline drugs into me and if he is a major drug dealer and if he had sex with me. Ask Eugene Mahoney if he met me at the book store in Council Bluffs and used to regularly pay me to have sex with him as a boy? Ask […] to take a polygraph test on whether he is a big-time drug dealer. Ask the F.B.I. guys to take a polygraph test on whether they threatened me with jail if I did not say the things they wanted me to say which things were a lie. Ask Marc Delman about the 48 Hours thing and the Schmit meeting. Obviously, either us kids are lying or the rich prominent people are lying. And just because they are rich and prominent does not mean they are telling the truth or because we are thought of as scum and kids who were supposedly all willingly involved in the drug trafficking and sexual activity does not mean we are lying. And like it or not, if we are not worth protecting then other young kids now and in the future will not be worth protecting either; and the prominent and respectable citizens who took us as children and made us a part of this drug dealing and sex abuse activity will continue without fear to do the same.

But right now, I need protection for myself and my family so that I can tell the truth totally and without fear of being punished or jailed for doing it. That is the purpose of this affidavit. To help Mr. De Camp in filing the proper papers to seek that protection. Mr. De Camp has discussed with me the fact that someone may attempt to file perjury charges against me for taking this action at this time. I understand that. I want to repeat one final thing: I told the truth to Gary Caradori. I tried to tell the truth to the F.B.I. and Marc Delman but they did not want to hear the truth and the only thing they wanted was to have me say the truth was in fact a hoax; and they scared me with threats of jail and other things into lying to the Grand Jury and then later into lying for them at the Alisha Owen Trial. I want to tell the truth without fear and to help other kids who are and were in the same situation as I am and was. That is the reason I am doing this. Before me a Notary Public on this 27 day of October, 1993, personally appeared Troy Boner, to me personally known, who executed the above affidavit, affirmed the truthfulness of the statements made therein, affirmed that he was voluntarily and willingly signing the affidavit and doing it for the purposes stated therein. In Chapter 17, “So the Truth Would Never Come Out,” the last chapter of the first edition of this book, I charged that “in the case of Larry King and the cadre of people he dealt with closely, boys and girls like Paul Bonacci, Troy Boner, Danny King, and Alisha Owen were used as drug couriers for a national program of illegal narcotics marketing. They were ‘throw-away kids.’ Because they were teenagers and younger when they were doing this activity, they provided a perfect insulation blanket between the real drug czars, like Larry King or Alan Baer, and the law.” On August 18-20, 1996, a California newspaper, the San Jose Mercury, published a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:192:da470a1512a1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5898, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 193, "text": "people he dealt with closely, boys and girls like Paul Bonacci, Troy Boner, Danny King, and Alisha Owen were used as drug couriers for a national program of illegal narcotics marketing. They were ‘throw-away kids.’ Because they were teenagers and younger when they were doing this activity, they provided a perfect insulation blanket between the real drug czars, like Larry King or Alan Baer, and the law.” On August 18-20, 1996, a California newspaper, the San Jose Mercury, published a series of articles implicating elements of the U.S. government in running tons of cocaine into U.S. cities during the 1980s. Based upon recently declassified government documents, eyewitness reports, and court records, Mercury reporter Gary Webb provided a detailed account of how the Contras financed their war against the Sandinista regime of Nicaragua by flying tons of cocaine into the West Coast, where it would be turned into the deadly, instantly addictive “crack,” and sold to such street gangs as the Cryps and the Bloods. Indignation exploded when the Mercury series hit the streets. Maxine Waters, Congresswoman for South-Central Los Angeles, one of the areas hardest hit by crack and drug-related violence, sent a letter to Central Intelligence Agency chief John Deutsch demanding an investigation of the Agency, in which she said, someone who has seen how the crack cocaine trade has devastated the South-Central Los Angeles community, I cannot exaggerate my feelings of dismay that my own government may have played a part in the origins and history of this problem. . . . The impact and the implications of the Meneses/BlandonlRoiss Contra CIA crack cocaine connection cannot be understated. We all have an obligation to get to the very bottom of the origin, development, and implementation of this seedy enterprise.\" While many were shocked at the news of apparent U.S. government drug-pushing, to me it was one more confirmation of a key aspect of the Franklin case. As I had discovered early on (as had Gary Caradori), the sexual abuse of children was only one of the Franklin story. During the 1980s, many of the children, such as Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci, said that they had been used as drug couriers to bring cocaine in from the West Coast for Alan Baer, Larry King, and others. Then, on September 11, 1996, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Representative Harold James, chairman of Pennsylvania’s Legislative Black Caucus, and a former undercover narcotics cop himself, also put out a call for an investigation. In the course of that press conference another name popped up, that I knew well from the Franklin investigation: George Bush. Flanked by political leaders of both the city and the state, James declared: “As a retired undercover Philadelphia police officer who worked on narcotics cases, I know we can better impact the flow of drugs if we stop drugs from coming into this country, arrest those at the top", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:193:24006aa19ee7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5899, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 194, "text": "cop himself, also put out a call for an investigation.

On this occasion, we must not allow anyone to use the pretext of national security to accomplish another cover-up. We need an investigation that goes right to the top.” As to where the “top” might be, James charged, in his release to the press, “previous investigations of the Iran-Contra scandal, particularly the U.S. House and Senate joint hearings in 1987, revealed the central role played by then Vice-President George Bush in covert intelligence operations …. One of Bush’s key lieutenants was Oliver North. Bush was also appointed by Reagan to run the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System, which supposedly coordinated efforts of all federal, state and local anti-drug agencies, especially along the south Florida coast. Bush was responsible for the White House anti-drug effort while, at the same time, according to the recent newspaper reports, tons of cocaine were allegedly supplied to street gangs by CIA-related networks.” Concluded James, “There’s something wrong with this picture.” In response to a question from one of the ten reporters in attendance about the role of Bush, Philadelphia City Council President John Street replied, “If George Bush is involved in it, someone should find it out. This kind of activity has been going on for well over a decade.” Lt. Col. Oliver North-whom at least one witness reported seeing at a party thrown by Larry King-had overseen the Contra resupply effort, and had been fully aware of the planeloads of drugs coming into the United States. A U.S. Senate subcommittee report under Massachusetts Senator John Kerry cited extensive evidence that the Contras were involved in drugs, and North had noted the fact in his publicly exposed notebooks. From what I know from my own corner of the world, there is excellent reason to investigate Bush for possible involvement in the dope business. Think back to what I reported in Chapter 13, “The Washington Connection,” about how George Bush and Larry King were linked in multiple ways, including eyewitness reports placing Bush at King’s sex parties. Think about the constant rumors that King was financing the Contras, who have now been proved to have been running dope by the ton. I became convinced early on that King was deeply involved with the Contras. I am reminded of the phone call State Senator Loran Schmit", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:194:7c012815e452", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5900, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 195, "text": "back to what I reported in Chapter 13, “The Washington Connection,” about how George Bush and Larry King were linked in multiple ways, including eyewitness reports placing Bush at King’s sex parties.

I became convinced early on that King was deeply involved with the Contras. I am reminded of the phone call State Senator Loran Schmit received on the Senate floor as the Franklin case was just beginning to break. The caller warned him off the case, because “it would lead to the highest levels of the Republican party.” I am reminded of when Larry King was finally arrested-just as he was about to go to a breakfast party in Omaha for his buddy, George Bush! I am reminded of the reports I used to hear that certain people in Omaha were charging that Omaha Police Chief Bob Wadman was protecting the expansion of the Cryps and Bloods into Omaha-far from their home turf of Los Angeles. So, was Larry King’s buddy George Bush the country’s “drug kingpin” in the 1980s? I don’t know. But what I do know, is that if Bush were running the Contra affair, and drugs were a big part of it, that would certainly jibe 100% with everything known or rumored about Bush, Larry King, and the Franklin Credit Union. Congresswoman Maxine Waters and Representative Harold James are right-let’s investigate! \"Of course the CIA in particular was involved in investigating, learning and, on occasion, using, everything we could learn about mind control-and with extremely good reason. Following the Korean War, this country’s military and intelligence communities went through a period of absolute paranoia about just how far our enemies were ahead of us in mind control and related activities. \"There was no particular program called ‘Monarch,’ contrary to what you want to think. ‘Monarch’ was merely a name that some participants in the program-who knew very little about it, other than from their own limited participation-were given to identify themselves. But, as far as the CIA was concerned, there was no such program named ‘Monarch.’ \"But, with respect to mind control, I will tell you that this country spent millions upon millions supposedly catching up to our Cold War adversaries, because we believed they had developed mind control technology which exceeded anything we had. In fact, we at the Company [CIA] truly believed for a substantial period of time, that technology and techniques and drugs had been developed by Russia which would enable them to have agents who in fact really were able to have and use ESP-extra sensory perception. “I will tell you one other thing,” Bill said, somewhat ominously, “we are not behind in knowledge of mind control.

I have deposited extensive documentation on the Monarch Project with people who have the means, the motivation, and, most importantly, the guts, to print the entire story, should I suffer an “accident” before I get around to it. Here, I will merely quote from the work of one of America’s finest investigative reporters, Anton Chaitkin. I had known of Chaitkin, who writes for Executive Intelligence Review magazine, from the book he co-authored with Webster Tarpley, George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography. This 659-page-book is a devastating expose of Bush, and it played a notable role in helping to shape the 1992 presidential campaign, which Bush happily lost. Perhaps it was because the name “Bush” was all over the Franklin scandal, that Chaitkin showed up one day in my Lincoln law office. I told him, “Look, I know you have been in some tough spots before, but are you really sure you want to poke around in this? This question of ‘mind control’ -the Monarch Project-is the most scary and dangerous thing I have ever encountered.” As I came to know Anton, probably all that little lecture did was to spur him on. Chaitkin got his story on the Monarch Project, and printed it in the December 13, 1993, New Federalist newspaper under the headline, “Franklin Case Witnesses Implicate FBI and U.S. Elites in Child-Torture and Murder.” Here follows an abbreviated version of that article: Since the 1992 publication of John DeCamp’s book, The Franklin Cover-Up, Paul Bonacci has filed new affidavits and has given extensive interviews to investigators including reporters for Executive Intelligence Review and New Federalist. Bonacci’s disclosures have been cross-gridded with evidence supplied by authorities in law enforcement, psychiatry, and the intelligence community. The result goes a long way to explain the high stakes involved, and the frantic nature of the Franklin cover-up…. Paul Bonacci has described in detail being dragged to Washington for use as a sex toy for Larry King’s clients.

Bonacci’s disclosures have been cross-gridded with evidence supplied by authorities in law enforcement, psychiatry, and the intelligence community. The result goes a long way to explain the high stakes involved, and the frantic nature of the Franklin cover-up…. Paul Bonacci has described in detail being dragged to Washington for use as a sex toy for Larry King’s clients. Bonacci told investigators he was in one of the private White House tours for young male prostitutes conducted by lobbyist Craig Spence, a close political associate of Larry King in the cloakand-dagger Contras enterprise. Spence turned up dead in a Boston hotel room in 1989, soon after his and King’s “compromising” business was exposed in a Washington Times June 29, 1989 story, headlined: “Homosexual Prostitution Inquiry Ensnares VIPs with Reagan, Bush.” From very early childhood, Paul Bonacci was subjected to tortures as profound as any the Nazis inflicted on their captives. This is not merely a comparison; rather it is an actual continuation, as we shall see. From sexual degradation, from witnessing and forced participation in Satanic cult murders, Bonacci suffered the cracking of his mind into what is called “multiple personality disorder” (MPD). Tens of thousands of American children have been diagnosed MPDs; virtually all of them are thought to have resulted from sexual abuse, of which perhaps 85 percent were cases of Satanic ritual abuse. In one instance detailed in The Franklin Cover-Up, Paul was taken by Larry King and others to a wooded area in California-identified after publication as the Bohemian Grove. There Paul and another boy were forced to do sex acts with and to consume parts of a child whom they had watched being murdered by the cultists. The body was to be disposed of by “the men with the hoods.” A “snuff’ pornography film was made of these events; it was directed by a man the party had picked up in Las Vegas whom Paul identified as”Hunter Thompson\"-the same name as a well known sleaze-culture figure. Paul has told investigators that the ring which plunged him into Satanism was centered at Offutt U.S. Air Force Base near Omaha; that he was taken to Offutt to be sexually victimized by a babysitter’s boyfriend when he was about three years old, around 1970. Offutt is the headquarters for the Strategic Air Command, and has had a cadre of thousands of intelligence personnel. At Offutt, and later at other military installations, Paul says this ring “trained” him by tortures, heavy drugging, and sexual degradation, while instructing him in military arts including assassination. In fact, his personal knowledge in these realms can scarcely be accounted for other than by crediting the indictments he has made. Larry King, FBI agent Gerry Wahl, Alan Baer, Harold Andersen, and former Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman have all been reported as collaborators with this Satanic militarybased ring.

Larry King, FBI agent Gerry Wahl, Alan Baer, Harold Andersen, and former Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman have all been reported as collaborators with this Satanic militarybased ring. King reportedly told Paul’s captors at Offutt, “He’s young-but you trained him good.” A member of Nebraska’s Concerned Parents group reported hearing from two North Omaha witnesses that “King used to send limousines down to Offutt Air Base to pick up CIA agents for parties.” Larry King reported his own adoring relationship to the late CIA Director William Casey in a Sept. 7, 1988, interview in the Omaha publication Metropolitan. Psychiatrists who have treated a growing number of MPD cases, victims of Satanic ritual abuse, report an alarming pattern of findings in many of their child patients. There is a structure to the personalities, conforming to what is evidently a deliberate breaking and reshaping of the mind. This phenomenon was identified to Paul Bonacci by his tormenters, and to other victims and witnesses, as the “Monarch” project. At Offutt Airbase, The use of mind-altering drugs, sensory deprivation, and other brainwashing techniques on U.S. citizens as subjects was the admitted practice of the CIA, certain military arms and private institutions joined in the MK-ULTRA, Artichoke, and Bluebird projects beginning in the early 1950s. A national security pretext often cited was the need to keep up with the Soviets in the race to develop a workable Manchurian Candidate human robot. With the “Monarch” (or whatever official title may be attached to it) project, the idea is extended to the production of a horde of children in whom the soul is crushed, who would spy, whore, kill, and commit suicide. Professionals probing the child victims of “Monarch” say there are clearly two responsible elements at work: the government/military, and cooperating Satanic (or more exactly pagan) cults. These are multi-generation groups, where parents donate their own children-who are proudly called “bloodline” or simply “blood” cultists-to be smashed with drugs and electric shock, and shaped. Other children are kidnapped and sold into this hell, or are brought in gradually through day-care situations. Paul Bonacci and other child victims have given evidence in great depth on the central role of Lt. Col. Michael Aquino in this depravity. Aquino, alleged to have recently retired from an active military role, was long the leader of an Army psychological warfare section which drew on his “expertise” and personal practices in brainwashing, Satanism, Nazism, homosexual pedophilia and murder.

The disclosures of Paul Bonacci, which cohere with reports of MPD professionals in other cases, point to a particular artificially induced mental structure as common to many victimized children. Space permits only the briefest treatment of this here; this is intended mainly to begin to “blow the circuits,” so to speak, when followed up by professional therapists and investigators. • General personality-accessible under the code name ALPHA, with possible Alpha-DOl, Alpha-009, etc. “persons” with distinct task orientations. • Sex programs, accessible through code name BETA; particular programs (and thus commands) are for pornography, acting, oral sex, etc. • Assassination programs, utilizing very specific modes, and espionage, accessible through code DELTA. • OMEGA, self-destruction programs, ranging from selfmutilation to suicide by many different specific possible acts. • GAMMA, system deception, amnesia and disinformation programs. Under this or other codes are track-covering false origins for the structure, giving the child memories of tormenters dressed as space aliens or Mickey Mouse or in Wizard of Oz costumes. • Trips on behalf of the North American Man-Boy Love Association (NAMBLA), the pedophile group now given semiofficial status by the United Nations. Paul cites travel to the Netherlands and Germany carrying child pornography for subsequent “import” to the U.S.A. to avoid prosecution. In Amsterdam, he names “Charles Hester,” and the British “Tommie Carter,” who had on computer a global list of child pornography users. NAMBLA is also cited for organizing auctions of children. • Training under “Captain Foster” (survival skills) at Fort Riley, Kansas, under “Lt. Dave Bannister” (intelligence) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, under “Col. Harris Livik” at Fort Defiance, Virginia, who is said to run a military school and to have housed “Monarch” boys. “Col. Bill Risher” of Bamberg, South Carolina, is said to have supplied children for Michael Aquino. • Travel to Dresden in communist East Germany, where weapons were inspected. There and in the Federal Republic of Germany, the “Monarch” personnel were frequently neo-Nazis. This milieu is a special project of Lt. Col. Aquino, who was a West European adviser to the U.S. Chiefs of Staff. Paul Bonacci has extensive experience in the Aryan Nation and other White Supremacist cults.

After the war, Allen Dulles and other Western intelligence people brought Nazi doctors out for use in the United States. A teenaged concentration camp inmate named Greenbaum, who had participated to save himself, also came to the United States. Known later as “Dr. Green,” he became a highlevel brainwasher, and is widely represented in brainwashing programs with a distinctive Cabalistic magic theme. At least some of these Nazi doctors were spirited out of Germany under the supervision of former Bank of England Governor Montagu Norman and Tavistock Institute Director John R. Rees on behalf of the British government. Norman, personally an insane Theosophist who had been chief of the prewar pro-Nazi faction within England, and Rees organized postwar propaganda and continuing psychological warfare activities, and created “Orwellian” groupings within U.S. psychiatry and mental health fields. It was through reading the first edition of The Franklin Cover-Up, that the Militia of Montana got my name and sought my assistance. Until they called me in early 1995, I had not even known that militias existed in this country nor, of course, that these “militias” were being closely watched by the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and being viewed as a national security danger. The Militia of Montana contacted me in a state of terror after their leaders and leaders of another group identifying themselves as “The Freemen,” were physically assaulted, seized, and arrested in the town of Roundup, Montana, in early January 1995. I was shocked, as I listened to the story of their arrest, imprisonment and physical abuse by public officials. I have always been a zealous defender of the First Amendment-Freedom of Speech, Press, Assembly. This Militia of Montana case convinced me that irrespective of what I personally thought about the beliefs of the MOM Leaders or the Freemen, these individuals had done nothing wrong, but were classic victims of improper government arrest, harassment, and abuse. As the case went on, I became very assertive on behalf of these men, angered by what had happened-and was still happening-under color of law. Soon, the major media focused attention on the case, telling wild lies about the facts of the incident surrounding the arrests. In February and March and April of 1995, talk shows repeatedly requested me to explain the true story, which I did. Meanwhile, militia groups from across the United States began marshaling to come to Montana, and to deal with the imprisonment of the MOM and Freemen in some fashion outside the court room;", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:200:ebed4c9ecaaf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5906, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 201, "text": "was still happening-under color of law.

Meanwhile, militia groups from across the United States began marshaling to come to Montana, and to deal with the imprisonment of the MOM and Freemen in some fashion outside the court room; this caused me grave concern. I would respectfully request that all charges of any nature filed against my clients be dismissed as soon as possible and that any and all personal property of my clients still held be returned. I would also, on their behalf, make the following offer to resolve in advance any civil rights litigation that my clients may initiate against the entities involved in the episode of arrest, incarceration, charges, that occurred: If the State would make a public apology to them, explain to the public the real truth on what occurred and why it occurred, insure the dismissal of the two MusselShell County deputies involved, and pay the sum of $1.00 (One Dollar) to my clients, they would waive their civil rights case that we believe they absolutely have against the various entities and personalities involved in this most interesting story. IIWe believe the episode culminating in the arrest and filing of charges against the “Montana Seven” began with: (1) A Con Job by a long-time repeat offender, (Call him John Doe), who was arrested and incarcerated again on or about late Feb. 1995 for serious spousal abuse. John Doe had become obsessed with a jealous rage and anger because he believed that a certain individual, one of the Montana Seven and a socalled Freeman had a “Relationship” with his wife that he did not sanction while he, John Doe, was previously incarcerated. John Doe solved his incarceration problem by spinning a tale for Deputy Jones-and later others-to the effect that the Freemen were on the verge of kidnapping and hanging public officials, particularly a Judge, as well as robbing banks and doing any sort of other dastardly deed that John Doe could spin a tale about and which MusselShell officials were ready to lap up without proper investigation or analysis. Naturally, John Doe identified his former friend, one of the Montana Seven and a Freeman, as one who was to be involved in this tale of terror-and described well his truck, items in it, etc.­ including a pile of money, gold and guns to watch out for. And thus, with one fantastic-though fantasy-tale, John Doe solved his incarceration problem and his jealousy problem, we believe the evidence will clearly show and which we believe the state is now aware of.

Defendant Dale Martin Jacobi of Thompson Falls, a businessman who just sold his business and has the cash from the sale and other property-guns from his home since he is moving them; equipment from his business electrical/plbg/htng business-rides into Roundup in his 1 ton 83 Chevy right after using part of his business sale proceeds to buy some gold coins in Billings. Frank had borrowed a two way business network radiocompletely legal, licensed, etc.-from another “Desperado” who ended up a member of the Montana Seven, namely, businessman Amando Gerry Lopez of Rexford. Lopez, also a Freeman, used the equipment in his business and allowed Frank to have the radio because Frank wanted to have access to assistance because he and Jacobi were carrying the cash mentioned above. Frank also had to file some “Trust Papers” in the courthouse in Roundup for some property Frank had bought in the county. Now comes Paul D. Stramer, Eureka, along with his friend, Cajun James, a disabled vet out of Eureka, whose gun-toting, buckskins-wearing, foot-long beard and super-long hair appearance would make the average person look and probably think twice about messing with him. But, until now, appearance is not a felony. Stramer wants to set up a statewide radio network for the Patriotic groups (Militia and/or Freemen) and is seeking finan­ cial assistance from the arch-enemy of the local officials, namely a Mr. Leroy Switzer. And Cajun James, a legally licensed gun salesman, has been given an order for purchase of weapons (single shot, I might add) from Mr. Switzer also. Mr. Switzer utilizes a CMO for his purchases (Certified Money Order) which he believes has value but which there seems to be considerable disagremeent on as to how much value it has in the overall financial community-but that is not an issue in the arrest ofthese individuals, merely an interesting sidebar. Deputy Jones found just what his con informant had told him he might find gold, hordes ofcash, guns, radio equipment, and two individuals who belonged to the militant groups he, Deputy Jones hated. Deputy Jones apparently believed he was on the verge of stopping an invasion, kidnapping, murder and worse. And, under those circumstances, why not rough up the individuals you have arrested? Why not scream obscenities at them and threaten them and tell them that those f— Freemen are not going to take over his town. And Deputy Jones did that … and a lot more. But, unknown to Deputy Jones, watching from a short", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:202:f5724b1f7f55", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5908, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 203, "text": "the militant groups he, Deputy Jones hated.

But, unknown to Deputy Jones, watching from a short distance was one of the other Freemen who then contacted the other individuals named here and said they should check on what was going on. Besides, as Lopez said, “They got my radio and I need it for my business and I can’t afford another one. They cost $500.00 and I am going to go to the Sheriff and see if they will give it back to me.” The tale gets controversial and tragic here. A couple of the defendants go into the sheriff’s office to seek return of the Lopez radio and the others wait in their car properly parked in front of the sheriff’s office. None of the Montana Seven defendants does anything improper or illegal. All are polite. But, suddenly, with lightning speed and led by Deputy Jones, the officials assault these individuals. They believe, apparently driven by paranoia, they have a right to capture. Again, led by Deputy Jones, the Montana Seven are trussed up like hogs; handcuffed with their hands behind their backs; forced to lie for six hours in pain on concrete trussed up and handcuffed. They abuse them in a variety of other ways, threaten them with loaded shotguns in their backs and chests, break out car windows, question them in violation of all legal and proper police standards; charge them with felonies of every ilk and description and fabricate allegations to support their charges and their actions. The officials lie to the relatives and friends calling in to the sheriff’s office and repeatedly deny that the Montana Seven are even at the jail or have been arrested. The Feds figure out-we believe-that they are in the midst of a comedy of errors and misunderstandings and after questioning the Montana Seven, quickly get out of any further involvement in the matters pending and return everything to local officials. We believe they, the Feds, are the ones who alerted the Attorney General of Montana of the need for some proper law enforcement involvement … but we do not know. Next, the Attorney General of Montana gets involved, a man named John Connor, and over the next few days sanity and proper law enforcement procedures begin to replace keystone kops and police brutality. Hundred Thousand Dollar Bonds are reduced to ten thousand dollar bond and communication is established between the attorney for the Montana Seven, myself, and the A.G.’s office.

Of course, before sanity begins returning, politicians (and I sure understand this) leap on the bandwagon and proclaim the evils of the terrorists and how the state must not be a victim of such terrorists; the media hypes the story-without benefit of accurate facts or any responsible investigative reporting and-the families and businesses of the Montana Seven are horribly damaged. And, the local law enforcement officials who prompted the comedy, “leak” one sordid and wild tale after another to the media as to what “really” occurred. As a sample of how far reality and what was being perceived as reality were separated, let me provide you some of the evidence grabbed which was supposed to support a charge (remember the claims in the media being supported by “leaks” from Local Officials, particularly Deputy Jones) of counterfeiting. Each of my clients would undergo a polygraph test on any material question relating to these charges against them or the events and incidents surrounding this. They would want you to bring in the best polygraph expert(s) in the country. They would agree in advance that any results ofthe testingfor any and all ofthem, no matter whether it showed positive or negative for them, would be admissible in court, civil or criminal. So much injury and damage has been done and so much disinformation has been put out that it is in the best interest of everybody, including particularly the Montana Seven, that the truth get out. And it is in the best interests of everybody, that Law Enforcement be held to the same standards of truth and responsibility they expect of the citizens. Again, I would repeat my offer as outlined in the beginning of this letter; and with these additional incentives I have just mentioned, polygraph, willingness to answer any questions for the press, it seems it would be beneficial for everyone to get these matters resolved, sanity restored and the situation de-escalated. The official response of the Attorney General of Montana to my ultimatum, was to say that the state of Montana was proceeding with the trial on charges of criminal syndicalism (sedition). The Deputy Attorney General John Connor, a fine individual who had to do whatever the Governor and Attorney General told him to, informed the press that my ultimatum would be ignored. When the press told me what the Governor and the Attorney General were purporting, I replied, “This story is pure fantasy, an", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:204:bbf81a300c17", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5910, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977795357", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "franklin-cover-up_cleaned", "chunk_index": 205, "text": "the Attorney General of Montana to my ultimatum, was to say that the state of Montana was proceeding with the trial on charges of criminal syndicalism (sedition).

When the press told me what the Governor and the Attorney General were purporting, I replied, “This story is pure fantasy, an attempt by public officials to excuse their mistakes. I dare Montana and its officials to go to trial on these bogus charges, because Montana will lose, and its criminal syndicalism laws will be declared unconstitutional.” Then, in March 1995, at the last minute before my deadline for dismissal of the charges, the Attorney General’s office swept into Roundup, dismissed all the charges, and informed the press that Montana officials were not responding to my demands, but were dismissing the charges because the Attorney General “needed more evidence” to prove his case. At the height of the “Montana Seven” case, as it came to be known, I had been dealing directly with the Montana Governor’s office, the Attorney General’s office and officials in Washington, as well as with the national press, trying to prevent an outbreak of violence spawned by either the militias or by the government. During February, and particularly in March and early April of 1995, rumors were flying through the entire Militia and Patriot community on almost an hourly basis, warning of imminent raids by federal officials against militia compounds. Nationwide, militias were circulating reports in all their fax, press and phone networks, that these raids were coming, and that the militia members had better be prepared. Team composed of ATF and FBI. CIA and U.S. military was about to launch airborne and ground strikes against various militia headquarters, particularly against the Militia of Montana at Noxon, Montana. Militias across the country prepared to defend themselves against these attacks. All this intense activity-unknown by most Americans then, or now-was occurring in the first half of April 1995. During that same period, I and others, such as former presidential candidate Bo Gritz, for example, spent hours each day trying to determine whether any such strikes were actually planned, or were just wild rumors. Federal officials advised us that no attacks were planned, information we relayed to militia leaders both in person and through talk shows on the patriot networks, working nonstop to defuse the extremely volatile situation. Since the bomb-or bombs-ripped through the Oklahoma City Federal Building on April 19, 1995, I have received through fluke or fate, a huge amount of information about the bombing. Based on this, I will give here my best assessment of what actually happened-what Americans in future years will understand about the events in Oklahoma City.

Based on this, I will give here my best assessment of what actually happened-what Americans in future years will understand about the events in Oklahoma City. I immediately put together an investigative team to look at the event and to try to determine what had actually occurred. The head of that team was Ted Gunderson, the former Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, who had had 800 agents working under him, and with whom I had collaborated in the Franklin case. Ted and his team arrived in Oklahoma before the dust had even settled from the explosion. Much later, after this initial work was completed, I became the attorney for a man named Hoppi Heidelberg, who was one of the federal grand jurors who had helped to indict Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the Oklahoma City bombing. Hoppi came to me because he believed the government planned to indict him for his work on the grand jury. It seems that Hoppi had come to the conclusion that the government was covering up facts, was refusing to deal properly with the grand jury, and was trying to narrow the case to Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols. Hoppi has said on talk shows nationwide, that he believes that there is a “John Doe 2”-and probably 3 and 4− and that the government is refusing to share that information with the American people. Hoppi was in fact removed from the grand jury-after the indictments of MeVeigh and Nichols. I emphasize at this point that nothing 1 say here violates, in my opinion, any information I learned from grand juror Hoppi Heidelberg, either from the standpoint of violating federal grand jury laws or violating attorney client relationships. All information disclosed here, was obtained by me from my own separate investigations.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:franklin-cover-up_cleaned.txt:206:9d5db34c9cc7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5912, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "Ninety miles southeast of Speer’s Oppeln hotel room, chaos was unfolding at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Speer’s chairman of the ultra-secret Committee-C for chemical weapons, a chemist named Dr. Otto Ambros, had documents to destroy. It was January 17, 1945, and every German in a position of power at Auschwitz, from the army officers to the IG Farben officials, was trying to flee. Not Ambros. He would not leave the labor-extermination camp for another six days. Otto Ambros was a fastidious man. His calculations were exact, his words carefully chosen, his fingernails always manicured. He wore his hair neatly oiled and parted. In addition to being Hitler’s favorite chemist, Ambros was the manager of IG Farben’s synthetic rubber and fuel factory at Auschwitz. With the Red Army bearing down, the Farben board members had ordered the destruction and removal of all classified paperwork; Ambros and colleague Walther Dürrfeld were at Auschwitz to do the job. In addition to being the plant manager of this hellish place, Ambros was the youngest member on Farben’s board of directors. All over the camp, SS guards were destroying evidence. Crematoria II and III were being dismantled, and a plan to dynamite Crematoria V was in effect. Some of the SS officers were already fleeing on horseback, while others were preparing to evacuate prisoners for the death march. Whips cracked. Dogs barked. Tanks painted white for camouflage outside the camp rolled through the muddy streets. Rumors swirled: The Red Army was only a few miles away. A female chemist in Farben’s Buna-Werke Polymerization Department asked the prisoner and future world-renowned writer Primo Levi, a chemist by training, to fix her bicycle tire. After the war, Levi recalled how strange it was to hear a Farben employee use the word “please” with a Jewish inmate like himself. Auschwitz was the Reich’s largest extermination center. As a concentration camp it consisted of three separate but symbiotic camps: Auschwitz I, the main camp; Auschwitz II, the Birkenau gas chambers and crematoria; and Auschwitz III, a labor-concentration camp run by the chemical giant IG Farben. Since April 7, 1942, IG Farben had been building the Reich’s largest chemical plant at Auschwitz, using a workforce of slave laborers selected from the Auschwitz train car platforms. Farben called their facility “IG Auschwitz.” IG Auschwitz was the first corporate concentration camp in the Third Reich. The barracks in which the slave laborers lived and died was officially called Monowitz. “Those of us who lived there called it Buna,” recalls Gerhard Maschkowski, a survivor of the camp. Maschkowski was a nineteen-year-old Jewish boy spared the gas chamber because he was of use to IG Auschwitz as an electrician. That he was still alive in the second week of January 1945 was something of a miracle. He had arrived at Auschwitz on April 20, 1943, which meant that he had been there for a", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:0:10adc064b114", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5913, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "lived and died was officially called Monowitz. “Those of us who lived there called it Buna,” recalls Gerhard Maschkowski, a survivor of the camp.

That he was still alive in the second week of January 1945 was something of a miracle. He had arrived at Auschwitz on April 20, 1943, which meant that he had been there for a year and nine months. At Buna, the average lifespan of a slave laborer was three months. Many of Gerhard Gerhard Maschkowski remembers January 18, 1945, with clarity, because it was his last day at Auschwitz. It was still dark outside when the SS burst into the barracks. “They shouted, ‘Get up! March!’ They had large guns, thick jackets, and dogs,” Maschkowski recalls. He put on his shoes and hurried outside. There, nine thousand emaciated, starving inmates from Buna were lining up in neat rows. Maschkowski heard cannon fire in the distance and the crack of firearms close by. There was chaos all around. SS guards were burning evidence. Bonfires of papers sent ashes up into the dark sky. Snow fell fast, then faster. There was a blizzard on the way. The guards, dressed in warm coats and boots, waved submachine guns. “Dogs on leather leashes barked and snarled,” Gerhard Maschkowski recalls. Wearing thin pajamas, the prisoners at Buna-Monowitz began a death march toward the German interior. Within forty-eight hours, 60 percent of them would be dead. Primo Levi was not part of the death march. A week before, he had contracted scarlet fever and had been sent to the infectious diseases ward. “He had a high temperature and a strawberry tongue,” remembered Aldo Moscati, the Italian doctor-prisoner who tended to him. “With a [104-degree] fever I was extremely feeble and could not even walk,” Primo Levi explained after the war. Lying supine in the infectious diseases ward, he listened to the sounds of the emptying camp. On January 21, a memorandum from Berlin ordered all Farben employees to leave. The last train for Germans leaving Auschwitz, transporting mostly IG Farben’s female staff from the camp, left that same afternoon. Yet Otto Ambros stayed behind. Ambros’s official title was plant manager of Buna-Werk IV and managing director of the fuel production facility at IG Auschwitz. He had been involved in the facility since January 1941, back when Farben’s original plans were being drawn. Ambros had chosen the site location and sketched out the original blueprints for the plant. He was also the man who invented synthetic rubber for the Reich. Tanks, trucks, and airplanes all require rubber for tires and treads, and during wartime this feat was considered so important to the Reich’s ability to wage war that Ambros had been awarded 1 million reichsmarks by the Führer.

Finally, on January 23, 1945, Ambros left the concentration camp. Only random prisoners remained. Inmates like Primo Levi who were too weak to march and had not been killed by the SS lay in the infectious diseases ward. When Levi’s fever finally broke and he ventured outside, he found groups of prisoners roaming around the camp looking for food. Levi found a silo filled with frozen potatoes. He made a fire and cooked his first food in days. On January 27, he was dragging a dead friend’s corpse to a large grave dug in a distant field when he spotted four men on horseback approaching the camp from far away. They were wearing white camouflage clothing, but as they got closer he could see that at the center of the soldiers’ caps there was a bright red star. The Red Army had arrived. Auschwitz was liberated. Otto Ambros was already on the way to Falkenhagen, Germany, to destroy evidence in another Farben factory there. Speer headed back to Berlin. Neither man dared travel north inside Poland, where a second armaments factory the two men were jointly involved in was also in jeopardy of being captured by the Soviets. At this facility, called Dyhernfurth after the small riverside village in which it was located, IG Farben produced chemical weapons—deadly nerve agents—on an industrial scale. On January 24, 1945, the day after Ambros fled Auschwitz, Farben had given the word to evacuate Dyhernfurth and destroy whatever evidence remained there. All munitions were loaded onto railcars and trucks and sent to depots in the west. All across Nazi-occupied Poland, German forces were retreating en masse as the Red Army continued to shred the eastern front. On February 5, 1945, one hundred and seventy miles northwest of Auschwitz, the Soviets captured the village of Dyhernfurth. Soviet soldiers took over the town’s castle, built during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and drank up its wine cellar. The castle, with its fairy-tale-like conical spires, quickly transformed into a scene of wild debauchery, with inebriated Russian soldiers singing rowdy victory songs. The situation got so out of control that Russian commanders suspended fighting until order could be restored. This made for a perfect opportunity for a team of Nazi commandos hiding in the forest to launch a daring and unprecedented raid.

This made for a perfect opportunity for a team of Nazi commandos hiding in the forest to launch a daring and unprecedented raid. Less than half a mile away, one of the Reich’s most prized wonder weapons facilities lay hidden underground. Camouflaged in a forest of pine trees, inside a large complex of underground bombproof bunkers, a workforce of 560 white-collar Germans and 3,000 slave laborers had been mass-producing, since 1942, liquid tabun—a deadly nerve agent the very existence of which was unknown to the outside world. Tabun was one of Hitler’s most jealously guarded secrets, a true wonder weapon of the most diabolical kind. Similar to a pesticide, the organophosphate tabun was one of the most deadly substances in the world. A tiny drop to the skin could kill an individual in minutes or sometimes seconds. Exposure meant the glands and muscles would hyperstimulate and the respiratory system would fail. Paralysis would set in and breathing would cease. At Dyhernfurth, where accidents had happened, a human’s death by tabun gas resembled the frenetic last moments of an ant sprayed with insecticide. Like the synthetic rubber and fuel factory at Auschwitz, the nerve agent production facility at Dyhernfurth was owned and operated by IG Farben, and here the Speer ministry worked with Farben to fill aerial bombs with tabun that could eventually be deployed from Luftwaffe planes. No one in the inner circle knew for sure when, or if, Hitler would finally concede to many of his ministers’ wishes and allow for a chemical weapons attack against the Allies. But as evidenced at Dyhernfurth, the opportunity was real. Enough poison gas had been produced here to decimate the population of London or Paris on any given day. Despite the overwhelming onslaught of Red Army troops to this region in February of 1945, Hitler remained determined to keep the secrets of tabun out of enemy hands. On the morning of February 5, 1945, Major General Max Sachsenheimer of the Reich’s Seventeenth Field Replacement Battalion and his troops were hiding in the forest along the banks of the Oder River. Sachsenheimer’s commando force was made up of several hundred soldiers, but he also had a unique secondary contingent of men, namely, eighty-two scientists and technicians. Some were army scientists but most were IG Farben employees and chemical weapons experts. Sachsenheimer’s mission was to protect the scientists while they scrubbed Farben’s facility of any and all traces of tabun. The Dyhernfurth complex was a sprawling, state-of-the-art production plant.

Speer’s Armaments and War Production Ministry had paid Farben nearly 200 million reichsmarks to build and operate it. The facility had been secretly and skillfully designed and managed by Otto Ambros. As he had done with IG Auschwitz, Ambros had overseen every element of this chemical weapons factory dating from the winter of 1941, when the thick forest here was first cleared of pine trees by 120 concentration camp slaves. As Nazi Germany blended industry, war making, and genocide, few corporations were as central a player as IG Farben. The chemical concern was the largest corporation in Europe and the fourth largest corporation in the world. IG Farben owned the patent on Zyklon B. And perhaps no single person at Farben was as central a figure in this equation as Otto Ambros had been. For his work as chairman of Committee-C, the chemical weapons committee inside the Speer Ministry, Ambros was given the prestigious title of military economy leader (Wehrwirtschaftsführer). He was awarded the War Merit Cross, 1st and 2nd Class, and the Knight’s Cross of the War Merit Cross, which was similar to the award bestowed on Dornberger and von Braun. There was a second scientist who played an important role in chemical weapons—a man who, like Otto Ambros, would be targeted for Operation Paperclip. This was SS-Brigadeführer Dr. Walter Schieber, a chemist by training, Speer’s deputy and director of the Armaments Supply Office. Schieber was a hard-core Nazi ideologue and a member of Reichsführer-SS Himmler’s personal staff. Unusually corpulent for an SS officer, his official car and airplane required retrofitting to accommodate his 275-pound frame. With Hitler’s physician, Karl Brandt, Schieber was in charge of gas mask production, a requisite for troop defense if chemical warfare was to be waged. As with biological weapons, the sword needs a shield, and by January of 1945 Schieber had overseen the production of 46.1 million gas masks. Their reliability had been tested at Dyhernfurth on concentration camp prisoners. The stories that would emerge during the Nuremberg trials about such tests were ghoulish, including locking prisoners in glass rooms and spraying them with nerve agent. War crimes investigators would later debate whether or not these actions were pilot programs for the gas chambers. The full story of how, and to what extent, Dr. Walter Schieber worked for the U.S. military after the war—and also for the CIA—has never been fully explained until this book.

The full story of how, and to what extent, Dr. Walter Schieber worked for the U.S. military after the war—and also for the CIA—has never been fully explained until this book. Only weeks before the Red Army took Dyhernfurth, overran its castle, and drank all its wine, thousands of concentration camp slave laborers had been toiling away at Farben’s secret chemical weapons plant performing the deadliest of jobs. Wearing double-layer rubber suits and bubbleshaped helmets, prisoners filled artillery shells and bomb casings with nerve agent, marking each munition in a secret code indicating tabun nerve agent: three green rings of paint. The prisoners’ suits worked similar to deep-sea diving suits. Attached to the back of each helmet was a tube delivering breathable air. But the air tube was short and gave workers very little room to move. If a man accidentally detached from the air source, he would be exposed to the lethal vapors through the breathing tube and die. But on the morning of February 5, 1945, the facility was empty. Not a chemist or a slave laborer remained. The munitions had been moved, documentary evidence destroyed, and all the IG Farben employees had fled. The prisoners had been evacuated by their SS guards three weeks before. Wearing prisoner pajamas and ill-fitting wooden work shoes, the Dyhernfurth laborers were marched west toward the German interior. Witnesses in nearby villages described a column of three thousand walking corpses. Temperatures in the area reached -18 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time the prisoners reached the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, fifty miles to the southwest, two-thirds of them had died of exposure. Now, working on Hitler’s orders, a technical team was preparing to return to Farben’s secret facility for a final scrub of tabun residue. In the freezing predawn air, the two chemists, eighty technicians, and a group of German commandos donned double-layered rubber suits, pulled gas masks over their heads, and stole down the banks of the Oder River. They moved quietly across a partially bombed-out railroad bridge, walked slowly down the railroad tracks, and headed to the chemical weapons plant. The protective suits were cumbersome, and it took the technical team sixtyfive minutes to travel less than a half a mile. Reaching the plant, the group made its way into the production facility that housed massive silver-lined kettles in which the nerve agent was made. Each kettle sat inside an operating chamber enclosed in double-glass walls encircling a complex ventilation system of double-walled pipes. While one group got to work decontaminating the chambers with ammonia and steam, another group scoured the surfaces of the munitions-filling factory where so many slave laborers had met death.

The commandos kept guard. While the technicians scrubbed, two and a half miles downriver Major General Sachsenheimer’s remaining platoon of soldiers sprang into action. They launched artillery shells at sleeping Russian forces in a diversionary feint. The Red Army reorganized and retaliated, and by lunchtime eighteen Soviet tanks were engaged in fierce fighting with Sachsenheimer’s troops. The battle, a footnote in the annals of the war, lasted just long enough for IG Farben’s technical team to get in, get out, and disappear. Not for several days did the Red Army finally stumble upon Farben’s chemical weapons facility at Dyhernfurth. By then it was void of people and tabun but otherwise entirely intact. As the Russians examined the facility, scrubbed immaculately clean, it became clear to the commanders that whatever this facility had produced must have been considered of great value to the Reich. The laboratory layout bore signs of chemical weapons production, and the Soviet army called in their own chemical weapons experts from the Sixteenth and Eighteenth Chemical Brigades. The factory was dismantled, crated, and shipped back to the Soviet Union for future use. What had been produced here in the forest remained a mystery to its new owners—the Russians—for a little over a year. By 1946 the entire chemical weapons factory at Dyhernfurth would be reassembled in a little town outside Stalingrad called Beketovka, and the plant given the Russian code name, Chemical Works No. 91. The Soviets themselves then began producing tabun nerve agent on an industrial scale. By 1948, the Soviet Military Chemical Text Book would list tabun as part of the Red Army’s stockpile. But 1948 was so far away. So much would happen with America and Hitler’s chemists between 1945 and 1948, most of it predicated on the emerging Soviet threat. Back in Berlin, Hitler read the first page of Speer’s report and ordered it filed away. Then Hitler became enraged. His furor was likely exacerbated by a conference taking place on the Crimea Peninsula, at Yalta, beginning February 4, 1945. It was to last for eight days. There, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin were confirming their commitment to demand Germany’s unconditional surrender. There would be no bargaining, the three heads of state declared.

War criminals would be tried, justice meted out. The idea of what defined justice varied dramatically from power to power. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill wanted Nazis leaders to be treated as “outlaws.” He argued that they should be lined up and shot rather than put on trial. The premier of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, rather unexpectedly argued for “no executions without trial.” President Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted a war crimes trial. What all parties agreed on was that, after the surrender, Germany would be broken up into three zones of occupation. (Soon, France’s involvement would make it four.) When Hitler learned of the Allies’ plan to divvy up the spoils of Germany, he became furious. Then he called on Albert Speer. “If the war is lost,” Hitler famously told Speer, “the nation will also perish. This fate is inevitable.” If Germany loses the war, Hitler said, the people deserved existential punishment for being weak. “What will remain after this struggle will be in any case only the inferior ones, since the good ones have fallen,” Hitler said. Following this logic, Hitler decreed that Speer’s ministry need not provide German citizens with even the most basic necessities, including shelter and food. He told Speer that if Speer were ever to give him another memorandum saying the war was unwinnable, and that negotiations with the enemy should be considered, Hitler would consider this an act of treason punishable by death. Hitler then issued a nationwide “scorched-earth” policy. Speer was to help organize the complete destruction of all German infrastructure, military and civilian—from its transportation and communication systems to its bridges and dams. Officially entitled Demolitions on Reich Territory, this order became known as the Nero Decree, or Nerobefehl, invoking the Roman emperor Nero, who allegedly engineered the Great Fire of 64 AD and then watched Rome burn. In central Germany, in the naturally fortified Harz Mountains, production of V-weapons continued at a frenzied pace despite every indication that Germany would soon lose the war. By late February 1945, conditions inside the Nordhausen tunnels had reached a cataclysm. It was bitterly cold, thousands were starving to death, and there was barely any food; watery broth was all the prisoners had to live on. The Nordhausen-Dora concentration camp was being overrun with new prisoners arriving on the death marches from Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen in the east. Some came on foot and others came in cattle cars.

Many arrived dead. Dora’s crematorium was overwhelmed. In this climate, Wernher von Braun and General Dornberger pressed on with plans to create a greater number of rockets each day. Since moving his offices from the Peenemünde facility to the Harz Mountains, von Braun had been given a promotion. Now he was head of what was called the Mittelbau-Dora Planning Office, a division within Himmler’s SS. Von Braun lived just a few miles from the Nordhausen complex, in a villa that had been confiscated from a Jewish factory owner years before. Each day he drove to his office in Bleicherode, eleven miles from the tunnel complex, where he drafted designs for new and better test stands and launch ramps for the V-2 . Despite the reality that the war was lost, the area was abuzz with new armaments factories being built, “dug by workers from some of the forty-odd subcamps now tied to Mittelbau-Dora,” Michael J. Neufeld explains. Von Braun’s vision was to escalate rocket production from two or three rockets a day to two hundred rockets a day. To prepare for this ambitious expansion, he commandeered factories, schools, and mines throughout the region. But rocket assembly was dependent on workers, and the slave laborers in Nordhausen were now dying at an ever-increasing rate. Von Braun had to have known this; he visited the underground tunnels in an official capacity ten times during the winter of 1945. For the emaciated slave laborers who had managed to stay alive, trying to assemble missiles in filthy, unfinished tunnels without food, water, or sanitation in the bitter cold of winter had become more and more difficult, and it showed in their work. In skies across Europe these hastily constructed rockets began breaking apart in flight. And in the pine forests of northern Germany, including those around the Castle Varlar, quickly assembled rockets were exploding on their mobile launch pads. The managers at Mittelwerk suspected sabotage. To send a message, public hangings were held. “Prisoners were hanged up to 57 in one day,” read one war crimes report. “They were hanged in the tunnels with the help of an electrically controlled crane, a dozen at a time, their hands bound behind their back, a piece of wood was put in their mouth… to prevent shouting.” The hangings were carried out directly above the V-2 production lines. Laborers were forced to watch their fellow prisoners suffer an agonizingly slow death. In solidarity, a group of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners staged a revolt. The suspects were rounded up.

Mittelwerk managers and SS guards decided to make an example of them. After these men were hanged, their bodies were left dangling for a day. Only after Arthur Rudolph, the Mittelwerk operations director, received a memo from one of his German engineers asking when they were going to get their crane back were the bodies taken down. In addition to von Braun’s recent promotion to head of the Mittelbau-Dora Planning Office, he was also promoted to SS-Sturmbannführer, or SS major. One of the benefits that came with this position was a chauffeur-driven car to shuttle von Braun back and forth between Nordhausen and Berlin. It was in the backseat of this car on the night of March 12, 1945, that von Braun was nearly killed. As his car was speeding down the autobahn headed for Berlin, his driver nodded off at the wheel. The car veered off the road and hurtled down a forty-foot embankment until it crashed on its side near a railroad track. The driver was knocked unconscious. Von Braun broke his arm. Both men lay bleeding in the cold, dark night when two of von Braun’s colleagues from Nordhausen, facilities designer Bernhard Tessmann and architect Hannes Lührsen, happened to drive by and spot the smashed-up car. They called for a military ambulance, which came to the scene and transported von Braun and his driver to a hospital. While recuperating, von Braun received a visit from his personal aide, Dieter Huzel, and Bernhard Tessmann, one of the two men who had saved von Braun’s life. Tessmann and Huzel told von Braun that the arrival of the U.S. Army was imminent. Any day now, they said, V-2 operations would cease. Word was going around that every man not considered a valuable scientist was going to be assigned to an infantry unit, handed a weapon, and ordered to fight the Americans on the front lines. Von Braun was now ready to concede that Germany would lose the war. What he was unwilling to do was relinquish his career. He needed a bargaining chip to use against the Americans after he was captured. Von Braun told Tessmann and Huzel where he kept the most valuable classified V-2 documents. Because von Braun was bedridden, he needed his two subordinates to crate up these documents and hide them in a remote, secure place where the Allies would never find them on their own.

Von Braun told Tessmann and Huzel that if they could do this they would be included in von Braun’s future negotiations with the Allies. General Dornberger would also be part of the team. Von Braun told Tessmann and Huzel that he would personally bring the general up to speed. Mittelwerk laborers continued to produce missiles until the end of March. The last V-2s were fired on March 27 and the last V-1s were fired the following day. On April 1, Dornberger received an order from SS-General Kammler demanding that Dornberger evacuate his staff from the Mittelwerk at once. Kammler had selected five hundred key scientists and engineers who were to board his private train car, parked in Bleicherode and nicknamed the Vengeance Express, and then travel four hundred miles south into the Bavarian Alps to hide out. Huzel and Tessmann were on Kammler’s list, but after colluding with General Dornberger they were able to stay behind to complete the document stash. Von Braun, still requiring medical attention and encumbered by a heavy cast, was taken to the Alps in a private car. Dornberger and his staff drove themselves, fleeing the Harz in a small convoy. When night fell on Dörnten, a small mining community at the northern edge of the Harz, the village was in a blackout. The local gauleiters (Nazi Party district leaders) had ordered villagers to shutter their windows, turn off the lights, and stay home. It was April 4, 1945, and American forces were reportedly camped out just thirty miles to the west. The village’s cobblestone streets were empty, save a lone truck driving slowly with its lights off, navigating by the moon. In the front seat sat Tessmann and Huzel. In the back of the truck were seven German soldiers wearing blindfolds. Also in the truck were dozens of crates filled with classified V-2 information. The truck passed through town and headed up a winding rural road leading into the mouth of an abandoned mine. Huzel and Tessmann parked the truck and shook hands with the caretaker, Herr Nebelung, a loyal Nazi, who sold the two engineers space in a large antechamber in the back of the Dörnten mine.

The group unloaded the crates, placed them onto flatcars, and oversaw them as they were driven down a long tunnel by an electric-battery-powered locomotive. At the end of the tunnel, behind an iron door, was a small, dry room. The crates of V-2 documents were packed inside, the door shut and locked. Outside, a soldier lit a stick of dynamite in front of the doorway to create a huge pile of rubble and keep the important Nazi documents hidden from the outside world. Huzel and Tessmann had sworn not to tell anyone what they’d done, but just as they were leaving for Bavaria to rendezvous with Dornberger and von Braun, the two men decided to make an exception. Karl Otto Fleischer had served as the army’s business manager for the Mittelwerk slave labor enterprise. Fleischer’s name was not on General Kammler’s list, and he’d gone home to his house in Nordhausen to blend in. Karl Fleischer was a loyal Nazi who reported directly to General Dornberger during V-2 production, and Huzel and Tessmann believed Fleischer would keep their secret safe. Fleischer was local. He could keep an eye on things and monitor if anyone started poking around the Dörnten mine. Huzel and Tessmann told Karl Fleischer about the secret location of the V-2 document stash, and with the U.S. Army just a few days outside Nordhausen, Huzel and Tessmann sped away. In France, Samuel Goudsmit and his team of Operation Alsos scientists had been waiting patiently since November to launch their next scientific intelligence mission. It had been four months since the team hit intelligence gold, inside the Strasbourg apartment of the Reich’s virologist Dr. Eugen Haagen. Now, in the last week of March 1945, Goudsmit and his military commander, Colonel Boris Pash, were finally getting ready to seize their next targets: IG Farben factories over the border in Germany, believed to be the locus of the Nazis’ chemical weapons program. Since November, Haagen’s apartment in Strasbourg had been serving as Alsos headquarters. There had been long delays. In December, Hitler’s counteroffensive in the Ardennes Forest meant that Alsos scientists could not conduct frontline missions as planned. But as serendipity would have it, the entire first floor below Haagen’s Strasbourg apartment belonged to IG Farben, the primary chemical weapons supplier of the Third Reich, and Alsos seized a considerable cache of documents Farben kept there.

Alsos knew Farben was involved in weapons-related vaccine research and suspected they were involved in medical experiments on prisoners. The two Farben factories they had in their sights were located only about eighty miles away, in the German cities of Ludwigshafen and Mannheim. For this, Operation Alsos had put together their largest task force to date: ten civilian scientists, six military scientists, and eighteen security operators. But venturing into German-held territory on their own was considered too dangerous for the American scientists. They had been waiting for Allied forces to cross over the Rhine River into Germany, at which point they, too, would be allowed in. Now, in the third week of March 1945, this long-awaited crossing appeared imminent. On March 23, 1945, British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery began a colossal troop offensive across the Rhine River, code-named Operation Plunder. Adding to the namesake’s subtext of seizure and pillage were Montgomery’s famous words: “Over the Rhine, then, let us go. And good hunting to you all on the other side.” Sacking a vanquished country at the end of a war was as old as war itself, but the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 prohibited looting beyond token items claimed as “trophies of war.” What, exactly, did Montgomery mean? On a tactical level, the Rhine River crossing meant that the Allies would smash open more than five hundred miles along the western front. From an intelligence collection standpoint, it truly meant plunder. As soldiers pushed forward into Germany, accompanying them were more than three thousand scientific and technical experts with the Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee, or CIOS, the joint British-American program that had been established in London the summer before. CIOS teams reported to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces, or SHAEF, located in Versailles and staffed by experts: scientists, engineers, doctors, and technicians accompanied by linguists and scholars to translate and interpret the documents that were seized. Representing the United States from CIOS were men from the War Department General Staff, the navy, the Army Air Forces, the State Department, the Foreign Economic Administration, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The British sent experts from the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, the Air Ministry, and the Ministries of Supply, Aircraft Production, Economic Warfare, Fuel and Power. All CIOS staff worked from a list of targets, similar to those used by Alsos, which became known as Black Lists. Frontline requests for specific CIOS teams were relayed to SHAEF from the combat zone.

An appropriate CIOS team would be dispatched into the field. Assisting CIOS teams were security forces called T-Forces, identifiable by helmets with a bright red T painted on the front. These small squadrons of elite soldiers operated at the army group level but worked independently of traditional combat units. Their job was to recognize potentially valuable scientific targets and then secure them until personnel from CIOS arrived. The goal of Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee was to investigate all things related to German science. Target types ran the gamut: radar, missiles, aircraft, medicine, bombs and fuses, chemical and biological weapons labs. And while CIOS remained an official joint venture, there were other groups in the mix, with competing interests at hand. Running parallel to CIOS operations were dozens of secret intelligence-gathering operations, mostly American. The Pentagon’s Special Mission V-2 was but one example. By late March 1945, Colonel Trichel, chief of U.S. Army Ordnance, Rocket Branch, had dispatched his team to Europe. Likewise, U.S. Naval Technical Intelligence had officers in Paris preparing for its own highly classified hunt for any intelligence regarding the Henschel Hs 293, a guided missile developed by the Nazis and designed to sink or damage enemy ships. The U.S. Army Air Forces (AAF) were still heavily engaged in strategic bombing campaigns, but a small group from Wright Field, near Dayton, Ohio, was laying plans to locate and capture Luftwaffe equipment and engineers. Spearheading Top Secret missions for British intelligence was a group of commandos called 30 Assault Unit, led by Ian Fleming, the personal assistant to the director of British naval intelligence and future author of the James Bond novels. Sometimes, the members of these parallel missions worked in consort with CIOS officers in the field. Certainly, they took full advantage of all the information CIOS made available, including its Black Lists. But each mission almost always put its individual objectives and goals first. The result, some officers joked, was CHAOS for CIOS. On its search for chemical weapons, Alsos scientists crossed the Rhine on the heels of the Third Army. They traveled in a small convoy of army jeeps. “The area was not in good shape,” Colonel Pash recalled after the war. “Buildings of the town shook from the shock waves generated by the gun explosions,” and “stalled or broken-down vehicles added to the confusion created by the wrecked armor and trucks of the retreating Nazis.” Entering Ludwigshafen, one of the Alsos jeeps", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:13:0cf513515024", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5926, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 14, "text": "its search for chemical weapons, Alsos scientists crossed the Rhine on the heels of the Third Army.

Hardly expecting a single jeep to appear on the road without a tank accompanying it, the Germans were apparently caught off-guard. “A single salvo and the few machine-gun bursts went wide,” Pash recalled after the war. The Alsos scientists had heard that T-Forces units were close behind them and were making arrangements for a large team of technical experts to arrive under the CIOS banner. The Alsos scientists were determined to get to the IG Farben factory first. But what they ended up finding in Ludwigshafen was disappointing to them. Not only had the factory been heavily damaged by Allied bombing raids, but filing cabinets were empty. Paperwork had been destroyed or removed. There were no chemical weapons found. The following morning, March 24, 1945, while at breakfast, the Alsos team met up with the T-Forces and the CIOS team. Both had come to inspect the Farben factory. “It was interesting to watch the effect of bombshells casually dropped by our scientists,” Pash recalled, “sounding something like… ‘Oh sure, You’ll be able to go to the Farben plant tomorrow, after the T-Forces secures it. You’ll find it interesting. We know, because we were there yesterday.’” The rivalry between the teams was evident. The two men leading the CIOS chemical weapons team were an American officer named Lieutenant Colonel Philip R. Tarr and a British officer named Major Edmund Tilley. These men would soon become critical players in the Operation Paperclip story. Each was considered an expert in chemical warfare, but Major Tilley had a leg up on his American counterpart—at least in the field—in that he spoke fluent German. In addition to his role as a CIOS leader, Colonel Tarr was chief officer in the U.S. Army’s Intelligence Division of the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service, Europe. Unknown to Major Tilley at this time was that Colonel Tarr’s U.S. Army objective would soon supersede his loyalty to their work together as a CIOS team. With American forces now on German soil, the fear that Hitler might unleash a devastating chemical weapons attack in a last-ditch attempt to make good on his wonder weapons promise was real, but Tarr and Tilley had very few leads as to where the chemical weapons might be stashed.

German counterintelligence agents had done a brilliant job concealing the Reich’s nerve agent programs from foreign intelligence agencies during the war. Tabun had been given various code names, including Trilon 83, Substance 83, and Gelan 1. Even its raw materials were coded. Ethanol was “A4,” and sodium was “A-17,” making identification all but impossible. In 1942, a U.S. intelligence report entitled “New German Poison Gas” concluded that the possibility that Germany had new chemical weapons was “no longer seriously regarded.” Only in May of 1943, after capturing a German chemist in North Africa, did British agents learn of a colorless nerve agent of “astounding properties” being developed by IG Farben chemists in Berlin. The British interrogation officers found the German chemist’s information to be credible and wrote up a ten-page secret report for the Chemical Defense Experimental Establishment, which operated out of Porton Down. But the captured scientist knew only the substance’s code name, Trilon 83. Without further information, no action was taken by the British. Now, in March 1945, Tarr and Tilley were on the hunt for this mysterious Trilon 83 and anything else like it. Leading the CIOS team into Germany, Tarr and Tilley inspected IG Farben factories at Ludwigshafen, Mannheim, and Elberfeld. At each location the officers noted with suspicion how remarkably little each town’s Farben scientists claimed to know. As far as intelligence collection was concerned, the scenario at each seized Farben factory was always strikingly similar: Where there should have been huge troves of company records, there were empty cabinets instead. Farben scientists who were taken into custody and questioned always said the same thing: IG Farben made chemical products for domestic use—detergent, paint, lacquer, and soap. And none of the scientists interviewed by CIOS officers claimed to have any idea where the bosses had gone. In a CIOS memorandum, Tilley and Tarr expressed mounting frustration. One scientist after the next “lied vigorously about his activities,” the men wrote in their intelligence report, entitled “Interrogation of German Scientific Personnel.” Good, actionable intelligence remained out of reach. Then, as circumstance would have it, Alsos agents caught a huge break farther north in the city of Bonn.

Alsos had been trailing the Third Armored Division since it first rolled into Ludwigshafen on March 23. Several days later the soldiers liberated the city of Cologne and then set their sights on Bonn, some fifteen miles to the north. Scouting soldiers reported seeing men who might be professors burning caseloads of documents in Bonn University courtyards. What they couldn’t see was that inside university bathrooms, professors were also desperately flushing documents down the toilet, hoping to destroy evidence that might implicate them in war crimes. When the Allies finally secured the university, a Polish lab technician approached a British soldier to say that he had salvaged a large pile of documents that did not properly flush down a toilet bowl, as had apparently been intended. These papers looked important, the lab technician said. And indeed they were. The man had turned over to British intelligence a classified list of the Reich’s top scientists. The officer handed the list over to Samuel Goudsmit of Operation Alsos. This group of documents would lead to what would become known as the Osenberg List. Dr. Werner Osenberg, a mechanical engineer, was a dedicated Nazi and member of the SS; he was also a high-ranking member of the Gestapo, the secret police. In June 1943 Osenberg was assigned by Göring to run the so-called Planning Office of the Reich Research Council, which was dedicated to warfare. Per a Führer decree of June 9, 1942, the Research Council’s charter read: “Leading men of science above all, are to make research fruitful for warfare by working together in their special fields.” From the council’s Planning Office, Osenberg’s job was to coordinate a Who’s Who list of German scientists, engineers, doctors, and technicians. With bureaucratic precision Osenberg set to work, tracking down and cataloguing every scientist in Germany. Osenberg’s mission was to put these men into service for the Reich. In short order he had compiled a list of fifteen thousand men and fourteen hundred research facilities. All across Germany scientists, engineers, and technicians were recalled from the front lines, an act Hitler called the Osenberg Action. This led to the release of five thousand scientists from the German Armed Forces. After being screened for skill level, the men of science were set up in appropriated universities and institutions across Reich territory where they could work on weapons-related research programs in service of the war effort. The mystery of how the Osenberg List ended up in a Bonn University toilet was never solved, but for Alsos it was an intelligence gold mine.

Not only was this list a record of who had been working on what scientific project for the Reich, but it contained addresses, including one for Werner Osenberg himself. Goudsmit dispatched a team to a little town near Hannover. There, Alsos agents captured Osenberg and his complete outfit. The papers found in the toilet were valuable, but it was an index of cards in Osenberg’s office that was priceless. “The primary index consists of a four-drawer cabinet containing approximately twothousand large printed cards (10^(′′) x 7^(′′)) adapted for multiple entry on both sides of the card,” reported Alsos. Secondary indexes included three additional sets of “approximately one thousand cards [each], $6 ^ { \\prime \\prime } \\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ X ~ } 4 ^ { \\prime \\prime } .$ … containing the same information but classified from a different standpoint and facilitating searches along different lines.” This was an overwhelming trove of information, too much for any one organization to handle. Alsos shared the Osenberg List with CIOS; there were thousands of leads that needed following up on. Osenberg’s card catalogue would allow the various teams to begin piecing together how science programs worked under the Reich and who had been in charge. The Alsos officers packed up Osenberg’s office and took him to Paris, where he was put to work organizing information. Goudsmit was appalled by the hubris Osenberg displayed after he was installed in an office in a guarded facility in Versailles. “Here, Osenberg had set up business as usual; he merely had his secretary change the address on his letterhead to… “at Present in Paris,” Goudsmit explained after the war. He also became exasperated when Osenberg tried repeatedly to convince Goudsmit of his sworn loyalty to the Allies. “I became impatient,” Goudsmit explained, and told Osenberg, “[O]ne cannot trust you.… You were in charge of the scientific section of the Gestapo, which you never revealed to us and you burned all the relating papers.” Osenberg was enraged by the accusation. “No, I did not burn those papers,” he told Goudsmit. “I buried them and, moreover, I was not the chief of the scientific section of the Gestapo, I was merely the second in command.” After that it was easy for Goudsmit to find out from Osenberg “where those papers were buried and where the missing Berlin papers were stored.” It was a city in ruins, and Berliners’ morale was sinking with each passing day. With nearly 85 percent of the city destroyed, Berlin had been reduced to rubble piles.

With nearly 85 percent of the city destroyed, Berlin had been reduced to rubble piles. The majority of buildings still standing had broken windows. Everyone was cold. The underground shelters were vastly overcrowded. Heating fuel was scarce. “During early April,” explains historian Anthony Beevor, “ as Berlin awaited the final onslaught [of the Red Army,] the atmosphere in the city became a mixture of febrile exhaustion, terrible foreboding and despair.” Nazi radio broadcasts reminded Berliners that they were required to fight to the end. According to Goebbels, “A single motto remains for us: ‘Conquer or die.’” Hitler blamed everything on the Jews and the Slavs. “The deadly Jewish-Bolshevik enemy with his masses is beginning his final attack,” he told troops on the eastern front, in a last appeal on April 15. The Russians were determined to exterminate all German people, Hitler promised, “the old men and children will be murdered, women and girls will be degraded as barracks whores.” Everybody else would be marched off to Siberia. In the heart of Berlin, in the Wilhelmstrasse district, where the Reich’s ministries were located, Colonel Siegfried Knemeyer tried to maintain order over the vast group of personnel he was responsible for at the Air Ministry. It was a miracle that the building was still standing. Constructed of reinforced concrete, the Air Ministry was a prized symbol of Nazi Party intimidation architecture, seven stories tall, with twenty-eight hundred rooms, four thousand windows, and corridors that totaled four miles in length. At the height of the air war, the place bustled with four thousand Nazi bureaucrats and their secretaries. This was no longer the case. The Luftwaffe was in ruins. Since 1943, Siegfried Knemeyer had served as chief of all air force technical developments for the Luftwaffe. His title was technical adviser to Reichsmarschall Göring, who adored Knemeyer, calling him “my boy.” From aircraft engines to instruments, if a new component was being developed for the Luftwaffe, Göring wanted to know what Knemeyer had to say about it before he gave the project the go-ahead. But now, in the second week of April 1945, most orders that arrived at the Air Ministry were impossible for Knemeyer to fulfill. In the second half of 1944, the German Air Force had lost more than twenty thousand airplanes. The Speer ministry had since managed to produce approximately three thousand new aircraft, but they were of little use now. Across the Reich, German aircraft sat stranded on tarmacs.

The Speer ministry had since managed to produce approximately three thousand new aircraft, but they were of little use now. Across the Reich, German aircraft sat stranded on tarmacs. The Allies had bombed Luftwaffe runways, and there was barely any aviation fuel left. The plan for IG Farben to make synthetic fuel at its Buna factory had ended when the Red Army liberated Auschwitz on January 27, 1945. Germany’s fuel sources in Hungary and Romania were tapped out. The German jet was superior to conventional Allied fighter planes in the air, but that didn’t mean much anymore, with most Luftwaffe aircraft stuck on the ground. Soon Knemeyer would flee Berlin, but not before he completed a final task assigned to him by Speer. According to Nuremberg trial testimony, Speer instructed Knemeyer to hide Luftwaffe technical information in the forest outside Berlin. Stashing official documents was a treasonable offense, but according to Knemeyer’s personal papers, Speer and Knemeyer had agreed that Germany’s seminal scientific progress in aeronautics could not, under any circumstances, fall into Russian hands. There was also a second unofficial job that Speer tapped Knemeyer for, one that was not discussed at Nuremberg but which Speer admitted to decades later. Speer asked Knemeyer to help plot his escape. Speer’s plan to flee Germany had been in the works for some time; it was the details he needed help ironing out. Ever since Speer had seen the film S.O.S. Iceberg, starring Leni Riefenstahl and Ernst Udet, he knew he wanted to escape to Greenland should Germany lose the war. In Greenland Speer could set up camp and write his memoirs, he later explained. Of course he’d need a pilot, which is where Knemeyer fit in. Knemeyer was an aeronautical engineer, but he was also one of the Luftwaffe’s most revered pilots, ranked among the top ten aviators in all of Germany. His specialty, back when he flew missions in the earlier stages of the war, had been espionage. From 1938 to 1942, Knemeyer flew a number of the most dangerous Abwehr (military intelligence) missions on record, including ones over England and Norway. And it was Knemeyer who made the first high-altitude sortie over North Africa, flying at forty-four thousand feet. But Knemeyer was also a pragmatist. He knew, apparently more so than Speer, that attempting to fly out of Germany and into Greenland transporting one of the most wanted war criminals of the Third Reich during the final days of the war would be a near-toimpossible feat.

He knew, apparently more so than Speer, that attempting to fly out of Germany and into Greenland transporting one of the most wanted war criminals of the Third Reich during the final days of the war would be a near-toimpossible feat. There was brutal weather in Greenland and fierce terrain. The mission would require a very specific aircraft that could handle the harsh conditions and difficult landing, namely, the Bv 222, designed by Blohm & Voss. Only thirteen had ever been built. There was only one man who had access to that kind of airplane, and that was Knemeyer’s friend Werner Baumbach, a twentyeight-year-old dive-bomber pilot whom Hitler had made general of the bombers. Knemeyer knew that bringing Baumbach on board was imperative for a successful Greenland escape. During the war, Baumbach had flown missions between Norway and a German weather station located in Greenland. Speer agreed and Baumbach was brought into the plan. In secret, Baumbach and Knemeyer began gathering “food, medicine, rifles, skis, tents, fishing equipment and hand grenades” at Speer’s behest. At the Travemünde airfield, north of Berlin, Baumbach earmarked a Bv 222 for use. The only thing that remained was Speer’s command for the group to flee. Time was running out. Berlin was nearing its downfall. All across Germany, the liberations were beginning. In one location after the next, prisoners in concentration camps and slave labor factories were being freed by Allied soldiers who stormed across Germany in tanks and jeeps and on foot. The action had begun in western Germany and continued steadily as the Allies marched east, headed toward Munich and Berlin. Alongside these liberations, soldiers also discovered Reich laboratories and research facilities, one after the next. After each discovery a team of CIOS scientists was called in to investigate. During the second week of April in 1945, four key facilities were seized—at Nordhausen, Geraberg, Völkenrode, and Raubkammer—each of which would lead to the capture of key scientists who would in turn become part of Operation Paperclip. On the morning of April 11, 1945, a unit of American soldiers with the 104th Infantry Division, also known as the Timberwolves, entered the slave tunnels at Nordhausen. Among the liberating soldiers was an infantry sharpshooter, a private first class named John Risen Jones Jr. In his bag he carried a camera, a gift given to him by his family before he shipped off to war. Expensive and sleeklooking, Jones’s Leica III was one of the first portable 35 mm cameras ever made. It had been seven months since John Risen Jones landed in France, back in September 1944.

He had spent 195 days on the continent thus far, many of them engaged in fierce combat, all the while pushing though snow, sleet, and mud—much of it on foot. Jones had walked across France, Belgium, and Holland, and now here he was, in the deep mountains of central Germany, the Harz. He had lost friends in battle and taken many photographs of the war. When his unit arrived in this little mountain town, he imagined the day would pass like the one before. Just one step closer to the end of this brutal war. No amount of fighting prepared John Risen Jones for what he saw through the lens of his Leica when his unit entered Nordhausen. The photographs he took documented the tragedy that had befallen thousands of V-2 rocket laborers condemned to die as slaves in the tunnels here. Hundreds of corpses were stretched out across the tunnel floors. Equally disturbing was the condition of hundreds more still alive: emaciated humans covered with bruises and sores, too weak to even stand. “It was a fabric of moans and whimpers of delirium and outright madness,” recalled fellow soldier Staff Sergeant Donald Schulz. John Risen Jones would not speak of it for fifty-one years. Following along behind the soldiers was a team of seven war crimes investigators. Among them was a young Dutch officer working for the U.S. Army, William J. Aalmans. Like John Risen Jones, Aalmans was deeply affected by what he saw and smelled. “Stench, the tuberculosis and the starved inmates,” he told journalist Tom Bower after the war. “Four people were dying every hour. It was unbelievable.” Aalmans and his team began taking witness statements from prisoners, who sipped watered-down milk for strength. The job facing the war crimes investigators was overwhelming, and their schedule was intense. After five days in Nordhausen they were ordered to move on. Most of the official paperwork regarding rocket production had been hidden or destroyed, but Aalmans and his team found a single sheet of paper inadvertently left behind, tacked to the wall. It was the Mittelwerk telephone list; a directory of who was in charge. At the very top were two names: Georg Rickhey, director of production, and Arthur Rudolph, deputy production manager. Aalmans found the document interesting enough to staple it to the report. Although it would take years to come to light, this single sheet of paper would eventually lead to the downfall of Rudolph and Rickhey and threaten to expose the dark secrets of Operation Paperclip.

Seventy-five miles south of Nordhausen, in the Thuringian Forest at the edge of the Harz, Allied soldiers liberated the town of Geraberg. Here, they came upon a curious-looking research facility concealed in a thick grove of trees. Clearly the place had recently been abandoned. It comprised a laboratory, an isolation block, animal houses, and living quarters for fourteen men. Part of the facility was still under construction. Word was sent to SHAEF headquarters in Versailles that a team of bacteriologists was needed in Geraberg. Alsos scientists were dispatched to investigate. One of the first biological warfare experts to arrive was Bill Cromartie, who had been hunting for evidence of Hitler’s biological weapons program since the mission began back in Strasbourg, France. Back in November, Cromartie had been one of the men scouring files with Samuel Goudsmit, inside the apartment of Dr. Eugen Haagen, when Alsos agents first learned that the Reich was testing deadly vaccines on prisoners in concentration camps. Arriving at Geraberg, Cromartie determined that the laboratory here was a significant lead. “The building and sites were on either side of a small valley and constructed under tall trees,” read Cromartie’s classified report. “On one side there was a building [that] was to have been the experimental laboratory,” he surmised, suggesting that this facility was designed to produce experimental vaccines to protect German soldiers against a biological weapons offensive. A local villager provided Cromartie and a colleague, J. M. Barnes, with two key pieces of information in the biological weapons puzzle. The villager explained that an SS man named Dr. Karl Gross had been overseeing work at this facility. Gross kept dozens of trunks and boxes locked in the upper floors of a local schoolhouse, and, while he had recently disappeared, he had left the trunks behind. The villager took the American scientists to the schoolhouse to investigate. An inventory was taken of Dr. Gross’s possessions, mostly laboratory equipment. “There were crates of test tubes and small flasks and large numbers of test tube racks. There were two incubators and an autoclave. There were two boxes of gas mask filters and some rubber hoods and gowns,” read the report. Everything was military-grade protective gear, marked as having “been obtained from the Hygiene Institute of the Waffen SS.” There was also a large collection of books, “several boxes of periodicals all dealing with infectious diseases.” The ones that really caught the scientists’ attention were “Russian contributions on", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:22:95be2f9f3544", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5935, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "small flasks and large numbers of test tube racks.

The place was cleared out and void of personal possessions. “His landlady said she believed he had burnt a lot of papers the night before he left,” the Alsos scientists noted in their report. But Dr. Gross was only the intermediary, the landlady said. There was another man who came to the facility and appeared to be in charge. He was an older man, about fifty, five foot nine, with a mustache and black hair. On his upper lip he had a pronounced dueling scar. He had to have been of high rank, because everyone on the staff deferred to him. When cross-referenced by Alsos against the Osenberg List, the situation became even clearer: Dr. Karl Gross worked under Dr. Kurt Blome, the individual in charge of biological weapons research and the deputy surgeon general of the Third Reich. All indicators pointed to the idea that Geraberg was a Reich facility for biological weapons research. Alsos agents photographed the site: the animal house, the vaccine station, the experimental laboratory, and the isolation hospital. They typed up a report and filed it away for future use. Now, near the top of the biological weapons Black List was the name Dr. Kurt Blome. Sixty miles north of Nordhausen, a battalion of American soldiers with the First U.S. Infantry moved cautiously through the forest on the western edge of a small city called Braunschweig. It was April 13, 1945, when they came upon a compound of about seventy buildings. Great care had gone into camouflaging this place, the soldiers noted. Thousands of trees had been planted closely so that the area would appear from the air to be dense forest. The buildings in the compound had been designed to look like simple farmhouses. Traditional gardens had been planted and tended to. Stork nests covered the rooftops. Inside the buildings, soldiers discovered state-of-the-art aircraft laboratories, including entire warehouses filled with airplane parts and rocket fuel. There were wind and weapons tunnels that were radically more advanced than anything the Army Air Forces had at Wright Field.

The oldest division in the United States Army had unexpectedly happened upon the most scientifically advanced aeronautics laboratory in the world. It was called the Hermann Göring Aeronautical Research Center at Völkenrode. The Allies had never heard of it before. It didn’t appear on any CIOS Black List. It was an incredible find. At first, it seemed as if the place had been abandoned. But after an hour of looking around, the soldiers came upon the institute’s scientific director, a man named Adolf Busemann. Busemann told the soldiers that this facility was called Völkenrode for short, and that it had been up and running for ten years. A team of Army Air Forces technical intelligence experts, working as part of a mission called Operation Lusty and stationed in Saint-Germain, France, was dispatched to investigate. By now the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe had destroyed the Luftwaffe, and the bombing campaign had essentially stopped. Its commander, General Carl A. “Tooey” Spaatz, had just received a fourth star for his success commanding the largest fleet of combat aircraft ever assembled for war. Now Spaatz had a new mission for his field commanders. “Operation Lusty,” Spaatz wrote in a memo, was “in effect,” and everyone “not engaged in critical operational duties” was to seek out “technical and scientific intelligence [that would be] of material assistance in the prosecution of the war against Japan.” The man Spaatz chose to lead the hunt for Luftwaffe scientists and engineers was Colonel Donald L. Putt. When Putt arrived at Völkenrode on April 22, 1945, he was thrilled by what he saw. All he could think about was how quickly he could get all this equipment back to the United States. Putt was a legendary test pilot who had been at Wright Field since 1933, assigned to various branches, including the Flying Branch. He had walked away from a deadly air crash that killed his colleagues and left him with second-degree burn scars on his face and neck. Putt was a hard-charging, Type A personality—a tiger among men. “He displayed the ability to withstand great emotional shock, to absorb it, and take in stride,” explained a colleague from Wright Field. Putt was also intellectually gifted, with a degree in electrical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology and a master’s in aeronautical engineering from the California Institute of Technology. As an older man, Donald Putt recalled the prewar mind-set regarding pilots who were also engineers. “Then, the philosophy was, ‘Don’t put an engineering pilot in the cockpit, because he tries to figure out why things happen.’” But when the air wars in Europe and Japan", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:24:961b085f5499", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5937, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "a colleague from Wright Field.

As an older man, Donald Putt recalled the prewar mind-set regarding pilots who were also engineers. “Then, the philosophy was, ‘Don’t put an engineering pilot in the cockpit, because he tries to figure out why things happen.’” But when the air wars in Europe and Japan escalated, the Army Air Forces found itself in need of fast, out-of-the-box thinking from American pilot-engineers like Putt. The Army Air Forces put the old philosophy to the side and Putt’s expertise to use. In 1944, Putt’s career milestone arrived when he was put in charge of modifying a B-29 bomber so that it could deliver an extraordinarily heavy, Top Secret payload on Japan. This payload was eventually revealed to be the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After Putt finished his B-29 bomber retrofitting jobs, in January 1945, he was sent overseas as director of technical services for the Air Service Command. Now here he was in the last week of April 1945 at Völkenrode. With his engineer’s expertise, Putt was able to clearly judge the revolutionary nature of the technology he was looking at. Most astonishing to Putt were Völkenrode’s seven wind tunnels that had allowed the Luftwaffe to study how a swept-back wing would behave at the speed at which an aircraft broke the sound barrier. This transition place, between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2, was still unknown to American fliers in 1945. When Putt learned from Völkenrode’s director, Adolf Busemann, that the sound barrier had already been breached by German scientists in these wind tunnels, he was amazed. Putt knew immediately that the facility had “the most superb instruments and test equipment” in the world. Putt was taking orders from the U.S. Army, European Theater of Operations, Directorate of Intelligence, Exploitation Division, which meant that he had access to stripped-down B-17s and B-24s if he needed them, a means to transport much of this equipment to the United States, which Putt very much wanted to do. He wrote to his boss, Major General Hugh Knerr, deputy commander of U.S. Strategic Air Force in Europe, outlining his proposition and suggesting a second idea: Why not also fly scientists like Adolf Busemann out of Germany, along with the captured Luftwaffe equipment? “If we are not too proud to make use of this German-born information, much benefit can be derived from it and we can advance where Germany left off,” Putt wrote. The German scientists “would be of immense value in our jet engine and airplane development program.” Putt and Knerr both knew that the War Department General Staff was filled with individuals who were wary of Germans in general and totally opposed to making deals of any", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:25:839e2656dde7", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5938, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 26, "text": "the captured Luftwaffe equipment? “If we are not too proud to make use of this German-born information, much benefit can be derived from it and we can advance where Germany left off,” Putt wrote.

But if anyone could get the War Department to bend, Knerr and Putt believed they could. Major General Knerr sent a memo to the War Department in Washington, D.C., explaining that using Luftwaffe technology to fight the war in Japan was imperative. He added that the scientists’ Nazi Party membership needed to be overlooked. “Pride and face saving have no place in national insurance,” wrote Knerr. The War Department General Staff was not so easily convinced—at least not now. Colonel Putt was informed that the equipment could come out of Völkenrode immediately but that getting German scientists to Wright Field would take some more time. Putt oversaw the massive airlift of German aircraft and rocket parts from Völkenrode to the United States; five thousand scientific documents were also shipped. Meanwhile, he and his staff rounded up as many Luftwaffe personnel as they could, tracking down leads and making deals with scientists and engineers in their homes. Putt informed the Germans that he could not offer them U.S. Army contracts just yet but that he would most likely be able to do so soon. In the meantime, he arranged for dozens of Luftwaffe scientists and engineers to be quartered in the Hotel Wittelsbacher Hof, in the spa town of Bad Kissingen, and made sure that the men had plenty to eat, drink, and smoke. Wait here, the scientists were told. The U.S. Army contracts are on the way. Around this time, the single largest cache of chemical weapons discovered to date was found seventy-five miles west of Hannover. On April 16, 1945, British soldiers from Montgomery’s Twenty-first Army Group pulled up to the entrance of an abandoned German army proving ground called the Robbers’ Lair, or Raubkammer. The place appeared to be abandoned, but Waffen-SS snipers still were known to be hiding in the woods. The soldiers exercised caution as they drove their armored personnel cars through a pair of entrance pillars adorned with Reich eagles and swastikas. At first glance the facility looked like a standard military proving ground—a place where bombs were exploded and blast measurements recorded. Raubkammer was located in a rural forested area called Münster-Nord, and it extended more than seventy-six square miles.

Large craters in open fields suggested that Luftwaffe airplanes had practiced dropping bombs here. There was fancy housing for hundreds of officers. There were large administrative buildings and an officers’ mess hall. Then the soldiers came upon the zoo. It was a large zoo, capable of housing a vast array of animals of all sizes. There were cages for mice, cats, and dogs, as well as large pens and stables for farm animals like horses, cows, and pigs. There were also monkey cages. But it was the discovery of a massive, round wooden cylinder—most likely an aerosol chamber—that triggered alarm. The structure was sixty-five feet tall and a hundred feet wide, and it was ringed with a network of scaffolding, pipes, and ventilator fans. Between the zoo and the large chamber, the soldiers were now relatively certain that Raubkammer was no ordinary military proving ground. The Robbers’ Lair bore the hallmarks of a field-testing facility that likely involved poison gas. An urgent memo was sent to SHAEF asking for a team of chemical warfare experts to be dispatched to Raubkammer. Two teams descended, one from the British Chemical Defense Experimental Establishment at Porton Down and another from CIOS, including Major Tilley and Colonel Tarr. At the same time, a second unit of British troops working just a few miles to the southwest of the Robbers’ Lair came upon two bunker clusters totaling almost two hundred structures. The area had been artfully concealed from overhead view by dense forest cover. The first cluster consisted of several dozen small wooden buildings intermittently spaced between similarly sized concrete blockhouses. The soldiers inventoried the contents with caution. Inside one set of bunkers they found thousands of bombs, stacked in neat piles. Each bomb was marked with a single yellow ring painted around the sides of the munition. This was the standard marking to denote mustard gas, the chemical weapon used by both sides in World War I. The British soldiers took inventory and counted one hundred thousand mustard gas shells. The second munitions depot was marked as belonging to the Luftwaffe. Here, 175 bunkers were filled with bombs that were unidentifiable to the Allies. Each bomb had been marked with three green rings painted around its sides. Montgomery’s soldiers sent an urgent memo to SHAEF asking for a team of chemical weapons experts to come investigate the munitions in the forest.

The scientists from CIOS and Porton Down were nervous about what might be inside the mysteriously marked bombs. They decided that it was best to try to locate German scientists in the area who might be familiar with the contents of the bombs before they opened the casings themselves —so they began knocking on the doors of the nicer houses in the vicinity of Robbers’ Lair. As they had suspected they would, CIOS officers located a number of individuals who confessed to being German army scientists and having worked at Raubkammer. While each scientist claimed to have no idea what kind of weapons testing had been going on at the military facility, CIOS officers were able to persuade several of the German scientists to assist them in extracting the liquid substance from the center of the bombs. By this time, chemists with the U.S. Army’s Forty-fifth Chemical Laboratory Company had arrived, bringing with them a mobile laboratory unit and cages filled with rabbits. The original thought was that the substance marked by three green rings was some kind of new Nazi blister agent— similar to, but perhaps more powerful than, mustard gas. The chemists were wrong. Extractions were made, and when tested on the rabbits in the mobile laboratory, whatever this liquid substance was killed a warm-blooded rabbit five times faster than anything that British or American scientists had ever seen, or even heard about, before. Even more alarming, the liquid substance did not have to be inhaled to kill. A single drop on the rabbit’s skin killed the animal in just a few minutes. The millions of gas masks England had distributed to city dwellers during the war would have offered no defense against a chemical weapon as potent as whatever this killing agent was. CIOS field agents wrote up a Top Secret report for their superiors at SHAEF. A menacing new breed of chemical weapons had been discovered. Aerial bombs “found to contain a markedly potent and hitherto unknown organophosphorus nerve agent” had been developed by the Nazis during the war and stashed in two hundred bunkers in the forest nearby. No chemical this lethal to man had ever been developed before. CIOS agents did not know it yet, but this nerve agent was tabun.

Underground in the center of Berlin, in a makeshift hospital set up in a subway tunnel beneath the Reich Chancellery, Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber performed emergency surgeries on wounded Wehrmacht soldiers. He gave blood transfusions, performed amputations—whatever it was that needed to be done. As surgeon general of the Third Reich, Schreiber was not a hospital doctor accustomed to dealing with triage. But, as he would later testify at Nuremberg, all of his physiciancolleagues had fled Berlin; this was not necessarily the truth. Schreiber was a short, squat man, five foot six, with blond hair, blue eyes, and a nose that ended in a fleshy point. A man of great willpower and stamina, he prided himself as setting his mind to a task and getting it done. General Dr. Schreiber performed surgeries in his makeshift underground hospital, a group of his Nazi Party colleagues had gathered for a party almost directly above where he was located, in the halfdestroyed Reich Chancellery building. Around noon, Hitler’s inner circle made its way into a cavernous room with polished marble walls and floor-to-ceiling doors: Speer, Göring, Himmler, SA-Obergruppenführer and police and Waffen-SS general Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Nazi Party foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz of the navy, Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, military commander Alfred Jodl, and SS-Brigadeführer Hans Krebs. The men gathered around an enormous table covered with bottles of champagne and a spread of food. Hitler said a few words and promised that the Russians would soon suffer their most crushing defeat yet. That morning, the Red Army had in fact begun its final assault on Berlin. Before dawn German soldiers had retreated from the Seelow Heights, fifty-five miles from the center of Berlin, leaving no front line. The Soviet operation to capture Berlin was colossal, involving 2,500,000 Red Army soldiers, 41,600 guns and mortars, 7,500 aircraft, and more than 6,000 tanks. Rumor, panic, and chaos enveloped the city at an unstoppable pace. The majority of Berliners were now living underground, in cellars and air raid shelters, appearing aboveground only to scavenge for food. Every road out of Berlin leading west was overwhelmed with refugees. Casualties were skyrocketing. To the south, a detachment of Hitler Youth fighting near the Buckow Forest became trapped in a forest fire; most were burned alive.

Casualties were skyrocketing. To the south, a detachment of Hitler Youth fighting near the Buckow Forest became trapped in a forest fire; most were burned alive. Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber’s makeshift hospital could not keep up with the wounded. During the course of the next twelve days the Red Army would fire 1.8 million shells on the city. Hitler’s birthday was also the day Knemeyer and Baumbach would flee Berlin for good. In the morning, Baumbach had received a cryptic message from Göring, who instructed him to go meet with SS-Brigadeführer Walter Friedrich Schellenberg, the notorious chief of military intelligence and Himmler’s number-two man. The end was near and everyone seemed to know it, so what did Schellenberg want from Baumbach now? Schellenberg told Baumbach that a warrant had been issued for his arrest and that he was scheduled to be taken into custody during the Führer’s birthday party. Baumbach should leave the city immediately, Schellenberg said. Anyone close to Hitler who was arrested this late in the war—usually suspected of treason—faced a quick execution. This was happening all across Berlin. Had Hitler found out about the Greenland escape plan? “Schellenberg, whom I had known for years,” Baumbach later explained, “was a clever man.” Baumbach interpreted the tip-off to mean only one thing: Schellenberg needed Baumbach alive to help facilitate an escape. “It was known among a core group of SS officers that Himmler had been trying to use concentration camp inmates as bargaining chips for clemency, through an intermediary, the Swedish Red Cross,” Baumbach explained. Of course Himmler would never be granted clemency; Baumbach figured that Schellenberg and Himmler wanted him alive so he could help them escape somewhere overseas. Baumbach located Knemeyer and the two pilots agreed to flee Berlin immediately. They got in Baumbach’s BMW and headed north to the Travemünde airfield, two hundred miles north of Berlin, on the Baltic Sea. The long-range aircraft they planned to use for their escape with Speer sat stocked and fueled on the tarmac. “We were supplied with everything we needed for six months,” Baumbach explained after the war. Knemeyer and Baumbach found many Luftwaffe officers packing up their belongings, stripping themselves of military identification, and preparing to disappear among civilians. An aide delivered an urgent message to Baumbach. This time it was from Himmler himself. The road leading to Mecklenburg was swamped with refugees. This part of Germany was one of the only regions still in German control. SS guards herded concentration camp prisoners along the roads like cattle in a last-ditch effort to keep them out of the liberators’ hands. The roads were almost impassable, and it took five hours for Baumbach and Knemeyer to drive a hundred miles. When they finally arrived at a large country home referred to as the manor of Dobbin, Himmler’s SS-guards escorted them inside. “The Reichsführer", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:30:b7129d4630b0", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5943, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "refugees.

When they finally arrived at a large country home referred to as the manor of Dobbin, Himmler’s SS-guards escorted them inside. “The Reichsführer will receive you now,” a guard said. Knemeyer was told to wait outside Himmler’s office, while Baumbach was led down a long, narrow corridor, up a winding staircase, and into Himmler’s study. Behind the desk, Himmler sat alone. He wore a gray field uniform covered with SS insignia, the death’s head (Totenkopf). The sleeves on Himmler’s uniform were too long, and Baumbach noted a cheap ring on the pinkie finger of his left hand. Himmler sized up the general of the bombers from behind his signature pince-nez and got to the point. “I’ve sent for you to clear up some Luftwaffe problems,” Himmler said, as recalled by Baumbach after the war. “The war has entered the final stage and there are some very important decisions I shall have to take.” Baumbach listened. “In the very near future I expect to be negotiating with our enemies probably through some neutral country,” Himmler said. “I’ve heard that all aircraft suitable for this purpose are under your command.” Baumbach looked out the windows and across the carefully pruned gardens outside, considering his response. Yes, Baumbach told Himmler, he had aircraft at his disposal, ready at any time. Himmler assumed an even friendlier tone, Baumbach recalled, and asked where he could get hold of Baumbach in the coming days. At the Travemünde airfield, Baumbach said. An aide interrupted to announce the arrival of Field Marshal Keitel. Baumbach was dismissed. Baumbach made his way back to the sitting room, where Knemeyer waited. By now Knemeyer had figured out whose fancy manor Himmler was living in. The home once belonged to Sir Henry Deterding, the English lord known as the Napoleon of Oil. Next to Knemeyer on a side table were two portraits in silver frames. One showed Göring wearing a medieval hunting costume and holding a large knife. It read, “[T]o my dear Deterding in gratitude for your noble gift of Rominten Reichs Hunting Lodge,” a detail Knemeyer shared with his son decades after the war. The second photograph was a portrait of Hitler. “Sir Henry Deterding,” it read, “in the name of the German people for the noble donation of a million reichsmarks. Adolf Hitler.” The reason that the Greenland escape plan was still on hold was because Speer decided to visit Hitler one last time at the Führerbunker, compelled by an “overwhelming desire to see him once more.” Driving alone in his private", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:31:5b626df7e408", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5944, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 32, "text": "a detail Knemeyer shared with his son decades after the war.

All lanes in both directions were being used for travel west. “Jalopies and limousines, trucks and delivery vans, motorcycles and even Berlin fire trucks” blocked the road. Unable to advance, Speer turned off the road and drove to a divisional staff headquarters, in Kyritz, where he learned Soviet forces had encircled Berlin. He also learned that there was only one landing strip inside Berlin that remained under German control, Gatow airport, on the bank of the Havel River. Speer decided that he would now fly into Berlin. But the nearest aircraft with fuel were parked on the tarmac at the Luftwaffe’s Rechlin test site, near Mecklenburg. Jet fuel was now as rare as hen’s teeth, and the aircraft was undoubtedly needed for other things. Speer insisted that the commandant at Rechlin locate a pilot capable of flying him into Berlin. The commandant at Rechlin explained that from Gatow, Speer would never be able to get to the Führerbunker if he traveled by car or by foot; the Russians controlled the way there. In order to get to the Führerbunker under the New Reich Chancellery, Speer would need a second, smaller aircraft to fly him from Gatow to the Brandenburg Gate. He would need a short takeoff and landing aircraft, or STOL, like the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch (Stork). “Escorted by a squadron of fighter planes, we flew southward at an altitude of somewhat over 3,000 feet, a few miles above the battle zone,” remembered Speer. “Visibility was perfect.… All that could be seen were brief, inconspicuous flashes from artillery or exploding shells.” The airfield at Gatow was deserted when they landed, with the exception of one of Hitler’s generals who was fleeing Berlin. Speer and his pilot climbed into a waiting Stork and flew the short distance over Berlin, landing amid rubble piles directly in front of the Brandenburg Gate.

Speer climbed over a pile of rubble that had once been a ceiling and walked into what used to be a sitting room. There, Hitler’s adjunct, Julius Schaub, stood drinking brandy with friends. Speer called out. Schaub appeared stunned by the sight of Speer. The companions dispersed. Schaub hurried off to inform Hitler that Speer had come to see him. Speer waited next to a rubble pile. Finally, he heard the words he had come to hear: “The Führer is ready to see you now.” Speer walked down into the bunker, where he was met by Martin Bormann, “Hitler’s Mephistopheles,” holding court. Bormann wanted to know if Speer had come to try to get Hitler to fly with him out of Berlin. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife, Magda, were also in the bunker, plotting the murder-suicide of their six children and themselves. Hitler’s girlfriend, Eva Braun, invited Speer into her quarters to eat cake and drink Moët & Chandon until Hitler was ready to see him. At 3:00 a.m. Speer was told he could come in. “I was both moved and confused,” Speer later recalled. “For his part he [Hitler] showed no emotion when we confronted one another. His words were as cold as his hand.” Six days after Speer’s final meeting with Hitler, the U.S. Army liberated Dachau, a concentration camp located twelve miles outside Munich. It was 7:30 in the morning on April 29 when fifty tanks from the Seventh Army, Third Battalion of the 157th Infantry Regiment, pulled up to what at first seemed like an ordinary military post, located adjacent to an SS training camp. The weather was cold and there was a dusting of snow. The post was surrounded by high brick walls, an electrified barbedwire fence, and a deep ditch. Seven fortified guard towers loomed overhead. The large iron front gates were closed and locked. A few American soldiers scaled the fence, cut the locks, and opened the gates. The soldiers rushed inside. A brief exchange of rifle fire ensued. Turkish newspaper correspondent Nerin E. Gun, imprisoned in Dachau for his reports on the Warsaw Ghetto, bore witness as some of the SS guards in the watchtowers began shooting at prisoners. But the American soldiers, Gun said, put a quick end to that. “The SS guards promptly came down the ladders, their hands raised high in surrender.” Other accounts describe brutal acts of vengeance inflicted by prisoners against their former SS guards.

More gunfire ensued as a second unit, the Forty-fifth Thunderbird Division, approached Dachau from the southwest. They discovered fifty open freight cars abandoned just outside the garrison. Each train car was filled with emaciated bodies. There were several thousand corpses in all. Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp, had been established by Himmler on March 20, 1933. It was originally a place where Communists and other political enemies of National Socialism, the ideology of the Nazi Party, were sent. The name came from the fact that prisoners could be “concentrated” in a group and held under protective custody following Nazi law. Quickly, this changed. Himmler made concentration camps “legally independent administrative units outside the penal code and the ordinary law.” Dachau had served as a training center for SS concentration camp guards and became a model for how hundreds of other concentration camps were to be set up and run. It was also a model for Nazi medical research programs involving doctors who would later become part of Operation Paperclip. A young U.S. Army lieutenant and physician, Dr. Marcus J. Smith, arrived at Dachau early on the morning of April 30, 1945, and in his journal Smith noted how cold and gloomy the thousand-yearold city was. Before noon it started to hail. Dr. Smith was the sole medical officer attached to a tenman displaced persons team sent to the concentration camp the day after it was liberated. He and his fellow soldiers had instructions to do what they could to help the 32,000 starved, diseased, and dying camp survivors as they waited for Red Cross workers to arrive. The newly liberated suffered from dysentery, tuberculosis, typhus, pneumonia, scabies, and other infectious diseases in early, late, and terminal stages, Smith wrote. “Even my callous, death-hardened county-hospital exterior begins to crack.… One of my men weeps.” During breaks, Dr. Smith walked around Dachau’s gas chamber to try to make sense of what had gone on there. “I cannot believe this is possible in this enlightened age,” he wrote. “In the rear of the crematorium is [a] sign, depicting a man riding a monstrous pig. ‘Wash your hands,’ says the caption. ‘It is your duty to remain clean.’” In his spare time, Dr. Smith wandered through the camp. “On one of these walks I enter a onestory building that contains laboratory counters and storage shelves,” Smith wrote, “almost everything in it has been smashed: I step over broken benches and drawers, twisted instruments and shattered", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:34:75cbd1a5d83e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5947, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 35, "text": "enlightened age,” he wrote. “In the rear of the crematorium is [a] sign, depicting a man riding a monstrous pig. ‘Wash your hands,’ says the caption. ‘It is your duty to remain clean.’” In his spare time, Dr. Smith wandered through the camp. “On one of these walks I enter a onestory building that contains laboratory counters and storage shelves,” Smith wrote, “almost everything in it has been smashed: I step over broken benches and drawers, twisted instruments and shattered glassware. In the debris, I am surprised to find a few specimen jars and bottles intact, filled with preserved human and insect tissues.” Smith asked questions around the concentration camp to try to learn more. Prisoners told him that the laboratory had served Nazi doctors as an experimental medical ward, and that everyone was afraid of it because it was a place “where selected prisoners [were] used as experimental subjects without their consent.” Although it was not yet known by American or British intelligence at the time, what Dr. Marcus Smith had come upon at Dachau was the place where a group of Luftwaffe doctors had been conducting medical research experiments on humans. This work took place in a freestanding barracks, isolated from the others, and was called Experimental Cell Block Five. Many of the Reich’s elite medical doctors passed through the laboratory here. The work that was performed in Experimental Cell Block Five was science without conscience: bad science for bad ends. That at least six Nazi medical doctors involved in this research at Dachau would be among the first scientists given contracts by the U.S. Army would become one of the darkest secrets of Operation Paperclip. The capturing of Nazi scientists would now become a watershed. One by one, across the Reich, Hitler’s scientists were taken into custody and interrogated. The day after Dachau was liberated, 375 miles to the north, Soviet commanders planned their final assault on the iconic Reichstag building, in Berlin. Sometime around 3:30 in the afternoon, inside the Führerbunker, Hitler fired a bullet into his head. The Russians were just five hundred meters from the Führerbunker’s emergency exit door. Around the corner, under the Reich Chancellery, Red Army soldiers took over the underground subway tunnels, including the one Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber had been using as a hospital. Soviet film footage—alleged by Schreiber to have been filmed days later as a reenactment—shows Schreiber coming out of a cellar with his hands over his head. Up north, Siegfried Knemeyer was captured by the British. Baumbach, Knemeyer, and Speer never escaped to Greenland after all. Shortly after Hitler killed himself, Baumbach was ordered by Grand Admiral Dönitz to go to the small town of Eutin, forty miles north of the city of Hamburg.

Hitler had named Dönitz his successor; Dönitz set up his new government in the naval barracks at Eutin because it was one of the few places not yet controlled by the Allied forces. Siegfried Knemeyer hadn’t been invited to join the new inner circle. Baumbach let him keep the BMW and Knemeyer fled west. On a country road outside Hamburg, Knemeyer spotted a vehicle filled with British soldiers on approach. He knew that the BMW he was driving would be recognized as belonging to a senior military officer, so he pulled off the highway, ditched the car, and fled on foot. British soldiers found him hiding under a bridge and arrested him. Knemeyer was taken to a newly liberated concentration camp outside Hamburg, where hundreds of other German officers and Nazi Party officials were held. He was a prisoner of war now and was accordingly stripped of his valuables and military insignia. Years later, Knemeyer would share with his son that he managed to hide his one remaining meaningful possession in his shoe: a 1,000 Swiss franc note given to him by Albert Speer. Von Braun and Dornberger were not captured. So confident were they as to their future use by the U.S. Army that they turned themselves in. Since departing from Nordhausen several weeks before, von Braun, Dornberger, and hundreds of other men from the rocket program had been hiding out in a remote ski village in the Bavarian Alps. Their resort, Haus Ingeburg, was located at an elevation of 3,850 feet along a windy mountain road then called the Adolf Hitler Pass (known before and after the war as the Oberjoch Pass). Thanks to the resources of the SS, the scientists had plenty of fine food and drink. There was a sun terrace and, as von Braun reflected after the war, little for any of them to do but eat, drink, sunbathe, and admire the snow-capped Allgäu Alps. “There I was living royally in a ski hotel on a mountain plateau,” von Braun later recalled, “the French below us to the west, and the On the night of May 1, 1945, the scientists were listening to the national radio as it played Bruckner’s Symphony No. 7 when, at 10:26, the music was interrupted by a long military drumroll. “Our Führer, Adolf Hitler, fighting to the last breath against Bolshevism, fell for Germany this afternoon in his operational headquarters in the Reich Chancellery,” the radio announcer declared.

The fight was a fabrication. But Hitler’s death spurred Wernher von Braun to action. Von Braun approached General Dornberger, suggesting that they move quickly to make a deal with the Americans. “I agree with you, Wernher,” Dornberger was overheard saying late that night. “It’s our obligation to put our baby into the right hands.” At Haus Ingeburg the rocket scientists had been using a network of German and Austrian intelligence sources to keep track of U.S. Army developments in the area. Von Braun and Dornberger knew that a unit of U.S. soldiers had set up a base at the bottom of the mountain on the Austrian side. The two men agreed it was best to send von Braun’s younger brother, Magnus, down the mountain to try to make a deal with the Americans. Magnus was trustworthy. He understood what could be said about the V-2 and what could never be said. Magnus von Braun had been in charge of overseeing slave labor production of the gyroscopes that each rocket required, and he understood why the subject of slave labor was to be avoided at all cost. He also was the best English speaker in the group. On the morning of May 2, Magnus von Braun climbed onto a bicycle and began pedaling down the steep mountain pass through the bright alpine sunshine. Shortly before lunchtime he came upon an American soldier manning a post along the road. It was Private First Class Fred Schneikert, the son of a Wisconsin farmer, now a soldier with the Forty-fourth Infantry Division of the U.S. Army. When Private Schneikert spotted a lone German on a bicycle, he ordered the man to drop the bike and raise both hands. Magnus von Braun complied. In broken English, he tried explaining to the American soldier that his brother wanted to make a deal with regard to the V-2 rocket. “It sounded like he wanted to ‘sell’ his brother to the Americans,” Private Schneikert recalled. Private Schneikert escorted Magnus von Braun farther down the mountain so he could speak with a superior at the Forty-fourth Division’s U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) headquarters, located in Reutte, just over the border in Austria. There, CIC contacted SHAEF headquarters in Versailles, which contacted a CIOS team. The CIOS Black List for rocket research included one thousand names of scientists and engineers slated for interrogation. Wernher von Braun was at the top of that list.

It was May 2, 1945, and although Hitler was dead, the German Reich had not yet surrendered. Allies feared members of a fanatical resistance group, the Werewolves, were lurking in Bavaria, planning a final attack. Thinking that the von Braun brother could be part of a trap, the Counter Intelligence Corps told Magnus to go tell his brother Wernher to come down and surrender himself. Magnus headed back up the mountain with the news. At the Haus Ingeburg ski resort, Wernher von Braun and General Dornberger had selected a small group to join their deal-making team. They were Magnus von Braun; General Dornberger’s chief of staff, Herbert Axster; the engine specialist Hans Lindenberg; and the two engineers who had hidden the V-2 documents inside the Dörnten mine, Dieter Huzel and Bernhard Tessmann. The men stuffed their personal belongings into three gray passenger vans and headed down the Adolf Hitler Pass. Heavy snow gave way to driving rain. When the group of seven arrived in Reutte later that night, they found First Lieutenant Charles Stewart doing paperwork by candlelight. Their welcome was, by many accounts, warm. “I did not expect to be kicked in the teeth,” von Braun told an American reporter years later. “The V-2 was something we had and you didn’t have. Naturally, you wanted to know all about it.” The rocket scientists were served fresh eggs, coffee, and bread with real butter. Fancy, but not quite as good as what was being provided at Haus Ingeburg. The scientists were given private rooms to sleep in, with pillows and clean sheets. In the morning, the press had arrived. The “capture” of the scientists and engineers behind the deadly V-2 was a big story for the international press. The group posed for photographs, and in the pictures they are all smiles. Von Braun boasted about having invented the V-2. He was “its founder and guiding spirit,” von Braun insisted. Everyone else was secondary to him. Some members of the Forty-fourth Division Counter Intelligence Corps found von Braun’s hubris appalling. “He posed for endless pictures with individual GIs, in which he beamed, shook hands, pointed inquiringly at medals and otherwise conducted himself as a celebrity rather than a prisoner,” noted one member, “treat[ing] our soldiers with the affable condescension of a visiting congressman.” Second Lieutenant Walter Jessel was the American intelligence officer originally in charge of interrogating von Braun.

His first and most lasting impression was the lack of remorse. “There is recognition of Germany’s defeat, but none whatsoever of Germany’s guilt and responsibility.” So confident were von Braun and Dornberger about their value to the U.S. Army, they demanded to see General Eisenhower, whom they called “Ike.” Hitler’s chemists—sought after as they were—were nowhere to be found. It was early May, and the Seventh Army was in control of the beautiful old city of Heidelberg, located on the Neckar River. Twenty-five agents attached to the U.S. military government’s Cartels Division, including clerks with OSS and the Foreign Economic Division, had descended on the town looking for board members from IG Farben. In addition to being wanted for war crimes, the IG Farben board of directors was being investigated for international money laundering schemes. A number of high-ranking Farben executives were known to have houses in Heidelberg, but to date no one had been able to find Hermann Schmitz, the company’s powerful and secretive CEO. Schmitz was also a director of the Deutsche Reichsbank, the German central bank, and director of the Bank for International Settlements in Geneva. He was believed to be the wealthiest banker in all of Germany. The reason no one had been able to locate Hermann Schmitz was not because he was hiding out or had fled but because officers were going around Heidelberg looking for “Schmitz Castle.” Despite the vast wealth he had accumulated during the war, Hermann Schmitz was actually a miser. He lived in a modest, if not ugly, little house. “No one would associate the legend of Schmitz with the house he lived in,” Nuremberg prosecutor Josiah DuBois recalled after the war. Working on a tip, and as part of a door-to-door search for suspected war criminals, a group of enlisted soldiers knocked on the door of a “stucco pillbox of a house” overlooking the city where a short man with a red face and a thick neck answered the door. Behind him, on a placard nailed to the wall, it was written that God was the head of this house.

Schmitz said he had no interest in answering the questions of the enlisted men whom he considered beneath him. If an officer came to speak with him, Schmitz said he might have something to say. The men conducted a cursory search of the house. Schmitz’s office was plainly furnished and contained nothing expensive or of any obvious value. Searching though his desk, however, the soldiers learned that Schmitz had friends in high places. They found a collection of birthday telegrams sent from Hitler and Göring, both of whom addressed Schmitz as “Justizrat,” Doctor of Laws. Schmitz declined to say, and the soldiers were only able to locate a small stash of about 15,000 reichsmarks, or about half the annual salary of a field marshal. So they left, letting Schmitz know that they would return the following day. On the second day, Schmitz let the soldiers back in. This time the soldiers found an air raid shelter behind the house, where Schmitz had hidden a trunk filled with IG Farben documents. There was still not enough evidence to justify arresting Schmitz. It would be a few more days until an incredible discovery was made. When CIOS team leader Major Tilley learned that Hermann Schmitz had been located, he rushed to Heidelberg. Tilley and Tarr had been leading the CIOS chemical weapons mission across Germany. Ever since they had discovered the tabun nerve agent cache hidden in the forest outside the Robbers’ Lair, they had been looking for Farben executives. Now they had the man at the top. If anyone could skillfully interrogate Hermann Schmitz, Major Tilley could. Not only did he speak fluent German, but he was deeply conversant on the subject of chemical warfare. In Heidelberg, Tilley went directly to Schmitz’s house. He suggested that the two men discuss a few things in Herr Schmitz’s private study. Schmitz said that would be fine. Tilley asked the Farben CEO a series of banal questions, all the while tapping on the walls of Schmitz’s study. Slowly, Tilley made his way around the room this way, listening for any inconsistencies in the way the walls were built. Schmitz grew increasingly uncomfortable. Finally he began to cry. Tilley had found what he was looking for: a secret safe buried in Schmitz’s office wall. Hermann Schmitz was one of the wealthiest bankers in Germany and one of the most important players in the economics of the Third Reich. What secret was contained in his safe? Major Tilley instructed Schmitz to open it.

Hermann Schmitz was one of the wealthiest bankers in Germany and one of the most important players in the economics of the Third Reich. What secret was contained in his safe? Major Tilley instructed Schmitz to open it. Inside, lying flat, was a photo album. “The photographs were in a wooden inlaid cover dedicated to Hermann Schmitz on his twenty-fifth jubilee, possibly as a Farben director,” Tilley explained in a CIOS intelligence report. Tilley lifted out the photo album from its hiding place, flipped open the cover, and began reviewing the pictures. On here of the scrapbook, the word “Auschwitz” was written. Tilley’s eyes scanned over a picture of a street in a Polish village. Next to the photograph was a cartoonish drawing “depicting individuals who had once been part of the Jewish population who lived there, portrayed in a manner that was not flattering to them,” Tilley explained. The caption underneath the cartoon read: “The Old Auschwitz. As it Was. Auschwitz in 1940.” At this point, Tilley wrote in his CIOS report, he was surprised at how “highly emotional” Schmitz became. What Tilley did not yet know was that he was looking at Schmitz’s secret photo album that chronicled the building history of Farben’s labor concentration camp, IG Auschwitz, from the very start. In May of 1945, almost no one, including Major Tilley, had any idea what really had happened at Auschwitz—that at least 1.1 million people had been exterminated there. The facts about the camp had not yet come to light. On January 27, 1945, Soviet troops liberated Auschwitz, and Red Army photographers took film footage and photographs of the atrocities they discovered there. But that information had not yet been shared openly with the rest of the world. A short report about the extermination camp had appeared in Stalinskoe Znamya, the Red Army’s newspaper, on January 28, 1945. Stalin was waiting to release the bulk of information until after Germany surrendered. What was clear to Major Tilley was that this photo album was important to Schmitz, and that he wanted it to remain hidden. Why, exactly, Major Tilley had no idea. As CIOS team leader, Major Tilley was on a hunt for Farben chemists who had developed nerve gas. Hermann Schmitz, while important to Farben in the bigger picture, was not a chemist. He claimed to have no idea where the Farben chemists had gone. The scrapbook was taken into evidence, and Tilley moved on in his search. Meanwhile, in southern Germany, in an Austrian border town called Gendorf, the man Major Tilley was really looking for—Dr. Otto Ambros—had just been located by U.S. Army soldiers.

Meanwhile, in southern Germany, in an Austrian border town called Gendorf, the man Major Tilley was really looking for—Dr. Otto Ambros—had just been located by U.S. Army soldiers. The soldiers had no idea who Ambros really was. When American soldiers rolled into the town of Gendorf, about sixty miles southeast of Munich, they noticed one man in particular because he stood out like a sore thumb. This first encounter with Ambros, later recounted at the Nuremberg trials, stuck out in soldiers’ minds because Ambros had been dressed in a fancy suit to greet the victors. The man hardly looked like he’d been through a war. The soldiers asked the man his rank and serial number. “Yes, I am German,” Ambros replied, and made a joke. He said that he had so many French friends he could almost be considered a Frenchman. In fact, his true home was in Ludwigshafen, on the border with France. He told the soldiers that the reason he was here in southern Bavaria was because he was the director of a large business concern called IG Farben. The company had a detergent factory here in Gendorf, Ambros explained. As a Farben board member he’d been asked to oversee production. German society might be experiencing a collapse, he told the soldiers, but everyone needed to stay clean. The soldiers asked to be taken to the detergent factory. Inside, they inspected huge vats of soap and other cleaning products. Work at the factory appeared to have been uninterrupted by the war. Ambros took the soldiers to his office, where someone had taped a rainbow of color spectrum cards to the wall. In addition to cleaning products, the facility made lacquers, Ambros explained. The soldiers looked around, thanked Ambros for the tour, and asked him not to leave town. Over the next few days, more soldiers arrived in Gendorf. These filthy, grime-covered American GIs were delighted when the so-called plain chemist offered them free bars of soap. Some of the soldiers hadn’t washed in more than a month. The chemist’s generosity did not stop there. Otto Ambros gave the soldiers powerful cleaning solvents so that they could wash their mud-covered armored tanks. Soldiers interviewed Otto Ambros a second time. This time, Ambros voluntarily offered up character witnesses. Working at the Farben factory in Gendorf were skinny men with shaved heads. Ambros said they were war refugees and that they could vouch for his kindness as a boss. They were from Poland, just across the border to the east.

Ambros told the soldiers that he had personally brought these poor workers here to Gendorf. He’d handpicked the men and trained them how to work hard. This way, when the refugees went home, they would have skills that could help them earn a living, Ambros explained. The skinny refugees were quiet and said nothing to dispute the plain chemist’s claims. Some of them even helped the American soldiers wash their tanks. Otto Ambros was a talkative man. He regaled the Americans with stories about the joys of chemistry. For example, did the soldiers realize what a miracle it was that man could make one hundred wonders from a single chemical compound like ethylene oxide? Or how amazing rubber was? Ambros told the soldiers that he had been to Ceylon, where the rubber plant grows. Rubber had so much in common with man, Ambros said. He was a rubber expert, so he knew this to be fact. Rubber was civilized. Neat and perfect if kept clean. Ambros told the soldiers that a rubber factory and a man must always be very clean. A single flake of dust or dirt in a vat of liquid rubber could mean a blowout on the autobahn one day. IG Farben had synthetic rubber factories and, like natural rubber, the laboratories and factories must always be kept perfectly clean. Ambros talked a lot, but he did not mention anything about the rubber factory he had built and managed at Auschwitz. The soldiers thanked him for his generosity with the soap and the cleaning agents. Before they left, they reminded Ambros again that it was important he not leave town. He was technically under house arrest. When American officials of higher rank finally arrived in Gendorf a few days later, they had more specific questions for Ambros. Why was part of the Farben detergent factory built underground? It would take months for CIOS investigators to learn that the factory here in Gendorf produced chemical weapons during the war—and that, after Ambros had fled Auschwitz in late January 1945, he and his deputy, Jürgen von Klenck, had come to Gendorf to destroy evidence, hide documents, and disguise the factory so that it appeared to produce only detergents and soap. In Munich, on May 17, 1945, U.S. soldiers at a checkpoint were conducting a routine identification request when a well-dressed man—134 pounds, five foot nine, with dark black hair, hazel eyes, and a pronounced dueling scar on the left side of his face between his", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:43:b56f5629f43b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5956, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 44, "text": "Auschwitz in late January 1945, he and his deputy, Jürgen von Klenck, had come to Gendorf to destroy evidence, hide documents, and disguise the factory so that it appeared to produce only detergents and soap.

Dr. Blome’s name triggered an alert: “Immediate arrest. 1st Priority.” Samuel Goudsmit and the entire team of biological warfare experts with Operation Alsos had been on the hunt for Dr. Blome. Agent Arnold Vyth, with the army’s Counter Intelligence Corps, made the arrest. Agent Vyth completed the necessary paperwork while the prisoner was processed. Dr. Blome was sent to the Twelfth Army Group Interrogation Center for questioning. Several days later, a document arrived via teletype from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), America’s wartime espionage agency and the precursor to the CIA. They, too, had been searching for Dr. Blome. The War Crimes Office had considerable information about Dr. Kurt Blome. He was deputy surgeon general of the Third Reich and vice president of the Reich’s Physicians’ League, Reichsärztekammer. He was believed to have reported directly to Göring and maybe even to Himmler, or to both. Blome had been named head of Reich cancer research in 1942. Alsos and OSS presumed that this was a cover name for biological weapons work. Blome was a dedicated and proud Nazi. His book Arzt im Kampf (Doctor in Battle) compared a doctor’s struggle with the struggle of the Third Reich. Soldiers, officers, and doctors weren’t all that different, each constantly in battle against invading forces and disease. Investigators were trying to piece together the labyrinthine medical hierarchy of the Third Reich so as to understand who was in charge of what organization. Particularly interesting to the interrogators was the fact that Dr. Kurt Blome had been part of a top-tier group of Nazi doctors who focused on “hygiene.” This word connoted disease control but was also believed to have been used by the Reich as a euphemism for ethnic cleansing and extermination of Jews. Alsos was in possession of correspondence between Blome and Himmler that discussed giving certain groups of sick individuals—in this case tubercular Poles—“special treatment” (Sonderbehandlung). What exactly did special treatment mean? At the time of Blome’s capture and interrogation, Allied intelligence agencies believed that there was only one physician higher than Blome in the hierarchy of the Reich Hygiene Committee, and that was the notorious Reich Health Leader (Reichsgesundheitsführer), Leonardo Conti. Dr. Blome spoke fluent English with his first army interrogator.

Dr. Blome spoke fluent English with his first army interrogator. He described himself as a “good Nazi”—obedient—and promised that he was willing to cooperate with the Allies. At first his interrogators were thrilled by the prospect of learning more about Reich medicine from such a big fish as Dr. Blome. Blome stated that in his capacity as deputy surgeon general of the Reich he had “observe[d] new scientific studies and experiments which led to later atrocities e.g. mass sterilization, gassing of Jews.” It was an astonishing admission. Until Dr. Blome gave up this information so freely, no physician in the inner circle had admitted to having known about such wide-scale atrocities as mass murder and sterilization programs. That Blome was willing to talk was extremely promising news. Blome was “cooperative and intelligent,” noted his interrogator. Most important, he was “willing to supply information.” But the U.S. investigators’ excitement did not last long. By his next interrogation, Dr. Kurt Blome had shut down entirely. He told his interrogating officer, Major E. W. B. Gill, that he had only ever been an administrator for the Reich; that he did nothing “hands-on.” Major Gill pressed Blome for information about his direct superior, Dr. Leonardo Conti. Blome said he knew nothing about Conti’s job. “When I pointed out that the deputy must presumably know something about his chief’s job,” Major Gill wrote in his report, “he said the organization was extremely complicated and really he would like to draw me a diagram on it.” Gill lost his temper. “I told Blome I didn’t want his dammed diagrams, but an answer to a simple question. How did he take Conti’s place if he [Conti] were absent or ill if he knew nothing of the job?” Blome repeated his position. That it was all too complicated to explain to a man like Major Gill. Outraged by the sidestepping, Gill kept at it. But by the end of Blome’s Alsos interrogation, Major Gill had been unable to get even a scrap of new information from Blome. He claimed never to have heard of the majority of the names of fellow doctors that Major Gill asked him about. Instead, Blome insisted that he knew nothing about the medical chain of command inside the Third Reich or the SS, despite the fact that he had personally met with Himmler five times since 1943. Gill asked how Blome, a “cancer expert,” had been put in charge of the Reich’s bioweapons program, a subject he claimed to know very little about.

Gill asked how Blome, a “cancer expert,” had been put in charge of the Reich’s bioweapons program, a subject he claimed to know very little about. Blome said he had no answer for that. “On my suggestion that a most important branch of war research would not be assigned to a complete ignoramus he, after endless explanations of the complexity of the German world, finally said it must have been because, as an undergraduate, he wrote on BW [biological weapons] as his thesis for a doctorate.” Major Gill felt for certain that Dr. Blome was lying. But there was nothing he could do except present Blome with information and evidence that Alsos had compiled about him since they had seized Dr. Eugen Haagen’s apartment six months before. Gill told Blome that in a series of interrogations with sixteen Reich doctors also involved in bioweapons-related research, Alsos officers had learned about many horrific medical crimes. Gill explained that Alsos had documents that tied Blome to the crimes. For example, Alsos had found letters inside the apartment of Dr. Eugen Haagen that linked Dr. Blome to Dr. Haagen and also to an SS colleague named Dr. August Hirt. These letters made clear that someone was providing Reich doctors with human guinea pigs. Who exactly was in charge of this program, Gill asked Blome? Gill needed a name. Blome denied having any idea what Gill was referring to. Major Gill told Blome he had a letter that implicated Blome. In another letter, Gill said, Dr. Blome had instructed Dr. Hirt to conduct research on “the effect of mustard gas on living organisms.” The phrase “living organisms” was a code name for people, wasn’t it? Gill asked Blome. Dr. Blome kept stonewalling. “On the whole subject of SS research, his attitude was always that it was so secret that not even [the] Reich chief medical advisor knew anything about it,” Major Gill wrote in his report. Down south in the Bavarian Alps, while the V-2 rocket scientists angled for a deal with the U.S. Army, Georg Rickhey, former general manager of the Mittelwerk, tried to blend in. Rickhey had taken a job ninety miles from Nordhausen, running operations in a salt mine. For several weeks, no one was looking for him. Then Colonel Peter Beasley, of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS), arrived in the area on a mission from the War Department. Beasley’s job was to locate the engineers who had built the fortified underground weapons facilities in the Harz.

Beasley’s job was to locate the engineers who had built the fortified underground weapons facilities in the Harz. These bombproof bunkers were extraordinary engineering feats, and the USSBS was impressed with how so many of them had withstood relentless Allied air bombing campaigns. The rocket facility at Nordhausen was of particular importance to USSBS officers, and Colonel Beasley set up shop in an abandoned barracks just north of the former Mittelwerk factory, in a town called Ilfeld, to investigate. As circumstance would have it, the barracks he chose to occupy was the building in which the former office of Georg Rickhey was located. From documents and equipment left behind, Colonel Beasley learned that Rickhey possessed extremely valuable information about how the tunnel factory had been built. Beasley asked around, but none of the locals claimed to know where Rickhey had gone. “I made daily visits to the jails in the small towns to see if I could locate anyone who might interest me,” Beasley wrote in a report. Eventually he found a man who gave him a tip. Georg Rickhey was running operations at a salt mine in the Black Forest, the man said. Colonel Beasley sent two officers into the field to track Rickhey down. Meanwhile, Beasley and his team followed another lead. “In Blankenburg,” Beasley wrote, “we found a school building with some miscellaneous papers bearing the Speer Ministry insignia.” From these documents Beasley learned that Georg Rickhey was the liaison between the Mittelwerk and the Ministry of Armaments. When Beasley’s two officers returned with Georg Rickhey in custody, Beasley placed Rickhey under arrest and began to interrogate him. He was “a nervous little man who smoked incessantly and always brought the conversation back to scientific or technical matters,” Beasley recalled after the war, but in the end he “was a most profitable catch.” “I’ve got a job for you,” Beasley told Rickhey. “I want you to begin right now writing out a full description of yourself and all the activities of the V-2 factory, and what your people were working on.” Rickhey complied. When the task was complete, Beasley told the former general manager of the Mittelwerk, “[W]e accept you as an official of the German Government; we have patience and time and lots of people—you have lost the war and so as far as I am concerned you are a man who knows a lot about rockets.

As an American officer, I want my country to have full possession of all your knowledge. To my superiors, I shall recommend that you be taken to the United States.” Rickhey embraced this news with open arms. He told Beasley that he was a scientist and only wanted to work in pleasant surroundings, like the United States. He agreed to tell Beasley where some important records had been hidden. Rickhey took Colonel Beasley to a cave several miles away. There, forty-two boxes of worksheets, engineering tables, and blueprints relating to Nordhausen and the V-2 had been stashed. This was certainly not Wernher von Braun’s documents stash, but for the USSBS, it was more than they possessed up to this point. Now that he was in possession of a huge trove of documents, Colonel Beasley realized that he needed to have them translated by someone with technical expertise. He had promised Rickhey a recommendation for a job in the United States, but first he needed Rickhey to come with him to London to translate and analyze these documents for him. Albert Speer, one of the most wanted Nazi war criminals in the world, was finally captured on the morning of May 23, 1945. He was standing in one of the bathrooms of a friend’s castle, Schloss Glücksburg, near Flensburg, in north Germany. Hitler’s successor, Grand Admiral Dönitz, had by now moved his new government from Eutin to Flensburg, which was located just a few miles from the Danish border. Speer, a Dönitz cabinet member, had been making the daily six-mile drive from Schloss Glücksburg to the new government’s headquarters. The way Speer told the story of his capture, he had been shaving when he heard the sounds of heavy footsteps and loud orders being delivered in English. Sensing that the end of his freedom had arrived, Speer opened the bathroom door a little, his face half-covered in shaving cream, and saw the British soldiers standing there. By the time the British arrested Speer, American officials had known for nearly two weeks where he had been hiding out. Speer’s previous eleven days in the castle had been spent in discussions with American officials with the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS). The head of that organization, Paul Nitze, had managed to be the first person in an international manhunt to track down Albert Speer. Nitze considered Speer his most desired intelligence target, and on May 12, 1945, he boarded his DC-3 from where he was stationed in London and headed to Castle Glücksburg “before you could say ‘knife,’” Nitze recalled after", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:48:1ba74d621f17", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5961, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 49, "text": "eleven days in the castle had been spent in discussions with American officials with the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS).

Because Flensburg was in the British zone of control, it was the British who needed to arrest Albert Speer. Until then, Nitze, an American, felt at liberty to get as much information from Speer as he could. “We were looking for absolutely vital information and knowledge and he was literally the only person in Germany who was in a position to provide it,” Nitze recalled years later. Specifically, Nitze’s organization wanted to know which Allied bombing campaigns had proved the most devastating against Germany during the war. America was still at war with the Japanese, and the USSBS believed Speer could provide them with information that might help America defeat them. Nitze was joined at the castle by two of his colleagues, George Ball and John Kenneth Galbraith. For the next eleven days the three men questioned Speer. From inside an elegant sitting room wallpapered in red and gold brocade, the men discussed which Allied bombing campaigns had done the most damage to Nazi Germany and which had had the least effect. Of particular interest to Nitze, Ball, and Galbraith was how the Reich’s armaments industry had been able to hold out for so long. Speer explained that at his initiative the majority of the Reich’s weapons facilities had been moved underground. These weapons complexes had proved to be impervious to even the heaviest bombing campaigns. They were engineering triumphs, their construction spearheaded largely by Franz Dorsch and Speer’s deputy Walter Schieber, Speer said. Speer’s secretary, Annemarie Kempf, took notes. The only interruption was when the cook for the castle summoned everyone for lunch. Speer did not mention that his deputy, SS-Brigadeführer Schieber, a chemist, also worked with Speer in chemical weapons production; that would be opening up a can of war crimes–related worms. The Americans were not interested in pressing Speer about his involvement in war crimes, and Speer was certainly not offering up any incriminating evidence against himself. Mostly he boasted about his ministry’s feats.

John Kenneth Galbraith was the only one of the three men from the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey who had toured a liberated concentration camp before interviewing Speer. Galbraith had seen the atrocities at Dachau and Buchenwald. He explained, “One was just beginning to hear rumors about Auschwitz.” Did Galbraith believe that Speer did not know about the extermination of the Jews? “No, I don’t believe he didn’t know,” Galbraith told Sereny. “Certainly he knew about all the slave laborers. I remember him saying to us, ‘You should hang Saukel’”—Speer’s deputy in charge of slave labor—“and then a few weeks later, Saukel said to us, ‘You should hang Speer.’ Nice people, weren’t they?” After eleven days of discussions with the Americans, the British located and arrested Speer. They drove him the six miles to Flensburg, where the remaining members of Hitler’s government were also arrested. Under an escort of more than thirty armored vehicles, the prisoners were driven to waiting aircraft. There, in a field of grass, the men of Hitler’s inner circle were loaded onto two airplanes and flown to a Top Secret interrogation center code-named Ashcan. Camp near Lüneburg, a former Wehrmacht sergeant was making a lot of noise. The officer in charge of Camp 31, Captain Thomas Selvester, found the man’s behavior odd. Wehrmacht soldiers who were prisoners rarely did anything to draw attention to themselves. Captain Selvester sent for the agitated man, whom he described as a short, “ill-looking” person in civilian clothing with a black eye patch over his left eye. Face-to-face with Captain Selvester, the small, ugly man ceremoniously pulled off the eye patch, revealing a pale, unshaven face. The man then produced a pair of hornrimmed glasses from his pocket and put them on his face. With the glasses on, Captain Selvester recognized Heinrich Himmler at once. Before him stood a man many considered the most powerful man in the Third Reich after Hitler. Himmler was Reichsführer-SS and chief of the German police, commander of the Reserve Army of the Wehrmacht, and Reich minister of the interior. That face. The cleft chin and the sinister, smiling eyes. Ever since a drawing of Himmler had appeared on the cover of Time magazine, on October 11, 1943—portraying the “Police Chief of Nazi Europe” in front of a mountain of corpses—he had become synonymous with evil.

Now that the little round glasses were on, Selvester was certain this person was indeed Heinrich Himmler. Still, Captain Selvester followed protocol and asked for signature verification. When Himmler had been captured days before he’d presented forged military papers that identified him as a Wehrmacht sergeant named Heinrich Hitzinger. The signature matched, and Captain Selvester sent for the most senior interrogator in Camp 31, a Captain named Smith. Once Smith arrived, Selvester ordered Himmler searched again. This time British soldiers found two vials of poison hidden in Himmler’s clothes. It was medicine to treat stomach cramps, Himmler said. Captain Smith ordered a second physical exam of the prisoner, and the camp’s doctor, Captain Clement Wells, spotted a blue-tipped object—hidden in the back of Himmler’s mouth. When Dr. Wells tried to remove it, Himmler jerked his head back and bit down. The vial contained poison. Within seconds, the prisoner collapsed. Now Heinrich Himmler was dead. An assistant to Dr. Wells noted in his diary, “[T]his evil thing breathed its last breath at 23:14.” The war in Europe was over. Germans called it die Stunde Null, zero hour. Cities lay in ruins. Allied bombing had destroyed more than 1.8 million German homes. Of the 18.2 million men who had served in the German army, navy, Luftwaffe, and the Waffen-SS, a total of 5.3 million had been killed. Sixty-one countries had been drawn into a war Germany started. Some 50 million people were dead. The Third Reich was no more. Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler were dead. Albert Speer was in custody. So were Siegfried Knemeyer and Dr. Kurt Blome. Otto Ambros was under house arrest in Gendorf, with no one in CIOS or Alsos yet having figured out who he really was. Wernher von Braun, Walter Dornberger, and Arthur Rudolph were in custody, working toward contracts with the U.S. Army. Georg Rickhey had a job in London, translating documents for the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey. The future of war and weapons hung in the balance. What would happen to the Nazi scientists? Who would be hired and who would be hanged? In May 1945 there was no official policy regarding what to do with any of them. “The question who is a Nazi is often a dark riddle,” an officer with the Third Army, G-5, wrote in a report sent to SHAEF headquarters in May. “The question what is a Nazi is also not easy to answer.” Over the next few months, critical decisions about what to do with Hitler’s", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:51:2649bdc16347", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5964, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 52, "text": "Nazi scientists?

Official policy would follow, one version for the public and another for the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). A headless monster called Operation Paperclip would emerge. What to do about Hitler’s former scientists? The fighting had stopped, and the Allied forces were transitioning from a conquering army to an occupying force. Germany was to be disarmed, demilitarized, and denazified so its ability to make war would be reduced to nil, and science and technology were at the very heart of the matter. “Clearly German science must be curbed,” noted Army Air Forces Lieutenant Colonel John O’Mara, in the CIOS report he authored on the rise of the Luftwaffe. “But how?” World War I had ended with a peace treaty that, among other restrictions, “sought to prevent the rise of German Air Power by forbidding powered flight. The result,” explained O’Mara, “was as ludicrous as it was tragic.” By the time Germany started World War II, its air force was the most powerful in the world. The mistake could not be repeated, and the U.S. procedural guidelines for an occupied Germany, contained in a directive known as JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff) 1076, promised to nullify Germany’s appetite for war. All military research was to cease. Scientists were rounded up and taken to detention centers for extensive questioning. Across the former Reich, SHAEF had set up internment centers where more than fifteen hundred scientists were now being held separate from other German prisoners of war. The U.S. Army had approximately 500 scientists in custody in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, in the Bavarian Alps, including the von Braun and Dornberger group; there were 444 persons of interest detained in Heidenheim, north of Munich; 200 were in Zell am See, in Austria; 30 kept at Château du Grande Chesnay, in France. The U.S. Navy had 200 scientists and engineers at a holding facility in Kochel, Germany, including many wind tunnel experts. The Army Air Forces had 150 Luftwaffe engineers and technicians in Bad Kissingen, Germany, a majority of whom had been rounded up by Colonel Donald Putt. CIOS had 50 scientists, including Werner Osenberg, in Versailles. But there was no clear policy regarding what lay ahead for the scientists, engineers, and technicians in Allied custody, and General Eisenhower sought clarification on the issue.

CIOS had 50 scientists, including Werner Osenberg, in Versailles. But there was no clear policy regarding what lay ahead for the scientists, engineers, and technicians in Allied custody, and General Eisenhower sought clarification on the issue. From Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in France, he sent a cable to the War Department General Staff in Washington, D.C., asking for specific direction about longer-term goals. “Restraint and control of future German scientific and technical investigations are clearly indicated,” General Eisenhower wrote, “but this headquarters is without guidance on the matter and is in no position to formulate long-term policy.” Were these men going to be detained indefinitely? Interrogated and released? The War Department responded to Eisenhower’s cable by letting him know his query was considered a “matter of urgency.” Tentative responsibility was assigned to the Captured Personnel and Materiel Branch of the Military Intelligence Service, Europe. Now that group was in charge of overseeing the scientists’ basic needs, including living quarters, food, and in some cases pay. But it would be another two weeks before the War Department would get back to General Eisenhower with any kind of a statement regarding policy. In the meantime, a number of events were unfolding—in America and in Germany—that would affect the decision making of the War Department General Staff. In the absence of policy, ideas were floated at the Pentagon. Some, like Major General Kenneth B. Wolfe, of the Army Air Forces, took matters into their own hands. General Wolfe was chief of engineering and procurement for Air Technical Service Command at Wright Field, and he supported Major General Knerr and Colonel Putt in their quest for capturing Luftwaffe spoils discovered at Völkenrode. But General Wolfe envisioned an even bigger science exploitation program and felt strongly that policy needed to be set now. Wolfe flew to SHAEF headquarters in France to meet with Eisenhower’s deputy, General Lucius D. Clay, to promote his idea. General Clay told General Wolfe that he was not opposed to such a program but that now was hardly a good time to broach it. “Besieged by the countless demands and the chaotic conditions relevant to ending the war, and the burdensome complexities of planning for the peace, [Clay] considered such efforts six months premature,” explains historian Clarence Lasby. General Clay told General Wolfe to come back and talk to him in six months. Instead, Wolfe set out for Nordhausen, Germany, where his colleague at the Pentagon, Colonel Gervais William Trichel, was running Special Mission V-2, the Top Secret scientific intelligence operation for the U.S. Army Ordnance, Rocket Branch.

Inside the abandoned rocket production facility in the underground tunnel complex at Nordhausen, Special Mission V-2 was just getting under way. When General Wolfe saw the vast numbers of Vweapons left behind, he became even more convinced that a U.S. program to exploit Nazi science had to happen now. Upon his return to Washington, D.C., General Wolfe wrote to General Clay with a revised idea. Not only did the United States military need to act immediately to capture Nazi armaments, Wolfe said, but America needed to hire the “German scientists and engineers” who had created the weapons and put them to work in America. “If steps to this end are taken, the double purpose of preventing Germany’s resurgence as a war power and advancing our own industrial future may be served.” Clay did not respond; he had already told General Wolfe to back off for six months. Meanwhile, the work that was going on at Nordhausen under the auspices of Special Mission V-2 would greatly influence the future of all the Nazi science programs that would follow. The man in charge of Special Mission V-2, twenty-eight-year-old Major Robert B. Staver, was no stranger to the military significance of the Nazis’ rockets. While preparing for Special Mission V-2 in London the winter before, Staver was nearly killed by one. He and a British colleague had been working inside an office at 27 Grosvenor Square one afternoon in February when a loud blast knocked both of them to the floor. Staver went to the window and saw a “big round cloud of smoke where a V-2 had exploded overhead.” Watching pieces of burning metal rain down from the sky, Staver did a few calculations in his head and determined that the V-2 had likely been heading “very directly” at the building in which he was working when it blew up prematurely. A few weeks later, Major Staver was asleep in a hotel room near the Marble Arch when he was thrown out of bed by an enormous blast. A V-2 had landed in nearby Hyde Park and killed sixty-two people. The near-death experiences made him ever more committed to Special Mission V-2. For six weeks Staver worked twelve hours a day, seven days a week, studying aerial photographs of Nordhausen supplied to him by the British and otherwise learning everything he could about the Vweapons.

As soon as the Allied forces liberated the tunnel complex, Major Staver would be one of the first intelligence officers inside. U.S. Army Ordnance believed that the V-2 rocket could help win the Pacific war, and for nearly two weeks Staver had been hard at work. He had overseen the collection of four hundred tons of rocket parts, which had been loaded onto railcars for delivery to the port at Antwerp, from where they would be shipped to the United States. But with his degree in mechanical engineering from Stanford University, Staver knew that the V-2 rocket was a lot more than the sum of its parts. Without blueprints or technical drawings, it was highly unlikely that American engineers could simply cobble the rocket components together and make the V-2 fly. The drawings and blueprints had to have been stashed somewhere near Nordhausen. If only Major Staver could find a German scientist to bribe, he might be able to find out where the crucial documents were hidden. For two weeks now Staver had been traveling through the Harz Mountains touring underground weapons factories, searching for a clue or a lead as to who might know more about the V-2 document stash. Locals told a wide variety of stories. Some spoke of paperwork going up in flames. Others talked about truckloads of metal trunks being hidden away in abandoned buildings, in beer gardens, and in castle walls. But this was all hearsay. No one could produce a concrete lead, and it was not exactly difficult to understand why. War crimes investigators were also in Nordhausen asking locals lots of questions. And as Staver trolled for rocket scientists, American GIs continued to dig mass graves for the thousands of corpses found at Nordhausen-Dora slave labor camp. The entire town of Nordhausen still smelled of death. While driving around on his hunt, Staver kept boxes stashed in the back of his army jeep, filled with cigarettes, alcohol, and cans of Spam. These valuable black market goods worked well in exchange for information, and finally, Staver got the lead he was looking for. A source told him that there was a V-2 rocket scientist by the name of Karl Otto Fleischer who lived nearby. Fleischer had been an engineer inside the Nordhausen tunnels as well as the Wehrmacht’s business manager, and he knew a lot more than he was letting on.

Fleischer reported directly to General Dornberger; he knew things. Staver drove to the scientist’s residence with a proposition more powerful than a can of Spam. Major Staver told Karl Otto Fleischer that he could cooperate or go to jail. Important V-2 documents had been hidden somewhere around Nordhausen, Staver said. If anyone knew, Fleischer did, Staver surmised. Dieter Huzel and Bernhard Tessmann had indeed told Fleischer about the document stash in the Dörnten mine before they fled for the Bavarian Alps. But Fleischer’s allegiance was to his colleagues, so he lied to Staver and said he had no idea what Staver was talking about. He pointed the finger at another colleague, an engineer and von Braun deputy named Dr. Eberhard Rees. Ask Rees, Fleischer said. He was the former chief in charge of the Peenemünde assembly line. When interviewed by Staver, Dr. Eberhard Rees played his own disinformation card, using Major Staver’s influence to help spring a third colleague from jail. Walther Riedel, chief of V-2 rocket motor and structural design, had been one of the four men honored at the Castle Varlar event the previous December. Now Riedel was receiving rough treatment in a jail eighty miles away, in Saalfeld. He had been mistaken by military intelligence as having been Hitler’s biological weapons chief. Agents with the Counter Intelligence Corps had knocked out several of Riedel’s front teeth. His security report listed him as “an active Nazi who wore the uniform and the party badge. Ardent.” In a series of interviews with Riedel, Major Staver found him to be a strange bird. Riedel was obsessed with outer space vehicles, which he called “passenger rockets.” In one interview, Riedel insisted he’d designed these passenger rockets for “short trips around the moon,” and that he’d been pursuing “space mirrors which would be used for good and possibly evil.” Riedel said he knew of at least forty rocket scientists besides himself who should be brought to America to complete this groundbreaking work. If the Americans didn’t act, Riedel said, the Russians surely would. Staver asked Riedel if he knew where the V-2 technical drawings were hidden. Riedel said he had no idea. Staver was working on a number of problems, all compounded by the fact that the Russians were coming. That much was real.

Nordhausen had been liberated by the Americans and was originally designated to be part of the American zone. Stalin protested, saying Russia had lost seventeen million men in the war and deserved greater reparations for greater losses sustained. The Allies agreed to turn over a large swath of American-held German territory to the Soviets on June 1. This territory included all of Nordhausen and everything in it. But Staver had more to worry about than the Russians. On May 18, 1945, an airplane arrived carrying a physicist and ordnance expert named Dr. Howard Percy “H. P.” Robertson. Robertson had been a team leader for Operation Alsos, and now he served President Eisenhower as chief of the Scientific Intelligence Advisory Section under SHAEF. Dr. H. P. Robertson told Major Staver that he intended to take rocket engineers Fleischer, Riedel, and Rees to Garmisch-Partenkirchen for interrogation, where they would be held alongside General Dornberger and Wernher von Braun until the War Department General Staff decided on a policy regarding Nazi scientists. Major Staver refused to give up Fleischer, Riedel, and Rees. They were his charges, he told Robertson. As far as exploiting Nazi science for American use, Staver and Robertson saw eye to eye. But as far as giving Nazi scientists special privileges, the two men were on opposite sides of the aisle. The idea outraged Robertson, who saw Nazi scientists as amoral opportunists who were “hostile to the Allied cause.” Dr. Robertson was a mathematical physicist who had taken a leave of absence from a professorship at Princeton University to help in the war effort. He was a jovial, gentle man who liked crossword puzzles, Ivy League football matches, and scotch. Robertson spoke German fluently and was respected by Germany’s academic elite not just for his scientific accomplishments but because he had studied, in 1925, in Göttingen and Munich. Before the war, Dr. Robertson counted many leading German scientists as his friends. World War II changed his perspective, notably regarding any German scientist who stayed and worked for Hitler. While at Princeton, Dr. Robertson had become friendly with Albert Einstein. The two men worked on theoretical projects together and spent time discussing Hitler, National Socialism, and the war. Einstein, born in Germany, had worked there until 1933, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physics and professor at the University of Berlin. But when Hitler came to power, Einstein immediately renounced his citizenship in defiance of the Nazi Party and immigrated to the United States. Dr. Robertson shared Einstein’s core view.

It had been the duty of German scientists to protest Hitler’s racist policies, beginning in 1933. Anyone who had served the Reich’s war machine was not going to be given a free pass by H. P. Robertson now. Determined to keep the Nazi scientists in his custody, Staver played the Russian card. Robertson may have been anti-Nazi, but he was also deeply patriotic. With access to secret Alsos intelligence information, Robertson was well aware that Russian rocket development was a legitimate and growing threat. Both men knew that in as little as twelve days, the Russians would arrive in Nordhausen. If Staver was not able to locate the V-2 documents by then, the Russians would eventually find them. Major Staver appealed to Dr. Robertson, arguing that his keeping Fleischer, Riedel, and Rees was the army’s last and best shot at locating the hidden V-2 documents. Ultimately, Dr. Robertson agreed. In a final appeal, Staver asked Robertson if there was anything Robertson could offer up that might help him in his search for the V-2 stash. Some clue or detail that Staver might be overlooking? Indeed there was. Dr. Robertson’s fluency in science and his familiarity with German scientific intelligence had thus far made him an extremely effective interrogator of the Nazi scientific and military elite. Wehrmacht generals, SS officers, and scientists were notoriously eager to speak with him. Listening to Staver, Dr. Robertson had an idea. He pulled a small writing pad out of his shirt pocket and looked over his notes. During an earlier interrogation of a rocket scientist named von Ploetz, Robertson had gotten an interesting lead. He decided to share it with Major Staver. “Von Ploetz said that General Dornberger told General Rossman [the German army’s Weapons Office department chief] that documents of V-weapon production were hidden in Kaliwerke [salt mine] at Bleicherode, walled into one of the mine shafts,” read Robertson from his notes. Robertson suggested that Staver use that information to his advantage. He agreed to leave Fleischer, Riedel, and Rees with Major Staver while he headed to Garmisch-Partenkirchen to interview General Dornberger and Wernher von Braun. At Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Robertson found the rocket scientists sunbathing in the Alps. This lovely Bavarian ski resort was the place where Adolf Hitler had hosted the Winter Olympics in 1936. Now the U.S. Army had hundreds of scientists set up in a former military barracks here. The food was plentiful, and the air was fresh and clean. “Mountain springtime,” Dieter Huzel recalled in his memoir. “Trees", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:58:ecc7dcd889f1", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5971, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 59, "text": "Major Staver while he headed to Garmisch-Partenkirchen to interview General Dornberger and Wernher von Braun.

Now the U.S. Army had hundreds of scientists set up in a former military barracks here. The food was plentiful, and the air was fresh and clean. “Mountain springtime,” Dieter Huzel recalled in his memoir. “Trees by now had donned their fresh, new green, flowers everywhere as far as one could see from our windows and balconies. Rain was infrequent and almost every day sunbathing was possible on a lawn-covered yard.” Huzel’s only complaint was that he didn’t receive mail and couldn’t make telephone calls. Wernher von Braun, General Dornberger, and their group had been here since being transferred from CIC headquarters in Reutte. Isolated in the Alps, the two scientists had been frustrating their interrogators, stonewalling and withholding information. Dr. Robertson came to see if he could get any better information out of the scientists. Most of the rocket team was here, including the two men who had stashed the V-2 documents that Staver was now searching for, Dieter Huzel and Bernhard Tessmann. Neither Huzel nor Tessmann had shared with von Braun or Dornberger the fact that they’d told Karl Otto Fleischer the location of the stash in the Dörnten mine. Dornberger and von Braun were under the assumption that they held all the bargaining chips. The intelligence officer Walter Jessel had sensed something was amiss with Dornberger and von Braun—that the two rocket scientists were playing games. “Control was exercised by Dornberger in the course of the CIOS investigations,” Jessel noted in one report. Dornberger’s “first instructions [to other scientists], probably under the impression of immediate transfer of the whole group to the United States, were to cooperate fully with the investigators,” Jessel explained. But as the days wore on and no deal was offered by the Allies, Jessel watched Dornberger become intractable. “Sometime later, he [Dornberger] gave the word [to the others] to hold back on information and say as little as possible.” The scientists were walking on the razor’s edge. If they said too much, many of them could be implicated in the slave labor war crimes, as was the case with Arthur Rudolph, Mittelwerk operations director. For Rudolph, it was best to say as little as possible. He described his time at Garmisch-Partenkirchen as enjoyable because it meant that “the horrible days of fleeing were over.” Years later, he described his weeks of internment in the Alps as ones where he could finally “enjoy a few days of relief,” but this relief was short-lived owing to his “restless intellect.” Rudolph demanded more of himself than a suntan, he later said. “There were already rumors that the Americans would take us to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:59:d4c02ca7fcc4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5972, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 60, "text": "to say as little as possible.

So, I decided I needed to learn English.” Arthur Rudolph’s interrogator saw Rudolph differently than he saw himself. In military intelligence documents, Rudolph was described as 100% Nazi,” a “dangerous type.” There was a decision to be made: whether to use Rudolph as an intelligence source or to intern him for denazification and investigation into possible war crimes. Denazification was an Allied strategy to democratize and demilitarize postwar Germany and Austria through tribunals in local civilian courts (Spruchkammern) that were set up to determine individual defendants’ standings. Each German who was tried was judged to belong in one of five categories, or classes: (1) major offenders; (2) party activists, militarists, and profiteers; (3) individuals who were less incriminated; (4) Nazi Party followers; (5) those who were exonerated. Rudolph’s interrogator did not believe a committed Nazi like Arthur Rudolph would make a viable intelligence source, and he wrote, “suggest internment.” Back in Nordhausen, Major Staver was making headway. Working on the new tip from Dr. Robertson, Staver drove to meet with his new source, Karl Otto Fleischer, in a parking lot. This time, Staver had Walther Riedel with him. In the parking lot, Staver demonstratively pulled a notebook from his breast pocket, just as Dr. Robertson had done with him. Staver read aloud a narrative he’d composed, part truth and part fiction. “Von Braun, [Ernst] Steinhoff, and all the others who fled to the south have been interned at Garmisch,” Major Staver told his two prisoners. “Our intelligence officers have talked to von Ploetz, General Dornberger, General Rossman, and General Kammler,” Staver said—also partially true. “They told us that many of your drawings and important documents were buried underground in a mine somewhere around here and that Riedel, or you[,] Fleischer, could help us find them,” Staver said, which was made up. Staver told the men that it was in their best interest to think over their next move very carefully. They could cooperate, he said, and give up the location of the V-2 documents. Or they could stonewall and risk being put in prison for withholding information. They had one night to consider the offer. Staver would meet the two men the following morning, in the same parking lot, at exactly 11:00. When Staver arrived at the rendezvous point the next day, he was disheartened to find Riedel waiting for him but not Fleischer. Even odder, Riedel said", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:60:c82fd1220759", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5973, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 61, "text": "very carefully.

When Staver arrived at the rendezvous point the next day, he was disheartened to find Riedel waiting for him but not Fleischer. Even odder, Riedel said he had a message from Fleischer to pass along: Fleischer was waiting for Major Staver in Haynrode, a nearby village, with “some very important news.” Staver needed to travel to Haynrode, find a boardinghouse called the Inn of the Staver and Walther Riedel drove together to the Inn of the Three Lime Trees. There, they met up with the innkeeper, who produced a message from Fleischer. Staver and Riedel were to walk through town, pass down a long alleyway, and head to the edge of the village, where they were to go to the home of a local priest. Staver and Riedel followed the trail, finally arriving at the priest’s house. There, in flawless English, the priest told Major Staver that Fleischer would see him soon. Fleischer emerged at the top of the stairs, came down, and asked Staver to follow him outside so the two men could talk privately under an apple tree. There, “in almost inaudible, somewhat apologetic tones[,] Fleischer admitted he had not been completely frank” about the whereabouts of the V-2 document stash, Staver explained. In fact, he knew where they were hidden and “believed he was the only one in Nordhausen who did.” But there was a problem, Fleischer said. He described to Staver how the caretaker at the mine had dynamited a wall of rubble over the entrance so no one could find them. This man was an ardent Nazi and would never turn over the documents to an American officer like Major Staver. Fleischer said he’d take Dr. Rees with him to do the job. As unreliable as he was, Staver decided to take Fleischer at his word. He gave him passes that allowed for travel around Nordhausen as well as enough gasoline to get back and forth between Nordhausen and the mine. Fleischer and Rees succeeded in getting the mine’s caretaker, Herr Nebelung, to cooperate. Local miners were paid by Fleischer, using money from the U.S. Army, to excavate through the rubble and retrieve the documents hidden in the mine. The stash was enormous, the crates weighing more than fourteen tons. Only now there was a new hurdle to overcome. British soldiers were set to arrive in Nordhausen on May 27 to oversee the transition to Red Army rule. This meant that Major Staver had to get the documents out fast. The original agreement between the British and the Americans was that", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:61:bf6281e1683b", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5974, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 62, "text": "money from the U.S. Army, to excavate through the rubble and retrieve the documents hidden in the mine.

The original agreement between the British and the Americans was that the two Allies would share with one another everything they learned about the V-weapons. If the British found out Staver was planning to secretly ship one hundred V-2 rockets back to the United States, they would likely consider it a double-cross. Major Staver needed to get to Paris. It was the only way he could obtain access to the ten-ton trucks necessary for moving such a large cache in such a short period of time. Staver assigned a colleague to oversee the Dörnten mine operation while he attempted to hitch a ride to Paris in a P-47 Thunderbolt. The pilot said it was impossible—that the Thunderbolt was a single-seat fighter. Staver said that his mission was urgent and offered to ride in the tiny space behind the pilot’s seat. The pilot finally agreed. Avoiding terrible weather higher up, the men flew all the way to Paris at “tree-top level” and arrived safely at Orly Field. Staver found a ride down the Champs-Élysées in a U.S. Army jeep. At Ordnance Headquarters he found the exact man he was looking for, Colonel Joel Holmes, sitting at his desk. As chief of the Technical Division, Colonel Holmes had the authority to grant Major Staver the semitrailers he needed to evacuate the Dörnten mine stash before the British and the Russians arrived. But Staver had a second plan that he had been conceiving, and, as he later explained, this moment in Paris was his prime opportunity to act. He told Colonel Holmes that there was a third element necessary to make the V-2 rocket program in America a success. Staver had been locating rocket parts and the documents necessary to assemble them correctly. But to make the rockets fly, the Americans needed the German scientists. The army needed to bring these scientists to the United States, Staver explained. Their superior knowledge could be used to help win the war in Japan. “You write the cable and I’ll sign it,” Staver remembered Colonel Holmes having said. In Paris, Staver sat down and wrote a cable that would have a huge impact on the future of the Nazi scientist program. “Have in custody over 400 top research development personnel of Peenemünde. Developed V-2,” Staver wrote. “The thinking of the scientific directors of this group is 25 years ahead of U.S.… Later version of this rocket should permit launching from Europe to U.S.” Given the enormity of", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:62:748d75e4b68c", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5975, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "cable and I’ll sign it,” Staver remembered Colonel Holmes having said.

Developed V-2,” Staver wrote. “The thinking of the scientific directors of this group is 25 years ahead of U.S.… Later version of this rocket should permit launching from Europe to U.S.” Given the enormity of this idea in 1945, that a rocket could one day actually fly from one continent to another, Staver pushed: “Immediate action recommended to prevent loss of whole or part of this group to other interested parties. Urgently request reply as early as possible.” The cable was sent to Colonel Trichel’s office at the Pentagon, and Major Staver returned to Nordhausen. The documents were loaded up and driven to Paris under armed guard. From there, they were shipped to the Foreign Documents Evaluation Center at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, in Maryland. Special Mission V-2 was declared a success. The U.S. Army Ordnance, Rocket Branch, now had one hundred rockets and fourteen tons of technical documents in its possession. But Staver did not view Special Mission V-2 as entirely complete. He still had his sights set on the rocket scientists themselves. With the arrival of the Soviets into Nordhausen less than forty-eight hours away, Staver got the approval he’d been waiting for from SHAEF headquarters. He went to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, picked up von Braun, and returned to Nordhausen. The clock was ticking. Staver needed von Braun’s help getting every last rocket scientist out of the Harz before the Soviets arrived. “We landed running,” remembered Staver’s team member Dr. Richard Porter. Back at Nordhausen, the men got to work locating the scientists who were still living in the area. Staver had a stack of note cards with the names and addresses of the V-2 engineers. He instructed every available U.S. soldier he could find to round up anything with wheels—trucks, motorcycles, and donkey carts— and sent soldiers fanning out across the Harz. Scientists and their families were given an offer. They could be transported out of what would soon become the Russian zone, or they could stay. Arthur Rudolph’s wife was in Stepferhausen, eighty-five miles south of Nordhausen, when a U.S. soldier arrived. “A black GI drove into town in a truck looking for me,” remembered Martha Rudolph. “He had a list of names and mine was on it. He told me that if I wanted to leave to get ready. He would be back in 30 minutes to pick me up. My friends all said, ‘Go, go—the Russians are coming. Why would you want to stay here?’ So I packed up what I could and left on the truck when the GI came back.” The Rudolphs’ daughter, Marianne, accompanied her to the train", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:63:d30218d97bf2", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5976, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 64, "text": "me,” remembered Martha Rudolph. “He had a list of names and mine was on it.

Why would you want to stay here?’ So I packed up what I could and left on the truck when the GI came back.” The Rudolphs’ daughter, Marianne, accompanied her to the train station. The scene at the station was surreal, recalling the horrific transport of prisoners during the war but with the roles reversed, fate and outcome turned upside down. Over one thousand Germans— scientists and their families—stood on the platforms, waiting to fit themselves into boxcars and passenger cars. The train’s engine had yet to be attached, and there was no announcement explaining the delay. Tension escalated, but the crowd remained calm until a mob of displaced persons flooded the station. Word had leaked out that German scientists were being evacuated out of Nordhausen in advance of the Red Army’s arrival. Suddenly, many other locals wanted out of the Harz, too. The Red Army had a terrible reputation. There were stories of entire units arriving in towns drunk and seeking revenge. At the railroad station, U.S. soldiers were called to the scene. Using the threat of weapons, they prevented any displaced person who was not a scientist or an engineer from boarding the boxcars and passenger cars. At the eleventh hour, Major Staver and Dr. Porter learned of one last potential disaster that needed to be dealt with. Right before boarding the train, General Dornberger confessed to having hidden his own stash of papers, an ace in the hole had Dornberger been double-crossed by von Braun and left out of the American deal. General Dornberger told Major Staver that he had buried five large boxes in a field in the spa town of Bad Sachsa. The boxes, which were made of wood and lined in metal, contained critical information about the V-2 rocket that would compromise the U.S. Army if it fell into Russian hands. In a last-ditch effort to find Dornberger’s secret stash, Staver and Porter set out on a final mission. The men drove sixty miles to the headquarters of the 332nd Engineering Regiment at Kassel, where they borrowed shovels, pickaxes, three men, and a mine detector. Back in a large field in Bad Sachsa, they searched the ground as if looking for a buried mine. Finally, they located Dornberger’s metal-lined cases, which contained 250 pounds of drawings and documents. The stash was loaded onto a truck and driven to an army facility in the American zone. On their way out of the Harz, Staver and Porter passed by Nordhausen to have one last look. “I wanted to blow up the whole factory at Nordhausen before we pulled out", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:64:1c45b8d0d275", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5977, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 65, "text": "a large field in Bad Sachsa, they searched the ground as if looking for a buried mine.

On their way out of the Harz, Staver and Porter passed by Nordhausen to have one last look. “I wanted to blow up the whole factory at Nordhausen before we pulled out but [I] couldn’t swing it legally. I was afraid at the time to do the job ‘unofficially,’ and have regretted it ever since,” Porter recalled. He was referring to the European Advisory Commission decree, signed by General Eisenhower on June 5, 1945, in Berlin, which prohibited the destruction of military research installations in another power’s zone. The Soviets were now heirs to the Harz. Major Staver had succeeded in secretly shipping out enough parts to reassemble one hundred V-2 rockets in America. Still, thousands of tons of rocket parts remained. For all the effort and moral compromise that went into Special Project V-2, the Red Army would now have no shortage of wonder weapons parts to choose from. The underground slave labor factory at Nordhausen was still virtually intact. Thousands of machine tools sat on the assembly lines ready to manufacture more parts. After an eleven-day delay, the Russians finally arrived. Leading the pack were technical specialists from Soviet missile program chief Georgy Malenkov’s Special Committee for rocket research. For every German scientist that had taken up the U.S. Army’s offer to evacuate, between two and ten remained behind. The Soviet secret police began rounding up hundreds of former rocket scientists and engineers and put them back to work. A Soviet guidance engineer named Boris Chertok even managed to move into von Braun’s old villa, the one the SS had confiscated from a Jewish businessman a few years before. Chertok oversaw the renaming of the Nordhausen tunnel complex from the Mittelwerk to the Institute Rabe, an abbreviation for Raketenantrieb Bleicherode, or Rocket Enterprise Bleicherode. Von Braun, eighty scientists, and their families were taken to the town of Witzenhausen, forty miles from Nordhausen, in the American zone. There, they were set up in a two-story schoolhouse and paid to get to work on future rocket plans while Army Ordnance worked on a plan to bring them to the United States, to the Fort Bliss Army Base, in Texas. The Americans had been obsessed with the V-weapons during the war. Now they had the science and the scientists. Major Staver’s cable from Paris regarding the four hundred rocket scientists “in custody” drew attention to the issue.

Major Staver’s cable from Paris regarding the four hundred rocket scientists “in custody” drew attention to the issue. In America, five Nazi scientists had already been secreted into the United States for classified weapons work. Just a few days after the German surrender, the director of naval intelligence successfully lobbied the War Department General Staff to circumvent State Department regulations so that a Nazi guided missile expert named Dr. Herbert Wagner and four of his assistants could begin working on technology meant to help end the war with Japan. The War Department gave approval, and in mid-May Dr. Wagner and his team were flown from Germany to a small airstrip outside Washington, D.C., inside a military aircraft with the windows blackened to keep anyone from seeing who was inside. During the war, Dr. Herbert Wagner had been chief missile design engineer at Henschel Aircraft. He was the man behind the first guided missile used in combat by the Reich, the Hs 293. This remotecontrol bomb was the nemesis of the U.S. Navy and the British Royal Navy and had sunk several Allied ships during the war. Not only did the U.S. Navy see glide bomb technology as critically important in the fight in the Pacific, but they saw Dr. Wagner as a man with “knowledge, experience and skills unmatched anywhere in the world.” The perceived importance of having Wagner’s expertise in the fight against Japan was illuminated by a dramatic event unfolding in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, just as he and his team arrived. On May 15, 1945, a Nazi submarine, identified in a New York Times headline as “the Japan-bound U-234,” surrendered itself to the USS Sutton in the waters five hundred miles off Cape Race, Newfoundland. Inside the submarine, which was en route to Japan, was a cache of Nazi wonder weapons, “said to contain what few aviation secrets may be left,” as well as “other war-weapon plans and pieces of equipment.” One of the wonder weapons on board was Dr. Wagner’s Hs 293 glider bomb, meant for use against the U.S. Navy in the Pacific. Additionally, there were drawings and plans for the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rocket, experimental equipment for stealth technology on submarines, an entire Me 262 fighter aircraft, and ten lead-lined canisters containing 1,200 pounds of uranium oxide—a basic material used in making an atomic bomb. The specifics of the weapons cache were not made public, but the notion that the Nazis had sold the secrets of some of their most prized wonder weapons to their Axis partner Japan was alarming. The scenario was made even more forbidding by the fact that also on board the U-234 was a top Reich scientist whose job it was to", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:66:7738967478ba", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5979, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 67, "text": "aircraft, and ten lead-lined canisters containing 1,200 pounds of uranium oxide—a basic material used in making an atomic bomb. The specifics of the weapons cache were not made public, but the notion that the Nazis had sold the secrets of some of their most prized wonder weapons to their Axis partner Japan was alarming. The scenario was made even more forbidding by the fact that also on board the U-234 was a top Reich scientist whose job it was to teach Japanese scientists how to copy and manufacture these Nazi wonder weapons for themselves. The scientist in the submarine was Dr. Heinz Schlicke, director of Naval Test Fields at Kiel. To the public he was only identified as a German “technician.” In fact, Dr. Schlicke was one of the most qualified Nazi scientists in the field of electronic warfare. His areas of expertise included radiolocation techniques, camouflage, jamming and counterjamming, remote control, and infrared. The navy took Dr. Schlicke prisoner of war and brought him to the Army Intelligence Center at Fort Meade, in Maryland. As for Dr. Wagner, the navy felt it needed to keep him happy so that his work would continue to bear scientific fruit. To soften the reality of his being a prisoner, his incarceration was called “voluntary detention.” Wagner and his assistants required a classified but comfortable place to work, the navy noted in an intelligence report, ideally in “an ivory tower or a gilded cage where life would be pleasant, the guards courteous, the locks thick but not too obvious.” The navy found what it was looking for in Hempstead House, a great stone castle on Sands Point, on the North Shore of Long Island, that was formerly the home of Daniel and Florence Guggenheim. The 160-acre estate had been donated by the Guggenheims to the navy for use as a training center. With its three stories, forty rooms, and sweeping view of the sea, the navy decided it was an ideal location. Hempstead House was given the code name the Special Devices Center, and Dr. Wagner and his assistants got to work. There were more problems afloat in Washington, this time coming from the FBI. If Nazi scientists were going to work for the U.S. military, the Department of Justice said it needed to perform background checks. J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI looked into Dr. Wagner’s past, based on information collected by army intelligence in Europe, and learned that Dr. Wagner had “once belonged to the German SS,” the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party run by Himmler. This meant that Wagner was an ardent Nazi. If he had stayed in Germany, as a former SS member and per the laws of the occupying forces, he would have been arrested and subject to a denazification trial. But the FBI was made aware of how badly the navy needed Wagner, and they labeled him “", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:67:622f85838ccf", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5980, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 68, "text": "in Europe, and learned that Dr. Wagner had “once belonged to the German SS,” the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party run by Himmler.

But the FBI was made aware of how badly the navy needed Wagner, and they labeled him “ an opportunist who is interested only in science.” The FBI’s bigger concern, read an intelligence report, was how much Dr. Wagner had been drinking lately. The FBI did not consider Wagner to be a “drunkard” but blamed his nearnightly intoxication on the recent death of his wife. The scientist in the submarine, Dr. Heinz Schlicke, became a prisoner at Fort Meade, where it did not take long for the U.S. Navy to learn how “eminently qualified” he was. Soon, Schlicke was giving classified lectures on technology he had developed during the war. The first was called “A General Review of Measures Planned by the German Admiralty in the Electronic Field in Order to Revive U-Boat Warfare.” The navy wanted to hire Schlicke immediately, but State Department regulations got in the way. Schlicke was already in military custody in the United States as a prisoner of war. He would have to be repatriated back to Germany before he could be given a contract to work in the United States, according to the State Department. The saga of the U-234 and its passenger made one thing clear: If the War Department was going to start hiring German scientists on a regular basis, it needed to create a committee to deal with the intricacies of each specific case. Finally, on May 28, 1945, Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson weighed in on the classified subject of hiring Nazi scientists for U.S. military research. Patterson wrote to the chief of staff to the president, Admiral William D. Leahy. “I strongly favor doing everything possible to utilize fully in the prosecution of the war against Japan all information that can be obtained from Germany or any other source,” Patterson wrote. He also expressed concern. “These men are enemies and it must be assumed they are capable of sabotaging our war effort. Bringing them to this country raises delicate questions, including the strong resentment of the American public, who might misunderstand the purpose of bringing them here and the treatment accorded them.” Patterson believed that the way to avoid foreseeable problems with the State Department, which handled visa approvals, was to involve the State Department in decision making now. Until a new committee was formed to deal specifically with Nazi scientists, Patterson suggested that the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC) be in charge.

Until a new committee was formed to deal specifically with Nazi scientists, Patterson suggested that the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC) be in charge. Patterson’s letter to the president’s chief of staff, which was not shared with President Truman, prompted a meeting at the Pentagon by the War Department General Staff. The group agreed on a temporary policy. Contracts would be given to a limited number of German scientists “provided they were not known or alleged war criminals.” The scientists were to be placed in protective military custody in the United States, and they were to be returned to Germany as quickly as possible after their classified weapons work was complete. A cable was sent to General Eisenhower, at SHAEF headquarters in Versailles, fulfilling his twoweek-old request to be advised on longer-term policy. But what had been decided in Washington, D.C., had very little impact on the reality of what was going on in the European Theater with scientists who had spent years serving Adolf Hitler. During the war, physicians with the U.S. Army Air Forces heard rumors about cutting-edge research being developed by the Reich’s aviation doctors. The Luftwaffe was highly secretive about this research, and its aviation doctors did not regularly publish their work in medical journals. When they did, usually in a Nazi Party–sponsored journal like Aviation Medicine (Luftfahrtmedizin), the U.S. Army Air Forces would circumvent copyright law, translate the work into English, and republish it for their own flight surgeons to study. Areas in which the Nazis were known to be breaking new ground were air-sea rescue programs, high-altitude studies, and decompression sickness studies. In other words, Nazi doctors were supposedly leading the world’s research in how pilots performed in extreme cold, extreme altitude, and at extreme speeds. At war’s end, there were two American military officers who were particularly interested in capturing the secrets of Nazi-sponsored aviation research. They were Major General Malcolm Grow, surgeon general of the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe, and Lieutenant Colonel Harry Armstrong, chief surgeon of the Eighth Air Force. Both men were physicians, flight surgeons, and aviation medicine pioneers. Before the war, Grow and Armstrong had cofounded the aviation medicine laboratory at Wright Field, where together they initiated many of the major medical advances that had kept U.S. airmen alive during the air war.

At Wright Field, Armstrong perfected a pilot-friendly oxygen mask and conducted groundbreaking studies in pilot physiology associated with high-altitude flight. Grow developed the original flier’s flak vest—a twenty-two-pound armored jacket that could protect airmen against antiaircraft fire. Now, with the war over, Grow and Armstrong saw unprecedented opportunity in seizing everything the Nazis had been working on in aviation research so as to incorporate that knowledge into U.S. Army Air Force’s understanding. According to an interview with Armstrong decades later, a plan was hatched during a meeting between himself and General Grow at the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe headquarters, in Saint-Germain, France. The two men knew that many of the Luftwaffe’s medical research institutions had been located in Berlin, and the plan was for Colonel Armstrong to go there and track down as many Luftwaffe doctors as he could find with the goal of enticing them to come to work for the U.S. Army Air Forces. As surgeon general, Grow could see to it that Armstrong was placed in the U.S-occupied zone in Berlin, as chief surgeon with the Army Air Forces contingent there. This would give Armstrong access to a city divided into U.S. and Russian zones. General Grow would return to Army Air Forces headquarters in Washington, D.C., where he would lobby superiors to authorize and pay for a new research laboratory exploiting what the Nazi doctors had been working on during the war. With the plan set in motion, Armstrong set out for Berlin. The search proved difficult at first. It appeared as if every Luftwaffe doctor had fled Berlin. Armstrong had a list of 115 individuals he hoped to find. At the top of that list was one of the Reich’s most important aviation doctors, a German physiologist named Dr. Hubertus Strughold. Armstrong had a past personal connection with Dr. Strughold. “The roots of that story go back to about 1934,” Armstrong explained in a U.S. Air Force oral history interview after the war, when both men were attending the annual convention of the Aero Medical Association, in Washington, D.C. The two men had much in common and “ became quite good friends.” Both were pioneers in pilot physiology and had conducted groundbreaking highaltitude experiments on themselves. “We had some common bonds in the sense that he and I were almost exactly the same age, he and I were both publishing a book on aviation medicine that particular year, and he held exactly the same assignment in Germany that I held in the United States,” Armstrong explained. The two physicians met a second time, in 1937, at an international medical conference at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City.

The two physicians met a second time, in 1937, at an international medical conference at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City. This was before the outbreak of war, Nazi Germany was not yet seen as an international pariah, and Dr. Strughold represented Germany at the conference. The two physicians had even more in common in 1937. Armstrong was director of the Aero Medical Research Laboratory at Wright Field, and Strughold was director of the Aviation Medical Research Institute of the Reich Air Ministry in Berlin. Their jobs were almost identical. Now, at war’s end, the two men had not seen one another in eight years, but Strughold had maintained the same high-ranking position for the duration of the war. If anyone knew the secrets of Luftwaffe medical research, Dr. Hubertus Strughold did. In Berlin, Harry Armstrong became determined to find him. One of the first places Armstrong visited was Strughold’s former office at the Aviation Medical Research Institute, located in the fancy Berlin suburb of Charlottenburg. He was looking for leads. But the once-grand German military medical academy, with its formerly manicured lawns and groomed parks, had been bombed and was abandoned. Strughold’s office was empty. Armstrong continued his journey across Berlin, visiting universities that Strughold was known to be affiliated with. Every doctor or professor he interviewed gave a similar answer: They claimed to have no idea where Dr. Strughold and his large staff of Luftwaffe doctors had gone. At the University of Berlin, Armstrong finally caught a break when he came across a respiratory specialist named Ulrich Luft, teaching a physiology class to a small group of students inside a wrecked classroom. Luft was unusual-looking, with a shock of red hair. He was tall, polite, and spoke perfect English, which he had learned from his Scottish mother. Ulrich Luft told Harry Armstrong that the Russians had taken everything from his university laboratory, including the faucets and sinks, and that he, Luft, was earning money in a local clinic treating war refugees suffering from typhoid fever. Armstrong saw opportunity in Luft’s predicament and confided in him, explaining that he was trying to locate German aviation doctors in order to hire them for U.S. Army–sponsored research. Armstrong said that, in particular, he was trying to find one man, Dr. Hubertus Strughold. Anyone who could help him would be paid. Dr. Luft told Armstrong that Strughold had been his former boss. According to Luft, Strughold had dismissed his entire staff at the Aviation Medical Research Institute in the last month of the war. Luft told Armstrong that Strughold and several", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:71:c2e58422790e", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5984, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 72, "text": "he was trying to locate German aviation doctors in order to hire them for U.S. Army–sponsored research.

According to Luft, Strughold had dismissed his entire staff at the Aviation Medical Research Institute in the last month of the war. Luft told Armstrong that Strughold and several of his closest colleagues had gone to the University of Göttingen. They were still there now, working inside a research lab under British control. Armstrong thanked Luft and headed to Göttingen to find Strughold. Whatever the British were paying him, Armstrong figured he would be able to lure Strughold away because of their strong personal connection. There was also a great deal of money to be made pending the authorization of the new research laboratory. Armstrong and Grow’s plan meant hiring more than fifty Luftwaffe doctors. There was a lot of work to be had, not just for Strughold but for many of his colleagues as well. A great drama was now set in motion owing to the fact that there was a second army officer also looking for Dr. Hubertus Strughold—a medical war crimes investigator and physician named Major Leopold Alexander. Dr. Strughold’s name had been placed on an army intelligence list of suspected war criminals with the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects, or CROWCASS. Major Alexander was on a mission to locate him. It is not known if Armstrong was aware of the allegations against Strughold and chose to ignore them or if he was in the dark as to Strughold’s having been placed on the CROWCASS list. But as Armstrong forged ahead with plans to hire Dr. Strughold and to make him a partner in the U.S. Army Air Forces laboratory, he did so in direct violation of the policy that had just been set by the War Department. German scientists could be hired for U.S. military contract work “provided they were not known or alleged war criminals.” The CROWCASS allegations against Dr. Strughold were serious. They included capital war crimes. The CROWCASS list came out of the immediate aftermath of the German surrender, when public pressure to prosecute Nazis accused of war crimes had reached fever pitch. On May 7, 1945, Life magazine published a story on the liberation of Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen, and other death camps, complete with graphic photographs. This was some of the first documentary evidence presented to the public. When confronted by these ghastly images, people all over the world expressed their outrage at the scale of atrocity that had been committed by the Nazis.

Death camps, slave labor camps, the systematic extermination of entire groups of people—this defied the rules of war. The idea of having a war crimes trial appealed to the general public as a means of holding individual Nazis accountable for the wickedness of their crimes. The group responsible for investigating war crimes was the United Nations War Crimes Commission (UNWCC), located in London and founded by the Allies in 1942 (it was originally called the United Nations Commission for the Investigation of War Crimes). The War Crimes Commission was not responsible for hunting down the criminals; that job was delegated to SHAEF. The War Crimes Commission had three committees: Committee I dealt with lists, Committee II coordinated enforcement issues with SHAEF, and Committee III gave advice on legal points. The commission and its committees worked in concert with CROWCASS, also located in Paris, which was responsible for gathering and maintaining information about suspected war criminals. After the fighting stopped, SHAEF sent war crimes investigators into the field to locate German doctors with the purpose of interrogating them. One of these investigators was Major Leopold Alexander, a Boston-based psychiatrist and neurologist and a physician with the U.S. Army. Dr. Alexander had been tending to wounded war veterans at a military hospital in England when he learned about his new assignment, just two weeks after the end of the war. With this undertaking, his whole life would change, as would his understanding of what it meant to be a doctor and what it meant to be an American. Dr. Alexander would unwittingly become one of the most important figures in the Nuremberg doctors’ trial. And he would inadvertently become a central player in one of the most dramatic events in the history of Operation Paperclip. That would take another seven years. For now, at war’s end, Dr. Alexander accepted his orders from SHAEF, boarded a military transport airplane in England, and headed for Germany to begin war crimes investigative work. His first stop was the Dachau concentration camp. Dr. Alexander did not yet know that it was inside Dachau, in the secret barracks called Experimental Cell Block Five, that Luftwaffe doctors had conducted some of the most barbaric and criminal medical experiments of the war. On May 23, 1945, Dr. Alexander, 39, was seated inside an American military transport airplane flying into Munich when, approximately fifteen miles north of the airport, his plane circled low and he saw the liberated Dachau concentration camp for the first time. “Surviving inmates were waving and cheering at the plane and", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:73:e80fc5483131", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5986, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 74, "text": "inside Dachau, in the secret barracks called Experimental Cell Block Five, that Luftwaffe doctors had conducted some of the most barbaric and criminal medical experiments of the war.

American aircraft brought fresh corned beef, potato salad, and real coffee by the ton to the newly liberated prisoners, many of whom were still too weak to leave the camp. The airplanes also brought doctors and nurses with the American Red Cross and the U.S. Army Typhus Commission and also, on occasion, a medical war crimes investigator like Dr. Alexander. The Dachau concentration camp was the first stop on a long list of Reich medical facilities and institutions that Dr. Alexander was scheduled to visit, locations where medical crimes were suspected of having taken place. With him, Dr. Alexander carried SHAEF instructions that granted him “full powers to investigate everything of interest” and also gave him the authority to “remove documents, equipment, or personnel as deemed necessary.” Fate and circumstance had prepared him for the job. Like Samuel Goudsmit, the scientific director of Operation Alsos, Dr. Alexander had a unique background that qualified him to investigate German doctors and had also made things personal. A Jew, he had once been a rising star among Germany’s medical elite. In 1933, Germany’s race laws forbade the twenty-eight-year-old physician from practicing medicine any longer. Devastated, he left the country and wound up in America. Now, thirteen years later, he was back on German soil. His former existence here seemed like a lifetime ago. From as far back as he could remember, Leopold Alexander longed to be a doctor, like his father, Gustav. “One of the strongest unconscious motives for becoming a physician was the strong bond of identification with my father,” he once said, explaining the pull toward medicine. Gustav Alexander was an ear, nose, and throat doctor in turn-of-the-century Vienna, a distinguished scholar who published more than eighty scientific papers before Leopold was born. His mother, Gisela, was the first woman awarded a PhD in philosophy from the University of Vienna, the oldest university in the German-speaking world. From a young age Leopold led a charmed life. The Alexanders were sophisticated, wealthy professionals who lived in intellectual-bohemian splendor in a huge house with live peacocks on the lawns.

Sigmund Freud was a frequent guest, as was the composer Gustav Mahler. By the time Leopold was fifteen, he was allowed to accompany his father on weekend hospital rounds. The father-son bond grew deep. On weekends they would walk through Vienna’s parks or museums, always engaged in lively conversation about history, anthropology, and medicine, as Dr. Alexander later recalled. In 1929, Leopold Alexander graduated from the University of Vienna Medical School and became a doctor, specializing in the evolution and pathology of the brain. For almost every aspiring physician in Europe at the time, the goal was to study medicine in Germany, and in 1932 Dr. Alexander was invited to enroll at the prestigious Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research in Berlin. There he first rubbed elbows with Germany’s leading medical doctors, including Karl Kleist, the distinguished professor of brain pathology who would become his mentor. Alexander focused his studies on brain disorders and began fieldwork on patients with schizophrenia. Life was full of promise. Tragedy struck in two cruel blows. In 1932, Gustav Alexander was killed by a former mental patient—murdered in cold blood on the streets of Vienna by a man who, ten years earlier, had been hospitalized and declared insane. The second tragedy occurred in January of 1933, when Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany. National Socialism was on the rise. For every Jew in Germany, life was about to change inexorably. Fortune blessed Dr. Alexander. On January 20, 1933, just days before Hitler took power, the ambitious physician prepared to decamp to rural China to study mental illness. “I have accepted an invitation to go for half a year to Beijing Union Medical College in Beijing (China) as an honorary lecturer in neurology and psychiatry,” Dr. Alexander wrote to his professors at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, promising to return to Germany by October 1, 1933. It was a promise he was never to fulfill. Within two months of Hitler’s taking power, the Nazis initiated a nationwide boycott of Jewish doctors, lawyers, and business professionals. This was followed, in April 1933, by the Reich’s Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. It was now illegal for non-Aryans to work as civil servants, a ban that included every university teaching position throughout Germany. In Frankfurt, where Dr. Alexander had lived, sixty-nine Jewish professors were fired. The news of Germany’s radical transformation reached Dr. Alexander in China. The Alexander family lawyer, Maximilian Friedmann, wrote him a letter warning against return. “The prospects in Germany are most unfavorable,” Friedmann said.

The Alexander family lawyer, Maximilian Friedmann, wrote him a letter warning against return. “The prospects in Germany are most unfavorable,” Friedmann said. An uncle, Robert Alexander, was even more candid about what was happening in Nazi Germany when he wrote to Dr. Alexander to say that the nation had “succumbed to the swastika.” A Jewish colleague and friend, a neurologist named Arnold Merzbach, also penned a letter to Dr. Alexander in despair, telling him that all of their Jewish colleagues in Frankfurt had been dismissed from their university posts. “Our very existences are falling apart,” Merzbach wrote. “We are all without hope.” For months, Dr. Alexander lived in denial. He clung to the fantasy that Nazi laws would not apply to him, and he vowed to return once his fellowship ended. In China, Dr. Alexander was in charge of the neurological departments of several field hospitals, where he tended to soldiers with head injuries received on the battlefield. Ignoring the Nazi mandate that now barred Jews from working as doctors or professors, he wrote a letter to Professor Kleist, his mentor in Germany, saying how much he looked forward to returning home. Kleist wrote back to say that his return to Germany was “totally impossible.… You as a Jew [since] you have not served as a soldier in the First World War, can not be state employed.” In closing, Kleist wrote, “Have no false hopes.” The letter may have saved Dr. Alexander’s life. Untethered in China, Alexander was now a nomad, a man without a home to return to. With remarkable ambition and fortitude, he pressed on. As his father had done before him, he wrote and published scientific papers; his were on mental illness, which made him a viable candidate for a fellowship in America. Fortune again favored him when, in the fall of 1933, he learned that he had been awarded a position at a state mental hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts, fifty miles outside Boston. Dr. Alexander boarded an American steamship called President Jackson and set sail for America by way of Japan. Out at sea, a strange event occurred. It happened in the middle of the long journey, when his ship was more than a thousand miles from land. A series of violent storms struck, sending passengers inside for days until finally the weather cleared. On the first clear day, Dr. Alexander ventured outside to play shuffleboard.

Gazing out across the wide sea, he spotted an enormous single wave traveling with great speed and force, bearing down on his tiny steamship. There was no escape from what he quickly recognized as a tidal wave. Before Dr. Alexander could run back inside the ship, the President Jackson was lifted up by this great wave. “The ship traveled up the steep slope very slowly, further and further, until we finally reached the top,” he wrote to his brother, Theo. And then, with the ship balancing precariously at the top of the wave, he described the terrifying feeling that followed. “Suddenly there was nothing behind it… nothing but a steep descent.” The ship began to free-fall, “its nose plunged deep into the water.… The impact was harsh, water splashed to all sides, and things fell to this side and that in the kitchen and common rooms.” The ship regained its balance, almost effortlessly, and steamed on. “The whole thing happened so unbelievably fast,” Alexander wrote. “When it was over, I said to myself now I understand the meaning of the saying, ‘the ocean opens up before you and swallows you whole.’” It did not take long for Dr. Alexander to thrive in America. He was a supremely hard worker. On average he slept five hours a night. Working as a doctor at a New England mental institution was endlessly fascinating to him. He once told a reporter that what interested him most was determining what made men tick. Only a few months after his arrival in New England, he was promoted to a fulltime position in the neuropsychiatric ward at Boston State Hospital. While performing hospital rounds in 1934, he met a social worker named Phyllis Harrington. They fell in love and married. By 1938 they had two children, a boy and a girl. A prolific writer, Dr. Alexander published fifty scientific papers. By the end of the decade he’d been hired to teach at Harvard Medical School. He was a U.S. citizen now. Journalists wrote newspaper articles about the “doctor from Vienna,” citing his outstanding accomplishments in the field of mental illness. He had a new home; he had been accepted as one of Boston’s medical elite. In December 1941 America went to war. Dr. Alexander joined the fight and was sent to the Sixtyfifth General Hospital in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and then to an army hospital in England.

For the duration of the war, Dr. Alexander helped wounded soldiers recover from shell shock. He also collected data on flight fatigue. After the Germans surrendered, he expected to be sent home. Instead he received his unprecedented order from SHAEF. He was to go to Germany and investigate allegations of Nazi medical crimes. In doing so, he would come face-to-face with former professors, mentors, and fellow students. It was his job to figure out who might be guilty and who was not. Dr. Alexander’s first trip to Dachau did not produce any significant leads despite rumors that barbaric medical experiments had gone on there. On June 5, 1945, he traveled the twelve miles to Munich to visit the Luftwaffe’s Institute for Aviation Medicine . This research facility was headed by a radiologist named Georg August Weltz, still working despite Germany’s collapse. On paper Weltz was a man of repute. He was gentle-looking, fifty-six years old with a shock of white hair and a wrinkled, sun-tanned face. In their first interview Weltz told Alexander he had worked as a military doctor his entire life, beginning as a Balloon Corps physician in World War I. Dr. Alexander had a SHAEF dossier on Weltz that revealed Weltz had joined the Nazi Party in 1937, after which he had moved quickly up the Reich’s medical chain of command. By 1941 he reported directly to the air marshal of the Luftwaffe, Erhard Milch, who reported to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. By war’s end, there were only a few men with more medical authority on Luftwaffe issues than Georg August Weltz—one of them being Dr. Hubertus Strughold. In their first interview, Weltz told Dr. Alexander that it had been his job to conduct a variety of research on methods of saving Luftwaffe pilots’ lives. Weltz cited what happened to Luftwaffe pilots in 1940 during the Battle of Britain. Many had been shot down over the English Channel by the British Royal Air Force and had bailed out of their crashing airplanes and initially survived. The fatalities, Weltz explained, often occurred hours later, usually from hypothermia. The bodies of many Luftwaffe pilots had been rescued from the icy waters of the channel just minutes after they had frozen to death. The Luftwaffe wanted to know if, through medical research, doctors could learn how to “unfreeze a man,” to bring him back to life. Dr. Weltz told Dr. Alexander that he and his team of researchers had performed groundbreaking research in this area. Weltz declared that they had in fact made a “startling and useful discovery.” The results, said", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:78:18b1afcc7299", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5991, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 79, "text": "of many Luftwaffe pilots had been rescued from the icy waters of the channel just minutes after they had frozen to death.

Dr. Weltz told Dr. Alexander that he and his team of researchers had performed groundbreaking research in this area. Weltz declared that they had in fact made a “startling and useful discovery.” The results, said Weltz, were simply “astounding.” Weltz hesitated to provide details but promised that the U.S. Army would be very interested in the knowledge he possessed. Weltz asked Dr. Alexander if a deal could be made. Weltz said that he was interested in securing a grant with the Rockefeller Foundation. Dr. Alexander explained that he had no authority with any private-sector foundation and that, before anything else, he needed Weltz to tell him about this so-called “astounding” discovery. Weltz said he and his team had solved an age-old riddle: Can a man who has frozen to death be brought back to life? The answer, Weltz confided, was yes. He had proof. He and his team had solved this medical conundrum through a radical rewarming technique they’d invented. Alexander asked Weltz to be more specific. Weltz said success was dependent upon precise body temperature and duration of rewarming in direct proportion to a man’s weight. He was not at liberty to provide data just yet, but the method his team had developed was so effective that the Luftwaffe air-sea rescue service had employed this very technique during the war. The experiments, said Weltz, had been conducted on large animals. Cows, horses, and “adult pigs.” Dr. Alexander was in a conundrum. Should he have Weltz arrested? Or was it best to try to learn more? “I still felt it wiser for the purposes of this investigation not to resort to coercive measures such as an arrest,” Alexander explained. He asked Weltz to take him to the laboratory where these experiments on large animals were performed. Weltz claimed that because of heavy bomb damage in Munich the Luftwaffe’s test facility for its rewarming techniques had been moved out to a dairy farm in the rural village of Weihenstephan. Alexander and Weltz drove there together in an army jeep. An inspection of the farm revealed a stateof-the-art low-pressure chamber concealed in a barn. This, Weltz explained, was where Luftwaffe pilots learned performance limits under medical supervision. Also called a high-altitude chamber, the apparatus allowed aviation doctors to simulate the effects of high altitude on the body. But the rewarming facilities were nowhere to be seen.

Where were they? Dr. Alexander asked. Weltz hesitated and then explained. They’d been moved, Weltz said—this time to an estate near Freising, at a government-owned experimental agricultural station. Dr. Alexander insisted on seeing the Freising facility, and the two men got back into the army jeep and drove on. In Freising, Alexander was shown yet another impressive medical research facility, also hidden in a barn, complete with a library and X-ray facilities, all meticulously preserved. But the laboratory was clearly designed to handle experiments on small animals, mice and guinea pigs, not larger animals like cows, horses, and adult pigs. There were records, drawings, and charts of the freezing experiments—all carefully preserved. But, again, they chronicled experiments on small animals, mostly mice. Where had the large animal experiments taken place? Weltz took Alexander to the rear of the barn, behind a stable and into a separate shed located far in the back of the property. There Weltz pointed to two dirty wooden tubs, both cracked. The grim reality of Dr. Weltz’s Luftwaffe research became painfully clear. “I came away from all these interviews with the distinct conviction that experimental studies on human beings, either by members of this group themselves, or by other workers well known to and affiliated [with] the members of this group, had been performed but were being concealed,” Dr. Alexander wrote. Without an admission of guilt, he had only suspicion. To make an arrest, he needed evidence. He thanked Dr. Weltz for his assistance and told him that he would be returning sometime in the future for a follow-up visit. Dr. Alexander had been on German soil for two weeks, and the deviance of Nazi science overwhelmed him. In a letter to his wife, Phyllis, he described what had become of German science under Nazi rule. “German science presents a grim spectacle,” he wrote. “Grim for many reasons. First it became incompetent and then it was drawn into the maelstrom of depravity of which this country reeks—the smell of the concentration camps, the smell of violent death, torture and suffering.” German doctors were not practicing science, Alexander said, but “really depraved pseudoscientific criminality.” In addition to investigating crimes committed in the name of aviation medical research, Dr. Alexander was the lead investigator looking at crimes committed in the name of neuropsychiatry and neuropathology. In this capacity, he came face-to-face with the odious and core Nazi belief that had informed the practice of medicine under Hitler’s rule. Not only were all people not created equal in the eyes of the Third Reich, but some people were actually not humans at all.

Not only were all people not created equal in the eyes of the Third Reich, but some people were actually not humans at all. According to Nazi ideology, Untermenschen—subhumans, as they were called, a designation that included Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Poles, Slavs, Russian prisoners of war, the handicapped, the mentally ill, and others—were no different from white mice or lab rabbits whose bodies could thereby be experimented on to advance the Reich’s medical goals. “The sub-human is a biological creature, crafted by nature,” according to Heinrich Himmler, “which has hands, legs, eyes, and mouth, even the semblance of a brain. Nevertheless, this terrible creature is only a partial human being.… Not all of those who appear human are in fact so.” German citizens were asked to believe this pseudo-science; millions did not protest. German scientists and physicians used this racial policy to justify torturous medical experiments resulting in maiming and death. In the case of the handicapped and the mentally ill, the Untermenschen theory was used by German doctors and technicians to justify genocide. As a war crimes investigator, Dr. Alexander was one of the first American servicemen to learn that the Reich had first sterilized and then euthanized nearly its entire population of mentally ill persons, including tens of thousands of children, under the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring. All across southern Germany, one German physician after the next admitted to Dr. Alexander his knowledge of the child euthanasia program. This included Dr. Alexander’s own mentor and former professor, the neurologist Karl Kleist. During an interview in Frankfurt, Kleist confessed to Dr. Alexander that he had known of the policy of euthanasia, and he handed over military psychiatric reports that allowed him to circumvent personal responsibility and claim he was just following orders. Kleist was not arrested, but a few days later he was removed from his teaching job. The former teacher and student never spoke again, and it remains a mystery if Dr. Alexander requested that Kleist be fired. Within a few years Kleist’s name would appear on a secret Paperclip recruiting list. It is not known if he came to the United States. Each day brought atrocious new information. “It sometimes seems as if the Nazis had taken special pains in making practically every nightmare come true,” Dr. Alexander later told his wife, comparing Reich medicine to something out of a dark German fairy tale.

Whereas doctors who knew about the euthanasia program tended to be forthcoming with information—the program was “justified” by a German law kept secret from the general public—it struck Dr. Alexander that criminal human experiments by Luftwaffe doctors, like the freezing experiments Weltz was involved in, appeared to have been more skillfully concealed. If Dr. Alexander wanted to learn the facts about what Luftwaffe doctors had been up to during the war, he knew that he had to understand the bigger picture. And he also had to determine where else the crimes might have taken place. The best way to do this was to interview the man nearest the top, Dr. Hubertus Strughold. Strughold had directed the Aviation Medical Research Institute for the Luftwaffe for ten of the twelve years of Nazi Party rule. When Dr. Alexander learned that Dr. Strughold was in Göttingen, in the British zone, he headed there. En route to Göttingen, Dr. Alexander had a fortuitous break. “A curious coincidence played into my hands,” he wrote. “On my way to Göttingen… while having dinner in the Officers’ mess of the 433rd A. A. Bn. [Army Battalion] in camp Rennerod, Westerwald, I happened to meet another casual guest, an army chaplain, Lieutenant Bigelow. In the course of our conversation, Lt. Bigelow told me he was quite eager to get my ideas about rather cruel experiments on human beings, which had been performed at Dachau concentration camp. He had learned of them from a broadcast a few days earlier when ex-prisoners of Dachau had talked about these grim experiments over the Allied radio in Germany.” This was exactly the kind of lead Dr. Alexander was looking for, and he asked Lieutenant Bigelow to share with him anything else he remembered from the radio report. Lieutenant Bigelow told Alexander that as a member of the clergy he had ministered to many war victims. He had heard frightful stories about what had gone on in the medical blocks at the concentration camps. But nothing compared to what he had heard in that radio report. Doctors at Dachau had frozen people to death, in tubs of ice-cold water, to see if they could be unfrozen and brought back to life. These experiments were apparently meant to simulate conditions that Luftwaffe pilots went through after they’d been shot down over the English Channel, Bigelow said. Dr. Alexander now had a solid new lead. To his mind, the experiments Bigelow was referring to sounded “strikingly similar to the animal experiments performed by Dr. Weltz and his group” at the Freising farm.

Dr. Alexander now had a solid new lead. To his mind, the experiments Bigelow was referring to sounded “strikingly similar to the animal experiments performed by Dr. Weltz and his group” at the Freising farm. Was the Luftwaffe involved in medical research at the concentration camps? Dr. Alexander asked the chaplain if he had caught any of the names of the doctors involved in the Dachau medical crimes. Bigelow said that he couldn’t recall but that he was certain he had heard that the Luftwaffe was involved. More determined than ever to investigate, Dr. Alexander continued on to Göttingen to interview Dr. Hubertus Strughold. At the Institute for Physiology in Göttingen, Dr. Alexander located Strughold and arranged to interview him, getting straight to the point. Dr. Alexander told Dr. Strughold about the radio report claiming that freezing experiments had been conducted by the Luftwaffe at Dachau. Did Strughold, as the physician in charge of aviation medical research for the Luftwaffe, know about these criminal experiments at Dachau? Dr. Strughold said that he had learned of the experiments at a medical symposium he attended in Nuremberg in October 1942. The conference, called “Medical Problems of Sea Distress and Winter Distress,” took place at the Hotel Deutscher Hof and involved ninety Luftwaffe doctors. During that conference, Strughold said, a man named Dr. Sigmund Rascher presented findings that had been obtained from experiments performed on prisoners at the Dachau concentration camp. This was the same man “who had been mentioned over the allied radio the other day,” Strughold said. He called Rascher a fringe doctor whose only assistant at Dachau was his wife, Nini. Both Raschers were now dead. Did Strughold approve of these experiments? Strughold told Dr. Alexander that “even though Dr. Rascher used criminals in his experiments, he [Strughold] still disapproved of such experiments in non-consenting volunteers on principle.” Dr. Strughold promised Dr. Alexander that within his institute in Berlin he had “always forbidden even the thought of such experiments… firstly on moral grounds and secondly on grounds of medical ethics.” Alexander asked Strughold if he knew of any other Luftwaffe doctors who had been involved in human experiments at Dachau. Strughold said, “Any experiments on humans that we have carried out were performed only on our own staff and on students interested in our subject on a strictly volunteer basis.” He did not reveal that a number of doctors on his staff had visited Dachau regularly and worked on research experiments there. Also in Göttingen, Dr. Alexander interviewed several other doctors who had worked for Strughold, asking each of them specific questions about human experiments.

Strughold said, “Any experiments on humans that we have carried out were performed only on our own staff and on students interested in our subject on a strictly volunteer basis.” He did not reveal that a number of doctors on his staff had visited Dachau regularly and worked on research experiments there. Also in Göttingen, Dr. Alexander interviewed several other doctors who had worked for Strughold, asking each of them specific questions about human experiments. Each doctor told a strikingly similar story. Dr. Sigmund Rascher was to blame for everything that went on at Dachau and now Rascher was dead. But one man, a physiologist named Dr. Friedrich Hermann Rein, let an important clue slip. Dr. Rascher had been an SS man, Rein said. This information gave Dr. Alexander a significant new piece of the puzzle he did not have before, namely, that the SS was also involved in the concentration camp freezing experiments. This was a revelation. The day after this disclosure, Dr. Alexander received further extraordinary, related news. “I learned that the entire contents of Himmler’s secret cave in Hallein, Germany [sic], containing a vast amount of miscellaneous specially secret S.S. records, had recently been discovered and taken” to the Seventh Army Document Center in Heidelberg. This huge trove of papers had been discovered by soldiers hidden away in yet another cave. The papers had been stamped with the unmistakable logo of the SS, and they bore Himmler’s personal annotations, drawn in the margins in the green pencil he liked to use. Dr. Alexander set out for the Document Center to see what he could glean from the files. These papers would turn out to be among the war’s most incriminating discoveries in a single document find. In Heidelberg, Himmler’s documents were being inventoried and sorted out when Dr. Alexander first arrived. One of the men tasked to the job was Hugh Iltis, the son of a Czech doctor, who, with his family, fled Europe in advance of the genocide. Iltis was a nineteen-year-old American soldier fighting on the front lines in France during the last months of the war when, he recalls, “a car showed up and an officer leapt out and pointed at me, then shouted ‘You, come with me!’” Iltis climbed into the car and sped away from the battlefield with the officer. Someone had learned that Hugh Iltis was a fluent German speaker (and perhaps that his father was a leading geneticist and anti-Nazi). Iltis was needed in Paris to translate captured Nazi documents, and the work kept on coming. Now, six months later, here he was in Heidelberg documenting atrocities for the War Crimes Commission. His discovery of the Himmler papers—it was Iltis who identified how important they were—would also become the most important collection of documents on Nazi human experimentation to be presented at the doctors’ trial.

Alexander told Iltis what it was that he was looking for: documents written by Dr. Sigmund Rascher that involved experiments on humans. Together, the two men broke the original seals on the innocuously named Case No. 707-Medical Experiments, papers that turned out to include years of correspondence between Rascher and Himmler. “The idea to start the experiments with human beings in Dachau was obviously Dr. Rascher’s,” Alexander explained in his classified scientific intelligence report. But as Alexander learned from the papers, Rascher was far from the only Luftwaffe doctor involved. Nor were the human experiments limited to freezing experiments. Even more damning, Dr. Alexander learned that one of Dr. Strughold’s closest colleagues and his coauthor, a physiologist named Dr. Siegfried Ruff, was in charge of overseeing Rascher’s human experiments at Dachau. This was stunning news. “Dr. Ruff, and his assistant Dr. Romberg, joined forces [with Rascher] and arrived in Dachau with a low pressure chamber which they supplied,” Alexander wrote in his report. This low-pressure chamber was used for a second set of deadly experiments involving high-altitude studies. Sitting inside the Seventh Army Documentation Center reading the Himmler papers, Dr. Alexander realized that Dr. Strughold had lied to him when he had said that the only Luftwaffe doctor involved in the Dachau experiments had been the “fringe doctor” Rascher. In fact, Strughold’s friend and colleague Dr. Ruff was deeply implicated. Most disturbing to Alexander were a group of photographs showing what happened in the course of the experiments as healthy young men—classified by the Nazis as Untermenschen—were strapped into a harness inside the low-pressure chamber and subjected to explosive decompression. These photographs, astonishing in their sadism, were essentially before, during, and after pictures of murder in the name of medicine. Other photographs among the Himmler papers documented the freezing experiments as they were being conducted at Dachau. Rascher’s experiments were by no means the solo act of one depraved man. There were photographs of yet another of Dr. Strughold’s Luftwaffe colleagues, Dr. Ernst Holzlöhner, holding prisoners down in tubs of icy water while their body temperatures were recorded as they died. It is believed that Rascher’s wife, Nini, took the photographs. In a classified CIOS report, Dr. Alexander expressed doubts about the veracity of Dr. Strughold’s earlier testimony from their first interview in Göttingen.

In a classified CIOS report, Dr. Alexander expressed doubts about the veracity of Dr. Strughold’s earlier testimony from their first interview in Göttingen. The Dachau experiments were joint endeavors by the Luftwaffe and the SS, and, despite Strughold’s denials, several aviation doctors on his staff, including individuals who reported to directly to him, were named in the Himmler papers. “Strughold at least must have been familiar with the parts played by his friend and co-worker Ruff,” Dr. Alexander wrote. In his report, he advised SHAEF that, while he could not yet say if Dr. On June 20, Alexander headed back to Munich to confront Dr. Weltz. Instead, he found a colleague of Weltz’s, a Dr. Lutz, who broke down and confessed that he’d been aware of the human experiments, but that they’d been conducted by his team members, not him. Lutz claimed to have been offered the “human job,” by Weltz, but declined to accept, on grounds that he was “too soft.” Before confronting Strughold, Dr. Alexander first returned to Dachau to locate eyewitnesses. There, he found three former prisoners who offered testimony. John Bauduin, Oscar Häusermann, and Dr. Paul Hussarek had managed to stay alive at the concentration camp by working as orderlies for the SS. After Dachau was liberated, the three men chose to stay behind so as to help investigators piece together medical crimes. They formed a group, calling it the Committee for the Investigation of SS Medical Crimes. From them, Dr. Alexander learned that the experiments had been conducted on Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, and Catholic priests in the secret, freestanding barracks called Experimental Cell Block Five. “In general, the death of prisoners transferred to Block 5 was expected within 2–3 days,” testified John Bauduin. The second witness, Dr. Hussarek, a Czech scholar sent to Dachau for committing “literary crimes,” told Dr. Alexander that “only a few experimental subjects survived the low pressure experiments. Most were killed.” All three men agreed that only one individual was known to have survived the experiments, a Polish priest named Leo Michalowski. Father Michalowski’s testimony provided a critical missing link in the medical murder experiments and how they were so skillfully concealed. Luftwaffe reports used the words “guinea pigs,” “large pigs,” and “adult pigs” as code words for their human subjects. In one of Weltz’s papers confiscated by Dr. Alexander, entitled “Alcohol and Rewarming,” Weltz wrote that “ shipwreck experiments had been [simulated] in large pigs.” The pigs were placed in tubs of water with blocks of ice and given alcohol to see if a rewarming effect occurred. The results, wrote Weltz, showed that “alcohol in pigs does not increase or accelerate the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:86:1eab29351eaa", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 5999, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 87, "text": "reports used the words “guinea pigs,” “large pigs,” and “adult pigs” as code words for their human subjects.

The results, wrote Weltz, showed that “alcohol in pigs does not increase or accelerate the loss of warmth.” In sworn testimony, Father Michalowski described what had been done to him at Dachau: “I was taken to room No. 4 on Block 5.… I was dropped in the water in which ice blocks were floating. I was conscious for one hour… then given some rum.” In Weltz’s paper the word “large pig” really meant “Catholic priest.” On June 22, Dr. Alexander returned to the Heidelberg Document Center to locate more information with the help of Hugh Iltis. Armed with new details and key words culled from survivor testimony, Dr. Alexander found what Dr. Rascher had called his “experiment reports.” These charts, Alexander noted, were a scientific chronicle of medical murder. Rascher had also had bigger plans. He was working with the SS to have the aviation medicine experiments relocated from Dachau to Auschwitz. “Auschwitz is in every way more suitable for such a large serial experiment than Dachau because it is colder there and the greater extent of open country within the camp would make the experiments less conspicuous,” Rascher wrote. Dr. Alexander also learned about a grotesque “motion picture of the record of the experiments” that had been shown at a private screening at the Air Ministry, at the behest of Himmler. The Luftwaffe doctor overseeing this event was yet another close colleague of Dr. Strughold’s, a physiologist and government official named Dr. Theodor Benzinger. Dr. Alexander was unable to locate Benzinger but noted the name in his report. He then returned to Göttingen to interview Strughold a second time to see if he could confirm that Strughold had been lying to him. In Göttingen, things had changed. Investigators working on scientific intelligence projects for the U.S. Army Air Forces (AAF) and the Royal Air Force (RAF) had interviewed many of the Luftwaffe doctors, including Dr. Strughold. Their conclusions were remarkably different from Dr. Alexander’s. None of the RAF or AAF officers had traveled to the Document Center in Heidelberg to read the Himmler files. Instead, their reports were meant to serve and support Armstrong and Grow’s secret, new research lab. RAF Wing Commander R. H. Winfield wrote in his report, “Strughold was the mainspring of German Aviation Medical Research” and had a large staff of colleagues, including Dr. Siegfried Ruff, who all appeared to have “suffered tremendously from their isolation during the war years.” Winfield, having no idea that Dr. Ruff had been the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:87:9b4c195867c4", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6000, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 88, "text": "the Document Center in Heidelberg to read the Himmler files.

Winfield wrote in his report, “Strughold was the mainspring of German Aviation Medical Research” and had a large staff of colleagues, including Dr. Siegfried Ruff, who all appeared to have “suffered tremendously from their isolation during the war years.” Winfield, having no idea that Dr. Ruff had been the person in charge of overseeing Rascher’s work at Dachau, stated that his “interrogations [of Ruff] revealed very little information not already known to the Allies.” Winfield saw Dr. Strughold as a patrician figure, “considerably disturbed about the welfare of his staff who, unable to evacuate Berlin, were now threatened by the Russians.” Representing the U.S. Army Air Forces was Colonel W. R. Lovelace, an expert in high-altitude escape and parachute studies. The following decade, Lovelace would become famous as the physician for NASA’s Cold War–era Project Mercury astronauts. For his confidential CIOS report, entitled “Research in Aviation Medicine for the German Air Force,” Lovelace interviewed Dr. Strughold and many of his colleagues, including the freezing expert, Georg Weltz. Like Winfield, Lovelace was in the dark about the medical murder experiments going on inside the concentration camps. He saw Weltz’s research as benign and dedicated five pages of his CIOS report to praising his studies on “rapid rewarming of the cooled animal.” Lovelace was particularly impressed by the fact that Weltz had frozen a “guinea pig” to death and was still able to record a heartbeat after death. “[T]he heartbeat may continue for some time if the animal is left in the cold,” Lovelace wrote in summation of Weltz’s findings. Unlike Dr. Alexander, Colonel Lovelace was able to interview Strughold and Ruff’s colleague Dr. Theodor Benzinger, the high-altitude specialist who ran the Reich’s Experimental Station of the Air Force Research Center, Rechlin, located north of Berlin. This was the same Dr. Benzinger who had overseen for Himmler the film screening at the Reich Air Ministry, in Berlin, of Dachau prisoners being murdered in medical experiments. And while Dr. Alexander had this information, Colonel Lovelace had no idea. Lovelace was particularly interested in Benzinger’s work involving “high altitude parachute escapes,” for which Benzinger had gathered much data and produced “studies in reversible and irreversible deaths.” Benzinger told Lovelace that he performed his studies on rabbits. Finally, Lovelace interviewed Dr. Konrad Schäfer, a chemist and physiologist whose wartime efforts to render salt water drinkable made him famous in Luftwaffe circles. With high praise from RAF and AAF officers, Doctors Ruff, Benzinger, and Schäfer were now each being considered for leading positions at the new research lab. It was the end of June 1945, and Dr. Alexander’s allotted time in the field as a war crimes investigator had drawn to a close.

It was the end of June 1945, and Dr. Alexander’s allotted time in the field as a war crimes investigator had drawn to a close. He was ordered back to London, where he would type up seven classified CIOS reports totaling more than fifteen hundred pages. Two weeks after Alexander left Germany, the chief of the Division of Aviation Medicine for the Army Air Forces, Detlev Bronk, and an AAF expert on the psychological and physiological stresses of flying named Howard Burchell, arrived in Germany to evaluate progress on the new research laboratory envisioned by Armstrong and Grow. Bronk and Burchell interviewed many of the same doctors and determined that they were all good candidates for the AAF center. Unlike Wing Commander Winfield and Colonel Lovelace, Bronk and Burchell had been made aware of some of the controversy surrounding Strughold and his Luftwaffe colleagues. In a joint report, they explained, “[N]o effort was made to assess [the doctors’] political and ethical viewpoints, or their responsibility for war crimes.” They also concluded, “Strughold was not always quite honest in presenting the true significance of the work which he supported.” But Bronk and Burchell stated that it was their position that army intelligence was better qualified to determine who was inadmissible “for political reasons” and who could be hired. As it turned out, military intelligence objected to hiring Dr. Benzinger and Dr. Ruff, on the grounds that both men had been hard-core Nazi ideologues. But in the following month, army intelligence determined that the doctors’ work at Heidelberg would be “short term,” and both men were cleared for U.S. Army employment. A deal was made between the U.S. Army Air Forces and Dr. Strughold. He would serve with Armstrong as cochairman of a Top Secret research center that the AAF was quietly setting up at the former Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Heidelberg, and to be called the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center. No one outside a small group could know about this controversial project because, per JCS 1076, no foreign power was permitted to carry out military research of any kind in Germany, including in medicine.

In Munich, Dr. Georg Weltz was arrested and sent to an internment facility for processing. From there, he would be sent to the prison complex in Nuremberg to await trial. In Washington, with policy now informally set, the debate over the Nazi scientist program became intense inside the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC). Like its successor organization, the National Security Council, SWNCC acted as the president’s principal forum for dealing with issues related to foreign policy and national security. The State Department was vocal in its opposition to the program. Exacerbating the situation for the State Department was a parallel issue it had recently become embroiled in. South American countries, Argentina and Uruguay in particular, were known to be giving safe haven to Nazi war criminals who had escaped from Germany at the end of the war. The State Department had been putting pressure on these countries to repatriate Nazis back to Europe to face war crimes charges. If it came out that the State Department was providing not only safe haven but employment opportunities for Nazi scientists in the United States, that would be cause for an international scandal. And while some generals and colonels in the War Department were decidedly for the Nazi science programs, others were fundamentally opposed to the idea. A secretly recorded conversation between two generals at the Pentagon summed up the conflict that the very idea of German scientists working for the U.S. military created. The Department of Justice was not happy about the voluminous workload that background checks on former enemy aliens would require. The Department of Labor was concerned about laws governing alien labor, and the Department of Commerce was concerned about patent rights. In an attempt to ease the contention, Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson sent a memorandum to the War Department General Staff stating that the person to mediate these issues was John J. McCloy, the assistant secretary of war and chairman of SWNCC. John J. McCloy would become an especially significant player in Operation Paperclip starting in 1949. But now, in the summer of 1945, he wore two hats related to the issue of Nazi scientists. On the one hand, Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson had put McCloy in charge of coordinating policy regarding Nazi scientists coming to the United States to work. On the other hand, Patterson’s boss, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, had given McCloy the job of helping to develop the war crimes program. McCloy’s position regarding the exploitation of Nazi science and scientists was clear. He believed that the program would help foster American military superiority while engendering economic prosperity.

McCloy’s position regarding the exploitation of Nazi science and scientists was clear. He believed that the program would help foster American military superiority while engendering economic prosperity. To McCloy, those ends justified any means. It was not that McCloy believed that the Nazis should go unpunished, at least not in the summer of 1945. For that, McCloy was a strong supporter of the International Military Tribunal (IMT) and the idea of a war crimes trial. But he was someone who saw these two categories as black and white. There were scientists and there were war criminals. In McCloy’s eyes, a war criminal was a Himmler, a Hess, a Göring, or a Bormann. Scientists, like industrialists, were the backbone of a healthy economy in this new, postwar world. In the summer of 1945, McCloy was regularly briefed on the capture and arrest of these war criminals as they were rounded up and taken to a Top Secret interrogation facility in Luxembourg, code-named Ashcan, where they would be squeezed for information before facing judgment at Nuremberg. John Dolibois, an officer with Army Intelligence, G-2, the Collecting and Dissemination Division, spent a significant portion of the last eight months of the war watching and rewatching Triumph of the Will, the three-hour-long Nazi propaganda film by Hitler’s favorite filmmaker, Leni Riefenstahl. Every Thursday night, inside a screening room at Camp Ritchie, America’s Military Intelligence Training Center, located eighty miles north of Washington in the Catoctin Mountains, the twenty-sixyear-old Dolibois used the film to teach German order of battle and Nazi Party hierarchy to colonels, generals, and intelligence officers preparing to go off to war. The Triumph of the Will documentary was an ideal teaching tool and enabled Dolibois to point out to his students how individuals within the Nazi Party hierarchy spoke and gestured, what insignia they wore, who was subordinate to whom. Between the hateful speeches and the endless parades, the fawning inner circle and the Nuremberg rallies, John Dolibois had become so familiar with Hitler’s inner circle that he could almost recite their speeches himself. He enjoyed teaching, but, like so many dedicated Americans of his generation, Dolibois wished to see action overseas. There was a tinge of envy as well. He stayed in touch with his former colleagues from Officer Candidates School, most of whom had been sent to Europe months ago. Many had already been promoted to captains and majors.

Many had already been promoted to captains and majors. As the war in Europe drew to a close, John Dolibois had accepted that he was, in all likelihood, not going to be sent overseas as part of an interrogation team, called an IPW team, to interview newly captured prisoners of war. Then, on Easter Sunday, April 1, 1945, he received orders to ship out with the next detachment. Steaming out of the New York harbor only days later, he was standing on the deck of the Île de France when someone handed him a telegram. He’d been promoted to first lieutenant. Things moved fast after he’d crossed the Atlantic. On April 13, Dolibois’s ship landed in West Scotland. Every vessel in the harbor was at half-mast; President Roosevelt had died the day before. A quick train trip to London bore witness to “appalling devastation.” Piles of rubble filled both sides of every street. Dolibois’s channel crossing took place under a full moon, and he was grateful to arrive in the war-torn port at Le Havre, France, without incident. “Up until then our move from Camp Ritchie to Le Havre had been well orchestrated,” explains Dolibois. “Now chaos set in.” Driving into Munich, destroyed vehicles and weaponry littered the road. In the clearings in the woods sat small fleets of wrecked Luftwaffe airplanes, their wings torn off and their fuselages pockmarked with holes. Corpses rotted in ditches. “Suddenly the war was very real,” Dolibois recalls. His first assignment was at the Dachau concentration camp, just two days after its liberation. Dolibois had been sent to Dachau to look over groups of captured German soldiers to see if important generals, party officials, or scientists were hiding out among the crowd. “Primarily I was to watch for high ranking Nazis in disguise,” remembers Dolibois. “We had reports that many of them were passing themselves off as ordinary German soldiers, thus hoping to be overlooked in the confusion and to disappear.” His job was to intuit the meaning of certain manners of walk, greeting, and speech. Dolibois was on the lookout for anyone who might be useful to the Allies for a more detailed interrogation at a facility elsewhere. At Dachau, John Dolibois scoured faces in the crowd for telltale marks, things that could not be hidden. The most obvious among them were the dueling scars of the Nazi elite. But at Camp Ritchie Dolibois had also become an expert in signs of concealment. Recently shaved facial hair or patches pulled off uniforms were indicators that a man had something to hide.

True expertise, Dolibois knew, lay in recognizing nuance. After a few days at Dachau, Dolibois received another assignment. He proceeded to Central Continental Prisoner of War Enclosure Number 32, or CCPWE No. 32. The mission he was now on was classified Top Secret. Everyone he asked about CCPWE No. 32 said that they had never heard of it before. When Dolibois’s driver left the borders of Germany and began heading into Luxembourg, Dolibois became overwhelmed with memories. Luxembourg, of all places—how capricious to be on assignment here. John Dolibois was born in Luxembourg. He had moved to America when he was a twelve-year-old boy, with his father; his mother had died in the great influenza pandemic. Driving into Luxembourg in 1945, Dolibois was seeing his native country for the first time in fourteen years. As his army jeep made its way into a little spa town called Mondorf-les-Bains, images of his youth flooded his mind. He recalled Mondorf’s “beautiful park, a quiet stream on which one could row a boat, lots of old trees, and acres of flowers.” Mondorf was built a few miles from the Moselle River in antiquity, developed by the Romans as a health resort. It was known for its restorative qualities, its mineral baths and fresh air. How different it all looked now, another small city devastated by war. Most homes and shops had been plundered or destroyed. Driving along the main boulevard, Dolibois observed how the façades of many houses had been blown off. He could see people carrying on with their lives inside of what was left of their homes. Only when his jeep pulled up to its destination did Dolibois realize that he’d arrived at the Palace Hotel. It was unrecognizable to him. A fifteen-foot-high fence ran around the main building, on top of which was a double-stringed curl of barbed wire. There was a second fence that appeared to be electrified. Camouflage netting hung from panels of fencing. Wide canvas sheets had been strung from tree to tree. Huge klieg lights illuminated the place. There were four guard towers, each manned by American soldiers holding powerful machine guns. Not even in photographs had John Dolibois seen an Allied prison facility in the European war theater as heavily fortified as this place was. At the front gate there was a jeep, parked and with its engine turned off. A stern-faced sergeant sat inside.

His name tag read “Sergeant of the Guard, Robert Block.” Block addressed Dolibois with a nod. Dolibois handed over his papers. After Block looked at them, the gate swung open and Dolibois was waved inside. In spite of its fortifications, the Palace Hotel remained surprisingly unscathed by war. The boomerang-shaped building was five stories tall. The fountain at the front entrance lacked water, its stone-carved nymph rising up from an empty pool. Inside the hotel foyer Dolibois was greeted by two guards. A third soldier handed him a key and pointed up a flight of stairs. He told Dolibois to leave his things in room 30, on the second floor. “I climbed up the stairs, located room 30 and let myself in with the key he had given me. It was an ordinary hotel room,” remembers Dolibois, “with rather noisy wallpaper.” Inside, the fancy light fixtures and plush furniture of a grand hotel had been replaced by a folding table, two chairs, and an army cot. Dolibois unpacked his duffel bag. There was a knock on the door. Ashcan may have been heavily fortified on the exterior, but inside the facility, the prisoners were free to roam around. Dolibois opened the door and stood face-to-face with a large man dressed in a ratty pearl-gray uniform with gold braids on the collars and gold insignia on the shoulder pads. He held a pair of trousers draped over one arm. Clicking his heels, he nodded and introduced himself as if he were at a party, not in a prison. The man opened his mouth and barked, “Göring, Reichsmarschall!” So this was Hermann Göring. Dolibois recognized him immediately from so many screenings of Triumph of the Will. Here was the man in flesh and blood. Göring was arguably the most notorious of Hitler’s inner circle still alive. Former commander in chief of the Luftwaffe. Director of the Four Year Plan. Hitler’s long-acknowledged successor until the perceived betrayal at the very end. It was Hermann Göring who ordered security police chief Reinhard Heydrich to organize and coordinate plans for a “solution to the Jewish question.” “At once I understood my assignment,” recalled Dolibois. He was here in Luxembourg to interrogate the highest-ranking war criminals in the Nazi Party. This was not a Nazi propaganda film. The individuals who had so populated his mind and his teaching at Camp Ritchie for the past eight months were right here. And they were all prisoners now.

The individuals who had so populated his mind and his teaching at Camp Ritchie for the past eight months were right here. And they were all prisoners now. Göring said he had been unfairly tricked by his captors. “He had been told he was going to a palatial spa,” Dolibois explained. When Göring arrived at Ashcan with his valet, Robert Kropp, he was expecting a vacation. He brought along eleven suitcases and twenty thousand Paracodin pills, and had made sure his toenails and fingernails had been varnished to a bright red shine for his stay. That the spa at Mondorf had lost its chandeliers and been turned into a maximum-security prison complex was not what Göring had in mind. His mattress was made of straw, Göring barked at Dolibois. He didn’t have a pillow. A man of his rank deserved more. CCPWE No. 32 was filled with Nazi “Bonzen,” the big wheels, as Dolibois and the other interrogators called them. Hans Frank, the “Jew-Butcher of Cracow,” arrived at Ashcan on a stretcher, in silk pajamas drenched in blood. He had tried to kill himself by slashing his own throat. Frank was captured with his thirty-eight-volume diary, written during the war, a damning confession of many crimes he was guilty of. “Dark-eyed and balding,” noted Ashcan’s commandant, Colonel Burton Andrus, Frank had “pale hairy hands.” Other prisoners included members of the former German General Staff: Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), or Armed Forces High Command; General Alfred Jodl, Keitel’s chief of operations; Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, commander of submarines and commander in chief of the German navy; Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, former chief of Armed Forces Italy and later Supreme Commander West; Joachim von Ribbentrop, foreign minister; and Albert Speer, minister of armaments and war production. These were the men who personally helped Hitler plan and execute World War II and the Holocaust—those who hadn’t escaped, perished, or committed suicide. “In a second circle, or clique, there were the real Nazi gangsters,” Dolibois explained, “the old fighters—who had been with Hitler at the beginning of his rise to power.” Among this group were Robert Ley, Labor Front leader; Julius Streicher, editor of the anti-Semitic newspaper and propaganda tool Der Stürmer; Alfred Rosenberg, Nazi philosopher; Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the man who betrayed Austria and became Reichskommissar of Holland; and Wilhelm Frick, former minister of the interior and Reichsprotektor of Bohemia-Moravia. Stripped of their power, small details spoke volumes to Dolibois. Göring was terrified of thunderstorms.

Stripped of their power, small details spoke volumes to Dolibois. Göring was terrified of thunderstorms. Keitel was obsessed with sunbathing and staring at his reflection in Ashcan’s only mirror, in its entrance hall. Robert Ley was repeatedly reprimanded for masturbating in the bathtub. Joachim von Ribbentrop, named by the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda as the best-dressed man in Germany for nine consecutive years, was a lazy slob. Day in and day out, John Dolibois interviewed them. “Almost all the men at Ashcan were eager to talk,” Dolibois recalls. “They felt neglected if they hadn’t been interrogated by someone for several days.… Their favorite pastime was casting blame.” The greatest challenge for Dolibois and his fellow interrogators was determining, or trying to determine, who was lying and who was telling the truth. “Cross-examination. Playing one prisoner off the other,” according to Dolibois, was a tactic that worked best. At war’s end, the staff of the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service had their sights set on bringing Hitler’s chemists to the United States. The service saw unbridled potential in making the Nazis’ nerve agent program its own and was willing to go to great lengths to obtain its secrets. Less than one month after British tanks rolled into the Robbers’ Lair and found the enormous cache of tabun-filled bombs in the forests of Münster-Nord, the Chemical Warfare Service had obtained a sample of the nerve agent and was analyzing its properties in its Development Laboratory in the United States. Work began on May 15, 1945, and took two weeks to complete. The analysis revealed that tabun was a revolutionary killer that could decimate enemy armies. General William N. Porter, chief of the Chemical Warfare Service, requested that five 260-kg tabun-filled bombs be shipped from the Robbers’ Lair to the United States “by air under highest priority” for field tests. Separately, General Porter asked the U.S. Army Air Forces and U.S. Army Ordnance to conduct their own feasibility studies to determine if tabun bombs could be used in combat by U.S. troops. Most people looked upon chemical warfare as abhorrent. In a June 1943 speech, President Roosevelt himself had said that using chemicals to kill people was immoral and inhumane. The president had denied Chemical Warfare Service officials their request to change the service’s name to the Chemical Corps because of the permanence the name change suggested. And yet here was the interesting news for the Chemical Service. When German nerve gas entered into the world of chemical warfare, it brought with it the assurance of a U.S. chemical warfare program in peacetime.", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:96:b29dd22402d5", "wtk_id": NaN}, {"doc_idx": 6009, "dataset": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned", "filename": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/031622104X", "publisher": "Trine Day Publishing", "found_on": "Trine Day Publishing", "title": "Operation Paperclip_cleaned", "chunk_index": 97, "text": "1943 speech, President Roosevelt himself had said that using chemicals to kill people was immoral and inhumane.

And yet here was the interesting news for the Chemical Service. When German nerve gas entered into the world of chemical warfare, it brought with it the assurance of a U.S. chemical warfare program in peacetime. According to chemical weapons expert Jonathan B. Tucker, “In 1945, in the aftermath of World War II, the U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Service decided to focus its research and development efforts on the German nerve agents, the technological challenges of which promised to ensure the organization’s survival through the period of postwar demobilization and declining military budgets.” Within several months of the German surrender, 530 tons of tabun nerve agent were shipped to the United States and used in Top Secret field tests. Requests to bring German chemists to the United States for weapons work quickly followed. But, as had been the case with the V-2 rocket scientists, the notion of issuing visas to Hitler’s chemists was met with hostility inside the State Department. When the chief of the State Department’s Passport Division, Howard K. Travers, learned about this idea, he sent his colleagues an internal memo stating, “We should do everything we consistently can to prevent German chemists and others from entering this country.” Colonel Philip R. Tarr of the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service and his British counterpart Major Edmund Tilley, were continuing their relentless pursuit. When Alsos located the chemist Richard Kuhn at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, they paid him a visit. Kuhn had once been an internationally revered organic chemist, but rumor had it that he had become an ardent Nazi during the war. Kuhn won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1938 but turned down accepting the award at the request of Hitler, who called it a Jewish prize. Here now to interview Richard Kuhn, Samuel Goudsmit had with him two American chemists, Louis Fieser of Harvard and Carl Baumann of the University of Wisconsin. Both men had actually worked with Kuhn in his laboratory before the war. After a cordial exchange of greetings, the interrogation began. Alsos sought information regarding the Third Reich’s nerve agent program. What did Herr Kuhn know? Kuhn, with his mop of straight reddish-brown hair, cunning smile, and schoolboy looks, swore that he had no connection whatsoever with Reich military research. He told his former colleagues that he was a pure scientist, an academic who spent the war working on the chemistry of modern drugs. Samuel Goudsmit had his doubts. “Richard Kuhn’s record did not seem too clean to me,” Goudsmit recalled after the war. “As president of the German Chemical Society he had followed the", "chunk_id": "trineday_mineru_txt_cleaned:Operation Paperclip_cleaned.txt:97:dfe7437a3c2c", "wtk_id": NaN}]
