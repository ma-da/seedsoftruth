substances that interfere with the body s hormone systems may contribute to a wide range of female reproductive health problems including reduced fertility early or delayed puberty premature menopause and polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS according to a new review of more than 250 human and animal studies Researchers increasingly suspect that environmental toxins detected in everything from urine and blood serum to breast milk and amniotic fluid play a significant role in increasingly common female reproductive health disorders EDCs include a wide array of everyday chemicals in our environment that are produced and marketed by industry They include plastic additives such as phthalates and bisphenols in food packaging household items and personal care products as well as pesticides that contaminate soil water air and food Published in May in Nature Reviews Endocrinology the article underscores the urgent need for stronger female reproductive health protection laws and regulations to limit EDC exposure throughout life starting in early development Reproductive health problems linked to EDCs not only increase infertility risk but may also raise the chance of other conditions like heart disease and osteoporosis The review found that EDCs impact female reproductive health in multiple ways including Reducing egg ovum supply and quality Interfering with ovarian follicle growth and speed up egg loss Increasing the risk of early menopause Disrupting the timing of puberty Contributing to rising rates of PCOS Lowering the success of fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization IVF This Review highlights some critical processes that are essential to female reproductive health and presents compelling evidence that EDCs disrupt ovarian development and function the researchers say They noted that multiple factors can influence female fertility and reproductive health such as genetics lifestyle socioeconomic status BMI and age Still they say a growing body of evidence points to an important contribution from endocrine disrupting chemicals EDCs EDCs may cause early harms that persist The findings come at a time when female reproductive disorders have steadily increased the researchers say and global female infertility rates have surged with women in their late 30s facing the highest risk The average age at which girls in the U S have their first periods has also decreased indicating a higher risk of adverse health outcomes later in life including breast cancer and Type 2 diabetes Female fertility and reproductive health depend on a series of developmental

Female fertility and reproductive health depend on a series of developmental steps from the formation of germ cells and an embryo through puberty and the healthy functioning of the reproductive system in adulthood Two of the most important factors are Adequate ovarian reserve the lifetime supply of follicles formed before birth that produce eggs and female sex hormones The ovarian reserve declines with age leading to menopause end of natural fertility when it is depleted Hormone regulating system known as the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis which helps regulate healthy reproduction and sexual development EDCs can disrupt these early stages and continue to affect reproductive health and fertility by interfering with the body s hormonal control signals reproductive organs and production of key hormones such as estrogen the researchers say For instance exposure can cause egg cells to grow too quickly stop important follicles from growing properly and increase the death of egg cells This can lead to irregular periods and may lower fertility over time Chemicals may damage early reproductive system development The effects of EDCs depend on when exposure occurs but animal and human studies show clear patterns of harm For example EDCs like bisphenol A BPA atrazine and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate DEHP can disrupt meiosis the process that forms egg cells causing poor egg quality or abnormal chromosomes Exposure in the womb to diethylstilbestrol or DES a synthetic estrogen whose use was banned by the U S Food and Drug Administration in 2000 has been linked to shorter reproductive lifespans and increased infertility likely due to fewer or faster loss of egg follicles High lifetime exposure to EDCs has been associated with earlier menopause One study found that women with the highest levels of combined exposure to 111 EDCs began menopause nearly four years earlier than those with the lowest exposure EDCs may also speed up follicular atresia the natural loss of immature eggs possibly by causing oxidative stress and other cellular damage In rats and mice EDCs lower levels of key reproductive hormones including estradiol a form of estrogen luteinizing hormone or LH and follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and disrupt normal reproductive cycles even months after exposure ends These studies provide causal proof for the numerous reported associations between EDC exposure in adulthood lower follicle density and premature menopause the researchers say EDCs and puberty timing Sooner or later Puberty begins when the brain reactivates hormonal control

trend of earlier puberty onset with girls starting puberty earlier worldwide by nearly three months per decade in some countries It can take years between chemical exposure and the start of puberty to study its impacts and human evidence is limited Yet some patterns indicating reproductive health harms have emerged the review shows EDCs may act like estrogen or block hormone production affecting when puberty starts Higher levels of EDCs have been linked to changes in the brain s release of gonadotropin releasing hormone or GnRH which helps control puberty For example BPA exposure in young rats delayed puberty and hindered the maturation of GnRH neurons In girls early exposure to BPA and DES has been linked to both early and delayed breast development but consistently delayed menstruation Phthalates which block male hormones have also been linked to delayed puberty Some EDCs may also affect puberty timing by changing how genes turn on and off across generations In one study a first generation of rats exposed to a mix of 13 EDCs had a third generation with delayed puberty and altered gene regulation PCOS and fertility treatment outcomes A major cause of female infertility PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder in women affecting up to 15 of women globally While genes play a role in its development the review suggests that EDCs may upset the hormone balance during fetal development affecting puberty signals egg growth and hormone production and raising the risk of developing PCOS While data linking EDCs to PCOS are limited the review cites studies that found Women with PCOS have higher levels of EDCs in their blood especially PFAS A Swedish study of women found that those living in areas with high PFAS contamination had more than twice the risk of developing PCOS A U S study of women seeking fertility evaluation and treatment linked higher per and polyfluoroalkyl substance PFAS levels especially perfluorooctane sulfonate to

plays a key role in brain and reproductive tract development Other female health issues such as preterm birth endometriosis and breast cancer have also been linked to EDC exposure increasing the

that plaintiffs submit new evidence to the EPA in an amended petition which they did and that the EPA review it in a new administrative process However the EPA told the court that such a process didn

agencies attempted to undermine its publication documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests showed And even when the document was ready in draft form the EPA continued to try to delay the trial Eventually Chen ordered a draft version of NTP s report to be made public so that the trial could continue The second phase of the trial began in January 2024 Over 10 days the parties presented evidence from the draft NTP report released in 2022 and several new cohort studies introduced by both sides which had been published between 2019 and 2024 In September 2024 Chen issued the

that 31 of all biosolids were used in agricultural applications Another 24 were used on home gardens landscaping golf courses and the like But the EPA is asleep at the switch when it comes to testing sewage sludge for the presence of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS more commonly known as forever chemicals It doesn t Which is inexcusable since the EPA was informed in 2003 by 3M then the nation s chief producer of PFAS for products like Teflon pans that high levels of PFAS were turning up in the nation s sewage Yes more than two decades ago EPA s tepid response was to ask 3M for more information EPA s slow walk has proven costly It wasn t until last April that the feds ramped up a PFAS testing program for the nation s drinking water As for sewage sludge In January the EPA finally released a draft risk assessment for sewage sludge that Reflects the agency s latest scientific understanding of the potential risks to human health and the environment posed by the presence of PFOA and PFOS in sewage sludge that is land applied as a soil conditioner or fertilizer on agricultural forested and other lands surface disposed e g placed in a sewage sludge only landfill called a monofill or incinerated For agricultural applications the EPA risk assessment considered three particular scenarios Application to a farm raising dairy cows beef cattle or chickens Application to a

PFOS as likely to be carcinogenic to humans And more concerning the EPA in April 2024 declared There is no level of exposure to these contaminants without risk of health impacts including certain cancers Forever chemicals can also be responsible for hepatic immunological cardiovascular and developmental effects For its part 3M was less than forthright back in the day in sharing with the feds what it knew about PFOS Sometime this year 3M claims it will cease forever chemical production But hundreds of millions of pounds of forever chemicals produced over more than 50 years remain in the

yet to take effect The prohibition on the chemical was to begin this year for all consumer uses and many industrial and commercial uses The EPA allowed a more gradual phasing out for more than a dozen industrial uses such as for some aerospace and defense applications In those cases the Biden EPA required employers to provide health protections for workers who come into contact with TCE The Trump EPA s recent petition to the federal appeals court to extend the ban s delay would also mean that employers would not be required to implement the new health protections for workers Delaying the ban means that people will continue to be exposed to the chemical which causes liver cancer kidney cancer and non Hodgkin lymphoma as well as holes in infants hearts that can be fatal While safer alternatives now exist for many of its uses TCE has seeped into the drinking water of more than 17 million people in the U S according to data compiled by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group

it deemed TCE a probable human carcinogen In 2001 a draft EPA assessment found the chemical to be more toxic than previously thought and highly likely to cause cancer The conclusion came under attack from some industry and government scientists The U S Department of Defense which is responsible for hundreds of TCE contaminated sites criticized the report as based on junk science Two reviews by panels of independent scientists however found the assessment was sound Still the EPA didn t begin drafting stricter regulations on TCE until the end of former President Barack Obama s administration

joining the first Trump administration had been a high level lobbyist for the American Chemistry Council an industry trade group presided over the EPA s chemical program when it pulled back from the TCE ban and more broadly retreated from rules that the chemical industry saw as burdensome After returning to the private sector Beck was recently named the principal deputy assistant administrator in the EPA s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention She did not respond to requests for comment Her appointment has left environmentalists despairing over the fate of the long awaited TCE ban

Environmental Protection Agency EPA will move forward with plans to gut the agency s office that studies how air pollution drinking water contamination and toxic chemicals including glyphosate affect human health the agency announced Friday As part of its reduction in force which reportedly will cut 748 8 million from the agency s budget the EPA is eliminating the Office of Research and Development ORD ORD is strictly a scientific research organization It has no regulatory responsibilities which means it isn t subject to industry influence in the same way as other sectors of the EPA As a result ORD often reaches different conclusions than other EPA research groups according to Bill Freese science director at the Center for Food Safety The office s findings underlie many of the policies and regulations issued by the agency Its research is often used to justify stricter rules prompting opposition from pesticide and chemical manufacturers and other industries and even from other sections within the agency that are allegedly captured by the chemical industry For example ORD identified glyphosate as a carcinogen when the EPA s pesticide wing argued it was safe Polluters across America are cheering on plans to eliminate the EPA s independent ORD Freese said He added They want to silence ORD s ground breaking research that demonstrates how cumulative exposure to their toxic products from phthalates to PFAS to pesticides impairs reproduction and has other adverse effects on human health We urge the Trump administration to reverse course and restore ORD because without it America will never become healthy again Freese told The Defender in an earlier interview that ORD does precisely the type of work called for by The MAHA Report The report released in May by the Make America Healthy Again Commission is the Trump administration s assessment of factors driving the epidemic of chronic childhood disease Much of ORD s research takes a different approach from current investigations For example one evaluation examined the adverse effects of cumulative exposure to multiple chemicals a problem highlighted in the report instead of the more common approach that

and eliminate ORD was meant to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of EPA operations and align core statutory requirements with its organizational structure The spokesperson said agency laboratory functions and hundreds of scientific technical bioinformatic and information technology experts had been transferred to EPA s air water and chemical offices There are thousands of scientists and engineers already employed by EPA within other program offices the spokesperson said The agency is also creating a new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions in the

decision on paraquat announcing that it needs more time to examine the potential health effects of the weedkilling chemical that has been widely used in agriculture for decades but also linked for years to the incurable brain ailment known as Parkinson s disease The EPA had promised to issue a report by Friday Jan 17 updating its position on paraquat after a petition filed by the Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson s Research and several other health advocacy organizations challenged the EPA s 2021 interim registration review decision in which the agency concluded that there was insufficient evidence linking paraquat exposure to Parkinson s That interim EPA decision did call for certain mitigation measures to reduce risks the agency said it found necessary to protect human health and the environment and labels on paraquat products were amended in 2022 to reflect those measures But critics have pressed the EPA to go further and ban the pesticide entirely The petition filed in the 9th Circuit U S Court of Appeals challenged not only the agency s position on Parkinson s risk but also the EPA s analysis of respiratory and dermal exposures exposure risks from paraquat drift and how to balance paraquat s risks and benefits As part of the process of reexamining its interim decision the agency said a year ago that it would spend 2024 analyzing new information about paraquat health effects and considering public comments about the issue The agency said last year it would issue a final document and potential next steps for paraquat use by the mid January 2025 date Instead on Jan 17 the EPA said it is delaying any action The agency issued a statement saying it had determined that additional data are necessary to resolve the uncertainty surrounding certain paraquat risks The agency cited the potential for paraquat to volatize and said it would be trying to determine potential inhalation risks to bystanders from the volatilization of paraquat Such data

against the EPA It s already been more than three years since this litigation started we cannot wait another four years just to start back at square one Too many lives are at stake In its announcement of the delay the EPA cited a recent preliminary conclusion by California state regulators that paraquat does not cause Parkinson s and said EPA scientists have not yet had sufficient time to review that report Critics of the chemical have been pressuring the EPA to ban paraquat for years but the drumbeat has grown louder in recent months In October 2024 more than 50 U S lawmakers sent letters to the EPA calling for a ban arguing that paraquat is a highly toxic pesticide whose continued use cannot be justified given its harms to farmworkers and rural communities The lawmakers cited scientific links between paraquat use and the development of Parkinson s and other life threatening diseases as well as grave impacts on the environment The lawmakers note that approximately 70 countries have banned paraquat Paraquat was introduced in the 1960s by a predecessor to the giant global agrochemical company Syngenta which is now a Chinese owned entity The herbicide has become one of the most

trees for the 10th straight year once again allowing farmers to use the insecticide despite its known risk to endangered species and pollinators critical to the health of the food supply Since 2015 the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA has had a moratorium on new uses of neonicotinoid insecticides including clothianidin because of evidence that the class of pesticides is linked to pollinator decline Neonics have been shown to be particularly harmful to bees which help pollinate important crops such as vegetables nuts cotton and more In a 2023 analysis the EPA found that clothianidin and other neonics are driving hundreds of species protected under the Endangered Species Act toward extinction Neonics are banned in Europe and the European Union EU has proposed essentially banning clothianidin on crops imported into the EU Despite the concerns the EPA has continually allowed farmers in Florida to drench the soil surrounding citrus trees with clothianidin to help fight an insect called Asian citrus psyllid which spreads a disease the industry calls citrus greening The EPA renewed that exemption last week Florida s citrus production has seen a steep decline over the last 20 years due largely to the dreaded disease It is the no 1 issue in citrus probably in the world said Lauren Diepenbrock an assistant professor and citrus entomology extension specialist at the University of Florida In the past 20 years Florida citrus production declined from 300 million boxes in 2003 04 to under 20 million boxes in 2022 23 Clothianidin is applied to the base of trees during the dry season so it has the best chance of being absorbed and not washing away Diepenbrock said Neonics are systemic pesticides which means that plants absorb the chemicals and spread them through their circulatory system This makes flowers leaves nectar and pollen harmful to both pests and non target insects The neonicotinoids can also often be taken up by non target plants In 2019 the EPA s Office of the Inspector General issued a report detailing concerns about this practice In the report the watchdog expressed concerns about the EPA granting the emergency exemptions without properly considering impacts on human health and the environment Diepenbrock said neonics are some of the most effective insecticides for Asian citrus psyllid though there are more than 16

never undergone a full safety review for this use When the EPA grants so called emergency approval year after year to a pesticide that s never undergone a full safety review there s something fundamentally wrong about this approach Donley said In 2020 the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned the EPA to limit emergency exemptions to two years The group also documented the EPA s abuse

environmental regulators are planning to raise the allowable levels of atrazine an endocrine disruptor linked to reproductive health issues and banned in the European Union Critics say the higher concentration discounts years of documented health and environmental risks You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Douglas Main U S environmental regulators are planning to change allowable levels of a weedkiller linked with reproductive health problems to a concentration critics say discounts years of documented health and environmental risks potentially marking a new battlefront within the Trump administration The proposal by the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA which was put forth in late 2024 under the Biden administration would allow concentrations of the herbicide atrazine up to 9 7 parts per billion ppb in streams and lakes before any mitigation efforts were required That is nearly three times higher than the level of 3 4 ppb proposed by the EPA in 2016 and reiterated by the agency as proper in 2022 But it is lower than a level pushed for under the prior Trump administration It is also lower than the longtime benchmark of 10 ppb that was in place from 2011 2019 and lower than atrazine maker Syngenta says is necessary The agency s move has been met with outrage by environmental health advocates who say industry influence is overriding solid science and years of fighting to reduce atrazine contamination of waterways is in jeopardy It s a punch in the gut for all the people who have worked to protect us from this incredibly harmful poison said Nathan Donley environmental health science director with the Center for Biological Diversity Atrazine is a widely used weedkilling chemical that is popular with farmers particularly those growing corn and the chemical has been found to heavily contaminate drinking water supplies around the country raising concerns for human health The chemical has been banned for use as an herbicide in the European Union since 2003 Research has shown that atrazine is an endocrine disruptor that can affect the sexual development of frogs chemically castrating frogs and feminizing male amphibians The effects are seen at exposure to levels well below 1 ppb over 10 times lower than the new proposed threshold for environmental safety known as the CE LOC or concentration equivalent level of concern In

EPA s most recent position disagrees Before Biden left office EPA spokesman Remmington Belford noted in a statement sent in response to questions that the new CE LOC proposal followed a 2023 scientific advisory panel reevaluation of a subset of studies on the topic EPA does not anticipate any human health risks of concern from atrazine exposure to surface water and drinking water Belford added The EPA is currently taking public comments on the proposal The comment period ends Feb 18 though the agency says comments must be received by Feb 3 It is unclear if the proposal will be impacted by changes in administration at the EPA under the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump But the prior Trump administration sparked an uproar when it attempted to raise the CE LOC to 15 ppb EPA scientists reported administrative meddling forced them to discount scientific findings to support that level and the measure was successfully challenged in court Back and forth As defined the CE LOC is supposed to provide a limit that protects fish invertebrates and amphibians in the aquatic ecosystem But agreeing on where that level should be has been a drawn out battle pitting Syngenta and supporters pushing for higher levels against health and environmental advocates pushing for lower levels The EPA has whipsawed back and forth on the question amid political changes in EPA leadership In a 2022 letter from EPA Assistant Administrator Michal Freedhoff to an industry advocacy group Freedhoff cited confusion over the changing agency positions on the matter She said the 15 ppb undertaken by the first Trump administration represented a policy decision but the best data on the issue as analyzed in 2016 before Trump took office and again during the Biden administration supported the 3 4 ppb It is not clear why the agency moved from 3 4 ppb to 9 7 ppb before Biden left office but many suspect corporate pressure as a possible culprit Syngenta has a long history of

The New Lede revealed after obtaining thousands of internal company records Researcher Tyrone Hayes an ecotoxicologist and developmental biologist at the University of California Berkeley who has studied atrazine for nearly 30 years said that the move by the EPA to allow such a high level of atrazine into the water is inexplicable given the evidence of atrazine harm to the environment Industry pressure is the only reasonable explanation for the agency s action he said Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Jason Rohr a researcher who has studied atrazine at the University of Notre Dame said the latest move by the EPA to set a benchmark at 9 7 is a little disappointing I would have expected the EPA to go in the opposite direction for there to be more regulations and restrictions especially in the last decade with all we ve learned he said In a 2021 paper Rohr wrote that the story of atrazine represents a textbook example of manufacturing uncertainty bending science to delay undesired regulatory decisions The paper chronicles how Syngenta and other industry groups regularly bent science toward favorable outcomes attacked and denied

agenda continues to gain popular support proposed changes in agricultural policy may pave the way for more pesticides to enter the U S food system The U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA is advancing a proposal that would block states from requiring warning labels on pesticides herbicides and other commonly used agricultural products The Lever reported Meanwhile at the state level at least 11 and as many as 21 states are proposing industry drafted bills to grant agrochemical companies immunity from liability for harms from their products if those products are licensed by the EPA according to Moms Across America Both proposals stem in part from the ongoing battles over glyphosate the most commonly used herbicide in the country and the key ingredient in Bayer s Roundup weedkiller Extensive scientific research has identified glyphosate as a carcinogen and linked it to many additional health concerns including autism and decreased birth weight for babies Monsanto which Bayer acquired in 2018 faces thousands of lawsuits by people who claim they developed cancer after being exposed to Roundup Bayer set aside more than 10 billion to settle roughly 100 000 of the claims although some of the settlements have become mired in difficulties In 2021 Bayer said it would set aside another 4 5 billion to cover cancer claims Under President Donald Trump s first administration the EPA determined that glyphosate is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans but a federal appeals court rejected that determination in June 2022 In September 2022 the EPA withdrew its decision but still maintains that no cancer risk to humans is present That decision is still under review The proposed rule changes come as former New York Congressman Lee Zeldin takes the helm at EPA Zeldin who has a history of voting against environmental protection measures has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from the agribusiness sector Trump promised that Zeldin would ensure fair and

general from 11 states are leading the initiative which would override existing laws and threaten to limit public awareness about the health risks of many chemical agricultural products according to The Lever They submitted a letter to the EPA stating that warning labels about glyphosate are central to their concerns They underscored how important glyphosate is for farmers in their states saying it allows them to effectively manage weeds using fewer chemicals and other inputs Better weed management also increases crop yields by allowing the growing crops to reach yield potential They also

in an email shared with The Defender that foreign pesticide companies are seeking complete immunity so they can get away with covering up the risks and dangers of their products This bill hurts farmers seeking to hold Bayer and ChemChina accountable for the harms they knowingly covered up In 2017 ChemChina acquired Syngenta maker of the highly poisonous paraquat weedkiller which is linked to Parkinson s disease Hinkle also said the immunity sought by chemical makers would apply to over 16 000 chemicals the EPA regulates under the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act FIFRA and also to any future chemicals covered by the act It covers not only human health claims like those pending against Bayer for causing cancer or ChemChina for causing Parkinson s disease but also property damage claims like those against Bayer for covering up the risk of drift from dicamba over the top he added By making the EPA label sufficient warning under state law all potential claims against any pesticide manufacturer are wiped out even when they actively conceal the risks to human health and the environment Hinkle wrote Moms Across America said that the deal Big Ag is seeking is even better than the protections afforded to Big Pharma by the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act That law protects vaccine makers from lawsuits for vaccines routinely recommended for pregnant

on most uses of a pesticide that acts as a nerve agent was applauded by health advocates this week though some warned the proposal doesn t go far enough The U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA proposal targets acephate a widely used bug killing chemical whose residues have been found in foods generally considered healthy such as celery green beans and tomatoes The chemical is also found in drinking water The agency said it plans to end all uses of acephate on food because it had determined after more than 50 years of use that it cannot be certain that no harm would result from acephate exposure particularly from acephate levels in drinking water Acephate is part of a class of nerve agent chemicals known as organophosphates that are popular with U S farmers who use them to fight pests in their fields But the chemicals have been linked to a range of adverse health effects particularly in children such as reduced IQ attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD and autism spectrum disorders Acephate long banned in the European Union has also been linked to cancer among other health problems We are applauding this It is long overdue said Patti Goldman a lawyer with Earthjustice one of several health and environmental advocacy organizations that have pushed the EPA for year to take action on acephate and other organophosphates We are really pleased that EPA is proposing to ban all food uses Earthjustice along with several other health civil rights farmworker and learning disability groups filed a petition in 2011 calling on the EPA to prohibit all organophosphates The EPA action came late last month coinciding with a report by ProPublica which revealed how the agency had in the past justified increasing the amount of acephate allowed on food by removing safety margins that are called for in federal law to protect children from pesticide residues in their diets The new EPA proposal reiterates that stance saying that when using new approach

wants public input on alternate mitigation proposals that may allow for certain registered uses of acephate Strong industry opposition is expected particularly from the cotton growing industry Cotton growers have called acephate a critical backbone for the industry The agency said it will take public comments on its plan for 60 days The agency s openness to consider mitigation strategies is a concern to health and environmental advocates who point out that even if all food uses were immediately banned it would not necessarily quickly eliminate residues in food and water The EPA had already canceled its approval of acephate for use on green beans in 2011 but the chemical was still found on samples of green beans in the most recent publicly reported tests done by the U S Department of Agriculture USDA more than a decade later according to the USDA s 2022 pesticide residue report In its proposal the EPA said that should there be food uses that can be reconsidered following the comment period it had come up with anticipated tolerances for what could be new legally allowed levels of acephate on certain food crops including Brussels sprouts and legumes The EPA includes tolerances for residues of methamidophos a metabolite of acephate that is considered by the EPA to be one of the most acutely toxic organophosphate pesticides The tolerances for methamidophos would be

agency also said it will delay the deadline for drinking water systems to comply with limits on two other contaminants from 2029 to 2031 You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Shannon Kelleher U S regulators said Wednesday they will do away with limits on certain types of toxic chemicals in U S drinking water a move that critics warn could expose millions of Americans to dangerous contaminants The U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA said it intends to rescind limits set under President Joe Biden in April 2024 on four types of harmful per and polyfluoroalkyl PFAS chemicals widely found in drinking water perfluorononanoic acid PFNA perfluorohexane sulfonate PFHxS perfluorobutane sulfonate PFBS and GenX The EPA will keep the limits of 4 parts per trillion in drinking water for two other types of PFAS perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid PFOS the agency said in a statement But in another move drawing criticism from health advocates the agency said it will delay the deadline for drinking water systems to comply from 2029 to 2031 This is a public health betrayal plain and simple said Melanie Benesh vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group Science is clear PFAS are dangerous even in tiny amounts The agency must protect all Americans not just from two chemicals but from the entire class of harmful PFAS The four PFAS chemicals the EPA plans to roll back regulations for are the ones currently in use because industry developed them to replace PFOA and PFOS so they are the chemicals most likely to increase contamination in the future Betsy Southerland a former EPA senior scientist and a former director in the agency s Office of Water said in a statement PFAS are types of chemicals that have long been used in a wide variety of products and industrial processes but many have been linked to health problems that include certain cancers and immune system and reproductive harms Countries around the world have been pushing companies to eliminate the use of PFAS known to be particularly dangerous such as PFOS and PFOA but the chemicals remain difficult to eradicate A recent study found residents of a Michigan community polluted with PFAS from a paper mill continue to have high levels of the chemicals in their blood even though the mill closed down 25

to use its regulatory and enforcement tools to hold polluters accountable The EPA also said it would defend the PFAS drinking water regulation from ongoing legal challenges from industry groups and

press conference in Utah which last week became the first state to ban the practice of adding fluoride to community water supplies The growing body of research showing fluoride s toxic effects gained national attention when a federal judge in September ruled against the EPA in a landmark lawsuit brought by the Fluoride Action Network FAN Mothers Against Fluoridation Food Water Watch and others U S District Judge Edward Chen ruled that water fluoridation at current levels recommended by public health agencies in the U S poses an unreasonable risk to children s health and that the agency must

communities should add fluoride to their drinking water and at what levels However the EPA sets the maximum levels allowed in water under the Safe Drinking Water Act The current maximum allowable levels of fluoride in drinking water are 4 0 milligrams liter mg L which is many orders of magnitude higher than the currently recommended dosage of 0 7 mg L which itself has demonstrated a risk to children s health in recent studies Chen ruled that the EPA must regulate fluoride under the Toxic Substances Control Act which regulates substances whose production use or disposal may cause unreasonable risks to human health In August 2024 the National Toxicology Program published a report linking fluoride exposure to neurotoxic effects in children after public health officials tried for years to block its publication and water down its conclusions Recent epidemiological studies in Canada Mexico and the U S showed significant associations between higher fluoride exposure and worse neurocognitive outcomes for children including at the 0 7 mg L levels A meta analysis published in January showed that fluoride exposure was associated with significant reductions in IQ scores in children Major medical associations and public health agencies including the American Academy of Pediatrics the American Dental Association and the CDC have continued to support adding fluoride to drinking water claiming it helps prevent cavities However in addition to the growing body of research showing fluoride s risks to children s health a second body of research shows that water

direct attack on the buy local foods movement and local meat producers American Stewards of Liberty the Kansas Natural Resource Coalition and other organizations submitted comments opposing the proposed rule Small meat producers unable to sustain these costs Representatives of the two groups told The Defender why they opposed the EPA s proposal Tracey Barton Kansas Natural Resource Coalition s executive director said The proposed EPA rule will require costly upgrades for meat processing facilities The anticipated cost is 300 000 400 000 for the initial upgrade with annual maintenance fees of 100 000 In Kansas many small meat processors are unable to sustain these costs and will be forced to close their doors For the facilities that are able to sustain the increase in capital the costs will be passed onto farmers ranchers as well as consumers driving meat prices which are at an all time high even higher Margaret Byfield executive director of American Stewards of Liberty said What is very concerning to us is that in the rule they have several alternatives The most extreme of these would apply to by their own numbers around 3 700 meat processors So that s going to capture your small local meat processor According to American Stewards of Liberty the EPA s current rule enacted in 1974 and last amended in 2004 applies only to approximately 150 of the 5 055 small processors in the U S Byfield said the rule would put small processors out of business and add to further concentration in the meat industry The cost of the regulation is what is going to run these small meat

requiring herd reduction or liquidation Howard Vlieger a member of the board of advisers of GMO Toxin Free USA told The Defender the EPA s proposed rule is devoid of common sense The first question that I would ask is what is their desired outcome Is the agency wanting to drive small packers out of business he asked According to Barton what prompted the EPA s proposal was an environmental sue and settle case Cape Fear River Watch et al v United States Environmental Protection Agency which the EPA settled within four months agreeing to modify their rules A consortium of environmental organizations filed the lawsuit in 2022 alleging most meat processing facilities were not governed by water pollution standards As a result of the settlement the EPA determined that revisions to its water pollution rules for meat processing facilities were appropriate leading to the new proposal Byfield said The rule isn t in effect yet and that the next step in the process is to go through all those public comments revise their rule based on those comments and then issue a new final rule However she warned the EPA may skip certain steps Typically in this process you have a second comment period However what we ve seen from this administration is they bypass that second set of comments We anticipate that they re going to try and push this rule out as quickly as they can before the window of the Congressional Review Act kicks in Byfield said What this means said Byfield is that if the administration changes Congress can review and revoke anything that was finalized within 90

live there anymore she added Writing on Substack Dr Robert Malone said the EPA anticipates the new rules will at least result in the closure of 16 processing facilities across the country However on the high side EPA estimates include an impact range of up to 845 processing facilities Byfield was not optimistic projecting that many meat processing facilities will be bought out by large companies and subsequently forced to close if the rule takes effect I think that the likely scenario is they d shut them down because it makes more sense to spend the 300 000 400 000 in one facility not in five or six I mean that s a huge cost even to the big guys she said Vlieger said There are many common sense options that could be utilized that would be cost efficient and simultaneously utilize the nutrient sources for crop production but the EPA seemingly wants to regulate small processors to death Large meat processors particularly concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs are the ones who benefit from favorable policies he said Small processing facilities are already at a disadvantage due to the costs for the rendering components of slaughter of all species of meat animals and poultry Whereas the largest packing companies receive credits for hide and offal the small processors have an expense to dispose of the offal he said referring to additional revenue large meat packing facilities can earn by selling meat by products This is an example of the government picking winners and losers The losers are farmers ranchers and small meat processors who cannot afford to comply

also allows consumers to build relationships with farmers and ranchers and to learn what goes into the meat they buy A lot of these local producers will invite you out to their property And so you

1960s and 1970s that resulted in many small butcher shops going out of business You no longer have that local butcher store Byfield said Now you have more regional butcher shops where they have to be large enough so that they re processing more meat pounds per day per week per month so that they can afford that regulatory burden that s already there Byfield said Byfield said that a proposed congressional bill H R 7079 also known as the Beef Act would stop this rule urging the public to call their local congressional representatives Additionally we believe there is going to be an effort

waste that is directly discharged into waterways and would establish limitations for phosphorus for the first time It would also establish the first pretreatment standards for oil grease and certain other pollutants The standards would apply to about 845 of the 3 879 slaughter and meat processing facilities that discharge waste into U S waters It s a very good step in the right direction said John Rumpler senior clean water director for Environment America a network of state environmental groups But by EPA s own estimates they could be doing more to curb pollution from this sector he said The EPA said its plan follows the latest science and would help protect the nation s vital water resources which support safe drinking water agriculture industry recreation activities and thriving communities through the implementation of affordable and available wastewater treatment technologies An alternative option proposed by the EPA would apply to the same 845 facilities eliminating an estimated 228 million pounds of water pollution per year according to the EPA A third option would extend requirements to some smaller facilities affecting almost twice as many facilities and eliminating an estimated 322 million pounds of pollution per year the EPA said In addition the EPA is proposing limits on E coli bacteria in wastewater directly discharged into waterways which can cause severe illness if consumed by humans Facilities that produce meat and poultry products are a major source of water pollution in the U S with slaughterhouses releasing more than 55 million pounds of toxic substances into rivers and streams in 2018 Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in waterways can lead to a variety of problems including eutrophication and harmful algal blooms which have negative impacts on human health and the environment according to the EPA This pollution may take a particularly heavy toll on low income and or otherwise disadvantaged 74 of facilities that produce meat and poultry products that directly discharge wastewater into nearby waterways are located within one mile of such communities according to a 2021 EPA", "chunk_id":

according to a 2021 EPA study Despite the environmental and human health impacts of these facilities the EPA has not updated its pollution control standards for large slaughterhouses since 2004 while its standards for smaller facilities have not budged since 1975 Over 100 environmental groups submitted comments to the EPA in 2019 calling for the agency to reduce water pollution from these facilities Environment America and nine other nonprofits in 2022 filed a complaint alleging that EPA s failure to update the pollution standards for the slaughterhouse sector violated the Clean Water Act The agency s announcement of the proposed rule is a result of a consent decree that set deadlines for the EPA to issue updated rules We believe that America s rivers lakes and streams should be safe for swimming and fishing and clean and safe for wildlife and so forth just as the Clean Water Act set out in 1972 said Rumpler The closer we can get to those goals that we all agreed on as a

Pesticides raised the issue when telling the National Organic Standards Board NOSB that it could not by law allow GRAS substances without a thorough independent review Beyond Pesticides whose executive director served on the NOSB cited a comprehensive review 2011 of the U S food additive regulatory program which found that 60 of food safety decisions allowing substances in food are made by

found FDA s oversight process does not help ensure the safety of all new GRAS determinations FDA only reviews those GRAS determinations that companies submit to the agency s voluntary notification program the agency generally does not have information about other GRAS determinations companies have made because companies are not required to inform FDA of them FDA has yet to issue a final regulation for its 1997 proposed rule that sets forth the framework and criteria for the voluntary notification program potentially detracting from the program s credibility FDA is not systematically ensuring the continued safety of current GRAS substances While according to FDA regulations the GRAS status of a substance must be reconsidered as new scientific information emerges the agency has not systematically reconsidered GRAS substances since the 1980s FDA has also not generally responded to concerns raised by individuals and public interest groups In fact FDA has decided on the validity of these concerns in only 1 of 11 cases In addition FDA does not know to what extent or even whether companies track evolving scientific information about their GRAS substances FDA s approach to regulating nanotechnology allows engineered nanomaterials to enter the food supply as GRAS substances without FDA s knowledge FDA encourages but does not require companies considering using engineered nanomaterials in food to consult with the agency regarding whether such substances might be GRAS Because GRAS notification is voluntary and companies are not required to identify nanomaterials in their GRAS substances the FDA has no way of knowing the full extent to which engineered nanomaterials have entered the U S food supply as part of GRAS substances Back to pesticide mixtures The

presence of multiple pesticide residues remain largely overlooked the authors say As previously reported scientists and health advocates have urged prioritizing further studies on the effect of mixtures on organisms for many decades given that exposure in the environment is not limited to a single pesticide at a time Recent studies have increasingly highlighted the toxic effects of abamectin on non target organisms and human cells the researchers state The combination of pesticides is widely used due to widespread resistance among red spider mites to individual pesticides The interaction effects of commonly used pesticides remain largely unexplored This study exposes a mechanism for the synergistic effects of concurrent exposure to a combination of pesticides and highlights the importance of considering synergy in risk assessments These findings enhance our understanding of the interactions among multiple pesticide residues and further clarify the complexity of these interactions and their impact on human exposure the authors conclude See additional coverage on health effects from pesticide mixtures here and here Additional research referenced in the study supports the findings of intestinal damage from pesticide exposure This includes The insecticide imidacloprid which induces disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier specifically through the down regulation of tight junction protein complexes has enhanced toxicity against the gut microbiota in mice with co exposure to zinc oxide See studies here and here The insecticide chlorpyrifos is observed to disrupt the integrity of the gut barrier in mice resulting in increased entry of lipopolysaccharides into the body See the study here The fungicide carbendazim which when combined with epoxiconazole or fluazinam has synergistic effects in Caco 2 cells according to a study in Food Chemistry The findings are very concerning given that pesticide residues in food are introduced directly to the intestines As the researchers note The intestinal tract functions as a congenital barrier for homeostasis preventing pathogenic bacteria toxins and other harmful substances from entering the

somehow brought about what happened and it devastated me At first Kory was thrilled when videos of him discussing the treatment went viral Major news organizations including The Associated Press contacted him and major medical journals invited research articles on his work Kory thought he would be able to help save lives Instead he and his opinions were attacked news stories discredited his research and he lost a series of jobs That led to some self reflection on his part Yet when a colleague sent him an email describing the Disinformation Playbook Kory said things began to make sense

pointed to the dangers of smoking This Disinformation Playbook was used against Kory Dr Paul Marik Dr Peter McCullough and countless others who proposed alternative therapies for COVID 19 After Kory

how few whistleblowers emerged during COVID 19 He said a study on whistleblowers described by Dr Peter Gøtzsche showed that despite the suffering such people typically experience When asked whether they would do it again they almost all said yes Leila said she wasn t surprised by the study s finding because as a whistleblower You feel happier that you lived in integrity and you weren t silenced

também mediram respostas de anticorpos incluindo aquelas contra a proteína spike e contra PEG um componente dos LNPs Além disso eles desenvolveram um ensaio para avaliar como os LNPs interagiam com diferentes tipos de células imunes em amostras de sangue As descobertas detalhadas incluem Detecção de mRNA e lipídios no sangue O estudo descobriu que tanto o mRNA quanto o lipídio ionizável SM 102 eram detectáveis em amostras de sangue já quatro horas após a vacinação Ambos os componentes atingiram suas concentrações máximas entre um e dois dias após a vacinação Taxas de persistência e decaimento Uma das principais descobertas do estudo foi a detectabilidade prolongada dos componentes da vacina no sangue Em 50 dos indivíduos pequenas quantidades de mRNA ainda eram detectáveis 28 dias após a vacinação Os pesquisadores também descobriram que a proporção de moléculas de mRNA intactas diminuiu lentamente mas consistentemente ao longo do período do estudo As taxas de decaimento do mRNA intacto e do lipídio SM 102 foram quase idênticas com ambos mostrando uma meia vida de aproximadamente 1 14 dias A degradação lenta do mRNA apesar de circular no sangue in vivo a 37 C e a taxa de decaimento idêntica do mRNA intacto e do lipídio ionizável sugere que o mRNA foi amplamente protegido na circulação dentro da nanopartícula lipídica declararam os autores Respostas de anticorpos O estudo mediu as respostas de anticorpos contra a proteína spike e o PEG Os anticorpos anti PEG já eram detectáveis na maioria dos indivíduos antes da vacinação e mostraram um aumento modesto",

indivíduos antes da vacinação e mostraram um aumento modesto após o reforço Os pesquisadores encontraram uma correlação positiva entre os níveis de pico de mRNA e lipídios ionizáveis no sangue e o aumento subsequente em anticorpos anti PEG um aumento de 1 4 vezes em anticorpos de imunoglobulina G IgG e um aumento de 4 6 vezes em anticorpos IgM Isso demonstra uma resposta imune não intencional contra um componente do próprio sistema de administração da vacina Os autores não observaram uma correlação entre anticorpos anti PEG preexistentes e a taxa de decaimento de mRNA ou lipídios ionizáveis no sangue Isso sugere que processos fisiológicos humanos intrínsecos em vez de anticorpos preexistentes podem ser responsáveis pela depuração de componentes da vacina pelo menos nos níveis de anticorpos observados neste estudo Como esperado a vacina também aumentou os anticorpos contra a proteína spike O aumento médio em IgG específica para spike foi de 21 3 vezes em 28 dias após a vacinação Interações celulares Os pesquisadores desenvolveram um procedimento para examinar como os LNPs interagiam com diferentes células imunes em amostras de sangue Eles descobriram que as nanopartículas estavam principalmente associadas a monócitos e células B com interação mínima com outros tipos de células como células T e células assassinas naturais Os monócitos são parte do sistema imunológico inato e podem engolfar partículas estranhas em um processo chamado fagocitose Sua interação com as nanopartículas sugere que eles podem desempenhar um papel no processamento e na limpeza dos componentes da vacina As células B são responsáveis por produzir anticorpos Sua interação com as nanopartículas pode ser parte do processo que leva à produção de anticorpos incluindo anticorpos anti PEG Notavelmente os pesquisadores observaram uma relação inversa entre a capacidade dos monócitos de interagir com LNPs e o aumento de anticorpos anti PEG após a vacinação Os autores disseram que isso sugere que a eficiência da depuração dos monócitos das nanopartículas pode influenciar o quanto o sistema imunológico desenvolve anticorpos contra PEG Autópsias necessárias para entender o efeito

outsider the scale can be overwhelming It s all you see for miles For me though it was just normal The fields around my family farm were my childhood playground But one thing struck me as off Nothing ate the corn as we had no cows pigs or chickens Each year the harvest disappeared down the highway on semi trucks And it s where the corn ended up that s a problem likely in your car s gas tank Now corn ethanol is fueling the rapidly expanding geologic carbon storage industry which is bringing a new set of problems to the Midwest In college studying environmental science I learned I grew up in the shadow of two industries oil and agriculture The prairies wetlands and oak savannas that once covered my home had been plowed under and replaced by corn and soy subsidized by the federal government Corn is grown so intensively that yields increase by two bushels per acre each year The side effects include carbon emissions topsoil depletion and fertilizer and pesticide runoff into the former meandering streams now ditches in which I once played and caught crawdads All this pollution may contribute to Iowa s rising cancer rates I live in central Illinois now a 45 minute drive from Decatur home of ethanol giant Archer Daniels Midland ADM and the end destination for much of the region s corn But wherever you live you re likely filling your car with Iowa corn The 2005 Renewable Fuel Standard which mandated ethanol in gasoline as a transition fuel to more sustainable biofuels that never materialized is now deeply inscribed in the Midwest s landscape Or as Silvia Secchi a natural resource economist and a professor in the Department of Geographical and Sustainability Sciences at the University of Iowa put it Ethanol is a way to dispose essentially of an ever growing ever increasing amount of corn Ethanol wasn t meant to last But as the automotive industry embraces electrification ethanol faces an existential crisis The Biden administration threw the ethanol industry a lifeline in the Inflation Reduction Act which established an 85 per metric ton subsidy for geologic carbon sequestration The carbon dioxide that ethanol plants produce is pretty clean easy

carbon sequestration well built more than a decade ago as a pilot project I ve followed the corn across state lines It seems I ve also followed the carbon Over the past 10 years ADM says its project has sequestered 4 5 million metric tons of CO2 Now companies have submitted plans for about 20 additional wells in Illinois to the EPA for approval which according to the Eco Justice Collaborative would mean scaling up sequestration by 100 times Proposals for pipelines that would snake across the Midwest transporting carbon here also keep cropping up Billions of dollars in tax breaks are up for grabs although the future of the carbon sequestration subsidy is uncertain under the Donald Trump administration By hiding its emissions underground the ethanol industry hopes to cling on indefinitely qualifying as a low carbon biofuel so it can be sold in California and later as an aviation fuel It s an equation industry has managed to solve perfectly a source of emissions and a way to sequester them both sides propped up by lucrative subsidies and tied together by a pipeline of high pressure liquified carbon dioxide But there s a problem at the ADM plant held up as an example of U S carbon

before the public found out the company s well located in the heart of Decatur leaked CO2 deep below It is absolutely correct for the City Council and for the residents of Decatur to come to the conclusion that ADM company withheld relevant substantive information about the safety of these carbon sequestration activities at the very time it was negotiating an agreement for carbon sequestration activities to take place at a much larger scale Horn said And so for that reason the residents are right to be concerned and to be frustrated Carbon sequestration might be important but who wants to live with it Residents vented their concern and frustration through the Protect the Mahomet Aquifer campaign led by the Prairie Rivers Network Eco Justice Collaborative and Illinois People s Action all local environmental groups The Mahomet supplies drinking water for much of central Illinois It also happens to overlie the most favorable geology for sequestration As carbon sequestration scales up four proposed projects would drill through the aquifer to Mt Simon Sandstone Some research shows that CO2 leaks could contaminate aquifers by leaching heavy metals into water or introducing brine from deeper saline aquifers Environmentalists also worry about bigger unknowns corrosion in wells cracks in caprock layers from seismic activity or unmapped abandoned oil wells that could provide irreparable paths for the CO2 to return to the surface And companies are incentivized by subsidies to put CO2 underground not necessarily to keep it there said Andrew Rehn the

Commission offered some concessions to the agricultural sector but said it will not scale back its plan to cut 90 of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 Reuters reported Tuesday The new commission plan drops the requirement to reduce farm related emissions such as nitrogen nitrous oxide and methane by one third and removes the recommendation that EU citizens eat less meat The Telegraph reported Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday also offered to drop her proposal requiring farmers to cut pesticide use in half by 2030 saying it had become a symbol of polarisation according to The Guardian Other concessions included limiting Ukrainian agricultural imports and delaying rules for setting aside more land to promote soil health and biodiversity At the behest of von der Leyen s center right European People s Party the revised commission plan features language praising the value of the agricultural sector noting its importance for attaining the EU goal of food sovereignty wrote Politico The compromise comes after weeks of escalating demonstrations by farmers in France Spain Germany Portugal Italy Poland the Netherlands Belgium Lithuania and other EU countries against several policies from fuel subsidies and unfair trade practices to green emissions rules and taxes that they said threaten their livelihoods The farmers argued the climate regulations have singled them out unfairly imposing a disproportionate burden compared to other industries that also damage the environment according to the Washington Examiner Over the past several weeks tractors in several European cities blocked major highways and city streets even an airport forcing national governments to the negotiating table before the EU Parliament summit in Brussels last week German Chancellor

Charts show falling birth rates for countries across Europe beginning in 2022 and datasheets break down the COVID 19 vaccination status of new mothers in the Czech Republic Why aren t governments interested in putting it all together and finding answers By Tomas Fürst In January 2022 the number of children born in the Czech Republic suddenly decreased by about 10 By the end of 2022 it had become clear that this was a signal All the monthly numbers of newborns were mysteriously low In April 2023 I wrote a piece for a Czech investigative platform InFakta and suggested that this unexpected phenomenon might be connected to the aggressive vaccination campaign that had started approximately nine months before the drop in natality Denik N a Czech equivalent of The New York Times immediately came forward with a devastating takedown of my article labeled me a liar and claimed that the pattern can be explained by demographics There were fewer women in the population and they were getting older To compare fertility across countries and time the so called Total Fertility Rate TFR is used Roughly speaking it is the average number of children that are born to a woman over her lifetime TFR is independent of the number of women and of their age structure Figure 1 below shows the evolution of TFR in several European countries between 2001 and 2023 I selected countries that experienced a similar drop in TFR in 2022 as the Czech Republic Figure 1 The evolution of Total Fertility Rate in selected European countries between 2000 and 2023 The data corresponding to a particular year are plotted at the end of the column representing that year So by the end of 2023 the following two points were clear 1 The drop in natality in the Czech Republic in 2022 could not be explained by demographic factors Total fertility rate which is independent of the number of women and their age structure dropped sharply in 2022 and has been decreasing ever since The data for 2024 show that the Czech TFR has decreased further to 1 37 2 Many other European countries experienced the same dramatic and unexpected decrease in fertility that started at the beginning of 2022 I have selected some of them for Figure 1 but there are more The Netherlands Norway Slovakia Slovenia and Sweden On the other hand there are some countries that do not show a sudden drop in TFR but rather a

TFR is independent of the demographics Thus the v word keeps creeping back into people s minds and the web s wild west is ripe with speculation We decided not to speculate but to wrestle some more data from the Czech government For many months we were trying to acquire the number of newborns in each month broken down by age and vaccination status of the mother The post socialist health care system of our country is a double edged sword On one hand the state collects much more data about citizens than an American would believe On the other hand we have an equivalent of the Freedom of Information Act FOIA and we are not afraid to use it After many months of fruitless correspondence with the authorities we turned to Jitka Chalankova a Czech Ron Johnson in skirts who finally managed to obtain an invaluable data sheet To my knowledge the datasheet now publicly available with an English translation here is the only officially released dataset containing a breakdown of newborns by the COVID 19 vaccination status of the mother We requested much more detailed data but this is all we got The data contains the number of births per month between January 2021 and December 2023 given by women aged 18 39 who were vaccinated i e had received at least one COVID 19 vaccine dose by the date of delivery and by women who were unvaccinated i e had not received any dose of any COVID 19

mentioning that the paper had been rejected without review in six high ranking scientific journals In Figure 2 we reprint the main finding of our analysis Figure 2A Histogram showing the percentage of women in the Czech Republic ages 18 39 years who were vaccinated with at least one dose of a Covid 19 vaccine by the end of the respective month Figure 2B Estimates of the number of successful conceptions SCs per 1 000 women ages 18 39 years according to their pre conception Covid vaccination status The blue shaded areas in Figure 1B show the intervals between the lower and upper estimates of the true SC rates for women vaccinated dark blue and unvaccinated light blue before conception Figure 2 reveals several interesting patterns that I list here in order of importance 1 Vaccinated women conceived about a third fewer children than would be expected from their share of the population Unvaccinated women conceived at about the same rate as all women before the pandemic Thus a strong association between COVID 19 vaccination status and successful conceptions has been established 2 In the second half of 2021 there was a peak in the rate of conceptions of the unvaccinated and a corresponding trough in the vaccinated This points to rather intelligent behavior of Czech women who contrary to the official advice probably avoided vaccination if they wanted to get pregnant This concentrated the pregnancies in the unvaccinated group and produced the peak 3 In the first half of 2021 there was significant uncertainty in the estimates of the conception rates The lower estimate of the conception rate in the vaccinated was produced by assuming that all women vaccinated by at least one dose during pregnancy were unvaccinated before conception This was almost certainly true in the first half of 2021 because the vaccines were not available prior to 2021 The upper estimate was produced by assuming that all women vaccinated by at least one dose during pregnancy also received at least one dose before conception This was probably closer to the truth in the second part of 2021 Thus we think that the true conception rates for the vaccinated start close to the lower",

early 2021 and end close to the upper bound in early 2022 Once again we would like to be much more precise but we have to work with what we have got Now that the association between COVID 19 vaccination and lower rates of conception has been established the one important question looms Is this association causal In other words did the COVID 19 vaccines really prevent women from getting pregnant The guardians of the official narrative brush off our findings and say that the difference is easily explained by confounding The vaccinated tend to be older more educated city dwelling more climate change aware you name it That all may well be true but in early 2022 the TFR of the whole population dropped sharply and has been decreasing ever since So something must have happened in the spring of 2021 Had the population of women just spontaneously separated into two groups rednecks who wanted kids and didn t want the jab and city slickers who didn t want kids and wanted the jab the fertility rate of the unvaccinated would indeed be much higher than that of the vaccinated In that respect such a selection bias could explain the observed pattern However had this been true the total TFR of the whole population would have remained constant But this is not what happened For some reason the TFR of the whole population jumped down in January 2022 and has been decreasing ever since And we have just shown that for some reason this decrease in fertility affected only the vaccinated So if you want to argue that a mysterious factor X is responsible for the drop in fertility you will have to explain 1 why the factor affected only the vaccinated and 2 why it started affecting them at about the time of vaccination That is a tall order Mr Occam and I both think that X the vaccine is the simplest explanation What really puzzles me is the continuation of the trend If the vaccines really prevented conception shouldn t the effect have been transient It s been more than three years

excess deaths in most Western countries but not in Eastern countries What could the difference possibly be Campbell asked Excess deaths remain high in the U S where between 2020 and early 2025 they were at least 10 higher than the 2015 to 2019 average Excess deaths in the U S spiked in the second half of 2021 through early 2022 reaching 46 We see excess deaths in the United States a bit above the 10 mark for quite a long period of time Campbell said This is an ongoing issue compared to 2015 to 2019 levels CDC data published in 2023 showed 155 000 excess deaths in 2020 and 2021 among people ages 15 64 Campbell observed similarly high excess death rates in several other highly vaccinated Western countries during the same period hovering around 10 in Australia Denmark France Germany Israel New Zealand the Netherlands Singapore and the U K and between 10 and 20 in Canada and Ireland This looks like a huge amount of excess deaths in addition to those lost as a result of the pandemic and the mismanagement and malmanagement during the pandemic Campbell said Referring to South Korea another highly vaccinated country where as recently as last year the excess death rate was over 20 Campbell said these are horrific figures which are simply not being talked about Excess death figures unprecedented raise serious concerns According to Campbell excess deaths should have decreased

people that might have gone on to die in the next few years that died kind of all died all of a sudden in 2020 So we should see a reduction in excess deaths as we see in Eastern European and other countries Campbell referred to excess death figures from Our World in Data for several non Western countries including Armenia Georgia Romania and Russia where the rates from late 2021 on have remained below average This is exactly what we would expect as a result of the pandemic where vulnerable people for various reasons are no longer with us Campbell said He noted that in some of these countries including Russia they didn t have any mRNA vaccine rollout coincidentally Campbell suggested the highest rates of excess deaths are found in countries where the administration of mRNA COVID 19 vaccines was most prevalent Responding to criticisms that correlation does not equal causation Campbell said that at the very least correlation warrants further study What is causing this causality may be adjudicated by larger scale associations So do we have large scale associations consistent between countries Have we noticed that it s consistent between countries where other explanations are unlikely Campbell asked Campbell also referenced a 2024 paper in BMJ Public Health analyzing excess deaths in 47 Western countries between 2020 and 2022 According to the paper Excess mortality during the COVID 19 pandemic has been substantial reaching almost 3 1 million across the countries sampled during this period This is unprecedented and raises serious concerns the paper stated This insight into the overall all cause excess mortality since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic is an important first step for future health crisis policy decision making According to the paper contributors include COVID 19 infection indirect effects of containment measures and COVID 19 vaccination programmes Differentiating between the various causes is challenging the authors said citing differences in how deaths are recorded and how causes of death are attributed across countries while Consensus is lacking in the medical community regarding when a deceased infected with COVID 19 should be

that higher than average excess deaths were due to the public health establishment s response and the COVID 19 vaccines A peer reviewed study published in March in Discover Medicine found that Japan recorded an abnormal increase in excess deaths in the years since the COVID 19 vaccines were introduced A peer reviewed study published in July 2024 in the European Society of Medicine s official journal Medical Research Archives found that the number of excess deaths in Australia is positively correlated with the number of COVID 19 booster vaccinations received A June 2024 study published in the journal Microorganisms showed that COVID 19 vaccines were linked to an increase in all cause mortality in Italy And a February 2024 study published in the Journal of Community Medicine and Public

upon policymakers to thoroughly investigate underlying causes of persistent excess mortality Campbell agreed Noting that there has been no such investigation in the U K Campbell said he is

2022 through March 2027 The National Cancer Institute part of HHS is facilitating the funding Funding for year three was released in April The study is headed up by Melanie L Kornides associate professor of nursing at the University of Pennsylvania whose research focuses on increasing vaccine uptake and also on strategies to combat misinformation Kornides is joined by a team of digital health communication experts software and program designers social media analysts and machine learning systems experts who will help her run the inoculation experiment on 2 500 parents of children ages 8 12 The team is collecting user data from YouTube Twitter Facebook and Instagram where people talk about HPV and using natural language processing to train an AI tool to identify HPV misinformation or posts that are critical of vaccination whether or not the information in the post is true or false They will then develop and test their inoculation tool exposing subjects in three study arms to different types of messaging meant to make them immune to such misinformation A control group will get no particular messaging and two test groups will be exposed either to messaging designed to inoculate viewers against content critical of of HPV vaccines and content critical of anti vaccine arguments The subjects will get booster doses of messaging at three and six months after their first inoculation If successful the researchers wrote this novel approach to combating health misinformation can be used in wide scale social media campaigns addressing pandemics childhood

providers and trusted community leaders that will convince more parents to vaccinate children against HPV It is one of more than 50 grants totaling more than 40 million awarded by the HHS to universities healthcare systems and departments of public health to increase HPV vaccine uptake that CHD identified were awarded through last year Since then the number of such studies has grown with 26 new grants totaling nearly 28 million awarded in 2024 alone It also aligns with a new initiative by the Biden administration to fund research on AI tools to identify and censor misinformation disinformation and malinformation online according to a U S House of Representatives interim report released in February Those projects are funded through the National Science Foundation Tweet about son s death after HPV shot marked misinformation Nearly half of parents have heard stories of harm from HPV vaccination according to the grant documents and those parents were more likely to refuse vaccination for their children Fueled by misinformation from the anti vaccine movement through social media parents concerns about side effects and safety may foster reluctance to vaccinate their children the documents said In response they are training AI to identify misinformation using methods from Kornides previous work identifying HPV vaccine misinformation on Twitter In that study Kornides and colleagues identified tweets about the HPV vaccine using keywords and coded them for their misinformation content During the open coding process we determined that almost all posts that raised concerns about HPV vaccine contained some degree of misinformation they found The most common form of misinformation described adverse events from vaccines Those tweets had greater engagement than pro HPV vaccine tweets The researchers broke the misinformation down into several classes Overall tweets that were deemed misinformation were tweets that raised concerns that the vaccine was ineffective unsafe or caused serious adverse events there was inadequate or falsified safety monitoring the pharmaceutical industry was profiteering the government conspired with interested actors to

that may make parents hesitant to vaccinate their children They also plan to periodically review the kinds of effective misinformation they want to undermine For example they reported in documents from the third year of the grant that the discussion on HPV vaccination has become more personal in the past few years with more parents questioning the HPV vaccine mandates for school children They see more tweets sharing personal experiences and increasing parents reluctance towards the HPV vaccine for their children the researchers said This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The

the most likely to stop people from vaccinating their children The premise behind the inoculation tool is a biological metaphor suggesting that people s attitudes can be inoculated against future persuasive attacks just like an immune system can be inoculated against a disease Like traditional vaccines inoculation theory works by introducing people to the potentially dangerous argument in a weakened form not strong enough to infect them and providing them with a well timed strong and persuasive argument to counteract it The first part of the method the threat is designed to make people

because while other studies have focused on effective provider communication and educational strategies few studies address misinformation generated by anti vaccine movements on social media platforms which they say are a major source of information for parents especially mothers The content they create will instead be geared toward encouraging vaccination and conferring resistance to antivaccination materials The researchers say that if successful their tool can be adapted to swiftly and efficiently address misinformation regarding COVID 19 childhood vaccinations and cancer

Anthony Fauci and key virologists to draft The proximal origin of SARS CoV 2 published March 2020 in Nature Medicine The paper has been used by media and the U S government to debunk the lab leak theory of the COVID 19 outbreak and accuse its proponents of being conspiracy theorists According to public health physician Dr David Bell partnerships like the one between the WHO and TikTok are inappropriate He told The Defender WHO as an organization subject to member states and with no direct standing over their citizens should not be involved in such direct messaging This is a clear infringement of the rights role and sovereignty of the states themselves WHO acts increasingly like a tool of colonialist corporate interests as it pushes their messages over the top of legitimate authorities and interferes in the running of health systems within countries According to Hinchliffe this is not the first TikTok partnership with the United Nations U N As part of a previous project Team Halo the U N trained scientists and doctors on TikTok and worked with TikTok to boost their profiles in an effort to combat misinformation while promoting authoritative sources during the

Addressing Misinformation About Medical Devices and Prescription Drugs Released in July and now open for public comment the guidance would allow pharmaceutical companies to issue tailored responses to internet based posts about their products and general medical product communications that would address misinformation According to Fierce Pharma The FDA proposed prohibiting companies from posting

role in censoring speech at the behest of the government in the new public square Zuckerberg may imagine that by making this announcement he is mooting this case or making it no longer significant

Meta will use a Community Notes model in which social users themselves decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context said Meta s Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan in a statement We ve seen this approach work on X Kaplan said The change will take a few weeks to implement Kaplan said Meta also will lift restrictions on topics such as immigration and gender identity It s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress but not on our platforms Kaplan said The Defender asked Meta if it will lift restrictions on discussions about vaccine safety and COVID 19 but did not receive a response by deadline Meta is also changing how it enforces its policies Up until now Kaplan said we have been using automated systems to scan for all policy violations

About COVID 19 Facebook and its faux fact check partner have no problem with misinformation provided that it serves a political agenda for which they desire to manufacture consent Facebook s fact checking feature is ostensibly intended to prevent users from becoming misinformed about important matters Instead it s being used as a tool for political propaganda and censorship of truthful information that does not align with certain political agendas Among other agendas Facebook has been serving to manufacture consent for extreme lockdown measures in response to the epidemic of COVID 19 the illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 This is evident in how only information challenging lockdown policies is apparently being flagged as misinformative despite the massive amount of misinformation being propagated by lockdown advocates in the mainstream media Indeed it is evident in how Facebook itself demonstrably misinforms its users through its fact check feature The role of PCR tests in the shifting justification for lockdown measures A recent example is a Nov 12 article by Facebook s fact checking partner Health Feedback which tries to defend the unscientific practice of treating every positive PCR test as a COVID 19 case and using those numbers to justify continuation or reimplementation of lockdown measures Lockdown measures were initially sold to the public as a strictly temporary means to allow hospitals time to procure personal protective equipment PPE and expand bed capacity The idea was to flatten the curve meaning to prevent a short sharp spike of cases that would overwhelm hospitals by reducing transmission with measures intended to prolong the duration of the epidemic wave Flattening the curve was not about preventing cases of COVID 19 The total area under the hypothetical curves would be the same it would just be flatter and more drawn out under the lockdown scenario The idea was not to save lives by reducing the total number of cases but by reducing excess deaths due to lack of access to medical treatment during the initial wave However the measures persisted with the justification soon shifting from a need to flatten the curve to a need to reduce cases indefinitely and regardless of hospitals ability to cope with patient numbers Here in Michigan for example Gov Gretchen Whitmer in May declared the faith based policy goal of reducing cases to nearly zero by keeping lockdown measures in place until a vaccine gets to market that will save us all The numbers of COVID 19 cases are being determined primarily through the use of tests known as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR assays which detect the presence of ribonucleic acid RNA unique to the novel

false information has been posted get this notification To fight false news Facebook pushes misleading content farther down in the newsfeed and provides additional articles on the same topic If a group repeatedly shares false news Facebook may push down all of that group s content which may mean fewer people visit the group Facebook may also stop suggesting that people join the group When

positive COVID 19 cases may arise from oversensitive tests that pick up mere fragments of the virus rather than active viable infections If true many patients may have been receiving false positive test results causing much needless anxiety and disruption to everyday life while the numbers of COVID 19 cases reported by public health authorities and major COVID tracking websites could be vastly overstated Payne was citing an interview with Fauci who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID under the National Institutes of Health NIH and a member of the White House coronavirus task force on a This Week in Virology TWiV podcast published on YouTube on July 16 Jaxen cites the same interview in his article providing a Twitter post with an embedded excerpt of the relevant portion of the interview about PCR tests in which Fauci states What is now sort of evolving into a bit of a standard that if you get a cycle threshold of 35 or more that the chances of it being replication competent are miniscule so that if somebody and you know we do we have patients and it s very frustrating for the patients as well as for the physicians somebody comes

nucleotides period As both Payne and Jaxen rightly observe the consequence of this oversensitivity is that people are being counted as COVID 19 cases based on a positive PCR test even if it detects only non viable viral fragments that are incapable of infection As Health Feedback concisely and accurately explains The podcast discussed COVID 19 testing and the value of the PCR test to inform tested individuals about what measures they should take The PCR test detects the presence of the virus by amplifying a small part of the virus genetic material The number of amplification cycles needed to arrive at a level considered to be a positive result is also called the cycle threshold Ct value The Ct value depends on the quantity of virus in a sample The more virus present the fewer amplification cycles are needed to reach the level for a positive result while a low viral load requires more amplification cycles to reach that same level Whether one has a high or low Ct determines whether contact tracing and self isolation measures would be useful This is because high viral load low Ct value likely indicates that a person is infectious whereas a low viral load high Ct value likely indicates that a person is not infectious or has low transmissibility Health Feedback again acknowledges the PCR test cannot distinguish between infectious and dead non infectious virus However Facebook s fact check partner goes on to argue that several outlets including Just the News incorrectly interpreted this information to suggest that the PCR test s high sensitivity is responsible for inflating the number of COVID 19 cases reported in the U S and that the true number of infections is smaller than reported figures indicate Matching facts to a political agenda Notice that the words cases and infections are treated synonymously by Health Feedback which adds that the supposedly false claim fails to distinguish between the test s ability to confirm a COVID 19 infection which is what case numbers measure with the test s ability to determine contagiousness By Health Feedback s reasoning It is inaccurate to label these high Ct positive results as false positives The term false

article argues a person who tests positive is or has been infected Therefore the article concludes the sensitivity of the PCR test is not responsible for the high number of COVID 19 cases in the U S Simply put COVID 19 case numbers are high because there are many infected people Health Feedback proceeds to identify the political agenda for which consent is being manufactured through its fallacious and deceptive argument This indicates a high level of virus transmission in the community and public health measures such as physical distancing and lockdowns are effective and important for reducing the number of COVID 19 infections and protecting the community In summary the article reiterates the claim that the COVID 19 case counts in the U S are inflated because of the PCR test s sensitivity is based on an inaccurate and misleading conflation of contagiousness with the presence of infection However it is Health Feedback s own argument that is fallacious This is what s known as a strawman argument Instead of addressing the true point being made Health Feedback has set up an imaginary opposing claim and falsely attributed it to the articles being censored by Facebook By this means the fact check partners are deflecting attention from the real issue In this case it s a strawman built on a false premise Indeed to accomplish its deflection Health Feedback outright lies to its readers by insisting that a positive PCR test necessarily means a COVID 19 case What both Payne and Jaxen reported was that PCR tests overinflate COVID 19 cases This is not the same thing as saying that the tests over inflate SARS CoV 2 infections The problem is not that Payne and Jaxen have conflated contagiousness with infection They do not The problem is that Health Feedback has

definition is a set of uniformly applied criteria for determining whether a person should be identified as having a particular disease injury or other health condition The CDC s case definition for COVID 19 establishes the clinical criteria for a COVID 19 diagnosis It requires an infected individual to have symptoms to be counted as a case The CDC s case definition also mentions the proper role of PCR tests which is only to confirm a diagnosis not as the sole basis for diagnosing a case of COVID 19 Thus the term infection is not synonymous with disease A person may be infected with SARS CoV 2 and yet not have COVID 19 and a positive PCR test does not necessarily mean that the individual tested has the disease Health Feedback s false claim that a positive PCR test means the person has COVID 19 rests on wrongly equating those terms as well as conflating the name of the virus with the name of the disease such as its use of the term COVID 19 infection What Health Feedback means is SARS CoV 2 infection which is not what case numbers measure While all cases of COVID 19 necessarily also represent a case of infection not all infections represent a case of COVID 19 Nevertheless in defiance of the CDC s case definition Health Feedback has chosen to defend the practice of counting many COVID 19 cases solely on the basis of a positive PCR test While Health Feedback argues that

Notice that Health Feedback s argument is belied by the title of that Times article which concedes that PCR tests with high Ct values maybe shouldn t be counted as positive in other words they could reasonably be considered false positives Health Feedback itself also implicitly concedes that most PCR test results are false positives by stating that the term false positive indicates that a person tested positive but does not have the disease Consequently according to Health Feedback s own reasoning a positive PCR test in the absence of clinical disease is indeed a false positive Note that the argument could have been made that the term false positive is misleading because it could be interpreted to mean that no SARS CoV 2 RNA was actually present in the tested sample despite a positive result but Health Feedback didn t make that argument In his Just the News piece Payne cited that New York Times article and Health Feedback also did so in its attempted rebuttal But the Times implicit acknowledgement that such test results may reasonably be considered false positives didn t stop Health Feedback from arguing that this interpretation is incorrect an enlightening instance of extreme cognitive dissonance The Health Feedback fact check also quotes Mandavilli demonstrating her own staggering cognitive dissonance on Twitter by trying to rebut people who had cited her article to raise awareness about this widespread misuse of PCR tests with the assertion that People who test positive on the PCR are infected they just may not be infectious But that is false A positive PCR test does not necessarily mean that the person is presently infected It only indicates that the person was exposed to the virus at some point in the past It could indicate a current infection or it could

infection with disease Moreover she is going further and fallaciously equating contagiousness with disease and implying that individuals who experience asymptomatic infection are just as contagious as individuals with clinical disease In truth a person can be both infected and contagious but not have the disease and the scientific evidence shows that individuals with asymptomatic infection are less likely to transmit the virus Why a positive PCR test doesn t equal contagious Again turning to the CDC s textbook medical definitions a carrier is a person or animal that harbors the infectious agent for a disease and can transmit it to others but does not demonstrate signs of the disease A carrier can be asymptomatic never indicate signs of the disease In other words an infected person may be capable of transmitting a virus to others without themselves having the disease that in some susceptible hosts can be caused by that virus However transmissibility is a function of numerous factors including the viral load required to cause infection and not everyone who is infected with SARS CoV 2 is equally likely or capable of transmitting the virus to others One reason why asymptomatic people are less likely to transmit the virus is that by definition they aren t coughing or sneezing This leaves speaking and breathing as the means by which they could theoretically transmit the virus through respiratory droplets or aerosols with the former being recognized as the predominant mode of transmission for SARS CoV 2 Transmission via aerosols or airborne transmission remains theoretical and appears to occur only in unique circumstances where crowds of people are talking or singing together in poorly ventilated indoor environments Another factor is the individual s behavior such as whether they frequent crowded bars or spend their evenings at home or whether they tend to speak loudly and closely to others faces or speak at a reasonable volume while respecting others personal space While the basic reproduction number or R naught R0 has been a widely cited metric with respect to transmissibility it assumes homogeneity in transmission dynamics If the reproduction number is 2

to three other people But in the real world there is heterogeneity in transmission dynamics Some infected individuals spread the virus to many others On the other hand the number of other people to whom most infected individuals appear to transmit an infectious dose of the virus is precisely zero Mandavilli is presumably aware of this After all this information has been previously reported in the New York Times In an article published by the Times on June 2 titled Just Stop the Superspreading epidemiologists Dillon Adam and Benjamin Cowling explained that it is a minority of infected individuals who are responsible for the majority of community transmission of SARS CoV 2 Certain individuals are considered superspreaders and outbreaks are often the consequence of superspreading events which involve crowds of people in close contact for prolonged periods of time almost always indoors In the case of SARS CoV 2 the Times reporter wrote evidence is growing that superspreading is a hugely significant factor of total transmission In a study in Hong Kong the Times reports researchers found that superspreading has overwhelmingly contributed to the transmission of SARS CoV 2 in the city overall The researchers found that just 20 percent of cases all of them involving social gatherings accounted for an astonishing 80 percent of transmissions No less astonishing they wrote was this corollary finding Seventy percent of the people infected did not pass on the virus to anyone According to mathematical modeling by other researchers according to the Times about 10 percent of SARS CoV 2 cases might account for 80 percent of transmissions worldwide The researchers noted that asymptomatic individuals can be contagious as opposed to asserting like Mandavilli that an infected person must be contagious They also reasoned that a highly contagious person is more likely to spread the infection in a crowd at a wedding in a bar during a sporting event than in a small group within their household and when contact is extensive or repeated Transmission is more likely during gatherings indoors than outdoors Simply ventilating a room can help The epidemiologists further

about maintaining or if infections resurge resuming sweeping measures designed to stem the virus s spread in all forms Just focus on stopping the superspreading In other words the types of lockdown measures being justified largely through the systematic misuse of PCR tests are a blunt instrument that are unnecessarily harmful Furthermore as the World Health Organization WHO observed individuals without symptoms are less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms At a press conference on June 8 WHO s technical lead on its coronavirus response Dr Maria Van Kerkhove stated that the available data indicated that It still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic actually transmits onward to a secondary individual Mandavilli tried vainly to dispute that information from WHO too in another New York Times article but did so by conflating the term asymptomatic which WHO was using to mean individuals who never developed any symptoms and presymptomatic which is used to describe transmission that occurs from individuals who go on to develop clinical disease It is possible for an asymptomatic individual infected with SARS CoV 2 to transmit the virus to others but it doesn t necessarily follow that because an individual is infected they are therefore highly contagious As Mandavilli herself explains in her article on PCR test sensitivity transmissibility is largely a function of viral load hence her acknowledgment that a low viral load indicates a low likelihood of contagiousness As explained in a study published in Nature Medicine on June 18 viral load inferred by the number of cycles required to reach the threshold for a positive PCR test does not equate with viral infectivity and further evaluation is needed to determine the respiratory SARS CoV 2 viral load that is correlated with culturable virus Scientists can detect viable virus in a sample by using cell cultures and observing for cytopathic effects and viral replication An inability to culture virus indicates that a PCR test is detecting only non infectious RNA fragments Additionally an equally high viral load in an asymptomatic individual as in an individual with clinical disease does not

virus As noted in a study published in Clinical Translational Immunology on July 27 early cellular immune responses to SARS CoV 2 infection as opposed to subsequent antibody responses appear to be beneficial to control viral load and prevent viral RNA shedding and a positive PCR test is at best only a surrogate marker for infectivity since it may represent non viable viruses or remnant nucleic acid products Little is known about the infectiveness of asymptomatic patients according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on August 6 While there is biological plausibility to the idea that asymptomatic individuals may be equally contagious as those with disease based on findings of equally high viral loads as inferred by PCR tests detection of viral RNA does not equate to infectious virus being present and transmissible A systematic review of studies on asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission of SARS CoV 2 published on June 17 at medRxiv which is an online preprint server for the publication of studies that have not yet undergone peer review further noted that while viral load can be predictive of transmissibility it is not a perfect correlation For example researchers have observed continued high viral loads in symptomatic individuals even after they were no longer able to culture infectious virus from patient samples As the Washington Post reported on Aug 8 data indicate that 40 percent of people with SARS CoV 2 infection have no symptoms which is to say they do not have COVID 19 That article also acknowledged the growing scientific evidence for the hypothesis that cellular immune responses to common human coronaviruses which are a frequent cause of common colds confer some level of cross protective immunity against SARS CoV 2 This background immunity could also help explain along with the absence of coughing and sneezing why asymptomatic individuals appear less likely to transmit the virus to others Some individuals have such an effective immune response that it rapidly clears the infection thus preventing them from developing COVID 19 and reducing the likelihood of them transmitting the virus onward

absolutely does not make sense to blame the measles outbreak on Kennedy according to Dr Vinay Prasad a hematologist oncologist and professor at the University of California San Francisco This

public health infrastructure not to the anti vax sentiment propagated by Kennedy and others Prasad wrote on his Substack The Samoan measles outbreak occurred because of a constellation of factors including a impoverished population a recent history in historical terms of having measles longstanding poor vaccination rates the manslaughter of two children a cover up poor health literacy poor

June 2019 almost a year after the two infants died triggering the government s 10 month pause in MMR vaccines and the sharp decline in vaccination rates Two or three months later a visitor from New Zealand introduced the illness and an outbreak followed The government responded by launching a mass vaccination campaign The Samoan measles outbreak had a particularly high case fatality rate because children either didn t seek medical treatment in Samoa s broken healthcare system or because doctors used ineffective treatments The idea that Kennedy s visit led to nationally low vaccination rates that then led to infant deaths a few months later doesn t make sense Prasad said He couldn t have caused it because the damage was already done Yet multiple media outlets including The Washington Post

reports and even the CDC itself contradict that figure On its website the CDC reports that before the first measles vaccine was developed in 1963 It is estimated 3 to 4 million people in the United States were infected each year resulting in 400 to 500 deaths Depending on which figures one uses that results in a death rate of somewhere between 1 in 6 000 and 1 in 10 000 cases A 1994 study by the Institute of Medicine now the National Academy of Medicine that reviewed pre vaccine era data in industrialized countries also found the death rate for measles to be just over 1 per 10 000 cases Marks

Anthony Fauci often claims a DNA of caring yet his actions reveal a stark contrast including pushing a vaccine in a draconian methodical and threatening manner and taking away liberty and jobs to an extreme never seen before in the history of mankind You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Dr Randall Bock Dr Anthony Fauci often claims a DNA of caring yet his actions reveal a stark contrast Avoiding direct patient care Fauci focused on populations effecting a mindset aligned with abstract compassion for humanity that nonetheless neglects individual rights His so called DNA of caring has most recently doubly stranded those subjected to it first by amplifying fear about COVID 19 while burying mitigating data and second by pushing a vaccine in a draconian methodical and threatening manner taking away liberty and jobs to an extreme never seen before in the history of mankind Additionally by fast tracking and strong arming an mRNA vaccine platform technology heretofore devoid of phase II or III safety studies Fauci prioritized hypothetical scientific advancement over actual current health medical knowledge and personal liberties effectively double crossing both the public s trust and violating his own integrity contradicting medically foundational principles he had spent his career enunciating perhaps influenced by pharmaceutical interests From public health to panic The motivations behind Fauci s pandemic pivot In early 2020 Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID initially approached the coronavirus with standard public health strategies By late February 2020 Fauci had become the deciding influencer for The New York Times Donald McNeil s decision to go up to eleven announcing To Take On the Coronavirus Go Medieval on It This article heightened panic in New York City soon to be America s pandemic landfall and marked a shift from a century of public health s more measured responses BACKWARDS to draconian measures Remember lockdowns emanate literally from 1970s prisons Several theories potentially explain this pivot One suggests Fauci s involvement with NIAID grants to the Wuhan lab pushed him to deflect accountability Another points to political motivations aiming to undermine an adversary Donald Trump by destabilizing the economy and influencing the election through lockdown necessitated mail in ballots A deeper but not necessarily mutually exclusive motive may lie in Fauci s support for mRNA vaccine technology Previously mRNA treatments had only reached phase I trials The pandemic allowed for emergency use authorization fast tracking this experimental platform and breaking regulatory barriers likely saving a decade by creating a precedent for future mRNA treatments He did this

Hopkins to inject and infect women with Zika to test the vaccine This is a man who will not let a public health emergency go to waste even if it involves aggrandizing it Despite his self assessment as

triggered by the realization of his agency NIAID s and or his own embarrassingly damaging complicity in the gain of function genesis of the Wuhan flu SARS CoV 2 coronavirus threat He aimed for self preservation politically maneuvering against Donald Trump to compromise him while also greasing the skids for the mRNA vaccine This necessitated performing life support for the emergency in the Emergency Use Authorization EUA by quashing any interim medications aggrandizing the threat of SARS CoV 2 when he knew from the Diamond Princess data that it was not that severe zero deaths 25 days after exposure and backtracking from his comments that respiratory illnesses were not best approached by vaccines that natural immunity was preferable to vaccine immunity and that flu shots needed to

on vaccination mandates was equally inconsistent In 2004 he advised against flu vaccines for those who had already contracted the flu Yet during the COVID 19 pandemic he supported mandatory vaccinations regardless of prior infection ignoring the virus evolving nature Vaccines were administered for an outdated strain akin to giving expired flu shots which are typically removed from circulation once the virus mutates significantly This inconsistency highlighted his failure to adapt his policies to the realities of the virus mutations Fauci 1 0 said You seek and learn from an

pledged 100 million to Moderna to develop an mRNA platform vaccine for Zika This investment was made despite the fact that Zika a relatively harmless dengue variant was not by that time persistently linked to the microcephaly cases it was blamed for The Zika microcephaly phenomenon just petered out even in the initial pandemic panic crisis year of 2016 This rush to develop an mRNA vaccine for a non crisis reflects a broader trend of aggrandizing potential threats to justify rapid and untested vaccine development My book Overturning Zika The Pandemic That Never Was points out the complete absence of any Zika related microcephaly increase in any year including the incipient 2015 year Once Zika tests were developed and Brazil adopted the WHO standard for statistical microcephaly determination the link between Zika and microcephaly was never substantiated and effectively disappeared Zika Microcephaly had always and only been science by press release political pressure and professorial self aggrandizement Fauci never stopped pushing for Zika vaccines long after it was clear there was no recurrence of Zika related microcephaly in Latin America In 2018 he attempted to initiate a human challenge trial in Brazil but the authorities refused not wanting to introduce the Zika virus into the population through experimentation Human challenge trials had fallen out of favor due to the negative outcomes of the Guatemala and Tuskegee experiments In 2017 the National Institutes of Health NIH ethics panel determined that Zika did not warrant human challenge trials but Fauci pushed for them regardless ignoring prevailing public health wisdom Why was he jonesing for a putative Zika vaccine Fauci was a proponent of synthetic vaccinology and mRNA platforms Conveniently

invested heavily in mRNA research through DARPA via the mysterious network JASON and BARDA By the end of the Obama era mRNA vaccines were being tested in both animals and humans but never beyond phase 1 The COVID 19 pandemic fast tracked the push for mRNA vaccines under Operation Warp Speed prioritizing them over traditional vaccines like Johnson Johnson s adenovirus vector vaccine Concerns about side effects such as myocarditis in young males were brushed aside in the rush to advance mRNA technology This urgency overshadowed the critical need for proper safety trials effectively using the public as guinea pigs in a massive premature experiment Now with the ice broken a flood of new mRNA vaccines is in the pipeline for diseases like cytomegalovirus CMV influenza and respiratory syncytial virus RSV Researchers are even exploring mRNA vaccines for avian flu hepatitis C HIV and more This rapid adoption bypasses decades of proven safety from traditional vaccine platforms raising

measures and COVID 19 vaccines This is unprecedented and raises serious concerns During the pandemic politicians and the media emphasized daily that every COVID 19 death mattered and every life deserved protection through containment measures and COVID 19 vaccines In the aftermath of the pandemic the same morale should apply This is the tragic outcome of Fauci s policies The world was promised salvation but instead we have worse economies more top down nondemocratic management halted education and disrupted lives Children couldn t see people s faces and the societal impacts have been profound We were betrayed by falsehoods Fauci s actions during the COVID 19 pandemic mirrored the very failings he claimed to have learned from the HIV AIDS crisis His inability to adapt combined with a penchant for authoritarian measures has left a legacy of distrust and division Fauci s enforcement of arbitrary measures disregard for scientific data and contribution to economic and social disruption have caused untold harm His tenure stands as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked authority Fauci s role in the COVID 19 response has shown a disregard for American values of

saying the opposite The senator drew a parallel between Dr Anthony Fauci s influence and that of former FBI Director J Edgar Hoover suggesting both accumulated excessive power during their 40 odd years in office Fauci s fiefdom grew in dollars to come to dominate all of NIH the National Institutes of Health Paul explained His budget dwarfed all the other budgets Paul also criticized the

public health initiatives and historical eugenics programs linking pandemic policies to past unethical medical experiments Among several examples he shared was the mid 1900s poisoning of children with

leveraged connections in Dr Anthony Fauci s inner circle to survive federal scrutiny and keep millions in public funding flowing without turning over key data documents obtained by U S Right to Know reveal You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Emily Kopp The Wuhan Institute of Virology s chief American collaborator leveraged connections in Dr Anthony Fauci s inner circle to survive federal scrutiny and keep millions in public funding flowing without turning over key data new records show Hundreds of documents emails obtained under Freedom of Information Act FOIA lawsuits or congressional subpoena as well as congressional interview transcripts show Fauci s institute protected EcoHealth Alliance which collaborated on novel coronavirus discovery and engineering projects with the Wuhan Institute of Virology At a congressional hearing this summer Fauci cast EcoHealth and its president Peter Daszak who are currently under proposed debarment by the federal government as minor and rogue grantees But EcoHealth was among the first grantees that Fauci s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID contacted as news of a novel coronavirus first swirled and Daszak requested supplemental funds to respond to the crisis In early February 2020 when NIAID began conducting weekly calls with a few experts about the novel coronavirus Daszak was among the invitees And at the height of pandemic confusion and controversy in the summer of 2020 EcoHealth maintained the goodwill of NIAID which awarded EcoHealth two new grants totaling 19 8 million weakening the leverage of other officials to obtain information from one of the U S government s only sources of insight into the Wuhan Institute of Virology Fauci asked how Peter is doing as he often does and he seemed to commiserate with him to a degree Fauci s senior scientific adviser David Morens wrote in an apparent reference to Daszak on Nov 18 2021 At the time officials at the National Institutes of Health s NIH central headquarters or Building One at the demand of the Trump White House had suspended EcoHealth s existing NIAID grant and sought lab notebooks and unpublished genomic data as a condition of getting its funding back This information could have shed light on the coronavirus research in Wuhan before the pandemic But aided by allies within NIAID millions continued to flow to EcoHealth and Daszak would not ask his longtime collaborators in Wuhan for information sought by the U S government until 20 months later in January 2022 two years after the pandemic began Some of the

and Fauci during the years long debates about gain of function research leading up to the pandemic one email shows After the pandemic arose Morens and another NIAID scientist named Jeffery Taubenberger wrote an editorial defending EcoHealth and referred to people concerned about gain of function research as luddites and the complaining crowd Thousands of pages of grant proposals and other documents obtained by U S Right to Know show that EcoHealth planned to use the new NIAID funding to continue research similar to the work that had brought the group under scrutiny using the very same viral samples Most of the NIAID employees who helped Daszak maintain funding amid the pandemic still retain positions of influence at NIAID The revelations come as the U S Senate considers legislation championed by Sen Rand Paul R Ky that would move regulation of the riskiest gain of function research out of the funding agency which is typically NIAID and empower an independent panel of scientists to determine when engineering new pathogens is worth the risk More than four years after the pandemic began the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS initiated debarment proceedings against EcoHealth and Daszak citing problems uncovered by government officials outside of Fauci s institute and the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic Funding to the group and its president has been suspended Daszak said he would contest the prospective debarment He has continued to lean on influential allies None of the NIAID employees named in this story replied to

congressional report NIH Director of Extramural Research Michael Lauer in the weeks following sent letters to EcoHealth in an attempt to end and investigate the grant culminating in a July 8 2020 letter that suspended all activities under the grant The letters sought information about the coronavirus work underway at the subcontracted lab Lauer asked that Daszak arrange for an outside inspection The letter asked that specific attention be paid to addressing the question of whether WIV Wuhan Institute of Virology staff had SARS CoV 2 in their possession prior to December 2019 Lauer had previously spearheaded NIH s response to the intellectual property and fraud concerns posed by China s Thousand Talents Program which Daszak noted with apparent annoyance to colleagues Daszak

to vouch for him Keusch s lab was set to be a collaborator on EcoHealth s EIDRC project grant documents show The acronym EIDRC or alternatively CREID stands for Emerging Infectious Diseases Research Center EcoHealth was being considered as one of just 11 of these multimillion dollar projects across the country Daszak had good reason to tread carefully A formally binding term of award for his new EIDRC project had not yet been issued by the time Building One came knocking According to the NIH website an NoA or notice of award is the official grant award document notifying the recipient and others that an award has been made Daszak conceded the project could just quietly disappear before any funding was guaranteed I am also very concerned that Trump could target our organization or me personally leading to our EIDRC being nixed and we don t even have an NoA on that so it could just quietly disappear Daszak said Morens noted that people within NIAID will be your advocates Morens is

the Wuhan lab including Zhengli Shi obtain approval to visit the institute s headquarters in Bethesda Maryland in June 2017 As EcoHealth s program officer he helped facilitate EcoHealth s gain of function research during a pause on most coronavirus gain of function research from 2014 2017 and did not recommend the work be evaluated by the Pandemic Potential Pathogen Committee P3CO put in place after the pause Stemmy had also not flagged that EcoHealth missed a Sept 30 2019 due date to submit its progress report describing its work in the months before the pandemic s outbreak congressional testimony shows In response to Lauer s letters the progress report was submitted on Aug 3 2021 after the pandemic had already emerged when an immense incentive existed to not disclose experiments that could bring the group under further scrutiny Jean Patterson Despite concerns about Daszak s research in the media in the White House and in NIH s Building One his goodwill within NIAID had apparently not diminished By August 2020 new NIAID funding of 7 5 million surged to EcoHealth to create an NIAID Center for Research on Emerging Infectious Diseases its most generous NIH grant to date Once the funding was formally awarded Morens asked Daszak about receiving a kickback a comment he would later describe as black humor Ahem do I get a kickback Too much fooking money DO you deserve it all Let s

NIAID We had a para inserted that means we have send copies of subcontracts to NIAID and explain our Biosafety monitoring plans Daszak wrote to Morens in October 2020 a few weeks after the award was announced I spoke with Jean Patterson who s running these CREID contacts and she had no idea what they were after Clearly it s the NIH director s office interfering Daszak also said he may alert the press of his outrage over this proviso I m going to try to deal with it quietly for now Daszak said But if they fuck me around I ll be talking with the press Just weeks later in September NIAID

working in the background and that Tony s speaking truth to power is extremely important a slight relief in a tough week Daszak wrote to Morens on May 7 2020 At a June 23 2020 congressional hearing when Fauci was asked about the grant being terminated he did not defend the decision by others within NIH to seek data from Wuhan He simply stated it was canceled because the NIH was told to cancel it in an apparent allusion to Trump Three days later House Democrats addressed a letter to HHS expressing concern about the termination of EcoHealth s grant citing press reports and Fauci s testimony to characterize the grant s jeopardy as part of a wider provocation of China by the Trump administration In early 2021 Daszak briefed NIAID and may have briefed Fauci directly another email indicates on the World Health Organization commissioned international mission to China Daszak had advanced the conclusion that a lab leak in Wuhan was extremely unlikely as the only American citizen on the team bringing him into conflict with the World Health Organization Director General Adhanom Ghebreyesus Tedros who argued the possibility had been ruled out prematurely without evidence But NIH officials outside of NIAID continued to ask EcoHealth about the Wuhan lab into the summer and fall of 2021 Daszak dragged his feet That year the issue of a possible connection between NIAID and the pandemic s origin became more salient because of a series of high profile Senate hearings in which Paul questioned Fauci about it Morens apparently ferried information from Daszak to Fauci about efforts in

should respond to Building One after speaking with Fauci He did so through their colleague Keusch as he had been advised by Fauci not to speak to Daszak directly Daszak was advised to contact Stemmy

well informed acknowledges the communications you mention and is on board because he will certainly be questioned the email reads He also suggested that you discuss with him that when you were aware that it was necessary to file the 5 year report the system shut you out and you presumed that was normal process as you were then into grant year 1 In other words Fauci s aide Morens after speaking with Fauci advised Daszak to confer with Stemmy on his explanation for the late progress report Daszak has said that there was a technical glitch so EcoHealth decided to forgo the final year s report

of the same It was obvious to Fauci s inner circle at NIAID that the new CREID grant mirrored EcoHealth s prior work just the sort of research that had alarmed the public and the White House in the

which was attempting to obtain information from EcoHealth and NIAID which was helping Daszak Daszak worked connections in the scientific community to turn up the heat on Collins Across many emails Daszak and his allies expressed resentment against NIH s Building One especially Collins and Lauer Good that he s going Daszak wrote in response to the news that Collins would be stepping down as NIH director in 2022 But he s left our organization as a daily target for conspiracies with death threats media attacks and legal actions against us All this began when he decided not to stand up to political interference in NIH funding under Trump Daszak appears to have expressed no such resentment against Fauci to whom he had a line through Morens Daszak put pressure on Collins to restore his prior NIAID funding in late August around the same time the separate 7 5 million grant had been formally secured An Aug 19 2020 Wall Street Journal story quoted Harold Varmus the former NIH director whom Keusch told Daszak he would contact about his grant denouncing the grant s suspension After the story published Collins wrote to Varmus linking to an article describing NIH s pressure on EcoHealth Alliance to provide records about the Wuhan Institute of Virology and another link to an article calling attention to RaTG13 and the Moijang mine This EcoHealth grant and its connection to

turn on NIH and what it has done and what that is unleashing he wrote Pushing on this as I can the reporter replied In a similar vein Daszak persuaded a BuzzFeed reporter to submit a FOIA request for Lauer s records to investigate Building One The resulting story faulted an activist group for having tapped into partisan politics to make big problems for Fauci over the EcoHealth grant beginning in April 2020 when Fauci had first become privately concerned about NIAID connections to Wuhan two months prior Other stories in the mainstream press also portrayed the termination of the grant as strictly political and scientifically unsound Despite Daszak s ire Collins was publicly dismissive of the idea that the pandemic could have resulted from EcoHealth s research in Wuhan Under Collins s direction NIH apparently did not respond in detail to congressional questions about its efforts to obtain more information from EcoHealth When congressional Democrats asked for details about EcoHealth

the Wuhan Institute of Virology or lab notebooks He only asked them for them once Daszak sent the email to his longtime collaborators in January 2022 20 months after Lauer first questioned EcoHealth

Institutes of Health NIH Science reported that Taubenberger s first day as acting director was April 25 Taubenberger will head an institute with a 6 56 billion budget making it the second largest NIH branch overseen by the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS Several researchers told Science that Taubenberger has a commendable track record highlighting his work sequencing the Spanish

both in pathogenesis animal models human data and vaccines But critics point to Taubenberger s public support of gain of function research and the zoonotic theory of COVID 19 s origins which holds that the virus crossed over naturally from animals to humans They also criticized his past ties to Fauci and other controversial virologists and his prior work on COVID 19 vaccines Gain of function research which increases the transmissibility or virulence of viruses is often used in vaccine development Such research was conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China prompting fears that the virus was developed at the lab and subsequently leaked Concerns over the safety of gain of function research previously led the U S government to implement a moratorium on such projects between

to match disease burden on the cause and cover up of COVID on reckless gain of function research and pathogen resurrection research and on biosafety biosecurity and biorisk management all appear to be diametrically opposed to those of HHS Secretary Kennedy As such Taubenberger s appointment as acting director of NIAID is baffling In a 2014 interview with the journal EMBO Reports Taubenberger downplayed the risks of gain of function research claiming it s what virologists have done for a hundred years In a 2013 letter to the journal mBio Taubenberger suggested that gain of function research replicates natural processes He argued that Influenza A viruses continually undergo dual use experiments as a matter of evolution and selection According to the American Society for Microbiology dual use research is a type of gain of function research that raises important biosafety and or biosecurity concerns It requires a higher level of review and is subject to strict protocols Jablonowski said Taubenberger s dismissal of concerns over the safety of gain of function research overlooks its inherent risks The problem with the argument is actually a problem with the policy it argues it assumes an ill willed actor intent on deliberate misuse as the risk Recent history has taught us that lab leaks pose a real and serious risk no ill willed actor needed Advocates of gain of function research do not include a realistic assessment of pathogen escape as part of a risk benefit balance Jablonowski said While Taubenberger has been lauded for his role in sequencing the 1918 Spanish flu virus some scientists were critical of this work with Ebright calling the reconstruction of the 1918 virus reckless Taubenberger exhumed victims of the 1918 Spanish flu from the

According to the Journal Bannan who holds a doctorate in microbiology had spent more than a year investigating the origins of COVID 19 In August 2021 he was ready to brief the White House regarding evidence of a lab leak but was never summoned Speaking to The Hill s Rising on Dec 31 2024 the Journal s Gordon said the most significant aspect of the report was that it was the first time that a figure who is involved in this intelligence investigation has spoken on the record about what happened It s striking that the people who were the foremost proponents of the lab leak theory weren t invited by the White House to the actual briefing where these theories were hashed out Gordon said Bannan now retired and employed as a consultant told the Journal What ended up on the intelligence

do so Dr Meryl Nass a biological warfare epidemiologist and founder of Door to Freedom told The Defender the Journal report showed there was a plan to control the narrative Similar to how Fauci and Farrar controlled the scientific narrative people controlled the intelligence agency narrative Nass said referring to Dr Anthony Fauci and to Jeremy Farrar Ph D then head of the Wellcome Trust and now chief scientist for the World Health Organization WHO A decision was made early in the Biden administration to protect Fauci and former National Institutes of Health NIH Director Francis Collins from

report dismayed but did not surprise him The manifest problems with the 2021 intelligence agency analysis and summary reports had been reported previously Ebright said The WSJ article was the first to cover these problems in a major media outlet and as such brought these problems to the attention of a new and broad audience Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Mixture of motives may have led to suppression of lab leak evidence In May 2021 Biden ordered an urgent assessment by the U S intelligence agencies and national laboratories on COVID 19 s origins to be completed within 90 days Earlier that year two publications appeared in key peer reviewed journals promoting the zoonotic theory The White House and mainstream media used those reports to label backers of the lab leak theory as conspiracy theorists One publication a statement by Farrar and Peter Daszak Ph D was published in The Lancet in March 2020 The other which became known as the Proximal Origin paper

Nature Medicine It was later revealed Fauci and Farrar played key roles in the publication of Proximal Origin In early 2021 a team of WHO experts visited China and subsequently drafted a joint report with Chinese scientists that the virus most likely had a zoonotic origin When Biden ordered the review two intelligence agencies supported the zoonotic theory One was the CIA albeit with low confidence According to the Journal the August 2021 White House briefing reflected this dominant view It s certainly surprising that the FBI given its scientific expertise was excluded from a leading role in Avril Haynes s intelligence review of COVID s origins Wade said According to the Journal Adrienne Keen Ph D played a key role in promoting the zoonotic narrative Keen who previously served as a consultant to the WHO worked with the U S Department of State when the intelligence report was drafted She later became director of Global Health Security for the National Intelligence Council before joining the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Keen advised the White House that the WHO report that determined a zoonotic origin for COVID 19 shouldn t be completely discounted the Journal reported A spokeswoman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told the Journal the agency complied with the Intelligence Community s analytic standards including objectivity in setting up the August 2021 briefing A spokesman for Haines said the FBI s assessment was accurately presented at the briefing But according to Wade there are several likely reasons proponents of the lab leak theory were excluded There was probably a mixture of motives from a fear that this episode could derail the larger relationship with the Chinese government to the possible desire of intelligence agencies and the NIH to cover up a scheme for gaining insight into Chinese biological warfare research Wade said This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The Defender is 100

intelligence investigation into COVID 19 s origins has slackened Gordon told Rising that the intelligence community s effort doesn t have the energy and staff resources behind it that it once did In 2023 the U S Department of Energy DOE joined the FBI in concluding that COVID 19 originated from a lab leak Both agencies have strong scientific competence perhaps greater than that at other agencies and being closer to the evidence were more persuaded by it Wade said According to Ebright The FBI and the DOE were the only two of the 18 U S agencies assigned to assess the origin of COVID 19 that had the in house scientific experts in molecular biology and microbiology able to assess the data and that lacked conflicts of interest from having parent agencies that had funded EcoHealth Alliance and its collaborators The other 16 agencies lacked the competence the independence or both to address the matter In June 2023 a report Haines office released to Congress acknowledged that some of the Wuhan Institute of Virology s scientists have genetically engineered coronaviruses using common laboratory practices However the report also claimed the U S Intelligence Community had no evidence this research led to the pandemic Thacker said he hopes the new administration will declassify all this information so that the public can understand what caused the worst pandemic in modern history An unbiased intelligence review would be a good step Wade suggested The reckless unregulated research that caused the COVID 19 pandemic killing 20 million and costing 25 trillion urgently needs to be stopped Ebright said Ebright called for a moratorium on gain of function research He also called for executive orders requiring intelligence agencies to comply with the COVID 19 Origin Act of 2023 and all government agencies that funded EcoHealth Alliance to release unredacted documents related to the research they funded Clearly virologists have proved themselves too irresponsible and self interested to be allowed to control gain of function research We need some mechanism for independent oversight of this research if it is to proceed at all Wade said", "chunk_id":

smartphones exceeded the agency s safety limits for human exposure to wireless radiation when held close to the body according to data obtained by the Environmental Health Trust EHT via Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests Rather than going public with the testing results the FCC hid them even when important lawsuits concerning cellphone radiation s impact on people s health were underway The outcome of such lawsuits might have been different had the agency been honest about what it knew said W Scott McCollough lead litigator for Children s Health Defense s CHD Electromagnetic Radiation EMR Wireless cases McCollough called the FCC s actions scandalous Miriam Eckenfels Garcia director of CHD s EMR program told The Defender While we are not surprised that the FCC is hiding information and prioritizing the protection of big industry over people s health seeing the FCC s actions play out in this way reminds us why the work we are doing in this program is hugely important and why CHD is proud to be on the forefront of holding the FCC and telecom industry accountable through our litigation education and advocacy Eckenfels Garcia and McCollough commended the nonprofit scientific research and education group EHT for getting the information out to the public EHT deserves great credit for digging this out McCollough told The Defender and exposing the FCC s extraordinary efforts to protect the industry it is supposed to regulate rather than protecting the people whose health it should be safeguarding by concealing information people need to know Five phones surpassed FCC radiation limit According to EHT the FCC undertook the 2 millimeter mm testing on Aug 30 through Sept 23 2019 after an Aug 21 2019 Chicago Tribune investigation reported that some cellphones exceeded the FCC s wireless radiation limits when tested 2 mm from the body The FCC typically uses a separation distance of roughly 10mm or potentially more for premarketing cellphone testing The Chicago Tribune chose 2mm to mimic the real world experience of those who carry their cellphone in a tight pants pocket or against their skin EHT said The FCC didn t release its 2 mm testing results until Sept 29 2023 in response to EHT s FOIA requests seeking documents related to cellphone radiation tests performed by the FCC from January 2017 through April 2020 The FCC s testing

results because releasing them would have supported the Chicago Tribune s investigation results The FCC was intent on hiding this information because they knew how bad it would reflect on the commission and the industry it serves The FCC has abandoned its primary mission and is now just a servant to telecom industry masters conspiring against the public s interest McCollough added According to McCollough the Chicago Tribune s investigation led to some lawsuits most famously Cohen v Apple The plaintiffs in that lawsuit alleged that Apple failed to warn iPhone users that they would receive excessive radiation if they placed the phone close to their body McCollough said the case s dismissal in 2020 relied on the fact that the FCC claimed to have tested Apple phones and found them compliant with FCC exposure regulations The separation distance was addressed there too but one has to believe that if the court there had known about the other results now exposed by EHT it may have made a different decision in that case he said Additionally McCollough said Had we known this when CHD and EHT were challenging the FCC s exposure limits before the D C Circuit referring to CHD and EHT s historic win in 2021 that challenged the FCC s safety limits it would have turned out even worse for the FCC The U S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that

results that court might have done more than just send the case back without any deadline for compliance with the mandate McCollough said Joe Sandri a lawyer for EHT pointed to another set of lawsuits still ongoing that might be affected by the testing results The roughly 80 plaintiffs in the consolidated set of cases Motorola Inc v Murray allege injuries and fatalities mostly but not exclusively through brain cancer may have been caused by the wireless radiation emitted by their cellphones The industry has been working hard to keep out evidence and this has impeded those lawsuits progress Sandri told The Defender Phones should be tested the way they are used When the FCC finally released the results to EHT the agency noted it was doing so with the caveat that the 2 mm separation distance test results are inconsistent with FCC practice and are misleading because they reflect extreme conditions Theodora Scarato EHT s vice president for policy and education who filed the FOIA requests pointed out that using a 2 mm separation distance isn t misleading or extreme It is outrageous that the U S allows phones to be tested with whatever separation distance the companies want Phones should be tested the way they are used she said in a press release Children and adults use and carry phones pressed to their body for hours every day It is time for a new approach to cell phone testing one that reflects the way people use phones today Scarato said Scarato also recommended the U S adopt a strong oversight and compliance program including post market RF emission and health

According to the Federal Communications Commission a new voluntary cybersecurity labeling program for smart devices will incentivize companies to sell products that meet high cybersecurity standards

new voluntary cybersecurity labeling program for smart Internet of Things IoT products According to the FCC the program will incentivize companies to sell products that meet high cybersecurity standards while helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions But according to Odette Wilkens a technology attorney the program may give consumers a false sense of cybersecurity That s because according to Wilkens the cybersecurity danger may not lurk within the products but within the signal being used by the wireless services that may be hacked Under the FCC program wireless IoT products such as home security cameras voice activated shopping devices fitness trackers and baby monitors will bear a U S Cyber Trust Mark logo on their packaging if they meet the FCC s robust cybersecurity standards The logo will be accompanied by a QR code that consumers can scan for the product s security details such as the support period for the product and whether the product carries automatic security updates Wilkens who also is president and general counsel for the nonprofit Wired Broadband Inc which advocates for hard wired high speed internet said the FCC shouldn t just put a cybersecurity label on products it should also label the wireless services Otherwise Wilkens added the consumer will be deceived into thinking that a cybersecurity label on the product means that the wireless services activated through those products carrying their personal data are also safe when they may not be This is especially true as the rollout of 5G is underway Wilkens said She pointed to a 2022 report co authored by former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler who coined the term the 5G Cyber Paradox meaning the more efficient 5G is the less secure it is 5G is more hackable given the thousands of

data privacy and cybersecurity matter expert who asked to remain anonymous told The Defender something similar The expert who has worked as a consultant to Fortune 500 companies over the last two decades and served on the data privacy work group for the U S Department of Commerce s National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST said it s a no brainer that the FCC needed to establish basic cybersecurity standards for products But the program doesn t address the crucial matters of data privacy and individuals being exploited through risky IoT devices that have promiscuous data sharing practices the expert said While the FCC was clearly aware that consumers are concerned about both its new program fails to include privacy safeguards he said So your smart speaker is still listening to you your smart lights know you are coming and going Security and privacy are not the same thing he said In a jail for example you ve got security but not privacy The bars allow everyone to surveil you Consumers will still be subject to surveillance when they use IoT devices For the basis of its labeling program the FCC adopted 10 of NIST s cybersecurity criteria In its 126 page report on the labeling program the FCC detailed the 10 criteria it will use to assess whether or not a product gets to bear its cybersecurity logo 1 Asset Identification The product can be uniquely identified by the customer and other authorized entities and the product uniquely identifies each IoT product component and maintains an up to date inventory of connected product components 2 Product Configuration The configuration of the IoT product is changeable with an ability to restore a secure default setting and changes can only be performed by authorized individuals services and other IoT product components 3 Data Protection The IoT product protects data store across all IoT product components and transmitted both between IoT product components and outside the IoT product from unauthorized

Sign Up A recent landmark court ruling in a case brought by Children s Health Defense CHD against the Federal Communications Commission FCC should concern anyone who uses wireless technology cell phones iWatches and Wi Fi especially parents of children who use these devices On Aug 13 the U S Court of Appeals for the D C Circuit ruled the FCC s 2019 decision that its 1996 guidelines adequately protect the public from non cancer harms from 5G and wireless based technologies was capricious arbitrary and not evidence based In 2019 after an alleged six year review of the science on the potential harms of 5G and wireless technology the FCC concluded the evidence showed no harm and therefore its 1996 guidelines are sufficient to protect the public and no review of the guidelines was warranted In the U S as long as a wireless based technology complies with FCC guidelines it is considered safe and no lawsuit can be filed for injuries However CHD s case revealed that while the FCC has been pushing 5G and forcing Wi Fi based technologies on our children the safety assurances made by the FCC and the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA are not supported by evidence As the court s ruling indicates the contrary is true The court ruled the FCC failed to engage at the level of reasoned decision making required from a federal agency Furthermore the commission failed to provide an analysis of the evidence showing how it reached its decision The FCC s determination that its health guidelines related to non cancer harms were adequate was based on a statement from the FDA and a link to the FDA webpage from 2017 The court ruled that the FDA s conclusions also were not supported by careful scientific analysis as required from a federal agency During a press conference Aug 16 announcing CHD s victory CHD Chairman Robert F Kennedy Jr said Those agencies no longer have any interest in protecting public health They have become sock puppets for the industry that they are

ruling that silence is not consent Following a report by the Government Accountability Office suggesting the FCC should review its 1996 guidelines in 2013 the FCC opened a Notice of Inquiry requesting comments from the public on whether the commission should initiate a rulemaking to modify the guidelines In December 2019 the FCC published its decision called order that the guidelines were sufficiently protective of public health and required no review Consequently in February 2020 CHD filed the lawsuit called Petitioner for Review challenging the decision A similar case was filed by the Environmental Health Trust The cases were consolidated in the D C Circuit and the organizations filed joint briefs More than 1 000 comments and extensive evidence of harm from radiation at levels well below the guidelines were filed with the FCC by scientists medical organizations municipalities and individuals who have developed sickness from this technology The court explained that when reaching a determination a federal agency must consider the evidence filed by the public and address important evidence especially when it contradicts the premise behind the agency s determination as it did in this case The petitioners filed 11 000 pages of evidence showing the extent of evidence the FCC ignored The court ruled the FCC failed to meaningfully respond to the evidence filed with the agency and that this failure also renders the FCC decision arbitrary capricious and not evidence based Referring to the petitioner s brief the court referenced evidence of numerous harms from wireless technology including radiation sickness electro sensitivity neurological effects oxidative stress a causal mechanism of harm effects on sperm and effects of prenatal exposure and blood brain barrie r damage all of which the FCC ignored The court emphasized the FCC s failure to respond to evidence of the effects on children especially in regard to testing procedures for cell phones The court stated

health including eyesight and mental well being under the bus Burke said Last October the FCC announced it would allow money from its E Rate program to fund the installation of Wi Fi on school buses starting in fiscal year 2024 The E Rate program is funded through taxes on consumers phone bills according to the U S Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation The program is designed to make telecommunications and information services more affordable for schools and libraries But the FCC argued that expanding it to include internet services on school buses was warranted to ensure that the millions of students caught in the Homework Gap can more fully engage in their learning FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said the program s expansion would especially help kids who live in rural areas where broadband connections are sparse and who ride long distances on the bus Soon after the FCC s announcement parents Maurine and Matthew Molak challenged the FCC s initiative in court The Molaks whose 16 year old son died as a result of cyberbullying are co founders of David s Legacy Foundation a nonprofit working to stop cyberbullying of children and teens through education legislation and legal action On Dec 20 2023 they filed a petition for review before the U S Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit arguing the FCC s ruling to allow E Rate funding for school bus Wi Fi

on the issues and assist the court in reaching the correct decision Addictive and distracting social media apps are wreaking havoc on our kids Cruz said in an April 11 statement The FCC s decision to fund children s unsupervised access to social media on bus rides to and from school is both dangerous and unlawful Joining Cruz in filing the amicus brief were Sens Marsha Blackburn R Tenn Mike Braun R Ind Ted Budd R N C James Lankford R Okla Cynthia Lummis R Wyo and Pete Ricketts R Neb The senators claimed the FCC s move to expand E Rate funding to cover Wi Fi on school buses is illegal because federal law confines the use of such funding to classrooms and libraries According to a press release by expanding E Rate subsidies to school buses the agency is attempting to extend a separate temporary COVID era program the Emergency Connectivity Fund which the FCC cannot do without specific congressional direction The Emergency Connectivity Fund previously helped schools obtain wireless internet infrastructure to support remote during the COVID 19 pandemic Ostensibly schools were able to use the funds to get Wi Fi on school buses The amicus brief stated Whether the FCC should fund

Commission FCC over its complete dismissal of evidence of serious health impacts from wireless technology devices and infrastructure such as cell phones and cell towers The cases have been brought after the FCC completely dismissed all evidence presented to it during a six year public inquiry which the FCC opened itself The FCC which is an independent agency of the U S government that regulates communications by radio television wire satellite and cable across the United States opened the inquiry in 2013 asking the public to submit comments to the inquiry s docket as to whether or not the FCC should review its 1996 Radio Frequency RF radiation guidelines The inquiry was closed in December 2019 During that time tremendous amounts of scientific and human evidence of physical harm caused by radiation emitted from wireless technology such as Wi Fi and cell towers was submitted to the FCC in 1 700 filings The filings contain peer reviewed studies that show radiofrequency radiation contributes to cell damage DNA damage infertility carcinogenicity cognitive deficits and cardiovascular disruption among a wide array of negative health effects Pleas to reconsider radiation limits came from scientists and science organizations such as the BioInitiative and EMF Scientist from doctors and medical organizations and from hundreds of individuals including parents of children injured by wireless technology The scientific studies and testimony of the physical harm caused by RF radiation were requested by the FCC for the purposes of reassessing their radiofrequency exposure limits and policies after Congress s Government Accountability Office recommended such a commission But the FCC summarily dismissed the evidence without explanation The FCC declared that the vast majority of filings were unscientific and even the filings that sought to present scientific evidence failed to make a persuasive case for revisiting our existing RF limits the FCC stated in a resolution to close their inquiry The FCC also cited sister agencies such as the FDA stating No evidence has moved our sister health and safety agencies to issue substantive policy recommendations for strengthening RF

the FDA s input How was it reasonable for the FCC to rely so heavily on a response from the FDA that did not address the very things you asked for information on devices other than cell phones the use of multiple devices and physical harms other than cancer Millet asked The FCC attorney admitted You re right that their statements spoke specifically about cell phones The FCC attorney also admitted that even after the FCC made very clear that they rely upon other agencies with expertise in this area they were met with silence We formally solicited the views of other agencies with expertise in this area we made very clear that we wanted to rely on them We relied on the views of expert agencies in adopting these limits in the first place the FCC attorney told the judges When asked by Judge Millet if the FCC relied on agencies besides the FDA the FCC attorney said We formally seek the input of all expert bodies in this area and we left the docket open for seven years giving ample opportunity to weigh in and not one of these bodies said you need to change your standards And we re not arguing that silence should be construed as endorsement but it shouldn t be construed as disapproval of the agency s existing limits Is the regulation of the FCC fit for purpose Reflecting on this silence of the expert agencies during the case press conference McCullough suggested that the regulation system was no longer fit for purpose Over all of this time it has become obvious that agencies that are charged with regulating entities almost inevitably become captured by them he said They are inculcated in how the industry works and they begin to develop some kind of Stockholm Syndrome by these agencies that they have to deal with Quite frankly that s all they see most of the

people and who set the example for their underlings And gradually the entire agency becomes subsumed in the process Kennedy continued The judges in this country and really everywhere will not give us victories in a vacuum We have to lay the public groundwork We have to show the judge that the public is out there and they want reform That there are people like you who have been injured We need to come in with those stories those very powerful parables about how democracy is failing it s being held up to ridicule and people are being harmed in terrible ways And we need a grassroots movement to

Drug Administration FDA is preparing to issue new guidance for vaccine manufacturers in the coming days as part of a new radical framework The guidance will likely focus on the COVID 19 shots The Washington Post reported Thursday citing comments by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary earlier this week The Post published its story earlier Thursday before The Wall Street Journal reported that unnamed sources at the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS said HHS is expected to announce within days that it will no longer recommend COVID 19 shots for children teens and pregnant women Speaking at the Food Drug Law Institute s conference in Washington Makary gave few specifics about the upcoming new framework but said it will help ensure the pharmaceutical industry understands exactly what we re thinking Endpoints News reported According to the Post this may entail guidance to companies so that they know the agency s approach to vaccine approvals We want to be very transparent and we want to create a framework for vaccine makers that they can use so they have a predictable FDA where they don t have to worry How is this going to be received Makary said at the conference The announcement comes just a month before government regulators are set to review COVID 19 vaccines for the next cold and flu season James Lyon Weiler Ph D president and CEO of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge and editor in chief of the journal Science Public Health Policy the Law said the new framework is long overdue and may represent an inflection point if it goes beyond mere optics and addresses the core systemic failures that have plagued vaccine policy for decades Lyons Weiler said For decades vaccine licensure has operated on a foundation riddled with shortcuts What we need now is a true break from the past a regulatory framework grounded in the principles of precision public health stratified risk and individualized safety Makary said Dr Vinay Prasad the new director of the FDA s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research CBER which oversees the approval and regulation of vaccines gene therapies and other biologic drugs will oversee the

According to the Post the FDA s announcement comes amid uncertainty that the first Trump administration introduced into the annual process for green lighting updated coronavirus shots traditionally offered in the fall Speaking at the conference Makary questioned the continued approval of COVID 19 vaccines based on years old clinical trial data Should we be making recommendations based on a randomized trial that s three or four years old with the new variant and a delta in population immunity Makary asked reporters So a lot of those original randomized trials were done at a time when there was very low population immunity Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist at Children s Health Defense said a new randomized trial on the COVID 19 vaccines would be a death blow to their EUA status referring to the emergency use authorization EUA under which they were released and through which they continue to enjoy a federal liability shield Jablonowski cited a presentation delivered during the October 2024 meeting of the CDC s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP which stated that the long term efficacy of the COVID 19 vaccines was statistically negative for adults 18 64 years old Linda Simoni Wastila Ph D a professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy said a re examination of the COVID 19 shots may also include reassessment of whether use of mRNA and other platforms constitute gene therapeutics as opposed to vaccine therapeutics Products developed using mRNA as a platform are different than vaccines developed using traditional non mRNA platforms and thus should have different guidance and thresholds for market approval Simoni Wastila said Simoni Wastila also called for the elimination of vaccine manufacturers liability shield

treated and should include better safety surveillance Is there a safety signal we didn t see in the trial and is there a benefit that we didn t see in the trial Makary asked We should also be looking at post approval monitoring about what s actually going on Witczak said she expects the framework to emphasize transparency independent data review and a slowing of the accelerated approval pathways especially EUA mechanisms that bypass traditional safety guardrails She said this could signal a shift away from the warp speed mentality and toward restoring public confidence Lyons Weiler suggested the framework include mandatory long term follow up of vaccine related adverse events a requirement for placebo controlled clinical trials and pre vaccination risk screening establishing regulatory independence revisiting existing vaccine recommendations and establishing data transparency Earlier this month Makary announced the development of a new real time surveillance system to capture data on vaccine injuries At the conference Makary said this database will help support the new vaccine framework Νow with big data we are assembling some of the biggest electronic health record databases and we will be able to query those databases in real time as soon as we approve a drug Makary said Big Pharma has been jittery about the new administration s vaccine approval process plans Biopharma stocks dropped when Prasad was named director of CBER earlier this month and when his predecessor Peter Marks M D Ph D widely viewed as being industry friendly resigned in March According to Endpoints News Makary responded to these concerns saying we do want to get decisions to sponsors quickly and suggesting that the approval process could be made more efficient Prasad had previously criticized public health agencies and Marks for what he described as a lax approval process for vaccines In a post on X in March Prasad said Marks could be replaced with a bobblehead doll that just stamps

have to be tested against a placebo before they can be approved in what the department described as a radical departure from past practices Also last month HHS suggested the COVID 19 vaccines could be removed from the childhood immunization schedule a proposal that was then made at the April meeting of ACIP despite pushback by some of the committee s members According to the Post ACIP will vote on recommendations for fall COVID 19 vaccines at its June 25 meeting The FDA recently asked Novavax which sought full approval of its COVID 19 vaccine to commit to performing a new clinical trial after its vaccine gets approved According to The Associated Press the FDA s increased scrutiny of the Novavax COVID 19 vaccine is sowing uncertainty about updates to other vaccines too Earlier this month HHS and the National Institutes of Health NIH announced that the Trump administration will invest 500 million into research on vaccines that protect against multiple strains of pandemic prone viruses as part of a program that will be known as Generation Gold Standard Simoni Wastila suggested that possible interactions between vaccinations frequently administered together such as those on the childhood schedule warrant more research and should be included in the new framework At present there is no agency that is equipped and required to do such analyses she said The FDA could contribute to this vital need by requiring new applications to conduct at the least post marketing analyses Witczak said public trust in government health agencies has been broken and that the new framework can help restore it If we want to restore faith in the system we must be willing to look at the process with clear eyes and the courage to make meaningful changes After all these are products being

hundreds of drugs over the last several decades with little to no evidence that they work according to a new investigation by The Lever Many of the drugs are permitted to stay on the market despite ample evidence that they don t work and that they cause serious and irreparable harm The Lever s two year investigation into the FDA approved drugs analyzed government reports internal FDA documents investigators notes congressional testimony court records and more than 100 interviews with researchers federal officials and patients The investigation found that from 2013 through 2022 73 of drugs approved by the FDA didn t meet the agency s four foundational standards required to show the drugs work as expected Fifty five of the approved drugs met only one of those four standards and 39 met none of them More than half of drug approvals were based on preliminary data which meant the pharmaceutical companies didn t submit evidence that patients had fewer symptoms showed improvement or had their lives extended The approval rate of such drugs has accelerated over the last decade according to the U S Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General Cancer treatments in particular raised serious red flags Only 2 4 of the 123 cancer drugs met all of the criteria and 29 met none The FDA approved 81 of cancer drugs based on preliminary data The report did not evaluate any vaccines The Lever wrote These statistics come after billions of dollars and years of lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry and patient advocacy groups pressuring Congress to loosen the FDA s scientific standards The resulting seismic shift from proving drugs work before they are approved to showing they work only after approval if ever has been quietly accomplished with virtually no

during the AIDS epidemic led to lowered standards The FDA regulates 3 9 trillion worth of products each year including drugs food supplements tobacco and medical devices according to The Lever Until the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s the agency had stricter regulatory procedures However demands by activists seeking faster access to new drugs in the context of the AIDS crisis with the support of the pharmaceutical industry resulted in the loosening of requirements for some drugs For example requirements that pharmaceutical companies submit more than one randomized controlled clinical trial showing that a drug is effective meant that researching drugs took time the entire approval process could take up to 12 years In 1992 the FDA created the accelerated pathway allowing companies to submit only preliminary data showing AIDS drug effectiveness Companies were expected to submit further evidence of effectiveness after the drugs were on the market The new rules also allowed companies to win approval without showing clinical outcomes evidence that a drug positively affected a patient s life Instead they could test for surrogate outcomes considered reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit For example instead of a medication for strokes showing that it stops strokes it can show a surrogate endpoint such as controlling blood pressure The AIDS drug AZT won approval on that basis it increased the number of T cells needed to fight viruses but had no effect on AIDS and instead proved extremely toxic to those who took it GSK the original manufacturer of AZT reaped 2 billion in profits In 1992 Congress formalized the reduced standards in the Prescription Drug User Fee Act which explicitly directed the FDA to allow approvals based on lower standards Pharmaceutical contributions to political campaigns shot up before the bill passed from 1 9 million in 1990 to 3 6 million in 1992 FDA approves drugs based on flimsy contradictory and inadequate evidence The Lever identified four key criteria drugmakers should meet according to FDA standards to assess whether drugs are safe and effective They are Control group Patients taking the drug were compared to a control group that was given a placebo or a comparator drug Patients taking the drug were compared to a control group that was given a placebo or a comparator drug Replication At least two well controlled

know which patients are on the drug and which are in the control group Clinical endpoint The studies measured the drug s effect on patients survival or function rather than a surrogate measure The authors note that these criteria don t guarantee sound scientific evidence but make up the minimum criteria to determine whether the drugmakers have provided substantial evidence to support their claims Only 28 of drugs approved over the 10 years studied met the four criteria Twenty nine percent met three criteria and more than 9 didn t meet any of them That doesn t mean these drugs don t work but it does mean the FDA approved them without knowing whether they are more likely to help patients than hurt them the authors wrote More than a quarter of the drugs were for cancer and one in four of those drugs didn t meet any of the criteria That s because companies commonly get cancer drugs approved based on surrogate outcomes like tumor shrinkage rather than on clinical outcomes such as reduced mortality or decreased symptoms Experts say the FDA should have no illusions regarding the unreliability of such surrogate outcomes especially since these outcomes fail to take into account the harms a drug may cause such as liver failure and anemia the authors wrote A notable example includes the agency s accelerated approval in 2008 of the drug Avastin to treat metastatic breast cancer Made by Genentech and marketed by Roche Avastin netted 6 8 billion by 2010 Eventually five clinical trials failed to show any clinical improvements for patients on the drug Instead they showed the drug caused blood clots perforated intestines stroke heart problems and kidney malfunction The FDA eventually withdrew its approval of the drug in November 2011 but in the process the agency and patients were attacked and harassed by the drugmakers The FDA has since been reluctant to withdraw approval for drugs according to The Lever Drugmakers that get drugs approved today on the accelerated

investigation does not include vaccines Children s Health Defense Senior Research Scientist Karl Jablonowski said vaccine trials have similar variability in meeting the criteria laid out in The Lever investigation He added that even clinical trials that might claim to meet the criteria often do so in name only For example testing against placebos that are other vaccines or that include the adjuvant contained in the vaccine doesn t provide true safety data He said A placebo specifically does not have a medical effect except in vaccine research where the placebo may constitute all the excipients components added as preservatives or to increase effectiveness less the antigen The excipients contain the chemicals or adjuvants that agitate the immune system and get it to pay attention to the antigen The more alarming the adjuvant is to the immune system the more likely it is to create durable immunity to the co administered antigen But adjuvants are really nasty chemicals and are by no means a healthy baseline Jablonowski also said clinical trials aren t always blinded even if they claim to be For example the Pfizer BioNTech study of the COVID 19 vaccine shows that the number of patients who withdrew from the study was 45 greater in the placebo group than in the vaccinated group Statistically there is a 0 02 chance that the study was actually blinded or 99 98 chance it was unblinded Jablonowski said Many vaccines test for antibodies rather than for protection against disease The more uncommon a disease is the larger a trial must be to capture statistical significance

food Hanson said that the USDA and FDA had some discussions about what oversight might look like for such products but they haven t made any rules The USDA had more public comments on what to call lab grown meats than on how they should be regulated Lab grown meat production relies on methods borrowed from Big Pharma The process for replicating cultured cells uses techniques borrowed from Big Pharma which relies on cultured cells to test drugs Wildtype s fish is made from the cultured cells of a living coho salmon and cultivated in steel vats or cultivators where the fish are fed a proprietary cell nutrient blend according to the pre market safety consultation summary the company submitted to the FDA The salmon itself is also made from water and other undisclosed ingredients The cells are harvested and then put onto plant based scaffolds that help to replicate the look and texture of salmon They are rinsed processed and packaged Wildtype describes the cultivators as similar

in vaccines FDA allows both human fetal cells and adult human tumor cells in vaccines Both types have cancer risks While both Pfizer and Moderna tested their mRNA vaccine using fetal cells there are no fetal cells cell debris or DNA in their final products However according to company documents Johnson and Johnson Janssen and Altimmune s COVID vaccines are manufactured in the human fetal cell line PER C6 and thus the final vaccine products will contain cellular debris and DNA fragments from these cells Researchers harvested these cell lines from the eyeball of an 18 week old human fetus

thus the final vaccine products will contain cellular debris and DNA fragments from the fetal HEK 293 cell line Scientists harvested this cell line from the kidney of a female Dutch fetus legally aborted in 1973 and then immortalized the cells by rendering them cancerous Normal primary cells which are unable to replicate indefinitely ultimately die Immortalized cell lines are derived from known malignant cancer cells such as those obtained from Henrietta Lacks HeLa or created in the laboratory by introducing viral oncogenes or chemical exposures capable of mutating normal primary cells into immortal tumor cells According to FDA s The Pink Sheet dated Nov 29 1999 for two decades the agency has been acutely aware of the inherent risks of using immortalized cell lines for vaccine development The FDA CBER Director Dr Peter Patriarca M D explained that continuous cell lines are used for their ability to self propagate making them an ideal substrate on which to grow viruses the

as enablers or perhaps worse still they are complicit in questionable or ethically unsound activity as a result of being driven by self serving motives A 1992 law that allows drugmakers to buy fast track approvals for new products from FDA has poured concrete on a regulatory dynamic already corrupted by all the ubiquitous mechanisms of agency capture Between 2000 and 2010 pharmaceutical companies paid the FDA 3 4 billion to gain rapid drug approvals Today Pharma companies underwrite three quarters of FDA s budget for scientific reviews ProPublica and fund nearly 50 of the FDA s total annual budget through PDUFA fees In exchange the agency increasingly fast tracks expensive drugs and vaccines with significant side effects and unproven health benefits No one at FDA wins kudos for slowing down those money flows To the contrary according to FDA s own employees drug company payments bias regulators with an inclination toward approval According to Dr Michael Carome a former Health

Corrupt vaccine approval panels But as corrupt as FDA is the internal panels VRBAC that approve new vaccines make the rest of the agency look like a Sunday church picnic When Dr Fauci Paul Offit Peter Hotez and Bill Gates tell you that you needn t worry because FDA is the gold standard for vaccine safety and that the ultimate licensing decision will be made by an independent panel of experts they are talking about VRBPAC But VRBPAC is far from independent It is not even comprised exclusively of public officials Instead it is populated by outside experts who are almost all pharmaceutical industry insiders In 2003 following a 3 year investigation the United States Congress s House Oversight Committee found VRBAC was completely dominated by the vaccine industry According to findings of the congressional investigation VRBAC s independent vaccine panel members often share vaccine patents with the pharmaceutical companies whose products they are evaluating They own stock in those vaccine companies receive payment from those companies for research and paid speeches They occupy consulting lofty and powerful sinecures and accept payments to monitor vaccine trials and funding for their academic departments The 2000 2003 U S House Government Reform Committee s investigation of VRBPAC found that 1 The overwhelming majority of members both voting members and consultants have substantial ties to the pharmaceutical industry 2 Conflict of interest rules employed by the FDA have been weak enforcement has been lax and committee members with substantial ties to pharmaceutical companies have been given waivers to participate in committee proceedings In many cases significant conflicts of interest are not deemed to be conflicts at all Congressional investigators offered a

from flies We are all lab rats in their high risk population wide experiment At FDA s vaccine division that sort of reckless decision making is routine In 2012 most live virus vaccines were from animal tissue and the idea of putting potentially cancerous tumor cells from adult donors in vaccines was still a daring and audacious gamble That September the FDA VRBPAC committee met to discuss this risky innovation The transcript of that meeting showing captive FDA officials considering a proposal by the pharma cabal to allow the use of human cancer cells HeLa to replace animal tissue in

cheaper than breeding animals for the culture media Millions of potentially cancer causing vaccines will be produced The vaccines may possibly cause genetic mutations Millions of dollars will be made

illustrates the reckless malevolent and murderous zeitgeist underlying the Pharma HHS partnership VRBPAC s devil may care decision making allowed pharmaceutical companies to use potentially cancerous fetal cells to make millions of vaccines Since that meeting vaccines containing cancerous cells and DNA strands from aborted fetuses have become pervasive among the 72 doses of vaccines that FDA has approved and CDC recommends for American children Today the vaccines for chickenpox MMR hepatitis A and shingles contain fetal DNA There is little chance of consequence to vaccine makers from making

and Drug Administration FDA had the opportunity to improve COVID 19 vaccine labeling but according to a team of medical and public health experts the agency refused to make the changes In an op ed published last week in The Hill Peter Doshi Ph D Linda Wastila Ph D and Kim Witczak wrote that the FDA rejected their petition to make changes to FDA approved labels for the Pfizer and Moderna COVID 19 vaccines even though the labels they said are obsolete misleading and out of touch with regulators elsewhere The trio were among a team of nine experts from the Coalition Advocating for Adequately Labeled Medicines CAALM who submitted a citizen petition to the FDA on Jan 31 Writing in The Hill the three said their petition tried to fix the issues with the labels by asking the FDA to make critical changes to official product labels that would reflect the vaccines lack of prevention of transmission or infection and risks pertaining to safety efficacy and adverse events The petitioners argued that Incomplete inaccurate or misleading labeling of any medical product can negatively impact the health and safety of Americans with global ramifications considering the international importance of FDA decisions However in a 33 page response letter delivered on April 18 the FDA denied almost every single request except for one Two of the petitioners who spoke with The Defender said they were astounded by the FDA s response which they characterized as an example of masterful doublespeak In a nutshell my response to the FDA astounded said Wastila The lack of due consideration of our requests coupled with the language which was circular condescending contradictory and confusing We are still parsing out their masterful doublespeak Referencing the FDA s claims that vaccines do not need to prevent transmission or illness Wastila professor and chair in geriatric pharmacotherapy at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy said FDA CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention NIH National Institutes of Health the White House and media still aggressively promote these products as preventing infection and transmission The majority of Americans believe that they are receiving a product that prevents infection and transmission This is the message they trust So they go out and get vaccinated and boosted to protect grandma to travel safely to get back to normal

light into how the FDA leadership views safety and efficacy of the mRNA COVID vaccines She also cited the timing of the FDA s response which came on the same day the original COVID 19 vaccines were replaced by the bivalent vaccines under the FDA s Emergency Use Authorization EUA She said I find it interesting we received the response on the same day the FDA rescinded the BLA Biologics License Application of the monovalent COVID products from Pfizer and Moderna Now technically the only products available are the EUA bivalent products I thought EUA products required an emergency and the national emergency was revoked April 10 and expired on May 11 Wastila also questioned the timing of the FDA s response telling The Defender The timing of FDA s response is curious it coincides with FDA s announcement that they no longer recommend the original two series monovalent product which means there are no BLA Pfizer COVID 19 vaccines effectively available on the market which presumably includes Comirnaty and Spikevax the fully licensed products The only products recommended are the EUA products And where is the emergency I m no lawyer but between the fuzziness of the EUA BLA boundary and the lack of a public health emergency how can EUA COVID 19 products still be promoted Whatever one thought of the initial shots people are now getting boosted indefinitely with little reliable information about scientific developments the petitioners wrote in The Hill Product labeling should be informative and accurate not promotional The law requires it and following the law shouldn t be optional FDA s double standard harms patients In the FDA s response Peter Marks M D Ph D director of the FDA s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said the agency had carefully

the public s trust in governmental institutions established to act in their interest they added FDA dismissed safety efficacy concerns Citing public statements by President Joe Biden Dr Anthony Fauci former CDC Director Rochelle Walensky the FDA Pfizer and Moderna the petitioners argued there is a widespread but inaccurate notion that efficacy against infection and transmission have been established by substantial evidence and that these vaccines contribute to herd immunity Referencing several FDA memos and documents they noted that in December 2020 when the FDA granted EUAs for the COVID 19 vaccines it made clear that the clinical trials were not designed to evaluate and data collected did not demonstrate an effect against SARS CoV 2 transmission In their op ed they said they asked the FDA to clarify in labeling that there isn t substantial evidence that mRNA vaccines reduce viral transmission The FDA has repeatedly stated that effectiveness against transmission remains unproven they wrote citing several examples including messaging that remains on the FDA s website today adding their belief that it is fairly obvious that there is substantial public confusion over just what the vaccines can and cannot do We pointed to messaging from public health leadership the three petitioners wrote Anthony Fauci stated the vaccine turns individuals into virus dead ends and Rochelle Walensky declared vaccinated people do not carry the virus However the FDA in its response claimed the petitioners chose selective statements from Fauci and Walensky and did not account for countervailing statements made by some of these officials The petitioners noted that the CDC s website continues to claim the COVID 19 vaccines are effective at limiting the spread of the virus Such

noted that while a Pfizer Phase 2 3 randomized trial in pregnant women began in February 2021 and was completed in July 2022 no results have been published Pregnant women were excluded from the original clinical trials they wrote in the petition referencing a June 2021 New England Journal of Medicine editorial urgently calling for trials among this population The petitioners also noted that before results were available from this trial the CDC and professional societies recommended all pregnant women get vaccinated However the trial itself originally designed to enroll 4 000 women inexplicably stopped at 349 participants The petitioners also referenced studies finding decreased sperm concentration from the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine heavy menstrual bleeding and detection of vaccine mRNA in breast milk Commenting on this in their op ed they wrote Federal law requires that product labeling lists adverse reactions that recipients may potentially experience if there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship The petitioners also called on the FDA to include a clear statement that Pfizer vaccine efficacy wanes two months after the second dose according to data from the Pfizer Phase 3 randomized trial Current labeling makes no mention of this data they said even though these results were available as early as April 2021 and publicly disclosed in July 2021 And they asked the FDA to revise COVID 19 vaccine product labels to include multi inflammatory syndrome MIS in children pulmonary embolism from the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine sudden cardiac death and neuropathic and autonomic disorders in the labeling for the COVID 19 vaccines They cited a dramatic increase in reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS and postmarketing studies that have found an increase in MIS in children increased occurrence of pulmonary embolism increased incidence of sudden cardiac death and increased incidence of neuropathic and autonomic disorders Historically VAERS has been shown to report only 1 of vaccine adverse events The petitioners also called for frequency data for clinical and subclinical myocarditis to be added to the

wrote In refusing to add these adverse events to the label the FDA invokes the strictest of standards demonstrating causality contradicting federal law that calls for using the some basis to believe standard In addition to allegedly violating federal law the petitioners argued the FDA failed to follow the lead of regulators elsewhere including in Europe and Japan For instance the European Medicines Agency EMA now advises that heavy menstrual bleeding is a potential side effect of the COVID 19 vaccines The FDA s response was a sophisticated version of who cares the petitioners wrote in The Hill In its response the FDA claimed that Foreign regulatory agencies expectations and regulations regarding product labeling can differ from those of the U S FDA and that the EMA had not proven causality with respect to that side effect If other foreign regulators put a warning on the label in their country the FDA should be alerting the public Witczak told The Defender The public was assured that safety surveillance information was being shared between countries Writing in The Hill the petitioners said that another one of their requests rejected by the FDA pertained to warnings about the documented risk of sudden death even though myocarditis is now a well recognized side effect particularly among young men despite citing multiple autopsy studies on lethal vaccination associated myocarditis According to the petitioners the FDA in its response argued that the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate a causal association between sudden cardiac death and vaccination and that alternative causes of death may not be apparent on autopsy I wonder if the public and doctors alike truly understand how little is known about these vaccines Witczak told The Defender

Tidmarsh who co authored the paper said that while some branded versions of the drugs contain talc many generic versions now contain magnesium stearate a safer alternative Drugmakers use talc mostly to help ingredients flow easily into tablet and capsule machinery without sticking to the machinery according to Steven Pfeiffer an organic chemist who works on drug development at Mirador

easy to know which foods contain talc Tidmarsh said Currently the FDA considers talc to be generally recognized as safe GRAS for use in food which means manufacturers aren t required to notify the FDA when they add it to food In March U S Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr directed the FDA to take steps to eliminate the GRAS loophole that allows the use of food ingredients based on food companies own assurances that the ingredients are safe with no safety assessment by the FDA When Makary asked what types of U S foods commonly contain talc the panelists were initially quiet Tidmarsh then responded by noting that according to the Codex Alimentarius a food index co published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations U N and the World Health Organization WHO there are literally hundreds of foods to which talc could be added The U N and WHO document states that talc can be added to food as an anticaking agent glazing agent and thickener This includes cheese sometimes the powder coating on cheese is talc Tidmarsh said WHO says talc is probably a human carcinogen Tidmarsh and other panelists discussed scientific evidence linking talc to both cancer and tissue inflammation In 2024 the WHO s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC concluded that talc is probably a human carcinogen The IARC based its conclusion on numerous reports of increased ovarian cancer in humans evidence for lung and adrenal gland cancers in experimental animals and strong mechanistic evidence that talc induces chronic inflammation Talc gets into our tissues and stays there a long time said Dr John Joseph Godleski professor emeritus of pathology at Harvard School of Public Health It takes nine years for one micron particle of talc to dissolve in human tissue he said There are 26 000 microns in one inch When talc is in a person s tissue it can affect the tissue in many ways including not only causing cancer but also what Godleski called

children s concentrated ingestible fluoride prescription drug products from the market The drugs which come in tablets and lozenges are routinely prescribed to children in the U S as a means to prevent cavities They can be prescribed to babies as young as 6 months old Overwhelming scientific research shows that fluoride s benefits to teeth are topical not the result of ingesting fluoride Research also shows that ingesting fluoride is linked to reduced IQ behavioral issues disruption of thyroid functioning and the gut microbiome The best way to prevent cavities in children is by avoiding excessive sugar intake and good dental hygiene not by altering a child s microbiome FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in the press release For the same reason that fluoride may kill bacteria on teeth it may also kill intestinal bacteria important for a child s health Makary said he is instructing the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to evaluate the risk of systemic fluoride exposure from the drugs When it comes to children we should err on the side of safety he added The agency said it aims to complete the safety review and public comment period and take action on the removal by Oct 31 The U S Department of Health and Human Services also intends to issue best practices for dental hygiene in children Dr Griffin Cole conference chairman of the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology told The Defender the announcement was great news for children s health Given what we now know about the dangers this drug poses to children we need to find ways to

fluoride where previous FDA administrations failed to do so FDA never approved prescription fluoride supplements Attorney Michael Connett represented the winning plaintiffs including FAN in the landmark lawsuit against the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA seeking to end water fluoridation He told The Defender that fluoride supplements have never been approved by the FDA to treat cavities The supplements were launched in the 1940s and later effectively grandfathered into the regulatory process They never underwent the testing for safety and effectiveness typically required by FDA regulated drugs and the agency never granted them formal approval Before 1938 sodium fluoride had never been used in dentistry Instead it was commonly used as a roach and rodent poison In 2016 FAN filed a citizens petition demanding the removal of unapproved unsafe unnecessary and ineffective sodium fluoride containing supplements from the market The petition cited a letter the FDA sent to Kirkman Labs a fluoride supplement manufacturer informing the company that it couldn t sell its products because they were unapproved drugs and didn t meet the generally recognized as safe classification The petition pointed out that FDA s decision on Kirkman should apply to all supplement manufacturers The FDA didn t disagree but said it made decisions on a case by case basis largely dependent on whether the U S attorney decided to file a lawsuit Cooper said A 2011 Cochrane review on fluoride supplements failed to locate any studies that investigated adverse effects other than

supplements was unknown for young children The study also found that supplements did show some minimal effect on cavities but only when children were not exposed to any topical fluoride like toothpaste It concluded that today fluoride supplements would have limited if any dental benefits Yet organizations like the American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics continue to recommend the supplements for children ages 6 months to 17 years old who don t have access to fluoridated drinking water Canada s Pediatric and Dental Association says the supplements should not be given to children under the age of three What about toothpaste Kathy Thiessen Ph D a leading fluoride expert and co author of a 2006 National Research Council report that addressed the toxic effects of fluoride said Fluoride drug products will generally deliver a higher dose at one time than other sources such as drinking water so acute effects e g gastrointestinal discomfort are more likely Also total doses per day are likely to be higher if prescription fluoride products are used making other effects more likely over the longer term Thiessen said eliminating prescription fluoride drug products is definitely a good move However she noted that one potential complication might be that some opponents of water fluoridation have posed the supplements as a way for people who still want fluoride to access it For example Utah passed a law last month ending water fluoridation but the law also extended the ability to prescribe fluoride supplements to pharmacists Elimination of the prescription products leaves primarily toothpaste which in my opinion should also not contain fluoride she said Limeback noted that today s announcement issued by the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS said the FDA will focus on supplements because they are swallowed by infants and children However Limeback said those concerns also exist for toothpaste The research shows that toddlers are unable to use fluoridated toothpaste without swallowing about 60 or more HHS also noted the recent legislation by states like Utah and Florida to ban water fluoridation Since the federal ruling last year in the landmark lawsuit against the EPA which found that fluoride added to water at current levels poses an unreasonable risk to children s health more than 60 U S towns counties and two states have voted to stop fluoridating their water according to FAN", "chunk_id":

The EWG says that it created the database to help consumers make healthier choices and that the raw data on product labels is supplied by Label Insight which is owned by NielsenIQ a major provider of

U S than are allowed in the EU said Erik Millstone an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex in England who has been studying food safety policy since the 1970s Direct comparisons are difficult because the two regulatory systems and the way they keep their records differ greatly A definitive count is elusive because the FDA doesn t require the industry to inform it of everything used in foods in the U S That kind of casual neglect totally would be unacceptable in Europe Millstone said Several decades behind europeans When the FDA formally approves substances for use in food

they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past The FDA website lists 19 post market determinations since 2010 that substances were not generally

Department of Health and Human Services to safeguard the food supply through pre market and post market safety evaluations of chemicals in the food supply The loophole swallowed the law The biggest gap in the FDA s oversight of foods goes back generations In 1958 Congress mandated that before additives could be used in foods manufacturers had to prove they were safe and get FDA approval However Congress carved out an exception for substances generally recognized as safe which came to be known simply as GRAS As conceived GRAS promised regulatory relief for standard ingredients like salt sugar vinegar and baking powder along with many chemicals Over time the loophole swallowed the law said a 2014 report by Neltner and Maricel Maffini for the Natural Resources Defense Council Companies can

2010 That spared the FDA from spending time reviewing countless substances For advice on whether ingredients are GRAS companies may convene panels of specialists The FDA has noted that panel members could be paid by the companies commissioning the review but in guidance to industry it says such compensation is not itself an unacceptable conflict About 3 000 flavoring ingredients have been deemed GRAS by a panel of scientists working for an industry group the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association of the U S known as FEMA said George Southworth the organization s executive director The scientists on the FEMA panel adhere to stringent conflict of interest policies and their GRAS determinations are submitted to the FDA which includes them in an online database Southworth said Southworth described the panel as independent and the FEMA website says panel members have never been employees of companies in the food industry Asked how many times FEMA s panel found that a flavoring didn t meet the test Southworth wouldn t say He indicated that some reviews are called off before a conclusion is reached Publicly reporting these numbers without full context could lead to misinterpretations about the safety of substances he added Another way Food companies have another option They can voluntarily notify the FDA that they believe their product is GRAS for its intended use and lay out their reasons giving the FDA a heads up and essentially seeking its blessing If they take that route they don t have to wait for an answer from the FDA to begin marketing the product

Psyched out On March 8 2022 a Canadian company Psyched Wellness issued a news release saying it had a green light to market products in the U S An independent review panel of scientific experts concluded that an extract the company developed AME 1 was Generally Recognized As Safe paving the way for it to be sold in bulk and used as an ingredient the company said The company described the panel s judgment as a successful certification and a key milestone The extract was derived from a hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria which the company said has incredible healing and medicinal powers As the company later put it in a news release it had obtained self Gras status In June 2024 the company announced that it would soon release Amanita muscaria watermelon gummies However the FDA later took issue with the company and its product In a memo dated Sept 9 2024 an FDA toxicologist said Psyched Wellness claim of GRAS certification was false The firm failed to show that its extract

Stéphane Bancel said in a news release COVID 19 continues to pose a significant potential threat to children especially those with underlying medical conditions Vaccination can be an important tool for protecting our youngest against severe disease and hospitalization We appreciate the FDA s diligent scientific review and approval of Spikevax for pediatric populations at increased risk for COVID 19 disease No announcement about the expanded approval was available on the FDA s website as of press time The FDA and the U S Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a

than the actual symptoms of COVID especially as they pertain to the pediatric population Palevsky said According to the U S government run Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS 73 075 cases of adverse events related to COVID 19 vaccines in people ages 17 and younger were reported as of June 27 Of these 6 138 cases were classified as serious The reports included 15 053 adverse event cases filed following Moderna s COVID 19 vaccine Of those 710 were serious These figures may underestimate the true incidence of adverse events as a 2011 Harvard report found that less than 1 of all adverse events are reported to VAERS In the last four years more children have suffered from severe health outcomes related to the injection of previous COVID shots than they have experienced severe symptoms from COVID itself Palevsky said Biologist Christina Parks Ph D said there are several elements of the FDA s approval that are concerning and bewildering She cited several core safety concerns regarding mRNA vaccines that have yet to be addressed Parks said Given the known toxicity of the full length spike protein why do current vaccines still code for the production of the spike protein in persons receiving the vaccine Immunological susceptibility to hyperinflammation is at the core of vulnerability to both severe COVID as well as COVID vaccine induced adverse reactions Where is the CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance on which immunological markers should be evaluated to determine whether the benefit of receiving a Moderna vaccine in the at risk children will outweigh the risk of chronic inflammation or an adverse event Studies link mRNA vaccines to myocarditis other serious side effects Multiple studies have linked COVID 19 vaccines to health risks in children Here are just a few The CDC and Moderna both know that the full length spike protein is toxic and likely the cause of myocarditis in young males yet they are recommending the Moderna vaccine for 11 year old males without making any changes to the vaccine or its administration that might mitigate this potential risk Parks said Last month the FDA approved updated versions of package inserts

week to lead the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research which regulates over the counter and prescription drugs In May the FDA moved to ban fluoride supplements after a systematic review of recent science by top government scientists published in January in JAMA Pediatrics reported that early fluoride exposure was linked to a decrease in children s IQ scores During Wednesday s meeting Tidmarsh said That s a huge issue Everybody should be concerned about that What this is saying is that the fluoride in water was causing a cognitive decrease in the younger children And the randomized studies say that there is no benefit So that s a tough thing to defend Our job here is to use evidence he added citing the recently updated Cochrane Review on fluoride which found that water fluoridation offered little to no protection against cavities in children Although the FDA never approved fluoride supplements which come in tablets and lozenges doctors have for decades routinely prescribed them to children including babies as young as 6 months old to prevent cavities Research has shown for more than two decades that any benefit to teeth from fluoride comes from topical applications like toothpaste not from ingesting the drug The supplements are known to cause dental fluorosis a tooth discoloration that is a marker of fluoride overexposure Overwhelming evidence now shows that ingesting fluoride is linked to lower IQ in children neurobehavioral issues and thyroid problems Fluoride advocates say safety studies exist but don t cite them Wednesday s day long meeting

where the right amount of fluoride is present during development As we look at ways in today s world of achieving that balance supplements play a very important role When we don t have fluoride there are certain things that happen that are very disturbing Bekker added We have an increase in tooth decay and we have an increase in the use of emergency services to receive care for dental emergencies However Tidmarsh called out Bekker comparing the lack of evidence in his presentation with the presentation by Dr Bill Osmunson a dentist associated with the Fluoride Action Network FAN who pointed out that no randomized controlled studies had ever been conducted on the supplements Bekker countered that he didn t want to overwhelm people with information That data is very available It s important to understand that he said citing no specific studies Just take them off the market The move to ban the supplements comes on the heels of a federal court decision last September that water

supplements was slated to comment on the content of the presentations about fluoride s risks Instead she argued that systemic absorption of fluoride is paramount I want to make sure you understand that when we drink fluoridated water we are allowing ourselves both a topical and a systemic source of fluoride And both of these are important She said systemic ingestion is particularly important for young children Lewis said researchers arguing there is little to no benefit to swallowing fluoride are biased What we ve seen today is people cherry picking studies and making conclusions without presenting us with the complete data that we need she added Those observations followed Taylor s presentation in which she explained that the National Toxicology Program and the JAMA publication presented an analysis of every available study and they made all of their data publicly available Cole responded to Lewis quoting her own Pediatrics in Review paper in which she concluded the

underscoring the fact that the drugs have never been subjected to an FDA approval process to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks The supplements were launched in the 1940s and later effectively grandfathered into the regulatory process They never underwent the testing for safety and effectiveness typically required by FDA regulated drugs and the agency never granted them formal approval Before 1938 sodium fluoride had never been used in dentistry Instead it was commonly used as a roach and rodent poison In 2016 FAN filed a citizens petition demanding the removal of unapproved unsafe unnecessary and ineffective sodium fluoride containing supplements from the market The petition cited a letter the FDA sent to Kirkman Labs a fluoride supplement manufacturer

Sign Up The U S Food and Drug Administration FDA is suffering from dysfunction and is failing to do bare minimum to carry out its core mission which is to make certain our nation s food and drug products are safe and effective according to Rep James Comer R Ky chairman of the U S House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Accountability In his opening remarks during a hearing Thursday on oversight of the FDA Comer said the FDA appears consistently unprepared for certain crises He cited the agency s failures to address the infant formula crisis and to prepare for and respond to drug shortages for essential medications used to treat infection heart disease and cancer FDA Commissioner Robert Califf was the sole witness to testify during the hearing which was dominated by topics such as the risks of tobacco and vaping products In his opening remarks Califf focused on what he referred to as the agency s work in four main areas including addressing vulnerabilities in the supply chain reversing the decline in our national life expectancy accelerating effective treatment for thousands of rare genetic diseases and undertaking the most significant reorganization in FDA history with a focus on human foods and improving oversight of all of our regulated industries Neither Comer nor Califf addressed COVID 19 bird flu or vaccine safety and vaccine related adverse events during their opening remarks However during questioning Califf addressed lawmakers questions about the effectiveness of ivermectin hydroxychloroquine and vitamin D as COVID 19

vaccine trial that led to the EUA emergency use authorization did show a dramatic reduction in the rate of infection in the two groups The virus then mutated But the good news is now we have a progression of overwhelming evidence in every country including the United States If you re up to date on your vaccine you re less likely to be dead You re less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit if you live in a county with a higher vaccine rate the mortality rate is lower So when you compare the two yes vaccines have side effects the risk of being dead is lower if you re vaccinating Dr Mary Talley Bowden an otolaryngologist and sleep medicine specialist in Houston disagreed She told The Defender Califf lied about the efficacy of the COVID shots adding that the 95 effective claim of COVID 19 vaccines was an absolute risk reduction in the rate of infection from only 0 88 to 0 04 Dr Denis Rancourt looked at all cause mortality following the COVID shots in 17 countries and found no positive association between taking the COVID shot and reduction in mortality In fact he found the opposite All cause mortality increased following the COVID shots Bowden said Califf also responded to a question from Gosar about the recent settlement in which the FDA agreed to remove content from its website and social media accounts discouraging the use of ivermectin to treat COVID 19 claiming the FDA didn t retract everything we had to say about ivermectin If you look at the randomized trials of ivermectin and there are many of them now there is no benefit of

intended to discourage doctors from prescribing ivermectin as a COVID 19 treatment What we re not doing is telling doctors what they have to do Doctors have the right to prescribe off label Califf said Bowden again accused Califf of lying During the pandemic government doctors like Califf dictated who would get treated and how from the safety of their homes over Zoom meetings They have consistently rejected input from doctors with extensive experience treating COVID patients and have simply cherry picked published data to fit their agenda In reality there are 49 randomized control trials studying ivermectin for COVID 35 of these show a benefit Responding to a question from ranking member Rep Jamie Raskin D Md on the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID 19 treatment Califf said Basically the same story There was really exciting preliminary work in the laboratory that said hydroxychloroquine may have efficacy against COVID So the randomized trials were done unfortunately no benefit Again nothing wrong with thinking it may work and trying it out in a randomized trial but then we have the data now Committee members also addressed vitamin D as a treatment for COVID 19 Responding to Rep Glenn Grothman R Wis about the lack of emphasis from the public health establishment on having vitamin D Califf said this is really not in our domain We don t regulate the practice of medicine that s determined by the medical profession And other agencies may have more to say about that Califf told the committee There are many diseases for which if you measure vitamin D levels the higher the vitamin D level the lower the risk of the disease But it turns out when randomized trials have been done for most diseases it turns out there is no difference And the randomized trials

federal agencies to provide accurate information to the public on this issue Avian flu has been around for a while but it s only recently that it s now infected cattle and now cattle in multiple cows in multiple states And so this is really an all of government effort Califf said There are Zoom conferences multiple times a day at present involving the FDA and other federal agencies We re all working together and you should see frequent communications as we work through this The most recent episode with the cows is a relatively new thing we re starting with a lot of uncertainty and working our way through it Califf said Califf also referenced the FDA s stockpile of bird flu vaccines If you look at the composition of this virus there s nothing in it that should confer resistance to the current antivirals that we have stockpiles of Califf said Califf refuses to commit to opposing pandemic treaty or receiving Big Pharma funds Citing a potential threat to U S sovereignty Rep Scott

such questions including Why did the FDA try to withhold the Pfizer safety data from physicians and patients for 75 years and Why is the FDA continuing to grant EUA after EUA for human experimentation when an effective treatment already exists Why has the FDA not alerted the public to the 1 200 diseases reported by Pfizer to be associated with the Pfizer mRNA shot Bartlett also asked Bowden said

the ages of 6 months and 64 years Instead it requires vaccine makers to conduct randomized clinical trials that have clinical outcomes preventing symptomatic COVID 19 hospitalization or death on the

plans to seek authorization for its pediatric COVID 19 vaccine for kids 6 and under but experts say the vaccine maker s trials for the young age group raise too many questions You must be a CHD

symptomatic disease by 43 7 in children 6 months to 2 years old and by 35 7 in children ages 2 to 6 The company said its Phase 2 3 KidCOVE study of its mRNA 1273 in children successfully met its primary endpoint However as Politico reported Wednesday and as experts told The Defender some doctors and scientists question whether Moderna s clinical trial data will be sufficient for the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA to grant EUA for the vaccine Experts cited the trials low efficacy rates small sample size and reliance on a research workaround called immunobridging as weaknesses that could hinder Moderna s case Given the other data that surrounds it I don t know that it s a slam dunk that the FDA will move forward in terms of releasing it for emergency use Peter Hotez professor of pediatrics and molecular virology and microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine told Politico We re still learning about the relationship between virus neutralizing antibodies and effectiveness Hotez said adding the FDA might need to raise its standards Experts also raised questions about the risk benefit ratio of the COVID vaccines for an age group with a statistically insignificant risk of severe illness The FDA recently tabled Pfizer s petition for EUA of its pediatric vaccine for infants and children 6 months to age 5 citing insufficient data on a third dose for children 2 to 4 years old Small trials hide injuries experts say Moderna s trial was designed to analyze the safety immunogenicity and tolerability of two vaccine doses in healthy children who were administered two 25 microgram doses 28 days apart according to Clinical Trials Arena The sample size was small Approximately 6 700 children were enrolled in the trial s 6 and under age group including about 4 200 children between the ages of 2 and 6 and 2 500 children between 6 months and 2 years The trial also encompassed children in the 6 to 12 year old age group bringing the total to nearly 11 700 children

Instead of having 30 000 to 45 000 people half who get the vaccine and half the placebo we re enrolling more like a few thousand in each of these age groups Toby Rogers Ph D an expert in statistics and how they relate to vaccine trials told The Defender that 6 700 participants makes for an undersized trial Researchers would call this intentionally undersized to hide harms Rogers said And this is a standard trick that pharmaceutical companies do For the Moderna study there were about 3 350 participants each in the treatment and placebo groups An adverse event such as myocarditis might happen one out of 5 000 times Rogers said If you have only 3 300 in the treatment group you are unlikely to see that particular harm in the clinical trial he said And if you do see it in the treatment group the company has ways to kick that person out of the trial Rogers added Say you experience myocarditis and you call the hospital at midnight and get in the car and go to the hospital you get kicked out of the trial because you are breaking their protocols They want you to call their doctors and not the hospital They do that pretty regularly In context trials for the polio vaccine had a million participants And now we have trials that are coming in with just a few thousand participants It s bad faith This is just the tip of a large iceberg Rogers said Moderna trials show vaccine fails to meet FDA 50 efficacy standard for EUA products Moderna s claim that two shots of its vaccine reduced cases of symptomatic disease by 43 7 in children 6 months to 2 years old and by 35 7 in children ages 2 to 6 means the vaccine falls below the FDA s 50 efficacy threshold for EUA products No one would argue that 40 percent protection is great Dr Chandy John a pediatrician at Indiana University told The Atlantic According to Politico Moderna officials said the regimen met a metric called immunobridging meaning the pediatric doses produced the same immune response that s been seen in young

according to Bernard Fritzell in a paper published in Developing Biological Standards In practice using immunobridging means that pediatric vaccine researchers looked at an older group from a previous trial who received a different dose of a vaccine with different ingredients and decided what level of antibodies in that group were enough to ward off COVID They then looked at the younger children s group to see how many of those participants had that same level of antibodies a process that is not predictive of an individual s ability to fight off infections Rogers said Rogers added So moving forward into this mythical future we predict that this many kids with antibodies will be protected If this was a legitimate way to do science you d never have to do clinical trials in kids because you could just immunobridge from any population under the sun whenever you wanted to If you get a clinical trial with zero effect you are going to finesse it with immunobridging Dr Meryl Nass an internal medicine physician with expertise in anthrax and bioterrorism and member of the Children s Health Defense CHD scientific advisory committee also criticized the practice The term immunobridging is simply a fancy way of saying we are going to use antibody titers instead of actual cases of disease prevented as our benchmark Nass told The Defender And we will compare the antibody level in one age group to that in another and if they are comparable we will say the vaccine works in the new age group Nass said Nass said the FDA began accepting surrogate markers of efficacy in vaccines years ago for vaccines intended for rare conditions in which there were not sufficient cases to determine actual efficacy in the real world Nass said This is simply not the case with COVID There is plenty of COVID going around For Moderna to claim the FDA should authorize its vaccine in babies and preschool children because the vaccine led to high antibody levels when its real world efficacy and only against mild symptoms was only 40 is a bad joke The efficacy level tells you that antibody levels are a poor surrogate for efficacy and should therefore be ignored Other parts of the immune system

its study was unable to assess the vaccine s efficacy against severe disease hospitalization or death for ages 6 and younger as participants infections were mild or moderate The only adverse events the study reported were fevers 15 of children had fevers higher than 100 4 degrees and 1 in 500 experienced a fever higher than 104 degrees Moderna did not disclose if any of the children who participated required hospitalization as a result of the fevers It did reveal that adverse reactions were more frequently reported after the second dose Trials short duration plus evolving variants raise questions Critics also cited the study s short duration though Moderna said it will continue to monitor its participants for 12 months Long term adverse effects of the vaccine remain an open question said Stephanie Seneff Ph D senior research scientist at MIT s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Are we prepared to booster children every three or four months since the protection from the vaccine is short lived Seneff asked The Omicron variation affected the Moderna s efficacy rates in children an outcome the company claimed was as expected But the fact that the virus continues to mutate at a fast rate and the fact that kids 6 and younger are at low risk from COVID makes the vaccine s use in healthy children questionable Hamid A Merchant subject leader in

prevalent in early 2020 and the virus has significantly mutated since then the breakthrough cases from the recent Omicron outbreak is a good example of the rapidly evolving nature of this virus Research in the UK indicates more than 85 of children ages 5 to 11 years have already contracted COVID and have acquired natural immunity Merchant added Kids at low risk of severe disease Politico

to believe but since the New York Times revealed that CDC hides the bulk of the data it collects on COVID in part to avoid providing tinder to antivaxxers regarding poor vaccine efficacy it may be that CDC did in fact choose not to look at such data A Johns Hopkins study that monitored 48 000 children under 18 who were diagnosed with COVID showed there were zero deaths in those without

of their COVID jab rollout for adults I m sure you re aware of the massive catastrophe we have with children under 5 dropping ill like flies from COVID as this is the justification Pfizer is using to

the adult dose failed to produce an adequate immune response in 2 to 4 year olds They re now experimenting to see if three doses will produce adequate results in that age group In the meantime the EUA

They claim the shots are safe so it s OK to inject young children even though they might not gain any benefit Does that make any sense According to MSN Pfizer and its partner BioNTech said that the submission was at the request of the FDA which is an unusual move Quickly after the announcement the FDA scheduled a meeting of its vaccine advisory committee for Feb 15 to discuss the application Allowing Pfizer to submit the request now means that if authorized parents will have the opportunity to begin a COVID 19 vaccination series for their children while awaiting potential authorization of a third dose according to Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla Data on the third dose will be submitted to the FDA in the coming months the company said COVID shots shown to destroy immune function The list of concerns is a long one We ve already seen that Pfizer s own data reveal there are serious problems with the shots and real world data confirming worst fears are mounting by the day A number of medical experts scientists and published studies have warned the COVID shots can reprogram your immune system to respond in a dysfunctional manner For example a study posted on the preprint server medRxiv May 6 2021 found the Pfizer BioNTech COVID jab reprograms both adaptive and innate immune responses causing immune depletion While the jab induced effective humoral and cellular immunity against several SARS CoV 2 variants the shot also modulated the production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells upon stimulation with both specific SARS CoV 2 and nonspecific viral fungal and bacterial stimuli People who were fully vaccinated having received two doses of the Pfizer shot also produced significantly less interferon upon stimulation which hampers vitally important innate immune responses In other words we re looking at a horrible tradeoff You may get some protection against SARS CoV 2 and its variants but you re weakening your overall immune function which opens the door wide to all sorts of other health problems from bacterial fungal and viral infections to cancer and autoimmunity Is it really wise to expose babies and toddlers to such risks Just because children

to a Freedom of Information Act FOIA request to the FDA also do nothing to assuage safety concerns Quite the contrary Cumulatively between Dec 1 2020 and Feb 28 2021 a period of just 2 5 months Pfizer received 42 086 injury reports including 1 223 fatalities Compare that to the 1976 swine flu vaccine which was pulled after 25 deaths Pfizer even acknowledges the abnormal rate of injuries They actually had to hire more data entry and case processing personnel to handle the influx of adverse events reports Still they insist everything is hunky dory and there s absolutely no problem Initially the FDA wanted 55 years to release all of Pfizer s trial data at a rate of 500 pages per month After finding another trove of related documents they asked for 75 years A judge denied both requests ordering the agency to release the data at a rate of 55 000 pages per month starting March 1 to finalize the full release in about eight months Judging by what we found in the initial 500 page batch

lawsuit seeking information from the U S Food and Drug Administration used in licensing the company s COVID 19 vaccine a litigation move that plaintiffs who are suing for the data say is premature Pfizer s lawyers at DLA Piper told U S District Judge Mark Pittman on Jan 21 it wanted a role in the proceedings to help the FDA avoid inappropriately disclosing trade secret and confidential commercial information The group of doctors and scientists who sued last year over public access to the FDA s Pfizer licensing records said in a court filing that the company s bid to jump into the lawsuit was untimely because the plaintiffs have not challenged any redactions to requested records The Defender further reported The FDA claimed Pfizer is entitled to intervene in the case and the process of redacting the documents in question due to the Trade Secrets Act signed into law by President Obama in 2016 stating FDA anticipates that coordination with Pfizer to obtain the company s views as to which portions of the records are subject to Exemption 4 the Trade Secrets Act 18 U S C 1905 or other statutory protections will be a necessary component of the agency s endeavors to meet the extraordinary exigencies of this case However according to The Gateway Pundit the Trade Secrets Act is being misinterpreted by the FDA and Pfizer T he protections provided under that law allow for an owner of a trade secret to sue in federal court when its trade secrets have been misappropriated and does not even imply that a company could intervene in a public records request through the FOIA

number of issues relating to Pfizer s handling of the COVID pandemic including its war profiteering focusing on profits during a pandemic and spreading misleading claims about its competitors a whistleblower s claims of scientific misconduct and questions about Pfizer playing God by unilaterally dictating who would get its jab and who wouldn t thereby prolonging the pandemic According to the Dispatches report Pfizer s jab was not only more expensive than its rival AstraZeneca to begin with costing the UK government 18 per dose compared to 3 for AstraZeneca but as a third booster dose rolled out Pfizer raised its price to 22 a decision that has raised questions about the company s motives It seems fairly obvious that it s all about the money for them Pfizer will of course disagree with that obvious conclusion According to professor Sir Andrew Pollard who helped develop the Pfizer shot the company s incentive was never about maximizing profits U S Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky on the other hand told Dispatches that Pfizer clearly made no effort to rein in their pricing or limit their profits Unprecedented profiteering According to Dispatches Pfizer s COVID jab has become the most profitable pharmaceutical product the world has ever seen As of the third quarter of 2021 Pfizer s revenues were 130 above operational costs with COVID jab revenue for 2021 reaching 36 billion Revenue from the jab is predicted to rise to 55 billion in 2022 equivalent to the gross domestic product GDP of Croatia One of the reasons for Pfizer s record breaking profits Dispatches says is because it has been prioritizing sales to wealthier Western nations willing and able to pay the higher cost Pfizer has also refused to license its patented recipe to ensure an adequate supply for

it pays for needed research and development but let s remember that taxpayers paid for all of the research and development that went into this jab in the first place As explained in the video the initial development of the Pfizer jab was done by BioNTech which received millions of euros of public funding from both the German government and the EU Essentially the public paid for its development and then got fleeced while Pfizer makes out like a bandit By the end of 2021 Pfizer had manufactured 2 billion doses of the jab But while the company claims it s dedicated to provide equitable and affordable access only 16 had gone to lower and middle income countries and only 1 to the poorest of nations In 2022 Pfizer intends to produce 4 billion doses According to Dispatches the total cost of manufacturing is somewhere between 80 cents and 1 40 per dose The most likely cost is right around 1 05 Pfizer disputes this saying it does not reflect the true costs of making the jab as this cost does not include the cost of scaling up manufacturing efforts global distribution and clinical trials The UK which pays the highest price for Pfizer s jab had at the end of 2021 paid Pfizer an estimated 2 6 billion about 3 5 billion which based on the cost of production is thought to be about 2 billion around 2 7 billion more than it should have paid had the profit margin been more reasonable Pfizer spread misinformation about rivals According to Dispatches Pfizer is also responsible for spreading misinformation about rival COVID shots including the AstraZeneca injection A Canadian PowerPoint presentation sent to medical professionals included a slide detailing alleged disadvantages of viral vector DNA injections such as the AstraZeneca shot The slide states that viral vector DNA injections might cause chromosomal integration and oncogenesis In other words the DNA might become permanently integrated in your genes and could cause cancer There was also a warning against its use in immunocompromised patients Curiously enough when asked Pollard claims there s no truth to any of those claims So how did those claims come to be shown to health professionals across

Pfizer funding More specifically the portion of the presentation that listed disadvantages of viral vector DNA products was written by a team that included at least one member who had previously worked in Pfizer s vaccine department When asked about the risks associated with vaccine misinformation Pollard says there are huge risks as anything that causes people to be hesitant about getting the shot can result in them risking their lives So seeing how Pfizer appears to have undermined a competing COVID jab aren t they then guilty of causing vaccine hesitancy and putting lives at risk And seeing how Pollard claims there s no truth to any of those warnings doesn t that suggest Pfizer put people s lives at risk for no other reason than to maximize their own profits Pfizer of course denies having had any influence over the creation of the presentation Keep in mind I strongly disagree with Dispatches claims that the Pfizer shot is a life saving drug I also disagree with Pollard s claim that vaccine hesitancy is potentially life threatening What I m pointing out here is the hypocrisy While Dispatches valiantly tries to paint Pfizer as a global savior albeit a greedy one I believe all COVID jabs are a dangerous scam that are doing far more harm to humanity than good They re literally raking in unprecedented profits from the suffering and death of untold millions Were corners cut After giving the audience a blanket assurance that the Pfizer jab is clearly safe and effective Dispatches goes on to review whistleblower testimony from Brooke Jackson a clinical research

know children are essentially at zero risk of dying from COVID They might test positive They might develop symptoms but they get through it just like they get through the common cold or flu There s no reason to jeopardize their long term health with a COVID jab They don t need it and therefore ANY risk of the jab no matter how small is unconscionable and unacceptable Fortunately many parents

December 2021 granted Emergency Use Authorization EUA to two COVID 19 early treatment oral drugs Pfizer s Paxlovid and Merck s molnupiravir This was a major milestone as until then there were no FDA endorsed pharmaceutical pill options for people diagnosed with COVID 19 The standard medical therapy for a newly diagnosed person was Go home rest drink water and go to the hospital if things get dire Now after almost two years people diagnosed with early stages of COVID 19 can be prescribed a pill As background there are three stipulations a drug must meet in order to obtain EUA from the FDA There must be an emergency The treatment in consideration must be safe and offer 50 efficacy There must not be an alternative available treatment that is safe and effective Pfizer and Merck oversaw clinical trials that attempted to prove their products were safe and effective In the letters of authorization issued to Pfizer and Merck the FDA outlined what tests were done what the results were what some of the limitations and concerns are etc The FDA then generated more detailed advisories to healthcare providers doctors for Paxlovid and molnupiravir These documents give more specifics about use restrictions e g not to children potentially adverse effects of each drug e g not to be used by pregnant women etc potential conflicts with other drugs quite a few etc Here are four key points to consider regarding the Paxlovid and molnupiravir data The tests were conducted by the pharmaceutical companies themselves not an unbiased entity No long term testing was done on either of these drugs the trials lasted a few months The effects on patients with many other diseases e g Parkinson s were not evaluated and remain unknown The reported effectiveness of each drug hospitalization or death 88 and 30 are relative not absolute See this explanation about this important point OK kudos to the FDA for giving consumers some early treatment options for dealing with COVID 19 It s especially good that they are non hospital take at home therapies However the question remains How do these FDA endorsed drugs compare to other over the counter OTC and non patented drugs especially ivermectin IVM

access the hyperlinks 6 takeaways from comparison of Paxlovid and molnupiravir to IVM HCQ and OTCs Pfizer s Paxlovid is reported to have very high effectiveness HCQ and the curcumin have effectiveness comparable to Paxlovid Merck s molnupiravir has very low effectiveness IVM Vitamin D and Zinc have effectiveness far superior to molnupiravir Paxlovid and molnupiravir have more serious side effects than the others Paxlovid and molnupiravir cost considerably more than the non patented options Are Pfizer and Merck oral treatment EUAs legal Remember federal law stipulates that an EUA can not be granted unless There is no adequate approved and available alternative to the product for diagnosing preventing or treating the disease or condition The data in this analysis indicate there are adequate and available alternatives for treating COVID 19 If the data are accurate then these EUAs have questionable legality Adequate and available alternatives for treating COVID 19 do in fact exist the FDA has no scientific justification for ignoring IVM HCQ Vitamin D and zinc Further if these FDA issued EUAs for Paxlovid and molnupiravir violate federal statutes a closer examination of the FDA s COVID 19 vaccine EUAs seems warranted If the Pfizer and Merck EUAs are legal then why haven t HCQ and IVM also been given EUAs Considering the six takeaways listed above plus the fact as noted in the above table that there have been successful HCQ and IVM studies much larger 10x than those done for Paxlovid and molnupiravir exactly why has the FDA not issued EUAs for IVM and HCQ The comparative in Table 1 adequately demonstrates there is no justification for the FDA s refusal to grant EUAs to IVM and HCQ If the FDA had granted EUAs for HCQ and IVM a year ago hundreds of thousands

identified above regarding the Paxlovid and molnupiravir data all apply here Some of the main takeaways from this comparison are Sotrovimab has the highest effectiveness but the least amount of data HCQ and curcumin have effectiveness comparable to the bamlanivimab and casirivimab combinations The first FDA EUA given to bamlanivimab turned out to be a mistake as health issues were discovered All the monoclonals have more serious side effects than the non EUA options All the monoclonals cost considerably more than the non EUA options All the monoclonals have much less safety data than the non

watchdog groups accuse the FDA of having evolved from a hard charging tiger of an agency a century ago to a pliant pussycat today You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Regulatory agencies says Encyclopedia Britannica are a uniquely American institution Though conceptualized as mere advisory bodies at the time of their emergence in the late 19th century federal regulatory agencies have since acquired comprehensive legislative powers and even quasi judicial powers exercising social control through rulemaking with almost no supervision by other branches of government As legal scholars tamely explain unique pressures and influences invariably push regulators actions and their decisions on policy questions in a direction favored by regulated firms This phenomenon known as regulatory capture has become the norm not least because lucrative revolving door jobs generally await tractable regulators once they exit their government posts In the crowded field of captured agencies the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA is one of the standouts FDA gets 45 of its budget from the pharmaceutical industry and fast tracks more than 50 of the drugs it approves Consumer watchdog groups accuse the FDA of having evolved from a hard charging tiger of an agency a century ago to a pliant pussycat today FDA states that drug recalls are initiated either by FDA request or on a company s own initiative According to the consumer website Drugwatch however FDA can only recommend but not force a recall Vaccine recalls too are almost always initiated voluntarily by the vaccine manufacturer In 1976 public outcry forced the government to pull the plug on a dangerous swine flu vaccine after just 10 weeks but only after 40 million Americans had received it Although manufacturers do withdraw dangerous drugs vaccines and consumer products from the market from time to time sometimes after FDA has obligingly looked the other way for decades many observers believe such recalls represent the tip of the iceberg a placatory bone thrown to persuade the public that the nation has a functional oversight system Is the FDA at least scrupulous about which drugs and vaccines it lets out of the starting gate As a long line of drug fiascoes suggests the clear answer is no experimental COVID vaccines are the latest example The still timely tale of thalidomide Thalidomide never received FDA approval but the saga illustrates how even 60 years ago the FDA had already cast its lot with industry In the late 1950s German firm Chemie Grünenthal now Grünenthal

thalidomide in 46 countries for five years before admitting the drug posed risks of severe birth defects including missing or deformed limbs and injuries to major organs In the U S Chemie Grünenthal gave two pharmaceutical giants companies that dominate the American market to this day permission to manufacture thalidomide first Smith Kline French now GlaxoSmithKline and then Richardson Merrell now Sanofi Richardson Merrell expected smooth regulatory sailing but after it ignored repeated requests for pregnancy safety data from Dr Frances Kelsey a newly minted FDA employee with untarnished integrity Kelsey took a bold stance against inadequate testing and corporate pressure and refused to approve thalidomide s U S release Mistakenly confident that corporate pressure would eventually bear fruit the company went ahead and distributed in an uncontrolled fashion more than 2 5 million doses of thalidomide to 20 000 pregnant women under cover of clinical trials When Kelsey still would not approve the drug the company was forced to give up but threatened to sue Kelsey after she tried to track down thalidomide babies Neither the FDA nor the U S attorney backed up Kelsey In 1962 President John F Kennedy shone a light on Kelsey s efforts by giving her a President s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service Even so thalidomide survivors allege the FDA and Richardson Merrell kept the full story of thalidomide buried for decades In fact not only did FDA squelch efforts to locate thalidomide victims but it produced a whitewashed report stating that Richardson Merrell s unauthorized marketing program had produced just 17 thalidomide babies a bogus estimate emphatically denounced by survivors At some point FDA appears to have quietly changed its tune In an undated presentation on its website the agency states By late 1961 it was obvious that thalidomide had caused serious birth defects in thousands of children Subscribe to The Defender It s Free Name

today permits thalidomide as a treatment for multiple myeloma The hunt is also on for dermatological and other uses DES and Vioxx Self congratulatory regulators claim the thalidomide disaster gave birth to stricter regulations and safer drugs However it is not hard to find examples that undermine this assertion For instance despite numerous danger signals it took the FDA until 1971 to issue a warning about pregnant women s use of diethylstilbestrol DES a drug the FDA approved in 1947 in the pre thalidomide era No ban accompanied FDA s soft pedaled 1971 warning however so mothers to be

California San Francisco Califf acknowledged that it wasn t accepted practice for the FDA to promote products the agency regulated but said the world was undergoing extenuating circumstances I don t think any FDA commissioner alive has been through a pandemic like this I think this is a very unusual situation said Califf In normal times the FDA should not be a cheerleader the FDA is a referee calling balls and strikes but in this case we were in the middle of a pandemic people were dying at very high rates he said Califf explained that Pfizer was not able to advertise Paxlovid because under section 564 of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act drug companies cannot advertise their products unless they are fully approved At the time Paxlovid only had emergency use authorization EUA Remember with an EUA the company can t advertise Califf explained The purchasing is not done by sales reps selling in hospitals and practices it s bulk purchasing by the government Consequently Califf took to social media to promote Paxlovid based on his observation that almost everyone who was dying or getting severely ill was not up to date on vaccination and had not been given the opportunity to take an antiviral It s not clear why Califf felt the need to promote the use of Paxlovid given the U S government had already committed to purchasing 10 million treatment courses at a cost of 5 29

COVID 19 By May 2022 76 of U S adults were vaccinated and an estimated 58 already had COVID 19 An observational study from Israel supported Califf s proposition that Paxlovid could reduce hospitalizations and deaths among high risk patients aged 65 and over but these types of studies have major limitations making it difficult to draw causal inferences Pfizer did actually commence a randomized clinical trial of Paxlovid in vaccinated people at lower risk of COVID 19 This represented the best opportunity to obtain high quality evidence rather than relying on confounded observational data However Pfizer abandoned the trial in December 2022 due to a very low rate of hospitalization or death observed in the standard risk patient population Jessica Adams an FDA regulatory affairs expert said Something is really wrong with public health leadership that thinks every norm can be thrown out the window in an emergency I wish the heads of our public health agencies could reflect more deeply with the benefit of hindsight It seems to be that Califf somehow doesn t see how off putting it was to watch him promote Paxlovid the way he did said Adams The FDA has learned nothing during the pandemic and is setting terrible precedents for future emergencies added Adams In fact FDA s own drug advisory committee was requesting further data about which populations would benefit from Paxlovid over others but this did not temper Califf s enthusiasm for promoting the drug Califf boasted on social media that he took Paxlovid after contracting COVID 19 and said the drug could reduce the risk of long covid despite it never being validated by robust trials leading some to criticize him for being a billboard for Pfizer Califf understood his comments

According to CEO Justin Kolbeck his team took cells from a real salmon and experimented with different methods to feed them while maintaining a healthy growing state The process was challenging since little research has been conducted on fish cell culture Instead of creating a genetically modified yeast organism to create leghemoglobin which is this iron tasting substance that they add to plant based ingredients we re actually growing the animal cells themselves Kolbeck said in an interview with Technology Networks We needed to come up with a mix of vitamins and minerals carbohydrates

Wildtype s conclusion that foods comprised of or containing cultured salmon cell material resulting from the production process are as safe as comparable foods produced by other methods Wildtype used a common loophole to win the FDA s approval According to CHD the FDA allowed the company s claims that the additives used don t need further testing because they fall under the agency s Generally Recognized as Safe process However these were originally intended for products whose safety has been established through a substantial history of consumption for food use by a significant number of consumers The GRAS exception was not designed to be used like this products that carry GRAS need to be backed by years of safety data But in this case it s based on the manufacturer s word nothing more Jaydee Hanson policy director for the Center for Food Safety CFS and expert in synthetic biology found this outrageous The FDA is negligent I would say in allowing a company to use the self approved generally recognized as safe method And then the FDA should have developed its own new guidelines for how to test this new food he said What s in lab grown salmon No one knows To make their fake salmon product Wildtype takes cultured cells from a living coho salmon and then cultivates them in custom designed steel vats similar to what is used for making beer or yogurt According to CHD this type of process replicating cultured cells is similar to what Big Pharma does to test drugs In this particular product however experts are expressing concern regarding the lack of transparency during the production and approval process And unlike many Pharma products that undergo clinical trials before being released this salmon skipped nearly all of those layers of scrutiny The cultured cells are fed with a proprietary cell nutrient blend What ingredients are added to this blend is a mystery and is something only the company s team knows The salmon itself is also made from

the food supply At face value fake meat sounds like the perfect solution to end world hunger protect animal welfare and save the planet from environmental destruction But when you look more closely you ll notice that there s a disturbing factor about this trend and it all boils down to the desire to control our food supply Globalists are working to replace animal husbandry with lab grown meat By allowing patented fake meat products to saturate the market private companies will effectively control the entire food supply and ultimately people s health Marketing claims say that lab grown meats are saving the planet when in fact they are jeopardizing the environment Manufacturers claim that lab grown meats are more environmentally friendly than typical meat production which requires land water and fossil fuels However researchers from the University of California Davis studied this closely and assessed that the energy needed and greenhouse gases emitted by lab grown meat has a global warming potential that is four to 25 times greater than for beef Regenerative farmer Will Harris also raises this point in an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience saying We are sequestering 3 5 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent for every pound of grass fed beef we sell Ironically the same environmental engineers did an analysis on Impossible Burgers They re emitting 3 5 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent Grass fed meats have a lower carbon footprint than lab grown meats The carbon footprint of beef from Harris regenerative farm White Oak Pastures is actually 111 lower than conventional CAFO

article Eating Fake Meat Raises Your Risk of Depression and Inflammation The bottom line is that while fake meat and seafood like Wildtype s lab grown salmon can replicate the appearance texture and flavor of real food there s absolutely no way any of these will be healthier better or even equal to the real thing Protect yourself from unregulated lab grown foods Let s face it no sane person would be willing to be part of an untested food experiment But when government agencies hand over the reins to companies and approve food products without sufficient safety measures in place then you need to take matters into your own hands Here s how to stay ahead of the curve so you ll be able to make informed food choices to protect your health Prioritize whole wild or pasture raised foods If you re unsure where your fish or meat comes from don t buy it Choose wild caught fish like Alaskan salmon or other seafood from trusted small fisheries When it comes to land animals stick to pasture raised

language and tell you exactly how their products are made These are the companies that still respect you as a consumer FAQs about lab grown salmon Q What is lab grown salmon and how is it made A Lab grown salmon is made by culturing fish cells in steel tanks using a proprietary nutrient blend The cells are fed multiplied and placed on plant based scaffolds to mimic the texture and appearance of real salmon without using a whole fish Q Did the FDA independently verify the safety of Wildtype s salmon A No The FDA approved Wildtype s lab grown salmon based solely on the company s internal safety data There were no independent studies animal trials or public reviews conducted before granting approval Q What concerns have experts raised about this approval process A Experts are alarmed that the product was approved through the GRAS loophole which relies on the manufacturer s word There s also no transparency about the ingredients used to feed the cells color the fish or prevent bacterial contamination Q Is lab grown salmon better for the environment than traditional seafood A Despite marketing claims a University of California Davis study found lab grown meat has a global warming potential four to 25 times higher than beef Regenerative farms by contrast often reduce net carbon emissions Q How can I avoid unregulated lab grown foods A Choose whole wild caught seafood

disruption of the genome or it could disrupt other genes that are related to cancer The FDA did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the study Do you have a news tip We want to hear from

injections despite nine studies by internationally known research teams All teams concluded that this contamination poses an unacceptable risk to three quarters of the world s population Three teams so far have demonstrated the integration into human cells To what extent this is happening to everybody who was injected needs to be investigated McKernan said that the FDA has long ignored evidence of the dangers posed by mRNA COVID 19 vaccines The criteria for pulling these shots was established long before DNA contamination was first discovered he said I would hope that evidence of highly

According to Demasi The FDA is expected to comment on the findings this week However the agency has yet to issue a public alert recall the affected batches or explain how vials exceeding safety standards were allowed to reach the market Plothe noted that Demasi presented evidence of DNA contamination to the FDA in September 2024 asking if the agency had launched an investigation or requested further testing of the mRNA vaccines by their manufacturers Nothing resulted from this request Plothe said As nine studies have proven this severe contamination and repeated requests to health

s food U S Secretary of Health and Human Services HHS Robert F Kennedy Jr said in a statement We re taking decisive action and using every authority we have to clean up the food supply and protect

MAHA Moms movement applauded the new initiative calling it a long overdue and necessary step in the right direction The announcement signals progress toward more transparency and accountability and I m hopeful this opens the door for deeper systemic reform Mackintosh said Food safety advocates have long argued that the FDA s procedures for regulating food safety including chemicals in the food supply have been lacking That s partly because food manufacturers were allowed to self certify the safety of many ingredients under the Generally Recognized as Safe GRAS certification process Industry influence over GRAS determinations has been a major concern for decades and any progress must directly address that Mackintosh said The GRAS loophole allowed food manufacturers to self certify safety without FDA review or public disclosure There has been little to no post market surveillance of chemicals once approved For instance the FDA granted GRAS certification to BHA and BHT in 1958 and 1959

Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency is prioritizing its resources and leveraging gold standard science to create for the first time a systematic post market review program that consumers can trust and rely on Only by improving the safety and transparency of the food supply and ensuring consumers can make healthful food choices will we overcome the long standing trajectory of chronic diseases Makary said The announcement also noted that earlier this year the FDA initiated a rulemaking procedure to eliminate the GRAS loophole allowing companies to self certify their products A focus on the chronic disease epidemic in the U S is part of Kennedy s Make America Healthy Again MAHA agenda The epidemic which includes rising rates of cancer diabetes obesity and other conditions has been attributed in part to toxic chemicals and other harmful ingredients in the domestic food supply Food safety advocates welcomed the news Zen Honeycutt founding executive director of Moms Across America and the Neighborhood Food Network said We finally have an administration that is listening to mothers and acting to Make America Healthy Again While we wish to see pre market policy changes so that the chemicals do not get into the food in the first place we understand that smaller steps need to be taken first to create huge change New process part of a larger initiative to improve food chemical oversight According to the FDA the agency s new post market review process is part of a larger initiative to improve food chemical oversight This has included a series of actions

Insider to save this article Sign Up Clinical trials funded by the U S government and the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation are set to begin for a self amplifying mRNA vaccine targeting the H5N1 bird flu virus Arcturus Therapeutics announced earlier this week that the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA issued a Study Can Proceed notification for its investigational ARCT 2304 vaccine candidate Epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher told The Defender the FDA s notification means Arcturus Therapeutics can begin its experiment of injecting humans with H5N1 bird flu replicon mRNA Self amplifying mRNA injections contain an enzyme that instructs the body on how to make more mRNA Arcturus says the vaccine is formulated within a lipid nanoparticle and is designed to make many copies of mRNA within the host cell This enables lower doses than conventional mRNA vaccines Hulscher said the replication machinery of self amplifying vaccines behaves like a synthetic virus and allows for an unknown period of toxic antigen production Writing on Substack immunologist and biochemist Jessica Rose Ph D said the new vaccine has major red flags She told The Defender Self amplifying mRNA products should not be used This is an absolute disaster waiting to happen According to Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist at Children s Health Defense Arcturus self replication platform has all the hazards of the other synthetic modified mRNA wrapped in a lipid nanoparticle just much worse With self replication it can become immortal forever antagonizing your or your fetus immune system with antigens Christof Plothe D O a member of the World Council for Health steering committee questioned the introduction of self amplifying mRNA vaccines amid ongoing safety concerns about conventional mRNA shots He told The Defender The self replicating technology takes the mRNA vaccines to a new level The vaccine contains the gene for the spike protein and the gene for a protein called replicase which allows the RNA to replicate After the rollout of the first global genetic experiment with mRNA technology it seems unbelievable that an even more aggressive attack on our body and genetics should be tried

excluded from enrollment Despite Japan s recent inclusion of a self amplifying COVID 19 vaccine among the routine vaccines it offers to older adults during this year s cold and flu season Hulscher

Injected participants experienced a 90 adverse event rate 74 5 systemic 15 2 required medical attention after the first dose in study phases 1 2 and 3a combined Hulscher said Hulscher said Arcturus claims that vaccines using self amplifying mRNA technology create the impression that those vaccines will be safer He argued that this would not be the case Because they self replicate for an unknown period of time a small dose of a replicon mRNA is expected to be more hazardous than a larger dose of conventional mRNA Hulscher said According to Jablonowski The difference between medicine and poison is dose and you cannot dose the mRNA vaccines Arcturus promotes smaller doses as a feature but the reality is that we have never been able to measure the antigen exposure from an mRNA vaccine Even if we had a theory of how many protein antigens were produced per mRNA strand we would never know how many times the mRNA self replicated Jablonowski said other risks of self amplifying vaccines

severe illness was not defined as hospitalization but as one of three clinical findings a respiratory rate 30 oxygen saturation less than 94 or a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen 300 These clinical findings are indicative of significant respiratory compromise but do not necessarily constitute a need for hospitalization The key points here are Vaccine effectiveness began to wane very early after the second booster four weeks with regard to infection and seven weeks with regard to severe illness Severe illness as defined in the study was different from the committee s consensus position on what constituted a measurable outcome to determine efficacy hospitalization Rapidly emerging variants do we need new vaccines Prior to the reports from the Israeli researchers Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC employee Heather Scobie Ph D MPH presented the CDC s information on emergent SARS CoV 2 strains in the U S The above plot demonstrates the rapid emergence over time of variant strains in the U S As of the beginning of 2022 the Omicron variant is responsible for the overwhelming majority of cases hospitalizations and deaths in this country This makes the strategy of continued boosting with a vaccine formulation designed to protect against the original Wuhan strain questionable One advantage of using mRNA based vaccines is that new formulations can be rapidly developed However even if a new variant is identified it still takes months to manufacture test and deploy Robert Johnson deputy assistant secretary at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority who presented during the meeting said If you re not on your way to that clinical trial by the beginning of May it s going to be very

FDA has no idea what it wants nor what it will do regarding planning for new versions of boosters None of its speakers are willing to venture a guess as to what will be needed Of course all are scared that they will recommend some variant that will have disappeared before the vaccine rollout Dr Cody Meissner a VRBPAC committee member and chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Tufts University asked what was perhaps the most obvious question regarding the emergence of variants Why are we seeing so many His question was not answered There was no discussion of the theory that introducing highly specific leaky those that do not prevent infection or transmission vaccines in the midst of a global pandemic will necessarily result in resistant strains Geert Vanden Bossche DVM warned authorities of this inevitability last year Public vaccine injured weigh in The committee heard 21 separate three minute presentations from members of the public These included Jessica Rose Ph D who expressed her dismay that at least one of the committee s temporary voting members had a financial conflict of interest Statistician Mathew Crawford who unequivocally stated there is no transparent data that demonstrate any efficacy of the experimental COVID 19 vaccines by offering numerous examples of bias and improper analyses in trial data and subsequent studies He also reminded members of clear safety signals coming from the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database David Wiseman Ph D presented a flurry of data from the CDC Israel and elsewhere demonstrating rapidly declining vaccine efficacy and increased all cause mortality in the vaccinated He raised additional questions about the evidence of reverse transcription of vaccine mRNA and the persistence of spike protein in the

takeaways An extended discussion period followed the last scheduled presentation Temporary committee member and chair of the meeting Dr Arnold Monto sought to establish a consensus position on how to proceed In summary Many members and presenters agreed that antibody levels are not a valid measure of immunity i e a correlate of protection Thus the only way to determine vaccine effectiveness is through a clinical trial There is not really time to do a clinical trial to pick a strain or strains by June to make a vaccine that would target said strains available for the fall Dr Peter Marks director of the FDA s vaccine division Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research admitted the fourth booster dose approved last week was a stopgap measure in other words a temporary measure to be implemented until a proper solution may be found in the future Despite the equivocal findings from Israel claims were repeatedly made that the present vaccine still protects against severe outcomes and death but FDA s lead scientist for this presentation Doran Fink admitted efficacy is also waning for severe outcomes No data was presented at all regarding strain choice prediction of what to use

doctors sued the FDA over its anti ivermectin social media posts during the COVID 19 pandemic admitted the FDA s war against ivermectin was a mistake and an abuse of governmental authority according to an investigation by Project Veritas The nonprofit which focuses on exposing corruption through undercover video on Aug 27 released footage of U S Department of Justice DOJ attorney Isaac Belfer telling an undercover Project Veritas journalist that what the FDA did was unquestionably beyond its authority Although Belfer defended the FDA s actions in court he told the Project Veritas journalist that there was a legitimate problem with the agency s actions If you remember during the pandemic Belfer said FDA issued some tweets that said You are not a horse You are not a cow Stop it with ivermectin They ll often use tweets to pursue a broader agenda In this instance the tweets were part of a larger agenda of discouraging people from using ivermectin a drug the FDA approved in 1996 for treating several diseases to treat COVID 19 But the FDA really shouldn t be saying Don t take this drug Belfer said because the FDA as a federal agency can do only what it has statutory authorization from Congress to do The FDA is authorized to provide information about drugs but it cannot recommend what drugs to take or not take That s the practice of medicine and the FDA can t practice medicine Belfer said Kim Mack Rosenberg general counsel for Children s Health Defense told The Defender Belfer s recent admissions underscore an immense tragedy during COVID 19 She added The bottom line here that people need to understand is we may never know how many people died because of FDA s actions Ivermectin was an effective treatment in many cases for COVID 19 yet patients were deprived of the treatment far too often Patients for whom ivermectin may have been an appropriate course of treatment did not have access to ivermectin because their doctors were misled by the FDA or did not understand the potential merits of prescribing ivermectin or were unable to obtain ivermectin prescriptions for their patients even when they wanted to prescribe the medication We can and

recommendations Doctors involved in the lawsuit told Project Veritas they suspected that the FDA s suppression campaign against ivermectin was motivated by the government s interest in promoting a speedy rollout of COVID 19 vaccines The FDA could grant the vaccines emergency use authorization only if no alternative medications existed to treat COVID 19 Not unreasonable to think that there have been a million unnecessary deaths In June 2022 after the FDA issued its social posts discouraging the use of ivermectin to treat COVID 19 three doctors Robert Apter Mary Talley Bowden and Paul E Marik co founder of the Front Line Critical Care Alliance sued the FDA They alleged the FDA s guidance on ivermectin interfered with the doctor patient relationship and their ability to prescribe an approved medication Attempts by the FDA to influence or intervene in the doctor patient relationship amount to interference with the practice of medicine the regulation of which is and always has been reserved to states the complaint stated The complaint pointed out that in addition to producing numerous social media posts aimed at discouraging ivermectin use the FDA also published a website entitled Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID 19 Additionally an FDA FAQ answered no to the frequently asked question Should I take ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID 19 Belfer was initially one of the lawyers representing the FDA in the suit After U S District Judge Jeffrey Brown in December 2022 dismissed the lawsuit another team of lawyers took over representing the FDA when the case came before the 5th Circuit U S Court of Appeals according to Project Veritas In September 2023 the 5th Circuit overturned the lower court s dismissal ruling that the FDA exceeded its authority under federal law when it advised the public against using ivermectin In March the FDA agreed to take down its website and social media posts warning people not to use

Ivermectin and COVID 19 reads The FDA has not authorized or approved ivermectin for use in preventing or treating COVID 19 in humans or animals The FDA has determined that currently available clinical trial data do not demonstrate that ivermectin is effective against COVID 19 in humans The website says the agency has received multiple reports of patients who have required medical attention including hospitalization after self medicating with ivermectin intended for animals Project Veritas pointed out that since major state and national medical governing authorities look to the FDA as an authoritative source on the appropriate use of drugs pharmacies still refuse to prescribe ivermectin and doctors face professional repercussions for prescribing it Mack Rosenberg agreed Many doctors have been vilified censured and subject to loss of licensure and loss of livelihood based on recommending and prescribing ivermectin to treat COVID 19 For example the American Board of Internal Medicine this month revoked the certifications of Drs Pierre Kory and Marik following a two year investigation into their promotion of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as treatments for COVID 19 and their statements questioning the safety and efficacy of COVID 19 vaccines Meanwhile countless U S citizens suffered as a result of the FDA s demotion of ivermectin said Apter He told Project Veritas It s not unreasonable to think that there have been a million unnecessary deaths from COVID in the United States because of the public health agency suppression of effective early treatment with

but the U S Food and Drug Administration doesn t want us to learn the truth You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up On July 28 the Wall Street Journal ran our article Why Is the FDA Attacking a Safe Effective Drug In it we outlined the potential value of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin for COVID 19 and we questioned the U S Food and Drug Administration s FDA vigorous attack on ivermectin Many people praised us and many criticized us We had clearly covered a sensitive subject It didn t help that one of the studies we referenced was retracted shortly before we submitted our article Within hours of learning that fact we sent a mea culpa to the Journal s editors They acted quickly adding a note at the end of the electronic version and publishing our letter It s important to address two criticisms of our work The first is that we exaggerated the FDA s warning on ivermectin The second is that Merck s stance on ivermectin proved that even the company that developed ivermectin thought that it doesn t work for COVID 19 First we didn t exaggerate the FDA s warning on ivermectin Instead the agency changed its website after our article was published probably to reflect the points we made Second Merck had two incentives to downplay ivermectin s usefulness against the novel coronavirus We ll explain both points more fully Ivermectin was developed and marketed by Merck Co while one of us Hooper worked there years ago Dr William C Campbell and Professor Satoshi Omura were awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine They earned it for discovering and developing avermectin Later Campbell and some associates modified avermectin to create ivermectin Merck Co has donated four billion doses of ivermectin to prevent river blindness and other

hands frequently and avoid crowds Was this based on the kinds of double blind studies that the FDA requires for drug approvals No After some critics claimed that we overstated or overreacted to the FDA s special warning we reviewed the FDA s website and found that it had been changed and there was no mention of the changes nor any reason given Overall the warnings were watered down and clarified We noticed the following changes The false statement that Ivermectin is not an anti viral a drug for treating viruses was removed Taking a drug for an unapproved use can be very dangerous This is true of ivermectin too was changed to the less alarming Ivermectin has not been shown to be safe or effective for these indications Indications is the official term used in the industry to denote new uses for a drug such as new diseases or conditions and or new patient populations The statement If you have a prescription for ivermectin for an FDA approved use get it from a legitimate source and take it

the end The new warning from the FDA is more correct and less alarming than the previous one In a statement from February Merck the company that originated and still sells ivermectin agreed with the FDA that ivermectin should not be used for COVID 19 We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency approved prescribing information To some this appeared to be a smoking gun Merck wants to make money they reason and people are interested in using ivermectin for COVID 19 therefore Merck would warn against such usage only if the scientific evidence were overwhelming But that s not how the pharmaceutical industry works Here s how the FDA regulated pharmaceutical industry really works The FDA judges all drugs as guilty until proven to the FDA s satisfaction both safe and efficacious By what process does this happen The FDA waits for a deep pocketed sponsor to present a comprehensive package that justifies the approval of a new drug or a new use of an existing drug For a drug like ivermectin long since generic a sponsor may never show up The reason is not that the drug is ineffective rather the reason is that any expenditures used to secure approval for that new use will help other generic manufacturers that haven t invested a dime Due to generic drug substitution rules at pharmacies Merck could spend millions of dollars to get a COVID 19 indication for ivermectin and then effectively get zero return What company would ever make that investment With no sponsor

sponsor never shows up and the boxes aren t checked off the FDA s standard approach is to tell Americans to stay away from the drug because it might be dangerous or ineffective Sometimes the FDA is too enthusiastic and these warnings are frankly alarming Guilty until proven innocent There are two reasons that Merck would warn against ivermectin usage essentially throwing its own drug under the bus Once they are marketed doctors can prescribe drugs for uses not specifically approved by the FDA Such usage is called off label Using ivermectin for COVID 19 is considered off label because that use is not specifically listed on ivermectin s FDA approved label While off label prescribing is widespread and completely legal it is illegal for a pharmaceutical company to promote that use Doctors can use drugs for off label uses and drug companies can supply them with product But heaven forbid that companies encourage support or promote off label prescribing The fines for doing so are outrageous During a particularly vigorous two year period the U S Department of Justice collected more than 6 billion from drug companies for off label promotion cases Merck s lawyers haven t forgotten that lesson Another reason for Merck to discount ivermectin s efficacy is a result of marketing strategy Ivermectin is an old cheap off patent drug Merck will never make much money from ivermectin sales Drug companies aren t looking to spruce up last year s winners they want new winners with long patent lives Not coincidentally Merck recently released the clinical results for its new COVID 19 fighter molnupiravir which has shown a 50 reduction in the risk of hospitalization and death among high risk unvaccinated adults Analysts are predicting multi billion dollar sales for molnupiravir While we can all be happy that Merck has developed a new therapeutic that can keep us safe from the ravages of COVID 19 we should realize that the FDA s rules give companies an incentive to focus on newer drugs while ignoring older ones Ivermectin may or may not be a miracle drug for COVID 19 The FDA doesn t want us to learn the truth The FDA spreads lies and alarms Americans while

health officials under the Biden administration failed to warn the public of the myocarditis risk associated with COVID 19 vaccines and actively downplayed that risk according to a U S Senate report released today The report issued by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations reveals previously redacted information from government records recently obtained by subpoena and by earlier requests

Federal Health Agencies How Health Officials Downplayed and Hid Myocarditis and Other Adverse Events Associated with the COVID 19 Vaccines Sen Ron Johnson R Wis the subcommittee chair wrote in the report s executive summary that the records reveal three facts U S health officials knew about the risks of myocarditis Those officials downplayed the health concern and U S health agencies delayed informing the public about the risk of the adverse event In addition to the report Johnson today also released the more than 2 400 pages of documents obtained by his subpoena to HHS Sadly this report confirms what we have long suspected and proven said Children s Health Defense CHD CEO Mary Holland It underscores the aberrant science and extreme cover ups that were endemic during the COVID era Holland cited a peer reviewed study published in October 2022 by CHD Senior Research Scientist Karl Jablonowski and CHD Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker showing that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC knew there was a safety signal for myocarditis more than three months before warning the public The study documented that as early as Feb 19 2021 the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS co managed by the CDC and the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA showed a strong statistically significant vaccine adverse event signal for myocarditis in males 8 21 years of age Yet the CDC waited until late May 2021 to alert the public According to the report released today the CDC first warned the public on May 28 2021 by posting an online clinical considerations note

extreme irresponsibility toward the American public Commenting on the new report Hooker said It is so encouraging that Sen Johnson is bringing this entire cover up regarding COVID 19 vaccine induced myocarditis to light He added The corrupt CDC and FDA officials who stonewalled the truth need to be held to account for the huge increases in cardiac issues seen especially among young adult males Report reveals records that should have been provided years ago The subcommittee called the new report an interim report because the HHS is still in the process of handing over documents subpoenaed by Johnson In late January Johnson subpoenaed HHS for COVID vaccine safety records after writing more than 70 congressional oversight letters to HHS officials and its health agencies during the Biden administration In the letters Johnson requested information on COVID 19 vaccine adverse events and related communications Biden HHS officials either completely ignored or inadequately addressed the requests according to the report Now the report states under a new administration and a new HHS secretary HHS is beginning to produce records pursuant to the chairman s subpoena that should have been provided years ago without redactions to Congress and the public A spokesperson for the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations told reporters that the report builds on the work of many journalists

officials also failed to take further steps to account for cases of underreporting in VAERS Although reports in VAERS require verification before they can be confirmed as vaccine related injuries or

Marks expressed concern about alerting the public to the risk of myocarditis from COVID 19 vaccines On May 27 2021 Marks then director of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research emailed Dr Rochelle Walensky then director of the CDC and copied Dr Janet Woodcock a former FDA official In the email Marks appeared unaware or ignorant of the VAERS signal mentioned in the May 24 2021 CDC

Health Defense CHD California Chapter s request for a preliminary injunction to block a California law that would have allowed the state s medical boards to punish doctors for spreading COVID 19 misinformation In his 30 page opinion Senior U S District Judge William Shubb determined the defendants in the case California Gov Gavin Newsom Attorney General Rob Bonta and California Medical and Osteopathic Boards provided no evidence that scientific consensus has any established technical meaning and that the law provides no clarity on the meaning of the word misinformation Judge Shubb also found the plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the grounds of their Fourteenth Amendment vagueness challenges The ruling pertains to a lawsuit filed Dec 1 2022 in the U S District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of plaintiffs CHD California Chapter Dr LeTrinh Hoang and Physicians for Informed Consent The lawsuit was filed after Newsom on Sept 30 2022 signed California Assembly Bill 2098 AB 2098 which was set to take effect Jan 1 AB 2098 bars doctors from providing treatment or advice to a patient related to COVID 19 when that treatment or advice includes 1 false information 2 that is contradicted by contemporary scientific consensus 3 contrary to the standard of care If a doctor goes against this ill defined consensus the doctor is guilty of unprofessional conduct and can face disciplinary action Judge Shubb s ruling prevents enforcement of AB 2098 pending resolution of the lawsuit According to lead counsel Rick Jaffe Judge Shubb looked at the law and correctly determined that the COVID misinformation was unconstitutionally vague in large part because the plaintiffs in both cases showed there is no current scientific consensus given the fast changing pace of the pandemic The case will now proceed on two tracks Jaffe said adding The parties will continue to litigate the case before Judge Shubb and we will be filing a motion for summary judgment in the not too distant future But because we won and because a judge in the Central District of California denied a similar challenge to AB 2098 the attorney general will certainly

scientific consensus and accordingly what is prohibited by the law Judge Shubb s ruling technically is limited only to the plaintiffs all persons represented by the plaintiffs and members of the organizations that filed the lawsuits Judge AB 2098 operates to inhibit exercise of First Amendment freedoms AB 2098 was introduced in February 2022 by California Assemblymember Evan Low who had previously formed the Vaccine Work Group with six other Democratic lawmakers with the intent of developing legislation promoting COVID 19 vaccines and battling misinformation The bill which garnered the support of the American Medical Association for its efforts to address public health disinformation passed the California Assembly in May 2022 and the California Senate in late August 2022 before Newsom signed it into law CHD California s motion for preliminary injunction included a declaration by Dr Sanjay Verma who highlighted numerous examples of public health authorities walking back recommendations that were previously deemed the consensus view Judge Shubb cited Verma s declaration in his order stating that it explains in detail how the so called consensus has developed and

misdemeanor to produce or sell lab grown meat in the state The law took effect in July Upside Foods which makes cultivated chicken sued Florida in August alleging the ban is unconstitutional and violates two federal laws that preempt Florida from imposing the ban A preliminary injunction is typically issued in a lawsuit if the court finds the plaintiff has a good chance of winning its case a substantial likelihood of success on the merits However Chief U S District Judge Mark Walker said Upside s argument which boiled down to if it s a poultry product states can t ban it was insufficient Just because a product falls within the scope of the federal Poultry Products Inspection Act and is under the U S Department of Agriculture s USDA regulatory authority does not mean a state is expressly preempted from banning the sale of that particular kind of poultry product Walker wrote Upside argued that the ban imposed ingredient and manufacturing requirements that clashed with provisions of the Poultry Products Inspection Act However Walker said Upside was unable to identify any federal law or regulation that created an ingredient requirement for cultivated meat He also said that because the company didn t produce its lab grown meat in Florida the manufacturing ban didn t affect its premises operations or facilities The ruling means the ban will remain in place while

told The Defender that even if it provides environmental benefits Any environmental benefit is greatly outweighed by the possible dangers that these cutting edge products may pose to one s health An investigation by The New York Times revealed several incidents during the development of some of Upside s products that raised safety concerns The company in 2018 found its chicken cell line

started experimenting with growing chemical free soybeans on 45 acres Today the 71 year old oversees the most expansive and profitable area of organic grain production in Iowa and possibly the U S You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Keith Schneider People searching for ways to limit the toll industrialized American agriculture takes on communities land and water may want to make a visit to Clear Creek Acres in northern Iowa With just shy of 800 residents West Bend Iowa is barely a blip on a prairie landscape but it has become home base for an uncommonly large expanse of organically grown crops operations that have found success in challenging the popular convention that pesticides and other agricultural chemicals are needed to feed the world Towering grain bins are surrounded by close to 50 000 acres of corn soybeans oats and other crops grown without the use of synthetic chemicals Farmers fertilize the land with chicken litter and hog manure and weed much of the land by hand or with non chemical tools such as new laser weeders What s occurred here since 1998 when farmer Barry Fehr experimented with raising chemical free soybeans on 45 acres is the development of the most expansive and profitable area of organic grain production in Iowa and possibly the U S Most of the land is farmed by multiple generations of the Fehr family The family also manages about 3 000 organic acres in Colorado Generating millions of dollars annually in a sustainable income the success of the organic operations here in the heart of corn country defies long held conventions about a need for chemicals in farming The agrochemical industry led by Monsanto owner Bayer Syngenta and other global seed and chemical giants maintains that weed killers insecticides and other pesticides are essential to robust food production and that a growing global population requires the use of chemicals in agriculture But 71 year old Dan Fehr who has been farming for more than 50 years says That is debatable The Fehr family farms are nearly matching the yields of crops grown conventionally perhaps seeing only about a 10 yield decline in comparison Fehr said Their costs are lower because they re not buying pesticides and the high priced genetically modified seeds designed to be used with certain weed killing pesticides And the prices they reap are higher because organic crops command premiums in a marketplace where consumer demand for organic foods is climbing About 25 000 acres of the Fehr farms in Iowa generate approximately 40 million a year in crop sales The

Nobody has died of not using pesticides I don t think it will hurt anything not to use pesticides Wave of growth Clear Creek is part of a wave of growth in chemical free agriculture in and around Iowa The number of organic farms in Iowa increased from 467 to 799 from 2011 to 2021 and ranks sixth in the nation for the number of chemical free farms The state is first in organic corn and soybean production according to the U S Department of Agriculture USDA From 2008 to 2016 the amount of U S farmland devoted to the production of organic corn soybeans wheat oats and barley grew by over 20 from 626 000 acres to 765 000 according to the Organic Trade Association the industry s principal trade group Iowa and four other northern Midwest and Great Plains states accounted for 40 of the organic grain trade a portion of the 63 8 billion in organic food sales in 2023 That amounts to 50 more sales than in 2015 according to a Federal Reserve study They are unique in the way they run their operation said Cole Thompson marketing director of Minnesota based Albert Lea Seed the nation s largest organic seed producer Most people in the industry think you can t farm at this scale organically But you can They re proving it While the family s achievements are celebrated in the country s growing organic farm sector not everybody is impressed Critics say the Fehrs practice of tilling their land to control weeds leaves thousands of acres bare making topsoil vulnerable to erosion from wind and rain Tilling also reduces the carbon sequestration potential of the soil say critics of the practice They aren t doing much for this community I ll tell you that said Joe Joyce who farms 2 000 acres here with the use of conventional chemicals It s just jealousy That s all

among all U S states according to a 2024 report issued by the Iowa Cancer Registry Jack Fehr 28 said his family is setting an example for other farmers who fear converting to organic farming takes too long costs too much yields too little and can t be done successfully except on small farms I talk to a lot of farmers said Fehr Their big question is well I don t know if I can make it work Well you can make it work We do And we get a premium for our organic crops two to three times what conventional prices are on average Fehr said Clear Creek buyers pay up to 8 a bushel for organic corn and 22 a bushel for organic soybeans twice the conventional market price High wire act Farming organically is a high wire act balancing the lower cost of supplies against the higher costs of labor Fehr explained that the cost of production at Clear Creek Acres is comparable to the costs of chemical agriculture On the saving side of the ledger are organic seeds that are priced less because they are not treated with chemicals to ward off insects and diseases There is no cost for insecticides herbicides fungicides and chemical fertilizers Clear Creek applies lower cost hog manure to its fields for nutrients And it uses chicken litter that it produces from a big non organic egg laying chicken feeding operation that it owns on the farm The last piece of keeping production costs down for farming operations as big as Clear Creek are economies of scale The farm and its neighbors have fleets of tractors combines trailers and other equipment that they share Those lower costs are offset by the

news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us We have a lot more equipment and our man hours our labor force are higher than with conventional farming said Fehr A big turnoff for the farmer looking to transition to organic is the amount of labor and time it takes I ve been in a tractor in the field farming since February 15 this year I haven t had a day off There s a lot of market space to grow much bigger Due to the increasing demand for organic meat milk and eggs not nearly enough organic grain is produced in the U S Imports of organic grain reached 1 3 million metric tons in 2023 four times more than in 2020 Addressing that scarcity also will produce environmental benefits particularly for water quality There are no toxic chemicals running off the organic fields And research shows that crop rotation and other organic cultivation practices improve the condition of the soil which keeps more nitrogen and phosphorus from draining into surface and groundwater A team of researchers from the USDA and Iowa State University compared runoff from fields where commercial fertilizers were applied to fields and pastures fertilized with manure The researchers found that conventional crop production drained nearly twice as much nitrate into water as organic production The authors of the study concluded that organic farming can improve water quality in Midwestern landscapes The interest in water sampling is keen in the two counties where the Fehrs farm The area west of Emmetsburg Palo Alto County s largest town has the highest number of waterways impaired by farm related contaminants

subfertility infertility the researchers say The study highlights growing concerns about the long term health effects of glyphosate and glyphosate based herbicides GBH such as Roundup Glyphosate use rose sharply in recent decades with around 240 million pounds sprayed annually on U S farms People are exposed to glyphosate through skin contact ingestion in food or water and inhalation of airborne

Microplastics have been found in male testes and female ovaries affecting sperm and follicle health They ve also been found in human placentas raising concerns about potential impacts on fetal

fertility rates worldwide Studies show microplastics have been found in male testes and female ovaries affecting sperm and follicle health Plastics contain xenoestrogens like phthalates and bisphenol A which can disrupt the endocrine system These compounds mimic estrogen leading to estrogen dominance and reproductive issues in both men and women Microplastics have been found in human placentas raising concerns about potential impacts on fetal development and pregnancy outcomes To reduce microplastic exposure I recommend filtering tap water choosing alternative packaging materials using natural fiber clothing and avoiding plastic food containers especially when microwaving The challenge of disposing of plastics is a growing concern today Our overreliance on this manmade material is causing major environmental problems When disposed of improperly plastic breaks down and makes its way into our own bodies in the form of microplastics A 2022 report published in Environment International noted that microplastics had been detected in human blood for the first time By April 2022 it was discovered lodged deep in the lungs of living people Now research highlights more places where microplastics accumulate within our bodies the reproductive organs and this may be contributing to the decline of fertility rates According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 76 of countries and territories around the world will have unsustainable fertility rates by 2050 This means that populations will shrink Microplastics can affect male fertility In Dr Kevin Pho s podcast Dr Oluyemisi Famuyiwa founder of the Montgomery Fertility Center in Rockville Maryland discusses how microplastics contribute to the declining fertility rates observed all over the world From Famuyiwa s research and medical practice she noticed a steady decline in semen quality and that men nowadays are less fertile than their grandfathers Again she suggests that microplastics may be the culprit Famuyiwa s viewpoint is supported by other research too In a study published in Frontiers in Endocrinology the researchers hypothesized It is noteworthy that an exponential rise in global plastic production coincides with a well documented population wide decline in human sperm production which appears to be accelerating since 2000 Going deeper into their research the authors noted that microplastic exposure contributes to lower sperm quantity and quality They cited animal test models which discovered that microplastics accumulated within the testes From there they noted that microplastics caused localized oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and over expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the testis Other reproductive issues were also observed such as

study published in Toxicological Sciences which investigated the prevalence of microplastics in male reproductive organs From a total of 47 canine and 23 human male participants they discovered 12 types of microplastics in all testes The mean total amount of microplastics was 122 63 micrograms per gram in dogs and 328 44 micrograms per gram in humans Polyethylene was the most prevalent microplastic type They went on to conclude These findings highlight the pervasive presence of microplastics in the male reproductive system in both canine and human testes with potential consequences on male fertility Female fertility isn t spared by microplastics Unsurprisingly microplastics can affect adult female fertility as well According to collated research from animal test models in the Frontiers in Endocrinology study microplastics that accumulate in the ovaries can lead to pregnancy related issues Ovaries of these exposed rodents have reduced weight decreased expression of cytoskeletal proteins and demonstrate altered follicle dynamics with a reduction in the number of growing and mature follicles and increased atretic and cystic follicles For context follicles play a crucial role in influencing fertility According to the London Women s Clinic follicles are small fluid filled sacs inside the ovaries that secrete hormones that control the menstrual cycle Hundreds of thousands of follicles are found in the ovaries and this number starts to decline by the age of 35 Each follicle typically releases an egg The Frontiers in Endocrinology study noted that accumulated microplastics in ovaries resulted in oxidative stress as well as disturbed antioxidant capacity Proinflammatory signaling was also observed Another research group found microplastics in the placenta Considered a landmark study by Famuyiwa the research published in Environment International noted that it s possible for microplastics to end up in the placenta potentially affecting the future health of the fetus The researchers collected six human placentas from consenting mothers and used Raman Microspectroscopy a special method to assess the chemical compositions of live organisms to evaluate the prevalence of microplastics Microplastics were found in all parts of the placenta including the fetal maternal and chorioamniotic membrane sections While the effects haven t been fully explored

during and after implantation functions of atypical chemokine receptors governing maternal fetal communication signaling between the embryo and the uterus and trafficking of uterine dendritic cells natural killer cells T cells and macrophages during normal pregnancy All these effects may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction Xenoestrogens in plastics the source of infertility There s also another important point brought up in the Environment International study I would like to emphasize the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds in microplastics The researchers noted that these endocrine disruptors could cause long term effects on human health And as you can imagine one affected area is fertility Microplastics often contain phthalates which can leach out of the material causing endocrine disrupting effects What s more phthalates are not the only endocrine disrupting substance present in microplastics Others include bisphenol A BPA flame retardants pesticides and per and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals PFAS so called forever chemicals This hypothesis is further supported in an evidence review conducted for the California State Legislature in 2023 which noted that exposure to microplastics is suspected to adversely impact sperm quality and testicular health in humans based on high quality of the body of evidence Another point I would like to emphasize is that plastics are xenoestrogens that can mimic the effects of estrogen on the body Most of their danger stems from the stimulation of your estrogen receptors Phthalates for example have estrogenic properties and have been implicated in other diseases as well As noted in a study published in Healthcare Human epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between phthalates exposures and adverse reproductive outcomes in both women and men for instance Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance overweight obesity allergy and asthma The reason for this is the abnormal stimulation of estrogen receptors which promotes cell proliferation and can contribute to the development and progression of estrogen sensitive cancers such as breast cancer and endometrial cancer Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us How to reduce your exposure to microplastics Preventing or at the very least minimizing your exposure to

as breast cancer and endometrial cancer Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us How to reduce your exposure to microplastics Preventing or at the very least minimizing your exposure to microplastics is your first line of defense against estrogen overload While that s easy to say it will require effort to implement considering plastics are all around you in your food water clothing home personal care items and even in household dust Educating yourself about different plastic sources and being conscious of them can go a long way to protecting your and your family s health Here are practical strategies to get you started Filter your tap water and avoid water bottled in plastic If you need to buy bottled water opt for glass bottles Also make sure the filter you use to purify your tap water can filter out microplastics Boil hard tap water If you have hard tap water consider boiling it before using it for cooking or drinking as hard water traps more microplastics Recent research shows boiling hard tap water for five minutes removes up to 90 of the microplastics in the water Avoid plastic packaging Opt for products packaged in glass metal or paper instead of plastic This can significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste that potentially breaks down into microplastics At home use wax paper parchment paper or paper bags to store foods rather than plastic wrap Use reusable containers Replace single use plastic bottles cups and containers with reusable alternatives made from safer materials like stainless steel or glass Never microwave plastics Heat can cause plastics to leach chemicals into food Use glass or ceramic containers for microwaving Avoid plastic cutting boards Use a wooden or glass cutting board instead Opt for natural fibers Whenever possible choose clothing and other textile products made from natural fibers like cotton wool and linen as synthetic fabrics such as polyester shed microfibers and leach xenoestrogens Wash synthetic clothes less frequently When washing synthetic textiles use a microfiber filter in your washing machine to trap synthetic fibers and prevent them from entering the water system Opt for food grade cosmetics and personal care products Some cosmetics toothpaste and personal care products contain microbeads or other plastic particles Look for products free of these materials Ideally opt for all natural food grade products In addition to these strategies there are other ways you can reduce your exposure to microplastics For example you can bring reusable shopping bags when buying groceries and bring your own glass containers when taking home leftovers Avoid processed food as well as they re typically wrapped or sealed in plastic Choose fresh whole produce instead Originally

chemicals enter the bloodstream they re hard to get rid of But new studies involving humans and mice show fiber found in everyday foods can trap the toxins in your gut interrupt their reabsorption and allow your body to eliminate them You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Story at a glance A specific type of fiber called beta glucan found in oats and barley was shown to reduce levels of harmful per and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS chemicals in the blood within just four weeks Participants who consumed beta glucan experienced significant drops in legacy PFAS compounds like perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid PFOS which are linked to cancer and hormone disruption The fiber group was the only one to show a meaningful reduction in the seven most high risk PFAS chemicals identified by the National Academies of Sciences including those that raise your risk for thyroid disease cancer and ulcerative colitis In a follow up study using mice animals exposed to high PFAS levels but fed beta glucan had lower blood PFAS improved fat metabolism and less liver stress compared to controls The key to beta glucan s effect is its gel forming action in your gut which traps PFAS and interrupts their reabsorption cycle allowing your body to eliminate them through stool Most people have no idea they re carrying around a hidden chemical load that their bodies weren t designed to handle But the reality is we re living in a world saturated with PFAS These synthetic compounds are engineered to resist heat water and oil and they don t just stay on the surface Once these substances enter your bloodstream they re incredibly hard to get rid of That s why researchers are searching for real practical solutions Many believe that detoxing PFAS is a lost cause that once they re in your body they re in for good But new evidence suggests otherwise It turns out your gut not your liver or kidneys is one key to turning this around And the solution doesn t involve harsh protocols or extreme diets It starts with something as simple as how you digest your food and whether the right kind of fiber is present to help carry these chemicals out If you ve ever wondered why you re dealing with persistent fatigue inflammation hormone problems or chronic digestive issues PFAS could be part of the story These chemicals hijack your system

enrolled in a trial testing oat beta glucan s effects on cholesterol Beta glucans are a type of soluble fiber found in oats and barley that form a gel like substance in your gut helping to trap and remove compounds like bile acids and as this study explored PFAS as well PFAS chemicals also known as forever chemicals are notoriously hard to remove from the body so the researchers wanted to know could a fiber intervention make a dent Participants received either a fiber rich supplement or a placebo for four weeks All participants followed the original protocol consuming either an oat beta glucan drink 1 gram g of beta glucan and 1 9 g total fiber per serving three times daily or a brown rice drink with no active fiber Blood samples were collected at baseline and after four weeks to measure 17 different PFAS types PFAS levels dropped significantly but only in the fiber group for legacy PFAS While short chain PFAS decreased in both groups likely due to their shorter half lives the study found that only the group consuming beta glucan showed significant reductions in long chain PFAS known to persist for years in the body These included perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonate PFOS two of the most studied PFAS compounds both associated with increased cancer and hormone disruption risks PFAS reductions occurred even in men with exposure levels typical of the general population Researchers noted that all participants had detectable PFAS levels at the start of the study The levels of certain PFAS were higher than previously reported in Canadian populations suggesting rising background exposure Despite this the beta glucan intervention still reduced PFAS levels showing promise even for people without known occupational or high dose environmental exposure Only the fiber group saw a drop in the most concerning types of PFAS These specific PFAS identified by the U S National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine are known to increase the risk for serious health issues like thyroid disease kidney problems ulcerative colitis and certain cancers If your blood level of these seven PFAS reaches just 2 nanograms per

during pregnancy and breast cancer risk At 20 nanograms per milliliter the recommendations expand to include regular screening for thyroid disease testicular cancer and more In the study only the fiber group had a meaningful reduction in this high risk PFAS group The proposed mechanism is the fiber s ability to trap PFAS in your digestive tract Researchers believe the gel forming fiber worked because PFAS share biochemical properties with bile acids compounds already known to bind to beta glucan and get flushed out in feces PFAS and bile acids are both amphipathic meaning they have both water loving and fat loving parts This allows them to interact with fiber gels and get excreted rather than reabsorbed Most PFAS don t leave your body easily Once excreted into the bile they re typically reabsorbed in your intestine returning to your liver in a loop Beta glucan breaks this cycle by holding PFAS in your gut giving your body a chance to eliminate them through stool rather than cycling them back into your bloodstream Oat beta glucan helped mice eliminate PFAS In a related study published in Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology researchers from Boston University used mice to examine whether oat beta glucan could reduce the body s PFAS load They exposed mice to a mixture of seven PFAS compounds in drinking water while feeding them diets that included either inulin a non gel forming fiber or oat beta glucan a gel forming fiber Despite drinking more contaminated water fiber fed mice had lower PFAS in their blood The mice fed beta glucan consumed more PFAS contaminated water yet ended up with lower blood levels of some of the most harmful PFAS This suggests that the fiber helped block reabsorption of PFAS in the gut In other words even when these mice took in more of the toxic chemicals their bodies were better at flushing them out before they could circulate back into the bloodstream Mice on the fiber diet had better fat metabolism and lower liver fat The beta glucan fed mice showed lower liver triglycerides and reduced fat accumulation in the small intestine and fat tissue overall This matters because PFAS have been linked to metabolic disruption and fatty liver disease These findings suggest that fiber offers a double benefit lowering toxic load while improving fat regulation in the body Fiber fed mice experienced better lipid balance without

issues or unexplained weight gain and you ve already cleaned up your water cookware and household products you could be missing the last piece of the puzzle what s stuck inside your body PFAS aren t just external threats they re internal ones too Once these forever chemicals get in they linger for years unless you take direct steps to push them out Here s where smart gut focused nutrition comes in The right type of fiber at the right time makes a meaningful difference in your toxic load But timing and your gut s condition matter So if you re trying to reduce PFAS levels in your system start here 1 Check your gut health first If you regularly feel bloated after meals go days without a bowel movement or have frequent loose stools your gut likely isn t ready for high fiber foods Don t guess listen to your symptoms These are signs that your microbiome is imbalanced and your gut lining is inflamed or damaged For now avoid complex carbs and stick to simpler ones like fruit and white rice while your gut settles down 2 Avoid fiber and fermentable carbs if your digestion is impaired A damaged gut can t handle even healthy foods Beans leafy greens cruciferous veggies and whole grains all ferment quickly and feed the wrong microbes when your gut is compromised That drives more bloating inflammation and gas In this phase you want fuel that doesn t backfire whole fruit and cooked starches that digest cleanly without fermenting too fast 3 Reintroduce fermentable fibers in small amounts once your gut calms When your bloating stops and your digestion becomes regular that s your green light Start with resistant starches like cooked and cooled white potatoes or green bananas These feed butyrate producing bacteria the kind that protect your gut lining and regulate inflammation Slowly add in garlic leeks and onions Keep portions small and build up as your tolerance improves 4 Eat foods high in beta glucans once your gut is stable Oats and barley contain beta glucan which

source While you work to flush them out don t let more in Use a water filter certified for PFAS Stop storing food in nonstick containers or wrappers Replace your nonstick cookware with stainless steel ceramic or enameled cast iron Skip stain resistant treatments on clothes and furniture PFAS are everywhere but the more you avoid them now the less your body has to fight later FAQs about removing PFAS with fiber Q What are PFAS and why are they dangerous A PFAS are synthetic chemicals used in nonstick cookware food packaging stain resistant fabrics and firefighting foams They build up in your blood liver and fat tissues and don t easily break down Long term exposure has been linked to liver damage hormone disruption cancer immune suppression and infertility Q How do PFAS stay in my body for so long A Once PFAS enter your system usually through contaminated water or food they re reabsorbed in your intestines and recirculated back to your liver in a loop This recycling is what gives PFAS such long half lives many remain in your body for years unless that cycle is broken Q Does fiber really help remove PFAS from my body A Yes Clinical research in humans and animals has shown that gel forming fibers like oat beta glucan bind PFAS in your gut and stop them from being reabsorbed This allows your body to eliminate them through stool reducing your overall PFAS burden over time Q

slain by small stones of truth and scientific analysis In an interview with medical commentator John Campbell Ph D Fenton co author of Fighting Goliath Exposing the flawed science and statistics behind the COVID 19 event said these powerful forces include the U K government and its major institutions such as the Office of National Statistics and American institutions like the Centers for

Fenton Who s Goliath Fenton explained that through hard scientific evidence and personal stories the book documents how the powerful forces represented by Goliath shaped the official narrative He said the communications with some government institutions revealed how bizarre the whole hysteria around COVID was but also how deceptive and corrupt some of those institutions really are COVID hysteria as Fenton and his co author Martin Neil Ph D call it was based on massively exaggerated case and mortality numbers created through flawed definitions easily manipulated data and inaccurate mass testing of healthy people that convinced people the only way out of the pandemic and lockdowns was an injection that was neither safe nor effective according to Fenton He and Campbell admitted that initially they bought into the hysteria Campbell said that in his 27 years as a nurse he had to follow the guidelines and update his teaching accordingly but things do seem to have changed now the trust seems to have gone and many of us have a great feeling of being let down He asked Fenton if he felt comfortable that his academic analysis led to these conclusions We were only looking at the data and what

very rigorous in analyzing the mortality data Neil concluded that most of those excess deaths which were mostly in the elderly resulted from either not following the guidelines including failing to treat bacterial pneumonia or the inappropriate use of ventilators and end of life drugs including midazolam That s why Fenton said he and Neil believe the deaths were caused not by the SARS CoV 2 virus but by the pandemic countermeasures and hospital protocols He said how the numbers were calculated played a large part When it came to COVID 19 vaccination status Fenton said anybody who tested positive within 21 days of their first vaccination was classified as unvaccinated In most cases people who died shortly after vaccination were also classified as unvaccinated But he and Neil found that when you adjusted for those fundamental flaws and systemic biases there was no evidence that the vaccines were effective and safe In almost all of the different age groups you were seeing slightly higher all cause mortality in the vaccinated than unvaccinated groups Fenton said He said he s spoken to young people who had no medical reason to get the shot but did so and that if they had

sparking a heated debate about vaccine safety and necessity The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare Terveyden ja hyvinvoinnin laitos or THL announced plans to begin administering H5N8 bird flu vaccines to select groups as early as next week despite the absence of human infections in the country The unprecedented move comes as global health experts express conflicting views on the threat posed by avian influenza While Finnish officials cite the need for preemptive protection critics argue the vaccination program is premature and potentially dangerous The Finnish announcement comes just two weeks after the European Commission Health Emergency Preparedness and Response HERA program announced the purchase of 665 000 doses of CSL Seqirus H5N8 avian influenza vaccine with an option to acquire another 40 million doses over the next four years HERA has already obtained 111 million doses of GSK s bird flu vaccine Finland s vaccination plan Finland plans to offer the CSL Seqirus

has expanded its reach affecting not only birds but also an increasing number of mammals including cows in the U S In 2023 Finland experienced large scale deaths of wild birds due to bird flu virus infections THL said The virus also spread widely to fur farms causing high morbidity and mortality in animals However the Finnish Food Agency reported that bird flu cases in wild birds have significantly decreased in 2024 compared to the previous year Globally human infections remain rare Since December 2021 only eight cases of bird flu have been reported in humans worldwide according to the World Health Organization In the U S three dairy workers were diagnosed with confirmed infections tied to the recent outbreak among cattle all experiencing mild symptoms according to STAT News Despite the low number of human cases health authorities remain concerned about the virus s potential to mutate and become more transmissible between humans However Dr Peter A McCullough in his Substack pos t on Monday argued that even if the bird flu crossed to humans it would be less dangerous Increased transmissibility of H5N1 has a tradeoff of decreased virulence he wrote He said the alarming statistics on human mortality rates are from long ago cases in Southeast Asia and that such concerns are not appropriate for today s strains Furthermore the U S has never had a fatal human case of bird flu he said A dangerous vaccine for a disease that does not exist Medical freedom advocates and health experts have voiced strong objections to the rapid deployment of the bird flu

vaccination management with the goal of taking crucial steps toward a more resilient and health secure future The EVC is based on the World Health Organization s WHO Global Digital Health Certification Network GDHCN The EU and WHO co launched the GDHCN in June 2023 to promote a global interoperable digital vaccine passport based on the EU s digital health certificate launched during the pandemic Vaccines Today described the GDHCN as a citizen centered method of storing and sharing data rather than a system that relies solely on public health systems Greece was the first European

Fund said The proposed vaccination card reflects an increasing effort to utilize public health tools as a means to concentrate wealth and provide a means to control populations It is very reminiscent of approaches in parts of Europe pre World War II and essentially serves a similar purpose to exclude individuals who do not follow government instructions from society The trial in Europe is an obvious next step after the recent widening of surveillance under the IHR International Health Regulation amendments which greatly increase the likelihood of recurrent lockdowns to enable mandated vaccination as a way to force mass use and profit making from vaccines Dutch attorney Meike Terhorst also criticized the pilot program calling a digital vaccination passport a direct threat to our freedom and also the sovereignty of any state All our powers are handed over to the globalists the group of bankers and investors Terhorst said Catherine Austin Fitts founder and publisher of the Solari Report and former U S assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development said plans for the EVC represent another step toward asserting control of labor and travel with a goal to controlling resources and assets Fitts said The goal is financial control There is no legitimate public health purpose The central bankers are hiding behind a health narrative policies like lockdown are a way to manage inflation and resource demand when monetary policy is highly inflationary Experts also tied the rollout of the EVC to warnings from government and health officials about the next pandemic potentially caused by the bird flu or a still unknown Disease X According to Fitts Many steps are underway to prepare for a bird flu pandemic Chicken is the most significant source of meat protein So

of toxic heavy metals a disturbing finding at a time when wildfires are generally getting worse The paper published on Oct 30 in the journal Environmental Science Technology Letters found that each of the 14 fire suppression products examined contained at least eight of the 10 heavy metals tested for including chromium cadmium lead and arsenic Most of these metals or their derivatives are highly toxic and known to cause a long list of diseases including cancer All have been approved for use by the U S Department of Agriculture Forest Service which did not respond to a request for comment The findings raise questions about the ecological and human health impact of spraying large quantities of these materials over huge tracts of land in the western U S according to study lead author Daniel McCurry an environmental chemist at the University of Southern California McCurry and colleagues became interested in investigating these products chemistry as wildfire severity has increased in recent years and news reports showed these being used widely throughout California and other western states Wildfires have generally become more intense and widespread in recent years and decades an expected outcome of human caused climate change and land management practices A total of just under 8 million acres have burned so far this year in the U S a 24 increase over the 10 year average Research suggests wildfires will get more severe and burn more acres in the coming decades One of the most widely used products Phos Chek contained high levels of chromium at 72 mg L or parts per million and cadmium 14 ppm toxic metals that can cause many health problems including cancer If these levels were found in water they would exceed the U S Environmental Protection Agency s maximum contaminant level by a factor of 730 and 2 900 respectively Phos Chek comes in various colors and formulations and is sprayed out of airplanes to hinder the advance of wildfires one variety comes in a striking orange red color that has been widely photographed One of its primary ingredients is ammonium phosphate a fertilizer which acts to coat foliage in a fire resistant layer The implications of

these metals are toxic to fish amphibians and insects at concentrations well below what is found in these products In the paper the authors calculated that the amount of cadmium transported by 2010 post fire rain in one Southern California drainage known as Arroyo Seco was roughly equivalent to the amount of the metal contained in the reported 216 000 gallons of Phos Chek used to suppress the wildfire in the area Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us According to the U S Department of Agriculture over 440 million gallons of these fire retardants were used on federal state and private land between 2009 and 2021 particularly in the western U S The authors calculate that all this material contained 838 000 pounds or 419 tons of these heavy metals Geologists have known for years that levels of heavy metals in water and soils can increase after wildfires as the blazes are known to aerosolize and move around these elements But it may be that these fire suppressants could help explain some of these spikes something not previously recognized in the scientific literature or by policymakers McCurry said This study demonstrates that there is a new source of metals that can be introduced by firefighting efforts said Julie Korak a researcher who studies water treatment and quality at the University of Colorado Boulder who wasn t involved in the paper The scientists became curious about the subject after a 2016 report highlighted the case of an air tanker base that was storing fire suppressants in central Washington The base was cited by the state

The authors of a study published by the American Chemical Society found that frequently flooded sites are contaminated with higher levels of pesticides which bioaccumulate and lead to higher contamination that can further cascade throughout the ecosystem and affect terrestrial food webs You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up A recent study published by the American Chemical Society analyzes pesticide contamination in riparian soil and plants as a result of flooding from streams in Germany The authors hypothesize and then prove that frequently flooded sites have higher levels of pesticides present due to the pesticides in surface waters contaminating the soil Results show that the plant vegetation in the contaminated soil then takes up the pesticides which bioaccumulate and lead to higher contamination that can further cascade throughout the ecosystem and affect terrestrial food webs O ur study provides evidence from the field that nontarget plant species typical for riparian stream sites receive considerable pesticide exposure via flooding events the authors share This exposure and subsequent bioaccumulation in plants threatens the food web as many riparian plants are a vital food source for insects According to the authors flooding events and their impact on pesticide contamination within soil and plants are rarely investigated This study measur ing 98 pesticides and metabolites in plants and root zone soils sampled at five streams situated in an area in Southwest Germany characterized by intensive agricultural land use highlights the differences in contamination between frequently flooded and rarely flooded areas and the greater impacts on the environment and resident organisms At each of the five streams in the Upper Rhine Valley samples were collected from paired sites with different flooding frequencies Regularly flooded sites are closer to each stream s usual water level while rarely flooded sites are more elevated Samples of the plant vegetation and soil were collected during October 2022 while the water level data utilized was for the year prior to sampling October 2021 to October 2022 The water level data from the Agency for the Environment in Rhineland Palatinate provides data on the frequency of site flooding permitting the authors to calculate the average flooded days per year for each sampling site The

regularly flooded site up to 17 individual pesticides are found in a single plant sample Within the soil from the regularly flooded sites 39 pesticides are detected while the soil from rarely flooded sites shows only 25 pesticides present The average pesticide concentration over all 98 compounds was up to 3 times higher at regularly flooded sites compared to rarely flooded sites in both soil and plants the authors report In just the soil of the regularly flooded sites about 10 times higher average pesticide concentrations are seen than in the soil of the rarely flooded sites Our results suggest a pathway for pesticides via flooding from the aquatic system to the terrestrial soil the authors conclude Nine pesticides are detected at high frequencies in both the soil and plants of the regularly flooded sites including the fungicides cyflufenamid fluopyram metrafenone spiroxamine boscalid and azoxystrobin and the herbicides prosulfocarb flufenacet and pendimethalin Of the nine pesticides the six fungicides are detected more frequently and with higher concentrations in the soil than the three herbicides while the opposite is seen in plant material All of these pesticides are regularly detected in surface waters of the area the authors say which represent a usual contamination profile driven by flooding events Within the plants from the regularly flooded sites pesticide concentrations are more than twice as high as those in rarely flooded sites According to the authors Four out of the nine pesticides cyflufenamid prosulfocarb flufenacet and pendimethalin were generally detected at higher mean concentrations in plant material compared to soil material which highlights bioaccumulation within plant tissue In analyzing the different parts of the plants the

sites present in both plants and root zone soil suggests that flooding is a vector for the aquatic terrestrial transport of contamination in small streams Our study provides evidence from the field that flooding events which may increase due to climate change can transport pesticides to riparian soils and plants with potential cascading effects on terrestrial food webs the authors state Bioaccumulation and biomagnification of pesticides have been documented as a threat to biodiversity As the authors point out e ven low pesticide concentrations at the base of the food web may translate via biomagnification to increased levels at higher trophic levels of the food chain leading to cascading effects They continue by summarizing The transfer of flood driven contaminants from water to land can result in their accumulation in the soil and thus enter the food web via plant absorption potentially triggering bottom up effects at higher trophic levels of the terrestrial food web The authors demonstrate how surface waters which are often polluted with chemicals such as those used in agriculture can transport contamination back into adjacent terrestrial ecosystems One study that followed the extreme flooding of the rivers Elbe and Vltava in August 2002 finds similar results of a 10 fold increase in concentration of pesticides in flooded soil compared to that in

Federalist Society earlier this month DeSantis a longtime critic of Fauci said the preemptive pardon former President Joe Biden granted Fauci last month protects him from federal prosecution but not state prosecution DeSantis comments came as 17 state attorneys general sent a letter to congressional leaders earlier this month inviting Congress to share with state investigators evidence that might implicate Fauci While Biden s preemptive pardon is likely to shield Fauci from federal prosecution it does not preclude state prosecution said attorney Greg Glaser Under the legal principle of dual sovereignty each state retains the authority to pursue its own investigations and prosecutions for violations of its own state law This is supported for example by the Tenth Amendment which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states Glaser said DeSantis said it s very possible new Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier his former chief of staff would seek to prosecute Fauci whom he called the chief henchman of the U S pandemic response according to the Florida Bulldog I think he s of the mindset to look at this to see what the jurisdictional hooks are to see what

Certainly one potential tool at our disposal is the referral of any pertinent findings to state officials As you are aware a pardon by former President Biden does not extend to preclude state level investigations or legal proceedings As state Attorneys General we possess the authority to address violations of state law or breaches of public trust The letter referenced the final report of the U S House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic released in December 2024 According to the letter the report delineated several key areas where Dr Fauci and others engaged in potential wrongdoing or misconduct These areas included a possible cover up of COVID 19 s origins failures in the oversight of National Institutes of Health NIH grants that funded gain of function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China and Fauci s pandemic policies which contributed to a profound erosion of public trust in health institutions The lab leak theory of COVID 19 s origin suggests that the virus escaped from the Wuhan laboratory According to the letter Fauci also suppressed key information about the potential health risks and adverse events of the COVID 19 vaccines It stated Dr Fauci led a deliberate campaign to stifle the voices of premier health scholars regarding the lack of adequate testing of vaccines This subsequently siloed crucial information from the public that may have led to more public awareness concerning the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis among young adult males the verified increased risk of blood clots in women and the long term effects vaccines had on fertility The letter also urged Congress to continue investigating Fauci According to legal experts Congress may continue such investigations despite Biden s pardon and retains the authority to

last month Fauci said he had committed no crime and that threats of investigation or prosecution create immeasurable and intolerable distress for him and his family But for Glaser the pardon may ultimately prove a blessing in disguise as it encourages boldness among states at a time when boldness is demanded by the public Glaser said Florida is well positioned to prove that Fauci was engaged in criminal racketeering in connection to his prioritization of funding and approval for COVID 19 vaccines and promotion of remdesivir a controversial COVID 19 treatment under Florida Statues Section 895 02 The statutes codify an expansive list of criminal racketeering examples such as engaging in a pattern of fraud battery and or homicide Attorney Rick Jaffe said Fauci s role in dismissing off label drugs such as ivermectin could be another possible route of investigation at the state level as it was the necessary predicate for the COVID shots emergency use authorization The more investigations the better and the more likely the public will get an honest and complete assessment of what went wrong Jaffe said Last month a Florida grand jury investigating any and all wrongdoing related to COVID 19 vaccines found profound and serious issues with vaccine development and safety in the U S and a pattern of deceptive and obfuscatory behavior by regulators that often straddled the line between ethical and unethical conduct The grand jury did not find criminal activity but Fauci s name did not appear in its report Jaffe said the outcomes of grand jury investigations can be

delivering DNA contaminants into people s cells You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo M D Ph D today called for a halt in the use of COVID 19 mRNA vaccines over safety concerns that the mRNA technology is delivering DNA contaminants into people s cells In a statement released today by the Florida Department of Health Ladapo said the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA failed to adequately respond to questions he raised about the issue in a letter sent last month to the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Ladapo asked the agencies to address the recent discovery of host cell DNA fragments in the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines Scientists studying the vaccines found bacterial DNA left over from the microscopic plasmids used for multiplying DNA in the mRNA vaccine manufacturing process One of the gene therapy tools discovered in COVID 19 vaccines is SV40 which is known to be cancer promoting Ladapo s letter said the presence of these fragments was particularly concerning given that the mRNA shots use lipid nanoparticles which he said are an efficient vehicle for delivery of mRNA in the COVID 19 vaccines into human cells and may therefore be an equally efficient vehicle for delivering contaminant DNA into human cells He asked the agencies to explain whether the risks of contaminant DNA being integrated into human cells had been assessed per the agencies own guidelines especially given the new risk factors introduced by the use of lipid nanoparticles In the FDA s response Peter Marks M D Ph D director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA reiterated that the agency is confident in the quality safety and effectiveness of the COVID 19 vaccines Marks also said that on first principle it is quite implausible that residual small DNA fragments could find their way into the nucleus of cells and be incorporated into chromosomal DNA He added that the FDA s pharmacovigilance data on hundreds of millions of individuals indicate no evidence indicative of genotoxicity The real challenge facing the FDA Marks said is the ongoing proliferation of misinformation and disinformation about these vaccines which results in vaccine hesitancy that lowers vaccine uptake Ladapo said the response did not sufficiently address his concerns The FDA s

including the risk that DNA integrated into sperm or egg gametes could be passed onto offspring of mRNA COVID 19 vaccine recipients If the risks of DNA integration have not been assessed for mRNA COVID 19 vaccines these vaccines are not appropriate for use in human beings Ladapo said An outspoken critic of COVID policies Ladapo a distinguished graduate of Harvard Medical School and well published medical researcher gained prominence early in the pandemic for arguing that fear not sound public health science was driving public messaging around COVID 19 He published a series of articles in USA Today and The Wall Street Journal criticizing lockdown measures and arguing the health system would be less burdened if more patients were treated before they require hospitalization and there are promising therapeutic options that patients can administer themselves at home Ladapo s outspokenness and his approach to handling the pandemic caught the eye of Florida Gov Ron DeSantis who appointed him as the state s surgeon general in September 2021 Since then he has been vocal in challenging federal policies and recommendations related to the COVID 19 mRNA vaccines and calling for agency accountability He issued an alert in Feb 2022 to the Florida healthcare sector and the public warning that COVID 19 mRNA vaccines caused a substantial increase in reports of adverse events in Florida In March 2022 Ladapo recommended against COVID 19 vaccines for healthy children making Florida the first state to break with official guidance from the CDC Last year he recommended against

weather droplets to cluster around them and increase the chances of precipitation The Guardian reported that by 2021 cloud seeding was underway or planned in many drought stricken U S states States

the lead author of a recent study of women and children in Los Angeles that found children born to women exposed during pregnancy to fluoridated drinking water were more likely to have neurobehavioural problems Malin said in the last seven years there have been several high quality rigorously conducted prospective pregnancy and birth cohort studies in North America These studies showed that chronic relatively low prenatal fluoride exposure levels are associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes including reduced IQ more symptoms of ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and declines in executive functioning The National Toxicology Program NTP a division of the U S Department of Health and Human Services published a report in August that found with moderate confidence that fluoride exposure is associated with lowered child IQ at levels of 1 5 milligrams per liter mg L only twice the currently recommended 0 7 mg L level of water fluoridation in the U S The NTP said there was uncertainty about exposure at lower levels a finding that pro fluoride organizations such as the American Dental Association ADA cite to justify their pro fluoridation position However in his ruling Chen said there is not a sufficient margin of safety between the level at which fluoride is known to be toxic or the hazard level and the currently recommended exposure level For most chemicals regulated by the EPA there must be at least a factor of 10 between the hazard level and the exposure level in order to protect people because real exposure levels can vary and people have different sensitivities Malin said that to comply with EPA s regulatory rule of thumb fluoride levels in drinking water would need to be set to 15 mg L or lower Ladapo s new guidance also cited several other recent key peer reviewed studies linking water fluoridation to neurodevelopmental issues These include a 2017 study in Mexico that linked prenatal fluoride exposure with lower IQ in

evidence shows community water fluoridation may lead to a very small reduction in cavities in children s baby teeth over time Fluoride in water reduced tooth decay only by about one quarter of one tooth they found These results also included the possibility of little or no difference in tooth decay they said One 2021 study in Calgary Canada found that stopping water fluoridation led to an increase in cavities However other recent major observational studies including the LOTUS Study found only a 2 reduction in cavities among people living in fluoridated areas in England Since 2023

a 27 higher risk of getting the flu than those who didn t get the vaccine suggesting the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season according to a new preprint study The study of 53 402 employees of the Cleveland Clinic an Ohio based nonprofit academic medical center concluded that the flu vaccine had a negative effectiveness rate of 26 9 According to the study published last week on the MedRxiv preprint server The cumulative incidence of influenza did not appear to be significantly different between the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early on but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of infection increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than among the unvaccinated TrialSite News called the findings deeply concerning because they suggest harm rather than protection and contradict public health narratives about the flu vaccine This Cleveland Clinic study reveals the complete failure of annual flu vaccines Americans are tired of toxin loaded injectable products that backfire and deteriorate their health said epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher Dr Clayton J Baker said the study strongly suggests the shot was outright harmful He said the findings not only demonstrate that this year s flu shot was a disaster but it calls into serious question the whole endeavor of seasonal population wide vaccines for respiratory viruses Internist Dr Meryl Nass said the results weren t surprising Flu shots are not tested for efficacy before use she said They are grandfathered in based on the license of earlier flu vaccines with rudimentary safety testing As a result negative efficacy is possible One of the most consequential influenza vaccine studies in recent years Although the study hasn t been peer reviewed scientists and medical experts

studies published in recent years because of its large sample size real world design risk based outcome the robust statistical methods used and no industry funding It is rare to see a study of this scale clarity and independence produce a result so directly at odds with national vaccine policy Lyons Weiler wrote Baker agreed noting that the negative efficacy of the vaccine suggests the vaccine caused some kind of unintentional immune impairment This suggests the vaccine makers do not understand how the vaccine is acting upon the immune system The whole endeavor of trying to produce an effective flu shot every year appears to be something of a farce if the manufacturers cannot even avoid producing one that increases the likelihood of contracting the flu Baker said Given all the variables that can influence the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in any given year and our current processes for developing the vaccine it may be asking for too much to expect the vaccine to be highly effective year after year the study stated Study s findings not without precedent According to the study Cleveland Clinic employees either receive an annual influenza vaccine or seek an exemption on medical or religious grounds Karl Jablonowski Ph D senior research scientist for Children s Health Defense said the study would not have been possible if the clinic didn t recognize such exemptions If the Cleveland Clinic did not allow a religious exemption it is likely the unvaccinated group would be too small to perform this study Jablonowski said It is an utter absurdity that those who were medically and religiously exempt posed measurably and significantly less of a threat of spreading influenza to patients than those who were mandated Lyons Weiler noted that the study s findings are not without precedent He cited a 2012 peer reviewed study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases showing that children who received the flu vaccine were at significantly increased risk of contracting non flu respiratory virus infections A peer reviewed study published last year in Scientific Reports examined 19 vaccines and found that 17 of those vaccines including flu shots were

according to a study published last week in Nature Biomedical Engineering The authors of the study said their findings establish floss based vaccination as a simple needle free strategy that enhances vaccine delivery and immune activation But critics said the study raises questions about informed consent and how the vaccine dose would be controlled The study is the first to show that applying a vaccine to the gum crevice of mice by flossing their teeth with special dental floss activated a strong immune response Harvinder Gill Ph D a professor in nanomedicine at North Carolina State University and the study s senior author told The Defender Nobody would ve thought that you could do that he said Delivering a vaccine to the gum crevice could make the vaccine more effective than a vaccine administered by a syringe plus the approach is painless Gill said But epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher questioned the technology s safety This vaccine technology carries the significant risk of uncontrolled dosing where each individual administration will yield a different result he said Jessica Rose Ph D an immunologist and biochemist said she fears people would use the dental floss without knowing it contained a vaccine For instance pharmaceutical company representatives could give doctors or dentists free samples to give patients without disclosing the product s risks The opportunity to provide informed consent will be impossible in this scenario Rose said Gill pushed back saying the technology is all about choice because it gives people who want to get vaccinated an option other than shots and nasal sprays Floss sparked antibody production in mice study showed For the study researchers flossed the teeth of mice using thread coated with different kinds of antigens Antigens are markers that alert the body to harmful foreign substances and trigger an immune response They are a vaccine s active ingredient according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In one test the researchers used floss coated with a fluorescently labeled protein They found that 75 of the protein was successfully delivered to the mouse s gums The mice still had elevated antibodies in their

said But that doesn t mean floss vaccines will be on the market soon Of course you have to modify Gill said You have to optimize the formulation And a lot of work needs to be done so that you could make it work for each different kind of vaccine The researchers also found that eating or drinking immediately after flossing did not inhibit the vaccine s effectiveness To test the method in people the researchers asked nearly 30 healthy people to floss with dental picks coated with colored food dye About 60 of the dye was delivered to their gums The majority of the participants said they would prefer a floss vaccine to an injection Why would floss vaccines be more effective than shots The floss method delivers the vaccine in the gum crevice a uniquely permeable mucosal surface where the body most needs to rally an immune response Gill said Mucosal surfaces are the body s interfacing tissues such as the respiratory tract gut and bladder that are in constant contact with microorganisms and play a crucial role in protecting host tissues from microbial invasion according to ScienceDirect It s best if a vaccine triggers the body to produce antibodies on or near mucosal surfaces since that s likely where the pathogen is first contacting the body Gill said Intramuscular shots mostly trigger antibody production in the blood and other bodily tissues meaning they don t provide good protection at mucosal surfaces he said However most mucosal surfaces don t absorb proteins well which makes them poor sites for delivering vaccines The gum crevice is an exception It is by nature highly permeable so it can absorb large molecules Gill said Putting a vaccine in gum crevices prompts the body to mount a strong immune response at the mucosal surface So if we can do that we actually make a better vaccine using the same vaccine Gill said Just by changing the administration route you can create a first line of defense on the mucosal surfaces That s why we are very excited But what

fluoridation at current U S levels poses an unreasonable risk of reduced IQ in children The U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA can no longer ignore that risk and must take regulatory action Judge Edward Chen of the U S District Court of the Northern District of California wrote in the long awaited landmark decision More than 200 million Americans drink water treated with fluoride at the optimal level of 0 7 milligrams per liter mg L However Chen ruled that a preponderance of scientific evidence shows this level of fluoride exposure may damage human health particularly that of pregnant mothers and young children The verdict delivers a major blow to the EPA public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and professional lobbying groups like the American Dental Association ADA which have staked their reputations on the claim that water fluoridation is one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century and an unqualified public good Fluoride proponents refused to reexamine that stance despite mounting scientific evidence from top researchers and government agencies of fluoride s neurotoxic risks particularly for

organizations like the Fluoride Action Network Moms Against Fluoridation and Food Water Watch along with individual parents and children It is the first lawsuit to go to a federal trial under the Toxic Substances Control Act TSCA as amended by Congress in 2016 The TSCA allows U S citizens to petition the EPA to evaluate whether a chemical presents an unreasonable risk to public health and should be regulated If the EPA denies a TSCA citizen petition which the agency did when the plaintiffs asked it to reexamine water fluoridation in 2016 the petitioners are entitled to a de novo

detailed articulation of the EPA s review process for chemicals that pose a hazard to human health and evaluates and summarizes the extensive scientific data presented at trial Chen wrote EPA s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level He cited a key report issued by the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS National Toxicology Program NTP which undertook a systematic review of all available scientific research at the time of publication The report concluded that fluoride is indeed associated with reduced IQ in children at least at exposure levels at or above 1 5 mg L Chen wrote The NTP also reported that although there are technical challenges to measuring fluoride s toxic effects at low levels scientists have observed a statistically significant association between fluoride and adverse effects in children even at such lower exposure levels Chen wrote He said that despite recognizing that fluoride is hazardous the EPA s defense rested largely on the fact that the exact level at which it is hazardous is too unclear for the agency to determine whether the chemical presents an unreasonable risk This argument is not persuasive Chen wrote Do you have a

given the margin of error required Chen wrote That means that even if the hazard level were 4 mg L well above the 1 5 mg L identified by the NTP the safe level of fluoride exposure would be 0 4 mg L well below the current optimal fluoride level in the U S Chen wrote The much lower probable hazard level established by high quality studies indicates that many pregnant women in the U S are already exposed to fluoride in water at levels exceeding the hazard level Under even the most conservative estimates of this level there is not enough of a margin between the accepted hazard level and the actual human exposure levels to find that fluoride is safe Chen concluded Simply put the risk to health at exposure levels in United States drinking water is sufficiently high to trigger regulatory

For more than seven decades U S public health officials have steadfastly supported water fluoridation claiming the practice is a key strategy for maintaining and improving dental health Proponents of water fluoridation with help from the mainstream press often attempted to cast those questioning fluoride s benefits and raising concerns about its safety as conspiracy theorists The EPA in 1975 recommended adding fluoride to water at an optimal level of 1 2 mg L for its dental benefits but recommended a maximum level of 4 mg L the ruling said As more evidence has emerged about fluoride s adverse health effects including skeletal fluorosis recommended levels were revised Surgeon General Vivek Murthy officially lowered the recommended dosage for water fluoridation in 2015 from 0 7 1 2 mg L to 0 7 mg L after considering adverse health effects along with alleged benefits However evidence that fluoride poses a neurotoxic risk has existed for decades In 2017 after the EPA rejected their citizen petition to end fluoridation of drinking water in the U S based on evidence of health risks namely neurotoxicity the plaintiffs filed the lawsuit A seven day trial took place in federal court in San Francisco in June 2020 but Chen put the proceedings on hold pending the release of the NTP s systematic review of research available on the neurotoxic effects of fluoride The NTP sought to publish its report which consisted of a state of the science monograph and a meta analysis in May 2022 but dental officials at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research pressured HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel Levine to prevent the review from being published The ADA also sought to suppress the report Levine told the NTP to not publish the report but to put it on hold and allow for further review Plaintiffs submitted documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act exposing this intervention to the court The revelation prompted Chen to rule that the trial should go forward using the draft report from the NTP The trial resumed in January in San Francisco with arguments presented over the course of two weeks The NTP s monograph was finalized and published last month on its website The meta analysis is forthcoming in a peer reviewed journal Connett said that Congress created the citizen petition

It s Hazardous Waste Fluoride is supposedly a miracle mineral when added to water to prevent tooth decay But it s the byproduct of phosphate fertilizer production and is classified by the EPA as

article Sign Up After Utah last month became the first state to ban water fluoridation local water managers now face a dilemma How should they dispose of the remaining fluoride Mainstream media dental associations the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and other proponents of water fluoridation repeatedly state that the miracle mineral fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral But the fluoride added to town water supplies is far from natural Naturally occurring fluoride is calcium fluoride The fluoride added to water is the byproduct of phosphate fertilizer production sold off by chemical companies to local water departments across the country The byproduct comes in the form of hydrofluorosilicic acid which is used by most large cities to fluoridate their water Hydrofluorosilicic acid is considered a hazardous substance and must be disposed of following strict environmental regulations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Scott Paxman general manager of the Weber Basin Conservancy District which provides water to over 700 000 Utah residents told The Defender that he reached out to the state Department of Environmental Quality DEQ to inquire about fluoride disposal DEQ told Paxman that once the May 7 deadline to end fluoridation in Utah kicks in any water districts that still have fluoride in their facilities will be subject to regulation as generators of hazardous waste requiring them to follow an expensive and time consuming set of regulatory requirements to get rid of their hydrofluorosilicic acid Paxman said he was outraged that his water conservancy district would be classified as a hazardous waste generator We aren t hazardous waste generators he said We are just middlemen He said that for years water operators in Utah had been raising concerns about the hazards of the acid that they saw firsthand in their facilities and the health risks they and the public faced from fluoride exposure Water operators like Paxman were active in the campaign to end fluoridation in Utah he said Now they were not getting the guidance they needed to dispose of the chemicals They have no idea how toxic this

Environmental Protection Agency EPA The 4 mg L maximum contaminant level was challenged in the recent landmark lawsuit against the EPA for failing to appropriately regulate the chemical The EPA lost and the judge in the case directed the agency to enact new regulations The EPA is appealing the ruling Four mg L is the level at which fluoride causes skeletal fluorosis a debilitating condition that causes skeletal deformities The judge in the federal lawsuit ruled that at 0 7 mg L water fluoridation poses an unreasonable risk to children s health because evidence shows it leads to reduced IQ Paxman said when he saw that suggestion he realized Oh my God they have no idea what they are talking about They have no idea how toxic this stuff is Other ideas floated by DEQ included selling the leftover hazardous waste to other states still fluoridating or returning it to Thatcher Chemical the industrial chemical distributor that sold them the so called miracle mineral Better guidelines needed for handling disposing fluoride as hazardous chemical Paxman has worked with input from fluoride toxicity expert Phyllis Mullenix Ph D and DEQ to develop better guidelines that have since been shared with water operators Since this is a hazardous chemical with elevated levels of arsenic lead mercury and chromium it must be handled and disposed of as a hazardous chemical as state and federal regulations require Paxman wrote in an email to colleagues Operators must legally continue fluoridation until May 7 when they will mothball all systems disconnecting them shutting down power and winterizing them Then they will hire a hazardous waste cleanup company like Clean Harbors to clean up the rest pumping out their tanks and disposing of the hydrofluorosilicic acid at a hazardous waste

production systems The industry formerly allowed these byproducts to vent into the air until it was compelled to mitigate them The phosphate industry collects the fluoride gas in a wet scrubber and the resulting hydrofluorosilicic acid liquid is put into storage tanks and shipped to water departments In declarations made as part of the fluoride lawsuit all three major producers of fluorosilicic

acid from Thatcher Weber Basin began periodically contracting a state certified external lab to analyze the chemicals provided so they could check the contaminant levels themselves and compare them to the company s claims The certificates of analysis show that the shipments of fluoride that then go into the water system regularly have extremely high levels of arsenic and sometimes lead or other

to our health The evidence that makes this clear has accumulated over many years with much of it laid out in court files after a group of non profits and individuals sued the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act to end water fluoridation alleging that fluoride s neurotoxicity posed an unreasonable risk to human health The litigation led last year to a federal court ruling that fluoridated water is not safe U S District Judge Edward Chen stated in his Sept 24 2024 decision that it was proven that water fluoridation at the level of 0 7 mg L milligrams per liter presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment Former President Barack Obama appointed Chen grilled both trial counsels without bias and drilled down on the scientific nuances concerning fluoride s neurotoxicity in coming to his conclusion His 80 page ruling will be one for the history books of environmental law Chen wrote in his ruling In all there is substantial and scientifically credible evidence establishing that fluoride poses a risk to human health it is associated with a reduction in the IQ of children and is hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States One thing the EPA cannot do in the face of this Court s finding is to ignore that risk Chen wrote The last seven years have been packed with volumes of scientific evidence expert testimonies depositions the National Toxicology Program Report on fluoride neurotoxicity and FOIA documents shedding light on institutional interference targeting top government toxicologists A May 2024 study that looked at pregnant women who drank fluoridated water and followed their children for three years after birth found that

During the trial both parties agreed that fluoride is a neurotoxin and that at least a 10 times safety factor was required This aspect alone makes fluoridated water not safe to drink As plaintiffs attorney Michael Connett has pointed out The court concluded that the levels that we add to drinking water are far too close to the levels that we know can cause neurotoxic effects Ashley Malin Ph D

December 2024 Malin cited a 2020 study that found that for every 0 5mg liter of fluoridated water in infant formula the infant s IQ could be lowered by nine points That study concluded that exposure to increasing levels of fluoride in tap water was associated with diminished non verbal intellectual abilities the effect was more pronounced among formula fed children Tavares city leaders then voted to end its water fluoridation program World famous scientists testified at the trial including Dr Philippe Grandjean who helped the EPA set the safety standards for mercury and Dr Bruce Lanphear who

biscuits had the highest at 420 μg kg These amounts were double to triple the amounts reported in drinking water groundwater and rainwater That s because TFA becomes more concentrated in plants than in the water used by plants According to the report Plants generally absorb many times more water than they convert into biomass and transpire water via the leaf surface Pollutants such as TFA therefore accumulate in plants at much higher concentrations than in the already pre concentrated soil water Since TFA doesn t break down in nature it builds up more and more as it enters the water

including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s CDC former director Dr Rochelle Walensky are pushing health officials to recommend an extra dose of the MMR vaccine for babies ages 6 11 months who live in or travel to areas of the U S with measles outbreaks according to Medpage Today The news comes as a suspected measles case in a 1 year old child in Pima County Arizona this week turned out to be a reaction to the measles mumps rubella MMR vaccine not measles According to a Pima County news release reactions to the MMR vaccine are rare and do not carry the same risk as community acquired measles The Pima County Health Department did not specify the toddler s symptoms but said state and county health authorities and the local hospital where the child was treated took precautions in the child s treatment as if it were an infectious case Arizona has not reported any measles cases so far in 2025 the release said The CDC s current Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule recommends children receive their first dose of the MMR vaccine between the ages of 12 15 months and their second dose between ages 4 6 years Infants 6 11 months old who are about to travel internationally are advised to get an extra dose before traveling Walensky and colleagues argued in op eds published in the Journal of the American Medical Association JAMA and STAT News that the recommendation should be changed due to the uptick in U S measles cases Some states experiencing measles outbreaks have already issued local advisories recommending that infants 6 11 months get an MMR shot but there is no such national recommendation in place Walensky and colleagues said Pediatric immunization guidelines should be revised in light of evolving epidemiologic trends they wrote in JAMA

Caserta said No MMR safety data cited to support giving shot to young babies In their op eds Walensky and colleagues made no mention of safety data underlying their proposal to give the MMR shot to 6 month olds Heather Ray science and research analyst administrator with Children s Health Defense CHD said that many people assume the MMR vaccine is safer than the measles mumps and rubella infections However there are serious red flags regarding the safety and research behind the vaccine Ray said According to a collection of documents recently released by Physicians for Informed Consent the risk of permanent disability or death from the MMR vaccine may be greater than the risk posed by measles mumps or rubella infection That s because vaccine safety studies conducted so far haven t been large enough Research has shown that in some instances the MMR vaccine causes febrile seizures anaphylaxis meningitis encephalitis thrombocytopenia arthralgia and vasculitis Ray called the risk of serious adverse events following MMR vaccination concerning and noted that only a small percentage are reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS As of the end of January there have been 41

age and dosage recommendations are currently the same as the MMR vaccine VAERS reports do not prove a causal relationship between a vaccine and an injury because the reports lack verification However

Even the aggressive schedule does not recommend the live virus MMR vaccine any earlier than 12 months old This is not a coincidence of logistics MMR is not recommended for younger than 12 months old because even the vaccine zealous recommenders do not find the risks appropriate In their JAMA op ed Walensky and colleagues noted that many parents are concerned about adding a third MMR shot to the schedule However they wrote this third dose can be especially critical because infants younger than 1 year face a heightened risk of severe measles related complications such as pneumonia encephalitis and death Jablonowski said if Walensky and her fellow authors are successful in persuading the medical community to administer the third dose to young babies they will have again demonstrated that immunization recommendations can be knee jerk reactions to fear The manufacturing of fear is a multi billion dollar a year industry he said Walensky acknowledged that a third MMR dose would cost money But she argued that it can be cost effective compared with the resources required to treat infections and contain outbreaks In a March 31 op ed for The Conversation Peter Kasson M D Ph D a professor

Kessler was not necessarily at the helm of the worst regulatory disaster in human history but he was certainly on the bridge Kessler s Nov 26 opinion piece is designed to stoke fear After the last

right now The health of the animal in the modern economics meets modern agriculture operations is of concern only insofar as the animals are healthy enough by rubber stamping U S Department of Agriculture standards to be slaughtered In that setting a sick animal may spread bird flu to all of the 50 000 animals in the same building and the similarly concentrated surrounding buildings Many poultry farms have a population in the millions These are breeding grounds for sickness where humans do not enter without personal protective equipment Under these conditions the bird flu virus may replicate many more times than it could in the natural world The second component is ample exposure to mammals and modern economics meets modern agriculture provides this one too There are about 100 million cows in the U S concentrated and confined in analogous conditions often close to poultry operations The more exposure a bird flu virus has to a mammal the more combinations of mutations are tried against mammalian immune systems Since humans are more biologically similar to cows than birds the H5N1 now in cows can more easily jump to humans as we are seeing in dairy workers The concern is that with the more exposure of humans to infected cows the more combinations the virus gets to try and may result in a strain that is transmissible between humans Do you have a news tip We want to

likely reserved for only the seriously ill and U S dairy workers with the most common symptom of pink eye leaving asymptomatic or mild illness cases undocumented With this bias a mortality rate is impossible to measure and a folly to estimate Existing bird flu vaccines only up to 70 effective and our stockpile is inadequate Kessler s assessment of human products for combating bird flu is that antivirals are less effective with novel strains monoclonal antibodies are not commercially available and we will have a national stockpile of maybe 10 million doses of an H5N8 H5N6 not H5N1 vaccine The hope lies in crossover immunity that a vaccine targeting H5N8 H5N6 might help the immune system recognize and combat H5N1 Ten million doses is not enough for the country or even a theoretical pandemic susceptible portion of the country Even if we had enough doses the vaccine is not effective enough estimated at between 30 and 70 to make a population wide immunity difference So Kessler turns to the solution of mRNA vaccines which could offer more effective countermeasures in response to worrisome mutations Out of control self amplifying mRNA vaccines will be just as bad as COVID mRNA vaccines In July the U S Department of Health and Human Services awarded Moderna 176 million to develop an mRNA H5N1 vaccine and the WHO launched an initiative to develop such mRNA vaccines By November the FDA gave Arcturus Therapeutics ARCT 2304 the study can proceed notification The self amplifying mRNA vaccine poses a real safety concern of recombination into an existing successful virus forever changing Earth s virome and posing a threat to human and animal health The claim is that self amplifying mRNA vaccines require a lower dose than conventional mRNA vaccines and are therefore safer Since these vaccines amplify themselves the actual dose of antigen a person may be exposed to is unknown and unknowable Kessler proposes that a theoretical virus that could replicate out of control and infect others be prophylactically combated with a real vaccine that replicates out of control and may infect others An H5N1 mRNA vaccine will come with many of the same adverse effects as

synthesizing nearly a decade of research The Fracking Science Compendium Ninth Edition was released in October by Concerned Health Professionals of New York and Physicians for Social Responsibility and adds to evidence of numerous problems posed by natural gas extraction through fracking and fracking associated infrastructure from pipelines and compressor stations to appliances such as gas furnaces and stoves The report compiles data and conclusions from thousands of studies including peer reviewed papers investigative media reports and government documents Our examination uncovered no evidence that fracking can be practiced in a manner that does not threaten human health directly or without imperiling climate stability upon which human health depends the report states For years scientists have warned that living in close proximity to a fracking operation elevates one s risk of developing various diseases or health impairments and the science substantiating these exposure based outcomes has only gotten more robust over the years This rapidly growing body of hundreds of studies supports the conclusion that fracking causes a variety of adverse health effects in fetuses infants children and adults Dr Ted Schettler a retired physician and public health expert and science director of the Science and Environmental Health Network said in a webinar held this week to

children whose birth residence was within 2 kilometers of a fracking well were 2 to 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia between the ages of 2 and 7 than children

York chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility said people should replace gas stoves in their homes as a preventative health measure similar to quitting smoking or prohibiting smoking indoors We have to wean ourselves off of natural gas she said Transitioning away from gas is also necessary from a climate standpoint Contrary to the narrative that gas is a cleaner substitute for coal or is a bridge fuel to renewable energy more evidence is emerging indicating that this fossil fuel has a larger greenhouse gas footprint than was previously understood The main reason for this is that natural gas is almost entirely composed of methane which is itself a powerful greenhouse gas that is roughly 86 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20 year timeframe In fact scientists estimate about 40 of current warming stems from atmospheric methane buildup Shale gas has a greenhouse gas footprint that is certainly as big as that of coal said Robert Howarth a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University and a leading expert on the greenhouse gas impacts of fracked gas In 2011 Howarth and colleagues published the first peer reviewed analysis examining the climate consequences of fracked gas finding that because there are methane leaks and venting throughout the lifecycle shale gas is likely to be a significant contributor to global warming The peer reviewed science since then has further validated their finding and Howarth has now issued a new warning about the greenhouse gas emissions impact of liquified natural gas LNG In a paper just submitted for peer review Howarth analyzed the emissions associated with LNG export operations which involves supercooling gas to liquefy it and then transporting it on giant tankers His analysis shows that LNG carried by older style tankers amounts to a greenhouse gas footprint that is roughly 2 5 to 3 times worse than simply burning coal and even with the newest tankers it is still almost 25 worse than coal The science is quite clear Liquified natural gas is a terrible idea from a climate standpoint Howarth said This new analysis comes at a critical time when the U S is rapidly expanding

an instrumental contributor to the Compendium since its inception and referred to it as her life s most meaningful work emphasized that the detrimental impacts of this industry cannot be mitigated through existing regulations or controls The problems with fracking both for our health and for our climate are intractable and are not fixable through any regulatory framework she said In this fracking resembles lead paint or indoor smoking No rules or regulations can make these practices safe The only meaningful solution the Compendium contends is a comprehensive ban on fracking The

group of lawmakers this week called on the FTC to update its decade old report on food marketing to children emphasizing the need to address the evolving digital advertising landscape The letter cites projections of a 700 increase in childhood diabetes over four decades if current trends continue You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Federal lawmakers this week called on the Federal Trade Commission FTC to take action against the marketing of junk food to children citing concerns about its impact on health and eating habits In a June 17 letter addressed to FTC Chair Lina M Khan and four commissioners a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers led by Sen Cory A Booker D N J urged the FTC to update its decade old report on food marketing to children and adolescents emphasizing the need to address the rapidly evolving landscape of digital advertising Child targeted advertising can impact children s food preferences purchase requests consumption patterns and could ultimately contribute to unhealthy eating patterns that increase the risk of chronic disease the letter said The lawmakers characterized the need for regulatory action as urgent in light of projected increases in childhood diabetes rates and the billions spent annually on influencer marketing However in a recent article in The Hill Lindsey Smith Taillie Ph D associate professor at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina was cautious in her assessment of how readily proposed legislative changes could be adopted It will likely be an uphill climb largely due to First Amendment protection of corporate speech she said The letter comes as several countries have begun grappling with similar issues of junk food marketing to children particularly in the digital space Key concerns raised in congressional letter The letter outlined several issues regarding food marketing to children in the digital age 1 Outdated regulatory framework The FTC s most recent comprehensive report on food marketing to children and adolescents was published in 2012 using data from 2009 Understanding the importance of this issue Congress directed FTC to issue an update to this report by June 2023 yet this has not yet been released the letter states 2 Evolving digital landscape Since the last report the advertising landscape has shifted dramatically influenced by the growth of online platforms new technologies increased spending on advertising and the use of user data and complex algorithms according to the letter 3 Targeted marketing concerns The lawmakers worried about how companies target ads to children in different socioeconomic and demographic groups They pointed to a study that found Black children were exposed to between 86 and 119 percent more

foods to young audiences There are countless recent examples of influencers on TikTok promoting food and beverage products where it is not always made clear the influencer is being paid to promote these products or has a material connection to the brand the lawmakers noted The lawmakers applauded the FTC s 2023 announcement to update its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising and its actions against food industry and health professional influencers promoting sugary products particularly to children But they expressed concern over the FTC s lack of providing enough clarity on heightened disclosure practices for endorsements aimed at children noting that cognitive research suggests disclosures will not work for younger children Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Junk food consumption linked to diabetes chronic disease According to the letter the food and beverage industry is expected to spend 7 billion on influencer marketing in the U S in 2024 alone The massive expenditure reflects the industry s shift toward digital platforms and influencer driven content to reach young consumers The health implications of this marketing blitz are stark The lawmakers pointed to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the number of U S children with Type 2 diabetes will increase by nearly 700 over the next four decades if current trends continue A study cited in Forbes found that higher junk food consumption was linked with greater body mass index waist circumference and higher fasting glucose levels which can be an early sign of diabetes in children as young as 3 to 6 years old Taillie emphasized the long term consequences of early junk food consumption Food marketing hooks kids on unhealthy foods creating poor eating habits that can last a lifetime In the Forbes article Dr Jesse Pines said such habits become deeply ingrained as the Standard American Diet and set the stage for earlier onset chronic disease including heart disease cancer and metabolic syndrome Online kid influencers push unhealthy foods The letter singled out social media platforms

children to marketing content Despite YouTube s ban on in stream food ads on YouTube Kids in 2020 the letter points out that the ban did not address food marketing in user uploaded content or content aimed at children on the regular YouTube platform The lawmakers cited a study revealing the prevalence of food marketing in content created by popular child influencers on the platform 65 of videos from the most popular kid influencers on YouTube contained at least one appearance of food More concerningly the study found that of all branded appearances studied 42 were for candy while sweet salty snacks sugary drinks and ice cream made up a combined 32 of the appearances The use of advergaming video games created to promote a brand was also highlighted as a tactic of concern In an article published by The Conversation Melbourne Law School s Tanita Northcott and Christina Parker Ph D noted that companies use vast amounts of data collected about individuals to target specific audiences and seamlessly integrate advertising into everyday life For example ads can present app only deals such as free fast food delivery Other ads connect junk food to wholesome or popular activities such as sports creating a halo effect This kind of disguised promotion limits kids ability to distinguish these marketing techniques from unbranded content a key step in reducing advertising s impact on behavior Taillie wrote Childhood Diabetes Reduction Act a hopeful measure The congressional letter urged the FTC to update its 2012 report enhance guidance and enforcement and address concerns about social media influencer marketing Taillie alluded to potential legislative measures including the Childhood Diabetes Reduction Act of 2024 already introduced in the U S Senate which could help achieve these aims According to Taillie the bill proposes limits on the types of techniques used to target kids for example dancing animated candies as well as limits on where such ads can appear e g on

marketing reduction efforts Northcott and Parker noted several countries productive regulations and research in tackling junk food marketing to children In Australia for instance the government has been investigating whether to ban unhealthy food advertising online and how such a ban could be implemented In the United Kingdom a ban on unhealthy food and drink advertising online will start in October 2025 Northcott and Parker said Their research using the Australian Ad Observatory found that unhealthy food and drinks are promoted in ways designed to appeal to parents and carers of children and children themselves This mirrors concerns raised in the U S congressional letter Taillie suggested the U S look to other countries approaches in addressing this issue mentioning Chile s regulations as a potential model In 2016 Chile restricted child directed appeals and placement of ads on children s programming for unhealthy products and banned their sale and promotion in schools She noted that in 2018 Chile began prohibiting unhealthy food ads on any television program between 6am 10pm Research showed that these regulations cut kids exposure to unhealthy food marketing by over two thirds", "chunk_id": "ai_corpus_slimmer_clean_filtered:childrenshealthdefense.org_defender_ftc-ultra-processed-food-marketing-children-digital-ads.txt:3:52db72fabc84", "wtk_id": NaN},

the relationship between the percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID cases across 68 countries and 2 947 U S counties that had second dose vaccine and available COVID case data For seven days preceding Sept 3 researchers computed COVID cases per one million people for each country as well as the percentage of population that was fully vaccinated Notably Israel with more than 60 of its population fully vaccinated had the highest COVID cases per 1 million people during the seven day period Iceland and Portugal with more than 75 of their populations fully vaccinated had more COVID cases per 1 million people than countries such as Vietnam and South Africa where only about 10 of the population is fully vaccinated Across U S counties the median new COVID cases per 100 000 people during the seven day period was similar across the categories of percentage of population fully vaccinated The researchers found a substantial county variation in new COVID cases within

initiative currently under development Reclaim the Net reports According to the Kenyan Daily Post Gates role in assisting the Kenyan government in its development and rollout of Maisha Namba was announced after a recent series of closed door meetings with Kenyan President William Ruto The billionaire who is known to champion GMO genetically modified organism foods has met Ruto in a series of meetings since he came to power with most of the engagements shrouded in secrecy the Kenyan Daily Post wrote The deal will connect the government to key technical experts and partners who will offer professional advice to guarantee a smooth rollout Kenyans co ke reports Alexis Hancock director of engineering for the Electronic Frontier Foundation told The Defender that such secrecy between governments and private entities is common Outside companies often pitch solutions to various governments that they can solve their problem with their product she said If governments are to implement this the technology involved should be allowed scrutiny by the people first before anything is deployed and delayed if it is not considered safe and equitable According to Biometric Update Maisha Namba is expected to address different challenges such as identifying and authenticating citizens safeguarding primary registration documents such as birth certificates and national identity cards and improving the management of social programmes and government operations The identification number attached to Maisha Namba will also be used to register for government services including education

Alliance as are Gavi the Gates Foundation the World Bank Accenture and the Rockefeller Foundation If all goes according to plan Bill Gates will not only inject billions of Africans with his mRNA vaccines Ngare said He has created a digital ID system for governments around the world to ensure nobody misses their vaccines and that those who refuse vaccination can be restricted from traveling or from accessing government services Gates supported biometric digital ID initiatives around the world including the first such program Aadhaar launched in India in 2009 Aadhaar enrolled over 99 of all

platforms he said According to Business Daily Africa such assistance to the Kenyan government is part of what the Gates Foundation sees as vast opportunities that can be unlocked through the existence of a digital identity in Kenya This is a huge priority of President Willam Ruto and we think very appropriately so because a strong robust open source digital identity system actually becomes a

involved in the rollout of Maisha Namba According to Kenya s Capital News the Kenyan government and the United Nations Development Program UNDP signed a memorandum of understanding in August to

Commissioner Rukia Chitechi said The system shall be run through schools by ensuring every child born is assigned a maisha namba Target 16 9 of the U N s Sustainable Development Goals SDGs calls for the provision of a digital legal identity for all including newborns by 2030 According to Glaser The UN s SDG Target 16 9 confirms that governments will be issuing everyone biometric ID by the year 2030 including babies That means the UN is partnering with corporations and local governments to issue you and your children a biometric ID by 2030 whether you want the IDs or not In a tweet Julius Kibet Bitok Kenya s principal secretary for immigration and citizens services said The digital identity system will provide Kenyans with a secure and reliable way to verify their identity for a variety of purposes including accessing gov t services opening bank accounts and traveling It will also help to reduce fraud and corruption and improve efficiency he added Ngare questioned that theory On face value and if the government is the holder of the data and not third parties such as Microsoft or its minors it may improve service delivery and reduce fraud as stated by government operatives Ngare said adding that he doubted this would be the case Similarly Hancock said If digital ID is done correctly a factor of convenience may benefit people from having to travel long distances for renewing important documents or issue temporary credentials as they await their official documentation There are other methods like selective disclosure where you do not have to display the entirety of your information but only what is required for a certain transaction Hancock said she was concerned about how a long term persistent identifier could be used to track people and create a

about India s Aadhaar digital ID program according to The Economist which wrote Though Aadhaar was supposed to be optional it is hard to function without it The Kenyan government claims the implementation of Maisha Namba is also intended to bring the country into compliance with international standards on global travel as determined by the International Civil Aviation Organization and other agencies Maisha Namba is funded with a budget of 1 billion Kenyan shillings approximately 6 8 million Biometric Update reports The program was initially set to launch on Oct 2 according to

the public that their personal information would be safe on the new digital platform Kenyan National Registration Bureau Registrar for the Kipipiri region Joel Muchunu said the Maisha Namba program will incorporate advanced security features including cryptographic technology for data security Kenya News Agency reported Irungu Houghton executive director of Amnesty International applauded the Maisha Namba program and the Kenyan government s digital transformation efforts according to Biometric Update but raised concerns about the safety of data that will be collected for the Maisha Namba scheme and said it is important Kenyans are comfortable they understand and are aware of the opportunities of this digital platform Such reassurances have not convinced all Kenyans however According to Reclaim the Net There is an evident wave of skepticism with activists from certain regions expressing concerns about inadequate infrastructure unreliable network access and privacy and civil liberties concerns Some activists argued that the Maisha Namba is indistinguishable from a previous digital ID effort attempted by the Kenyan government the Huduma Namba according to Kenyan outlet The Star That program was declared unconstitutional by Kenya s High Court in October 2021 for conflicting with the country s Data Protection Act Ngare said Huduma Namba failed because the government

state more effective is good for the things you like the state to do and bad for the things you don t like the state to do But if you believe in a state that should provide you education and should let you vote and should give you health services there s got to be some notion of Who are my citizens and are they eligible for this benefit he added Ngare said that Gates involvement with Maisha Namba is just one of his many interests in Africa having previously been involved with The clandestine administration of fertility regulating Tetatus vaccines to Kenyan women in 2014 2015 facilitated

Bill Melinda Gates Foundation and its employees are exempt from legal action for acts performed in Kenya as part of their official foundation duties Will the move set a precedent for other billionaire

reported on Substack Under the new status the foundation and its employees are exempt from legal action for acts performed as part of their official foundation duties They also are exempt from paying taxes on their salaries and they now have the right to own property in Kenya While nations around the world have long treated Bill Gates as a head of state it s now been practically codified into law in Kenya wrote Schwab author of The Bill Gates Problem Reckoning with the Myth of the Good Billionaire Schwab said the decision has raised alarm bells within the country and across the world One public advocate through a Freedom of Information Act request has already petitioned the government for documents related to the decision Others worry the decision to grant immunity may set a precedent for other billionaire philanthropists Concerns also have arisen that other nations will be pressured to follow Kenya s lead and offer immunity to the Gates Foundation in exchange for continued access to the massive resources the foundation pours into other African countries The Government of Kenya s announcement Schwab wrote comes just a week after farmer organizations and religious leaders across the continent called for reparations for the damage the foundation has inflicted on African agriculture through its so called green revolution program They say the foundation promotes corporate industrial agriculture at the expense of local practices and African ecosystems Much of the Gates Foundation s investment in African agriculture happens through the Nairobi based AGRA previously known as the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa The foundation is AGRA s co founder and biggest donor It has given at least 872 million to the organization Schwab reported AGRA says it exists to fulfil a vision where Africa can feed itself yet it directs its funding to support input intensive and resource intensive agriculture The alliance promotes the use of synthetic fertilizers and commercial seeds controlled by Big Ag the restructuring of seed laws to criminalize trading of seeds not certified by Big Ag and supports seed dealers who promote corporate products The foundation has

concern It s a big red flag In terms of food sovereignty as we give Gates these privileges and immunities Africa is going to be not food sovereign not seed sovereign we re going to be slaves and masters of the big corporations he added In response to criticism about its new diplomatic immunity in Kenya the foundation issued a statement affirming its commitment to partnering with the Kenyan government Our agreement to operate in Kenya was made in alignment with the Kenyan government s Privileges and Immunities Act We operate according to the typical agreements Kenya makes with other foundations and nonprofits Buhle Makamanzi deputy director of Global Communications for the Gates Foundation in Africa said in the statement Schwab said the move by the Kenyan government and the concerns raised by critics get to the heart of Gates s anti democratic influence and power which at least in Kenya appears to be reaching new levels No one ever elected or appointed Gates to lead the world on any topic Schwab said Yet through his great wealth and his money in politics brand of philanthropy he is able to buy a seat at the democratic decision making table and apparently also buy diplomatic immunity Not just Big Ag Gates investments include vaccines digital IDs GMO mosquitoes Gates massive investment in Africa extends beyond agriculture into public health and more recently digital IDs in Kenya It also includes the Target Malaria project which proposed to end malaria by introducing genetically modified or GMO mosquitoes Critics say the program is based on flawed ecological thinking and backed by the same agri business interests that have devastated agroecological farming systems Schwab also pointed to widespread criticism of Gates program to implement mass circumcision in Swaziland and Zambia to curb the transmission of HIV However some of Gates most wide reaching investments in Africa and the global south more broadly have been in the development and distribution of vaccines For example the Gates Foundation is the topmost funder of polio initiatives worldwide In April 2013 Gates said that eradicating polio was his top priority even though there

deplatformed me and many other critics of regulatory corruption and authoritarian public health policies So here is some fodder for those of you who have the eerie sense that the government industry pandemic response feels like it was planned even before there was a pandemic This document shows that a cabal of powerful individuals did indeed begin planning the mass eviction of vaccine skeptics from social media in October 2019 a week or two before COVID began circulating That month Microsoft founder Bill Gates organized an exercise of four table top simulations of a worldwide coronavirus pandemic with other high ranking Deep State panjandrums The exercise was referred to as Event 201 Gates co conspirators included representatives from the World Bank the World Economic Forum Great

and team did indeed simulate health and economic policies It s hard to swallow that Gates has forgotten Gates s Event 201 simulated COVID epidemic caused 65 million deaths at the 18 month endpoint and global economic collapse lasting up to a decade Compared to the Gates simulation therefore the actual COVID 19 crisis is a bit of a dud having imposed a mere 2 5 million deaths attributed to COVID over the past 13 months The deaths attributed to COVID in the real life situation are highly questionable and must be seen in the context of a global population of 7 8 billion with about 59 million deaths expected annually The predictions of decade long economic collapse will probably prove more accurate but only because of the draconian lockdown promoted by Gates Gates Event 201 script imagines

during the first phase of a two round polio vaccination campaign the World Health Organization WHO reported The campaign continuing today in southern Gaza is set to conclude next week in northern Gaza It will target about 640 000 children Israel and Hamas agreed to a daily eight hour ceasefire in the places where the vaccines are being administered Reuters reported The course of treatment requires the children to receive a second dose of the vaccine in four weeks The campaign was launched after vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 was detected in wastewater samples in central Gaza in June and four children were reported to have acute flaccid paralysis a condition with many possible causes including the poliovirus One of the four children a 10 month old unvaccinated baby tested positive for circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 Vaccine derived polio occurs when the attenuated poliovirus used to make oral vaccines regains its virulence and begins circulating according to the WHO The oral polio vaccine is commonly used because administrators argue it has several benefits for mass vaccination in low resourced areas Dr Suzanne Humphries co author of Dissolving Illusions Diseases Vaccines and The Forgotten History told CHD TV host Polly Tommey in an interview today Humphries book includes an extensive history of polio and the polio vaccine Because the oral vaccine doesn t need refrigeration and doesn t need to be administered by professional healthcare providers it s easier to use it for mass vaccination campaigns Humphries said However the oral vaccine also is responsible for creating the poliovirus now circulating and infecting hundreds of people globally each year Gazan children getting genetically modified vaccine developed by Gates Foundation The vaccine now given to Palestinian children in Gaza is nOPV2 a novel oral polio vaccine focusing on type 2 polio The nOPV2 vaccine is genetically modified to prevent it from mutating and regaining virulence It is not

is released on emergency use And most of the testing early on was done on people who are already fully vaccinated so that their chances of having a mutation are less because of that Humphries said that although the 10 month old baby is partially paralyzed he will likely recover the use of his limb Most people who get polio recover the use of their limbs within 60 days she said Poliomyelitis the disease that affects the spinal cord and paralyzes the limbs can be induced with just toxins she said And if a virus is involved it becomes more invasive in the presence of certain chemicals Humphries said there s been little or no discussion about the bombs dropped across Gaza which have been melting buildings melting plastic melting electricity and chemicals not to mention what was in the bombs she said The amount of toxicity people in that region have had to endure is astronomical We don t even know most of the chemicals those people are being exposed to she said For example If they dropped bombs on any factories that were making pesticides I mean that s enough to cause paralysis in lots of people around that area right there Vaccine adverse events also aren t being discussed Who s going

19 vaccine authorized for emergency use was safe and effective You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The family of a 24 year old man who died from complications of COVID 19 vaccine induced myocarditis today filed a lawsuit against the U S Department of Defense DOD which oversaw the development and distribution of the drug under Operation Warp Speed Ray Flores the attorney representing the estate of George Watts Jr filed the lawsuit in the U S District Court for the District of Columbia against the DOD and Lloyd Austin III in his official capacity as defense secretary The lawsuit alleges the DOD engaged in willful misconduct by continuing to exclusively allow distribution of the stockpiled version of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine that had been authorized for emergency use even after the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA granted full approval to a different vaccine Comirnaty According to the complaint the DOD capitalized on a quintessential bait and switch fraud using the fact that Comirnaty was FDA approved to bolster its claims that the vaccine authorized for emergency use was safe and effective in a move that intentionally misled millions of Americans The DOD did this despite being fully aware that drugs granted Emergency Use Authorization EUA cannot legally be marketed as safe and effective because the FDA standard for EUA is only that drugs may be effective That means the DOD intentionally without justification and with disregard for the risks misrepresented an experimental vaccine as safe and effective when it could not legally use that terminology the lawsuit states As a result the lawsuit alleges George Watts Jr was misled into taking the investigational vaccine and he died as a result Attorney Michael Baum told The Defender in an email This groundbreaking case filed by George Watts Jr s surviving family may provide a path for other Covid vaccine injured individuals to seek recovery for their injuries The Watts family s complaint shines a light on the willful steps the Department of Defense took that led to Mr Watts Pfizer vaccine induced death from myocarditis Most people are unaware of the Department of Defense s directing the development and distribution of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid vaccine The DOD s actions led to Mr Watts improper injection with the unapproved vaccine The Watts family s case

when in the summer of 2021 the school mandated the COVID 19 vaccine for all students attending fall classes The mandate was part of the mandate at the State University of New York SUNY a network of 64 colleges and universities Watts waited to get vaccinated until the FDA approved the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine and got his first dose at Guthrie Robert Packer Hospital in Pennsylvania on Aug 27 2021 He was administered the EUA Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 vaccine The FDA approved the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine on Aug 23 2021 but the DOD didn t make it available Despite experiencing side effects from the first dose Watts understood the vaccine to be safe and effective so he took a second dose at the same location on Sept 17 2021 Following the second dose Watts experienced more severe side effects including numbness in his extremities difficulty grasping and holding objects a sinus infection cough and sensitivity to light He visited the ER at the Guthrie hospital on Oct 12 2021 also complaining of a lump on the left side of his neck The hospital diagnosed him with sinusitis and prescribed an antibiotic Watts returned to the ER on October 19 2021 concerned that he was not improving After that his health continued to decline On Oct 27 2021 at home with his mother Watts began coughing up blood and then became unresponsive His mother called 911 and administered CPR Watts was taken to the ER where he was found to be in cardiac arrest and subsequently died He had no previous medical history that could explain his sudden death Watts also tested negative for COVID 19 in a post mortem test

announced Operation Warp Speed a partnership between the White House and the DOD to accelerate the development production and distribution of a COVID 19 vaccine Two months later the DOD signed a contract with Pfizer to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses of its mRNA COVID 19 vaccine guaranteeing that any vaccine produced under the contract would be protected under the PREP Act and therefore not subject to liability The FDA issued an EUA for the Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 vaccine on Dec 11 2020 and Army Gen Gustave F Perna Operation Warp Speed chief operating officer announced the vaccine would be rapidly distributed across the country Drugs fully approved by the FDA must be found to be safe pure and potent but EUA drugs are held to a lower standard they are required only to demonstrate that they may be effective according to the FDA But Perna and his boss Austin III conveyed the message that the EUA vaccines were safe and effective and urged the healthcare community to do the same in order to counter widespread misinformation about the vaccines the lawsuit alleges After the FDA approved the Comirnaty vaccine the DOD did not initiate its production and distribution but instead continued to distribute existing Pfizer EUA products As a result although Watts waited for the COVID 19 vaccine to be FDA approved he still received a version of the vaccine that had not been FDA approved as safe and effective According to the lawsuit the DOD blurred the line between the two legally distinct vaccines promoting the idea that the COVID 19 vaccine was FDA approved and therefore safe and effective while administering the vaccine that was only authorized and therefore not legally allowed to be described as safe The DOD knowingly blurred this line the lawsuit alleges because it had already been found liable for violating informed consent and of imposing an experimental vaccine In the 2004 case of Doe v Rumsfeld et al a federal court ruled the DOD could not mandate the EUA anthrax vaccine for service members because forcing them to take an experimental vaccine violated their right to informed consent That ruling stated that absent informed consent or a presidential waiver The United States cannot demand that members of the armed forces also serve as guinea pigs for experimental drugs The current lawsuit further alleges that the DOD knowingly

the DOD under the PREP Act It concludes that Watts died because he believed he was receiving safe and effective vaccines but in fact received the deadly ones The lawsuit seeks general special compensatory and punitive damages Commenting on the significance of the case Kim Mack Rosenberg acting outside general counsel for CHD told The Defender The PREP Act purports to provide an extraordinary liability shield to the government manufacturers distributors and others related to COVID 19 vaccines and other so called countermeasures covered by the act The Watts complaint is an important and unprecedented challenge to that liability shield The complaint threads the act s needle by pointing the finger squarely at Operation Warp Speed leadership while raising critical legal challenges to the act s protection particularly where as is alleged in the Watts complaint a defendant like the Department of Defense has engaged in willful misconduct But the complaint does more than that It will educate about the PREP Act s far reach actions by the DOD during the state of emergency and the general lack of accountability for entities and individuals protected by the PREP Act The public needs to understand that this act intentionally allows potentially bad actors to go unpunished Here a young man lost his life and the government has remained silent hiding behind a legal shield

The nasal vaccines would use spray drying technology also used in asthma inhalers that rapidly dries liquid with hot gas to form stable powders for respiratory delivery via the nose the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy reported According to CEPI nasal administration could help to achieve mucosal immunity which scientists believe is key for reducing virus transmission The vaccine would remain stable at room temperature which would eliminate the need for cold chain logistics used by existing mRNA vaccines making the products accessible to poorer countries CEPI added

RNA vaccines Christian Plank Ph D chief technology officer at Ethris said If successful this approach has the potential to transform vaccine delivery and accessibility on a global scale However

with reports of children s deaths According to data from the U S government run Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS there were 48 reports of adverse events resulting in death in connection with FluMust including at least 23 deaths in children 17 and under VAERS data also show 11 121 adverse events have been reported following the administration of FluMist products including 947 that were classified as serious About half of the reports were for children 17 and under A 2011 Harvard study found that less than 1 of adverse events are reported to VAERS Still funding for new nasal vaccines has continued as they offer easy access to a key part of the immune system and are considered advantageous for manufacturers in terms of cost convenience and ease of administration and disposal In June 2024 the U S Department of Health and Human Services HHS granted 500 million for clinical trials of next generation nasal and oral COVID 19 vaccines The funding was awarded through

foreign intelligence agency the BND determined with 80 95 certainty in 2020 that the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic originated with a lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China but successive governments kept the information under lock and key according to a German investigative report The report published jointly on Wednesday by Die Zeit and Süddeutsche Zeitung was the result of an 18 month investigation The investigation found that in 2020 then German Chancellor Angela Merkel commissioned a BND operation code named Project Saaremaa that targeted Chinese agencies and research institutions When the BND s investigation concluded that a Wuhan lab leak was the most likely source of the COVID 19 pandemic the Merkel government prohibited the spy agency from releasing its results to the public In 2023 Merkel s successor outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz also refused to allow the BND to release its findings According to The German Review Merkel and Scholz kept this information secret for reasons that aren t totally clear Did two consecutive federal governments first the grand coalition under Angela Merkel CDU and then the trafficking coalition under Olaf Scholz SPD muzzle the BND perhaps to prevent a painful debate with global political repercussions the investigative report asked While this information remained secret proponents of the lab leak theory were often derided as conspiracy theorists a narrative fueled by the publication of the Proximal Origin paper in Nature Medicine in 2020 which concluded that COVID 19 was the result of zoonotic or animal to human transfer A U S House of Representatives report found that Dr Anthony Fauci played a key role in the drafting and subsequent publication of the Proximal Origin paper According to the investigative report the German government abruptly changed its stance in late 2024 It will now allow the BND to inform the country s parliamentary body the Bundestag and the World Health Organization about its findings The German government also now plans to advocate for strict global restrictions on controversial gain of function research Such research which increases the transmissibility or

said most political commentators are uneasy with the science and can only assess the issue on political grounds Rutgers University molecular biologist Richard Ebright Ph D a critic of gain of function research said All informed persons without exception knew by early 2020 that SARS CoV 2 likely entered humans through a research related incident in Wuhan But most chose to lie or stay silent This included not only the scientific establishment but also the intelligence agencies of the U S and Germany Ebright said The FBI had evidence in 2021 that the virus leaked from a lab but wasn t allowed to present it The Wall Street Journal reported last year Investigative journalist Paul D Thacker said major U S news outlets have not reported on the German investigation because it doesn t fit their politics At a press conference Wednesday Scholz declined to comment on the investigative report Representatives for Merkel and the BND also refused to comment BND found Wuhan lab had unusually large amount of knowledge about leak A group of BND investigators including a virologist was tasked with investigating COVID 19 s origins early in 2020 The agents struck gold in Wuhan discovering unpublished data and internal documents that pointed toward a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology Investigators found a series of measurements and data dealing with coronaviruses and information on animal experiments and several scientific studies including unpublished dissertations from 2019 and 2020 The doctoral theses allegedly dealt with the effects of coronaviruses on the human brain the report stated They also found that security precautions at the Wuhan lab were apparently surprisingly lax The material BND uncovered suggests that in Wuhan an unusually large amount of knowledge about

certainty that a leak occurred at the Wuhan lab The BND took its findings to the German Chancellery and to Merkel herself later in 2020 But according to the report the Chancellery saw two problems It questioned the reliability of BND s findings and also appeared reluctant to enter into what had since become a geopolitical conflict between the U S and China The German government was wedged between two global rivals and the conflict had the potential to become a global political explosion And in the middle stood the BND with its data documents and interpretations the report stated As a result The Chancellery decided to do nothing and the BND was sworn to silence According to The German Review while the political logic of this decision may be understandable the decision to keep the BND s findings secret meant that it was ignoring appeals by the World Health Organisation to pass on any information that could help determine the cause of the pandemic This policy of silence continued under the new Scholz led government which took power in late 2021 According to the investigative report although the expert council on the coronavirus pandemic appointed by Chancellor Scholz met 33 times it did not learn of the BND s findings nor did the public The German government maintained this stance even after determinations by the U S Department of Energy in February 2023 and by the FBI in March 2023 that SARS CoV 2 likely emerged as a result of a lab leak In December 2024 the BND was allowed to share its findings with scientists and intelligence services A CIA report released in

and host of a COVID 19 related podcast heard by millions was a proponent of the zoonotic theory and was linked to Wuhan scientists The German Review noted that Drosten had been intimately involved in lobbying for gain of function research and had collaborated on research with Shi Zhengli Ph D widely known as the Bat Lady on viruses adapted to human cell cultures The German investigative report found that the Wuhan Institute of Virology engaged in gain of function research Zhengli headed the Wuhan lab which received funding from the National Institutes of Health NIH for gain of function research According to the report gain of function research is high risk The potential for misuse is high and the line between responsible and irresponsible is thin Yet the lab appears to be overstepping boundaries by continuing such research at present The German Review noted that during the COVID 19 pandemic Drosten said lab leaks were extremely implausible Yet in an interview last

latest Transparency Report to the European Union nearly 90 of requests to the social media platform for information on users who posted illegal or harmful speech came from just one country Germany You

member states in connection with not just illegal speech and yes national legislation in EU countries includes many speech crimes but also legal speech that is deemed harmful This is the real innovation involved in the EU s Digital Services Act DSA It creates an obligation for platforms to take action in the form of content moderation against not just illegal content but also ostensibly harmful content such as disinformation Note that in the period covered in X s latest DSA Transparency Report to the EU on its content moderation efforts nearly 90 of such requests for information on the purveyors of ostensibly illegal or harmful speech came from just one country Germany See the chart below Note that X also takes action against posts or accounts for illegal or harmful speech that is reported to it by EU member states or the European Commission Such action may involve deletion or geo blocking withholding of content But as the enforcement options linked in the report make clear it can also involve various forms of visibility filtering or restricting engagement by our Freedom of Speech Not Reach enforcement philosophy as the report puts it Here again Germany is top of the table having submitted 42 of all the reports to X on illegal or harmful speech and nearly 50 of the reports from member states See the chart below Germany submitted nearly twice as many reports as any other member state France finished a distant second and over 10 times more reports than comparably sized Italy The European Commission submitted around 15 of the reports It is also notable that Germany submitted by far the most reports on content entailing negative effects on civic discourse or elections yet another category of speech that is clearly not illegal per se but that is deemed harmful enough under the DSA regime to require suppression Hence while the content is not per se illegal it would be illegal for platforms under the DSA not to suppress it This ambiguity is at the

during the COVID 19 pandemic period and have not returned to their pre pandemic levels according to a report published last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the World Health Organization WHO The report which analyzed progress toward measles elimination between 2000 2023 cited a 20 global surge in measles cases between 2022 and 2023 yet researchers also found that the number of deaths from measles declined by 8 Falling vaccination rates are driving the rise in cases the report concluded During the pandemic estimated global coverage with one dose of a two dose measles containing vaccine declined to 81 they reported CDC data published last year showed that in the last two decades global measles vaccination rates had been rising steadily from 72 in 2000 to 86 in 2019 They fell 5 percentage points in 2021 to 81 but then inched up to 83 in 2022 Globally approximately 83 of children received their first dose of the measles vaccine in 2023 and 74 got their recommended second dose the health organizations said More than 22 million children missed getting vaccinated altogether the health agencies said in a press conference that accompanied the report Health officials credited the vaccines for averting 60 3 million measles deaths between 2000 2023 Most of the estimated 107 500 reported deaths globally from measles in 2023 occurred in the African region a WHO spokesperson said which was published in the CDC s online Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Measles deaths most commonly occur in low income countries and countries experiencing fragile conflict affected and vulnerable settings which exacerbate inequities the report said According to the report vaccination coverage is also the lowest in such countries The researchers concluded that higher vaccination rates particularly in vulnerable countries would be necessary to eliminate measles The link they draw between lower vaccination rates and higher case numbers is

continue to focus on increasing vaccination rates rather than on tackling broader issues of public health Historically and everywhere measles prevalence disappears when living conditions improve said Denis Rancourt Ph D an excess mortality researcher and lead scientist for more than 20 years at the University of Ottawa in Canada Rancourt who also studies the effect of poverty on mortality suggested that addressing poverty and improving public health and political stability through investments in economic infrastructure not through military interventions and vaccination campaigns would be a more effective strategy He added Giving these vaccines to impoverished and oppressed populations whether domestic or foreign is an evil and cynical exercise motivated by corporate greed and

countries including the entire region of the Americas are free of endemic measles despite media reports claiming that measles rates are skyrocketing in Canada and the U S and that anti vaccine

vaccine He noted that the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS has logged 254 reports for mortalities associated with the vaccine in the U S In addition to tracking vaccination rates the researchers also tracked reported measles cases and identified the genotypes or variants of measles types circulating There are 24 known measles genotypes but only 19 have been seen since 1990 and only four have been seen since 2018 Jablonowski pointed out that the measles vaccine is based on genotype A yet the report identified types B3 and D8 as circulating Genotype D8 is about as far removed

Fertility Exposure to glyphosate based herbicides even at safe levels can damage reproductive organs and affect the fertility of the exposed individual and future generations Fortunately there are ways to limit your exposure You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up Story at a glance Research shows that glyphosate exposure even at safe levels causes hormone imbalance oxidative stress and permanent damage to reproductive organs like the ovaries and uterus Exposure reduces estrogen and follicle stimulating hormone FSH while increasing testosterone and progesterone creating conditions similar to polycystic ovarian syndrome or PCOS It also impairs egg quality and lowers the chance of successful fertilization and implantation Glyphosate alters gene expression in the uterus of offspring who were never directly exposed These inherited disruptions impact fertility for your children and grandchildren The chemical shuts down mitochondria blocks detox enzymes and depletes essential minerals setting off a chain reaction that affects everything from hormone production to brain function Avoiding glyphosate contaminated food filtering your water eliminating seed oils and healing your gut are key steps to reverse its impact and regain reproductive and metabolic health Glyphosate based herbicides now account for 19 of all herbicides used globally with over 240 million pounds sprayed annually across American farmlands However glyphosate doesn t stay in the soil it shows up in your body as well In fact measurable glyphosate residues have been detected in the urine of 60 to 80 of the general U S population including pregnant women and children meaning you re likely carrying trace amounts of this chemical Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Roundup a product first released by Monsanto in the 1970s It s often marketed as safe because humans don t have the same enzyme pathways it targets in plants However our gut bacteria do have this pathway so it can affect the gut microbiome As explained in Stephanie Seneff Ph D s book Toxic Legacy glyphosate also binds strongly to toxic metals such as aluminum and has been shown to make the intestinal barrier

they accumulate over time increasing your risk of infertility developmental issues in your offspring and chronic reproductive diseases that might not surface until much later in life Even safe levels of glyphosate disrupt your reproductive system The research reviewed a mix of healthy animals pregnant females and cell lines exposed to levels of glyphosate considered safe by regulatory standards Despite these being acceptable the exposure still caused hormone imbalance oxidative stress damage to developing eggs and shifts in gene expression that could impact future pregnancies These effects showed up repeatedly in different test models Glyphosate causes visible damage to the ovaries In female piglets fed glyphosate contaminated feed researchers observed visible ovarian damage tissue shrinkage fat accumulation and cell calcification In rats exposed in utero the number of healthy follicles which hold your eggs decreased significantly while abnormal ones increased The damage is permanent as follicles don t regenerate once damaged Hormone disruption from glyphosate mimics PCOS like patterns Animals exposed to glyphosate showed adverse hormone effects Estrogen and FSH levels dropped while testosterone and progesterone rose Without healthy estrogen and FSH levels your eggs won t mature properly and the uterus will not be prepared for pregnancy In one study glyphosate increased signals like luteinizing hormone releasing hormone pushing hormone rhythms toward a PCOS like state which makes conception harder and disrupts other systems like insulin sensitivity The uterus becomes overly sensitive to estrogen setting you up for disease Aside from suppressing estrogen glyphosate also makes the uterus respond too strongly to even low doses This hyper responsiveness is linked to endometrial hyperplasia a condition where the uterine lining grows too thick This raises the risk of irregular bleeding pain and endometrial cancer Rats exposed to glyphosate showed changes that would make this overgrowth much more likely Collectively these findings raise concerns about potential associations between GBH glyphosate based herbicide exposure and female reproductive

with chemical boosters like polyoxyethylene tallow amine POEA to help it penetrate plant cells These additives make this chemical even more toxic Aromatase the enzyme that turns testosterone into estrogen was severely inhibited when glyphosate and POEA were used together That disruption happened even at doses 100 times lower than the amount sprayed on crops showing just how potent the mix really is Hormonal imbalance caused by glyphosate breaks reproductive rhythm When aromatase is blocked estrogen drops and testosterone builds up This shift messes up your entire reproductive system cycles become irregular ovulation becomes unreliable and your uterus is unable to support implantation Even if you manage to conceive your body will not be able to maintain a healthy pregnancy Glyphosate damages eggs at the cellular level making pregnancy harder In mouse studies glyphosate interfered with spindle fibers in the egg these are structures that organize chromosomes during cell division When those break down eggs don t mature correctly and could carry genetic defects Glyphosate also drained zinc and raised oxidative stress by increasing harmful reactive oxygen species or ROS damaging egg membranes DNA and internal protein structures that are needed for fertilization Oxidative stress skyrockets while your antioxidant defenses are wiped out One study showed glyphosate exposure raised malondialdehyde or MDA which is a sign of oxidative cell damage At the same time your natural antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase or SOD and glutathione peroxidase or GPx were suppressed That means your body s clean up crew was disabled just when the damage was ramping up This is especially dangerous in tissues like the ovaries and uterus which are highly sensitive to hormonal and oxidative shifts Zinc depletion makes the damage worse and harder to stop Zinc helps the body fight oxidative stress but glyphosate grabs onto zinc and removes it from circulation In

these changes don t come with warning signs You could be losing egg quality disrupting your hormone rhythm or developing uterine abnormalities long before you notice irregular periods or fertility struggles That s the danger by the time symptoms show up much of the damage has already been done Glyphosate disrupts testosterone production in men Research published in Science of the Total Environment has shown that glyphosate also affects the production of testosterone in specialized cells called Leydig cells found in male testes The main role of Leydig cells is to produce testosterone in response to luteinizing hormone This testosterone is essential for male sexual development spermatogenesis and secondary sex characteristics According to this research glyphosate disrupts the normal function of these cells impacting their ability to produce testosterone Glyphosate interferes with the machinery within Leydig cells Think of it like how a factory works when one part breaks down the entire production is affected Basically glyphosate interferes with the intricate process of testosterone production in two main ways It disrupts the transport of cholesterol into the cell s machinery where testosterone is made Cholesterol is the building block of testosterone Normally a protein called steroidogenic acute regulatory protein or StAR moves cholesterol into the part of the cell where testosterone is produced However glyphosate inhibits the expression of StAR by activating another protein called NR1D1 As a result your cells don t get enough cholesterol which hinders testosterone production It triggers a form of programmed cell death called autophagy dependent ferroptosis This is a complex process where the cell begins to break down its own components autophagy coupled with iron related damage to its membranes ferroptosis ultimately leading to the destruction of the Leydig cells themselves So not only does glyphosate block the production line for testosterone but it also damages and kills the cells responsible for making it You can learn more about this in Low Level Chronic Glyphosate Linked to Fetal Harms and Reproductive Toxicity Glyphosate

entire body Researchers analyzed how glyphosate moves through tissue interferes with key metabolic pathways and shuts down systems responsible for detox energy production and inflammation control These disruptions are subtle at first but set the stage for long term health problems Glyphosate shuts down your mitochondria the energy engines in your cells The study revealed that glyphosate interferes with the electron transport chain inside your mitochondria where your body turns food into usable energy When this system breaks down your energy supply plummets especially in high demand tissues like your brain ovaries and adrenal glands That translates into sluggishness hormone imbalance and impaired recovery from stress or illness People with chronic health issues are especially vulnerable to glyphosate s effects The findings of this study are especially important if you re dealing with fatigue hormone problems autoimmune issues or unexplained symptoms Glyphosate doesn t need to target a specific organ It hits foundational systems like mitochondria liver enzymes and gut bacteria that support nearly every other function in your body Once those are disrupted symptoms start stacking up including brain fog digestive issues weight gain and low energy Detoxification grinds to a halt because key liver enzymes are blocked Glyphosate also interferes with cytochrome P450 enzymes which your liver uses to clear out toxins drugs and even hormones like estrogen When these enzymes slow down harmful compounds stay in your bloodstream longer That means elevated estrogen levels drug sensitivity and increased toxic buildup Brain chemistry suffers when glyphosate blocks key neurological enzymes Researchers found that glyphosate suppresses two enzymes monoamine oxidase MAO and acetylcholinesterase AChE MAO helps balance mood regulating neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin while AChE breaks down acetylcholine which is essential for memory and mental

re dealing with irregular cycles fatigue brain fog or just want to safeguard your future here are five strategies to minimize your exposure to this toxic chemical 1 Switch to organic produce If you re not ready to go fully organic and honestly most people aren t overnight start with the Environmental Working Group s EWG Dirty Dozen list These are the fruits and vegetables with the highest pesticide residues and glyphosate is often the main culprit By replacing these pesticide loaded conventional produce with organic versions you slash your glyphosate intake without overhauling your entire diet Washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly especially if they are not organic also helps remove pesticide residues Read Want an Efficient and Inexpensive Way to Wash Your Produce for more useful tips 2 Eliminate non organic wheat and legumes Glyphosate is sprayed not just on genetically modified organisms GMO crops but also on conventional wheat barley and chickpeas as a drying agent right before

often contaminated with glyphosate If you re using a basic filter or no filter at all that s not enough Install a high quality whole house reverse osmosis water filtration system or look for spring water that s independently tested for pesticide residue 5 Heal your gut to repair the damage glyphosate has already caused Reducing exposure is only half the work If you ve already been exposed and based on the research almost everyone has you need to rebuild your internal defenses Start by restoring beneficial bacteria like Akkermansia muciniphila which support your gut barrier and immune system Add slowly digested carbs like root vegetables and properly prepared white rice once your digestion stabilizes If you re struggling with irregular periods unexplained fatigue infertility or chronic bloating addressing glyphosate exposure could be the missing piece The sooner you start lowering that load the faster your body gets back to what it was built to do repair balance and thrive Frequently asked questions FAQs about glyphosate s reproductive effects Q How does glyphosate affect female fertility A Glyphosate disrupts the hormones required for ovulation and egg maturation including estrogen and FSH while raising testosterone and progesterone It also causes direct damage to ovarian tissue and developing eggs increasing the risk of infertility and conditions like PCOS and endometriosis even at exposure levels deemed safe by regulators Q Can glyphosate exposure harm future generations A Yes Glyphosate exposure during pregnancy causes epigenetic changes alterations in how genes are read without changing the DNA sequence These changes were shown to affect the uteruses of offspring who weren t directly exposed meaning damage is passed on to your children and grandchildren Q What other health systems does glyphosate disrupt besides reproduction A Glyphosate interferes with mitochondrial energy production detoxification enzymes in the liver and essential

herbicide patented in 1974 by Monsanto now owned by Bayer More than 20 years later the company developed genetically modified crops including soybean corn and cotton that could withstand direct exposure to the pesticide This allowed farmers to directly spray glyphosate onto crops eliminating weeds while sparing the crops themselves but also allowing some of it to contaminate water food soil dust and air A 2017 study found that Americans exposure to glyphosate grew by about 500 since Roundup Ready GM crops were introduced in the U S in 1996 and there has been widespread detection of glyphosate in human urine and blood including in pregnant women Federal regulators have maintained there are no risks to human health from the currently registered uses of glyphosate despite a lack of

for use in feed for farmed salmon The canola was genetically engineered to contain healthy omega 3 long chain fatty acids The GM canola called NS B50027 4 was developed as a land based source of marine fishy fatty acids This is being touted as an environmental benefit since farmed salmon are normally fed on fish oil to boost their omega 3 levels Wild fish get their omega 3 from eating algae But wild fish stocks are depleted and the price of fish oil has risen meaning that the amount of fish oil in salmon feed has decreased markedly in recent years The Aquaterra omega 3 canola oil is being promoted as sustainable in the media by Nofima a Norwegian research institute that conducts research and development for the aquaculture industry Its scientists carried out research on Aquaterra omega 3 canola oil They concluded that when salmon have a diet containing the oil they get more omega 3 in their flesh better pigmentation and fewer dark spots qualities designed to appeal to the health conscious consumer Deformed butterflies Taking the pressure off wild fish stocks by growing GM oilseeds that produce health enhancing long chain omega 3 fatty acids might seem like a good idea However a study has found that these fish oils novel in land based ecosystems cause wing deformities in butterflies The study was not on GM canola but on the fish oils that such GM crops are engineered to contain The researchers found that when the long chain omega 3 fatty acids found in fish oil eicosapentaenoic acid EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA were fed to cabbage white butterflies the insects grew into heavier adults and had a higher frequency of wing deformities The team was careful to test realistic doses that might be expressed in GM omega 3 producing crops and ingested by

genetically engineered crops and seeds promised that the technology would reduce pesticide use However a new study confirms that industrial agriculture s use of genetic engineering technologies has caused pesticide use to soar You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up By Claire Robinson Genetically modified GM crops have increased agriculture s dependence on pesticides rather than reducing it a study published in April found Drawing on data from four GM crops Bt cotton herbicide tolerant HT soybean HT and or Bt maize and HT canola the researchers including agricultural development expert professor Glenn Davis Stone from Washington and Lee University and Bt cotton expert K R Kranthi of the International Cotton Advisory Committee traced the surge in chemical use over three decades They found a paradox while GM seeds were supposed to reduce pesticide use their introduction caused pesticide use to soar The researchers explain this outcome using the Jevons paradox an economic theory that dates back to 1865 British economist William Stanley Jevons argued that efficiency in resource use often leads to more not less consumption The study applies this idea to GM crops which were claimed to reduce pesticide use but in reality have made it skyrocket The researchers consider the two most prevalent GM seed pesticide technology regimes Bt crops and herbicide tolerant HT crops Both seeds are billed as efficient technologies HT crops are claimed to facilitate more efficient weed control and Bt crops are claimed to control insect pests more efficiently However the researchers found that Like other technological efficiencies the increased use of GM crops over the past 30 years has not contributed to input reductions nor to land reclamations but to the expansion of agricultural land and increased use of the very pesticides these technologies are purported to curtail This is due to the complexity of agricultural systems The efficiencies of GM crops not only lower the cost for individual farmers to use in aggregate more pesticides they also make those pesticides ever more essential to the political economy of agriculture through the input intensive monocultures in which they are embedded In fact increases in chemical usage occur throughout these GM crop systems because technological substitutions like GM seeds cannot be separated from their cascading impacts on labour weed and pest ecology or agricultural decision making Bt cotton in India Farmers buy more insecticides than ever The authors consider the example of GM Bt cotton in India

treadmill of higher expenses and increased pesticide use The authors comment The irony is that the wide adoption of Bt cotton a technology with the express purpose of reducing insecticide sprays is itself a key reason that Indian farmers apply more insecticides to their fields now There is simply much more cotton now grown in India and it is planted in monocultures that demand more of many kinds of resources This is agricultural elasticity With new social and biological technologies like Bt cotton seeds and fertilizer subsidies cotton cropping can expand and farmers can intensify their efforts as capitalist cotton producers These complex interactions only emerge after time complicating the original technological efficiency of spraying less by requiring more inputs like fertilizers land and water GM crops and chemical use The study shows that this pattern was also found in the U S with GM herbicide tolerant crops These crops initially made weed management more efficient as farmers could save labor costs as well as spraying only broad spectrum glyphosate which is cheaper than other herbicides And crucially they could apply glyphosate herbicide to the growing crop without fear of killing it The result was a dramatic escalation in glyphosate application particularly in soybean cultivation Among U S farmers the number of soybean acres treated with glyphosate jumped from 9 2 million to 113 million between the pre HT year of 1994 and 2018 During this time the number of soybean hectares rose from 24 9 million to 36 1 million and the percentage of area treated with glyphosate rose from 15 to 87 Monsanto now Bayer promoted glyphosate as a weedkiller with a complex mode of action that would delay resistance in weeds But this claim turned out to be false as the study emphasises As glyphosate resistant weeds spread farmers had to spray more of the chemical When glyphosate alone failed to control the weeds manufacturers created GM crops tolerant to even more

farmers had to spray more of the chemical When glyphosate alone failed to control the weeds manufacturers created GM crops tolerant to even more toxic chemicals such as dicamba and 2 4 D Farmers began spraying these chemicals as well as glyphosate As the authors of the new study point out These herbicides add yet more externalised public cost in the form of volatile herbicide drift Likewise in Argentina Brazil and Canada GM crops promised simpler weed control but delivered higher herbicide use In modern chemical intensive agriculture farmers adopt GM crops they use more chemicals pests and weeds adapt and companies develop new GM traits and chemicals which farmers buy again The researchers call this an agricultural efficiency trap With the GM crops examined in the study at first there is an appearance of greater efficiency and productivity But over time farmers are locked into systems that increase pesticide use and raise long term costs Those costs include externalized ones like deforestation soil degradation water pollution plant damage from spray drift and labor exploitation Whole systems approach needed The researchers write that it is not useful to analyse the effects of GM crops on the level of individual elements like resource use chemical input or land use Instead agricultural efficiencies are best analyzed at a system level to account for the complex social ecological and political factors at play that skew different parts of the production system Beyond the GM crops issue an example given by the researchers is irrigation technologies which allow for more efficient use of aquifer resources enabling agriculture to expand to use more water across a larger landscape and in higher value more water intensive crops The end result will be increased demand for and use of water Another example is land sparing Powerful lobbies are calling for what they term the sustainable intensification of agriculture the idea that maximising yield from existing farmland by increasing fertilizer and pesticide use will theoretically spare land for nature The researchers point out that this is a discredited notion because Increasing efficiencies generally induce agricultural expansion Statistical models considering yields and forest loss across the tropics conclude that expansion is more common than land sparing especially when political economic conditions encourage private land accumulation create new demands for products or allow new land to be developed The researchers conclude GM crops are simply the latest of many technological innovations that have enabled a form of capitalist agriculture to persist HT crops exemplify this with their clear connection to rises in glyphosate use Farmers around the world especially over the

mustard greens are engineered to be less bitter than traditional mustard greens so they can be eaten raw in a salad the company said Bayer plans to amp up distribution selling the greens in U S

have been pushed by food giants like Monsanto purchased by Bayer in 2018 as a solution for all types of challenges in agriculture including promises to feed the world Proponents say GE foods increase

into food and exacerbated existing problems GMO crops also have faced widespread rejection by consumers concerned with the health and environmental impacts of the foods despite efforts by the powerful and well funded pro GMO lobby to undermine those concerns At first genetic engineering worked by inserting genes from one species into another That s why the products were often called transgenic For

Efficacy of Genetically Modified Crops and Foods said this claim is false Gene editing is unquestionably a GM technique that produces GMOs It falls under the definition of a GMO in EU law and in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety she said Also gene editing can and does introduce foreign DNA both intentionally and unintentionally Robinson said the real difference between older style transgenic GM techniques and gene editing is that in older style GM the insertion of the GM gene s into the genome of the host organism is random whereas gene editing begins with the creation of a break across the double strands of the DNA at a particular targeted location in the genome The creation of a double strand DNA break triggers DNA repair mechanisms which depending on the gene editing experiment setup can lead to genetic material being added removed or altered at this location she said Claims that this gene editing is precise she said stem from the targeted nature of that double strand DNA break However she said That is where gene editing s precision ends The cell s own repair machinery repairs the DNA break that CRISPR made That repair process is inherently imprecise Robinson said and can result in widespread mutations or DNA damage throughout the genome These mutations could result in altered gene function and biochemistry of the plant which could include the production of novel toxins and allergens and unpredictable effects on the environment and farming Robinson said That s why many scientists have called for gene editing to remain strictly regulated she added U S has little regulation for gene edited foods The EU has strict regulations on GMOs but that isn t the case in the U S Under the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology the U S Department of

both law and science The ruling is a rebuke of the first Trump administration s efforts to practically eliminate oversight of novel GE technology and instead let industry self regulate Previously nearly all GE plants went through agency approval before experimental planting and again before any commercial use Center for Food Safety and allies sued the USDA in 2021 to reverse this rollback arguing that the rule change violated numerous environmental laws including the Endangered Species Act the National Environmental Policy Act and the Plant Protection Act The court held that the regulations violated the Plant Protection Act and the Administrative Procedure Act The court s decision sharply criticized the defendant federal agency for its abrupt reversal after more than a decade of recognizing the harms of novel GE technology The court at various points held the agency decision was in direct conflict with the conclusion of its own experts and was based on perception and beliefs that are merely asserted as fiat untethered to a clear and sound analysis Despite USDA s repeated admissions of the need for stronger not lesser regulations the rule unlawfully ignored these concerns of GE crops risks As such the court found that the rule did not address a single one of these issues that the agency itself previously raised The court also found that the exemption of GE

want to hear from you Contact Us Additional background Now in commercial production for several decades GE crop systems are well known to cause several significant agricultural and environmental harms Such harms include organic and conventional crop contamination from GE crops and market closures the significant increase in pesticide use and the proliferation of pesticide resistant superweeds Because the vast majority of genetically modified organisms GMOs are engineered to be resistant to weed killing pesticides they have dramatically increased the amount of these chemicals sprayed in U S agriculture These GE herbicide resistant crop systems have triggered an epidemic of herbicide immune weeds which now infest 120 million acres leading to a toxic spiral of weeds immune to ever more herbicides and increased spraying of toxic chemical cocktails to kill them Genetically engineered crops including rice alfalfa corn and many others have caused farmers billions of dollars in market losses from transgenic contamination of conventional or organic crops as food companies and foreign markets reject tainted supplies The USDA has repeatedly acknowledged the need for stronger GE crop regulations since 2000 when Congress enacted the Plant Protection Act giving the agency broad new authority to prevent agricultural economic and environmental harms After several false starts to implement this new authority beginning in 2004 nearly a decade and a half later in 2020 the USDA under the prior Trump administration reversed course and dramatically weakened its oversight of GE organisms Instead of strengthening rules that were already anemic the 2020 revisions either exempt most GE crops from any regulation or subject them to cursory reviews that sidestep serious analysis of their actual harms Statements from other plaintiffs on the decision A growing body of science shows that GE crops dramatically escalate toxic herbicide use causing harm to farmers rural communities and biodiversity USDA needs to urgently prioritize a high standard of oversight for GE organisms to evaluate real risks for people and the environment said Dana Perls program manager of Food and

Bill Melinda Gates Foundation and DARPA a division of the U S Department of Defense are funding research to genetically engineer tomatoes to be able to disrupt the reproductive cycle of the whitefly a common insect that damages tomato plants Critics of the technology said they aren t surprised the research is running into trouble You must be a CHD Insider to save this article Sign Up The Bill Melinda Gates Foundation is funding research to genetically engineer tomatoes to be able to disrupt the reproductive cycle of the whitefly a common insect that damages tomato plants Jon Fleetwood reported on Substack The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA a division of the U S Department of Defense also funded the research as part of its Insect Allies project according to a study on the tomatoes published last month in BMC Plant Biology Whiteflies or Bemisia tabaci are a common pest that drinks sap from phloem the food conducting tissue in tomato plant stems and leaves sometimes causing the plant to dry up The insects also excrete a sticky substance called honeydew which attracts ants Whiteflies can decimate crops The BMC study estimates the pest causes 2 billion in annual losses in cassava production in Africa alone which can cause food insecurity in regions that rely on the crop The researchers aim to develop a genetic modification GM technology that could modify plants to produce proteins that target and destroy whitefly eggs The authors note that targeting egg viability is a unique strategy for transgenic plants setting it apart from most GM insecticidal plants that target adult insects Fleetwood raised concerns about the technology s potential to harm human health and the environment If commercialized these t ransgenic plants genetically engineered to include genes from other species could introduce reproductive disrupting insecticidal compounds into the human food chain Fleetwood wrote He continued Tomatoes engineered with insecticides to disrupt reproduction may sound like a breakthrough but they raise critical questions about safety transparency and the ethics of modifying food crops to attack life at its reproductive core As these technologies develop consumers have a right to know Are these the risks we re willing to take with our food The DARPA Insect Allies program funds scalable readily deployable and generalizable countermeasures to natural and engineered threats to the U S food supply The program seeks to provide targeted therapies to mature plants within a single growing season However in this

the product remains far from commercialization he said Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us Study hits major barrier Fleetwood summarized the three mechanisms the genetically engineered tomatoes used to target whitefly egg viability Chitinase Production The tomatoes are engineered to produce an enzyme derived from the fern Tectaria macrodonta that degrades chitin a key component of insect eggshells This enzyme is intended to kill the developing embryos inside the eggs Reproductive Hijacking Using synthetic vitellogenin domains SynVg the proteins mimic natural reproductive pathways in whiteflies ensuring the insecticides are delivered directly into the eggs Enhanced Uptake Protein transduction domains PTD facilitate the transport of these insecticidal compounds from the insect s gut to its reproductive system Antoniou explained that to track how these mechanisms worked the researchers used a transgene that encodes an easily detectable fluorescent protein mCherry which allowed them to easily monitor whether the transgene was expressed Using mCherry they targeted plant parts the the phloem and the apoplast or space around the plant cells that the insects will eat In principle Antoniou said the pest would ingest any insecticidal protein expressed in these parts of the plant However when the researchers fed whiteflies the mCherry expressing GM tomatoes they did not detect the fluorescent protein in the insects including in their eggs as intended While the authors couldn t explain why the transgene was absent in the flies that ate the tomatoes they said an innate protein degrading defense mechanism in the eggs may have caused the issue Antoniou said The authors acknowledge that this natural defence mechanism constitutes a major barrier to taking this technology forward He also noted that because the researchers were initially having problems detecting the transgene in the engineered tomatoes they had to use suckers plants that grow from the roots of the host plant Problems of transgene expression silencing and more strikingly major deformities were observed in these sucker plant clones Antoniou said This is not unexpected given the known tendency for transgene silencing and the highly mutagenic nature of the GM transformation process as a whole which can lead to major DNA damage and disruptions in gene expression patterns This article was funded by critical thinkers like you The Defender is 100 reader supported No corporate sponsors No paywalls Our writers and editors rely on you to fund stories

chemical pesticide use but critics point to concerns about the unintended consequences of such technologies He criticized the study for failing to address the risks of disrupting reproduction in target species harming non target organisms and exposing humans to novel proteins Although the researchers experimented with an ornamental tomato variety applying this technology to food crops for human consumption raises health concerns Antoniou said He explained A crucial missing piece of information is whether the transgenes are expressed in mature tomato fruits If they are then the consumer would be ingesting insecticidal proteins with unknown health consequences Although this would not result in direct reproductive concerns in the case of the chitinase because humans including human eggs don t contain chitin there could be toxic or allergic reactions GM Watch Editor Claire Robinson said that because the GM technology used in the study focuses on the production of chitinase an enzyme that breaks down chitin it won t directly affect human fertility Chitin is only present in insects insect eggs and fungi and not in mammals including humans However that doesn t mean it s harmless to humans she said Ingesting this GMO produced insecticide may have adverse health effects on humans which are unpredictable It may also harm non target and beneficial insects whose exoskeletons and eggs contain chitin Robinson added Having said all that judging by the paper published in the journal this technology doesn t seem to be working well and Gates and DARPA need to face the reality that they will need to pump large amounts of funds into a project that may never succeed Insects can rapidly adapt to technologies and products intended to kill them and it s likely that even if this technology is developed to a point where it initially seems to work it could have a limited window of effectiveness", "chunk_id":

review of treatments for gender dysphoria in minors that was swiftly criticized in part because the names of its authors were withheld I am one of the authors As HHS said upon publication the review is going through the peer review process for which anonymity is preferred My co authors and I discussed additional reasons for anonymity including that disclosure might distract attention from the review s content or lead to personal attacks or professional penalties Those who have raised concerns about the field of pediatric gender medicine are well aware of the risks to reputations or careers The hostile response to the review by medical groups and practitioners underscores why it was necessary Medicalized treatment for pediatric gender dysphoria needs to be dispassionately scrutinized like any other area of medicine no matter which side of the aisle is cheering it on But in the U S it has not been The review describes how the medicalized gender affirming care approach to treating pediatric gender distress endorsed by the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics rests on very weak evidence Puberty blockers followed by cross sex hormones compromise fertility and may cause lifelong sexual dysfunction among other adverse effects surgeries such as mastectomies remove healthy tissue and carry known risks of complications Medical procedures always have downsides but in this case no reliable research indicates that these treatments are beneficial to minors mental health One of the most important chapters provides an ethical analysis arguing that pediatric medical transition is ethically inappropriate because of its unfavorable risk benefit profile We agree with the health authorities in Sweden who reached the same conclusion in 2022 The argument is quite simple medical ethics 101 as one of my colleagues put it and does not rely on contested claims about consent or regret which is how the ethical debate is often framed", "chunk_id":

ultra processed foods something of a household phrase Once a term only used by nutritionists and food policy researchers to describe the most processed foods in the supply chain think chips and sodas packaged bread microwave dinners and even some yogurts ultra processing has become a calling card of the Make America Healthy Again MAHA movement The movement which is focused on addressing America s escalating health crisis by investigating food pharmaceuticals vaccines and environmental contaminants and has frequently platformed pseudoscience found a home in Donald Trump s administration after Kennedy endorsed the president Despite this rhetoric experts are skeptical that ultra processed foods will go anywhere Rather than reining in ultra processing the Trump administration s food policy has mostly undermined MAHA s stated goals The first report of the MAHA commission made headlines in May when it raised concerns about a chronic disease crisis in children Echoing language that Kennedy campaigned on the report argued that the American diet has shifted dramatically toward ultra processed foods and that nearly 70 of children s calories now come from UPFs contributing to obesity

occurring in the U S with inadequate oversight It s a big deal Trump had said alluding to the highly contested theory that the COVID 19 pandemic was caused by a lab leak related to such research in China Soon after researchers at the National Institutes of Health NIH spent weeks assessing experiments for risk and preparing a report for the White House on what studies to halt according to internal emails obtained by The Washington Post and interviews with two career staffers familiar with the process But after the director of the NIH s infectious disease institute signed off on the findings the politically appointed No 2 in command at the NIH Matthew Memoli overrode career staff according to the emails and staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not

administration to slash the federal work force and dismantle agencies The Environmental Protection Agency EPA said on Friday that it would eliminate its scientific research arm and begin firing hundreds of chemists biologists toxicologists and other scientists after denying for months that it intended to do so The move underscores how the Trump administration is forging ahead with efforts to slash the federal work force and dismantle federal agencies after the Supreme Court allowed these plans to proceed while legal challenges unfold Government scientists have been particular targets of the administration s large scale layoffs The decision to dismantle the EPA s Office of Research and Development had been widely expected since March when a leaked document that called for eliminating the office was first reported by The New York Times But until Friday the Trump administration maintained that no final decisions had been made The EPA s science office provides the independent

given by the Trump administration s Vaccine Czar offered a brief glimpse into the inner workings of the extremely secretive Operation Warp Speed OWS the Trump administration s public private partnership for delivering a COVID 19 vaccine to 300 million Americans by next January What was revealed should deeply unsettle all Americans During an interview with the Wall Street Journal published last Friday the captain of OWS career Big Pharma executive Moncef Slaoui confirmed that the millions of Americans who are set to receive the project s COVID 19 vaccine will be monitored via incredibly precise tracking systems that will ensure that patients each get two doses of the same vaccine and to monitor them for adverse health effects Slaoui also noted that tech giants Google and Oracle have been contracted as part of this tracking system but did not specify their exact roles beyond helping to collect and track vaccine data The day before the Wall Street Journal interview was published the New York Times published a separate interview with Slaoui where he referred to this tracking system as a very active pharmacovigilance surveillance system During a previous interview with the journal Science in early September Slaoui had referred to this system only as a very active pharmacovigilance system that would make sure that when the vaccines are introduced that we ll absolutely continue to assess their safety Slaoui has only recently tacked on the words tracking and surveillance to his description of this system during his relatively rare media interviews While Slaoui himself was short on specifics regarding this pharmacovigilance surveillance system the few official documents from OWS that have been publicly released offer some details about what this system may look like and how long it is expected to track the vital signs and whereabouts of Americans who receive a Warp Speed vaccine The pharmacovigilantes Two official OWS documents released in mid September state that vaccine recipients expected to include a majority of the U S population would be monitored for twenty four months after the first dose of a COVID 19 vaccine is administered and that this would be done by a pharmacovigilance system In the OWS document entitled From the Factory to the Frontlines the Department of Health and Human Services HHS and the Department of Defense DOD stated that because Warp Speed vaccine candidates use new unlicensed vaccine production methods that have limited previous data on safety in humans the long term safety of these vaccines will be carefully assessed using pharmacovigilance surveillance and Phase 4 post licensure clinical trials It continues The key objective of pharmacovigilance is to determine each vaccine s performance in real life scenarios to study efficacy and to discover any infrequent and rare side effects not identified in clinical trials OWS", "chunk_id":

surveillance and Phase 4 post licensure clinical trials It continues The key objective of pharmacovigilance is to determine each vaccine s performance in real life scenarios to study efficacy and to discover any infrequent and rare side effects not identified in clinical trials OWS will also use pharmacovigilance analytics which serves as one of the instruments for the continuous monitoring of pharmacovigilance data Robust analytical tools will be used to leverage large amounts of data and the benefits of using such data across the value chain including regulatory obligations In addition Moncef Slaoui and OWS s vaccine coordinator Matt Hepburn formerly a program manager at the Pentagon s controversial Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had previously published an article in the New England Journal of Medicine that stated that because some technologies have limited previous data on safety in humans the long term safety of these vaccines will be carefully assessed using pharmacovigilance surveillance strategies The use of pharmacovigilance on those who receive the vaccine is also mentioned in the official Warp Speed infographic which states that monitoring will be done in cooperation with the Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Protection CDC and will involve 24 month post trial monitoring for adverse effects In a separate part of that same document OWS describes one of its four key tenets as traceability which has three goals to confirm which of the approved vaccines were administered regardless of location private public to send a reminder to return for second dose and to administer the correct second dose Regarding a COVID 19 vaccine requiring more than one dose a CDC document associated with OWS states For most COVID 19 vaccine products two doses of vaccine separated by 21 or 28 days will be needed Because different COVID 19 vaccine products will not be interchangeable a vaccine recipient s second dose must be from the same manufacturer as their first dose Second dose reminders for vaccine recipients will be critical to ensure compliance with vaccine dosing intervals and achieve optimal vaccine effectiveness The CDC document also references a document published in August by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security associated with the Event 201 and Dark Winter simulations as informing its COVID 19 vaccination strategy The Johns Hopkins paper which counts Dark Winter co organizer Thomas Inglesby as one of its authors argues that existing passive reporting systems managed by the CDC and FDA should be retooled to create an active safety surveillance system directed by the CDC that monitors all COVID 19 vaccine recipients perhaps by short message service or other electronic mechanisms

documents that the pharmacovigilance surveillance system would intimately involve the FDA top FDA officials stated in September that they were barred from attending OWS meetings and told reporters they could not explain the operation s organization or when or with what frequency its leadership meets The FDA officials did state however that they are still allowed to interact with companies developing products for OWS STAT reported In addition the FDA has apparently set up a firewall between the vast majority of staff and the initiative Operation Warp Speed that appears to drastically limit the number of FDA officials with any knowledge of or involvement in Warp Speed The FDA s director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Janet Woodcock is the only FDA official listed as having any direct involvement in OWS and appears to be personally managing this firewall at the FDA Woodcock describes herself as a long time advocate for the use of big data in the evaluation of drug and vaccine safety and has been intimately involved in FDA precursors to the coming Warp Speed pharmacovigilance surveillance system known as Sentinel and PRISM both of which are discussed later in this report Woodcock is currently on a temporary leave of absence from her role as the director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research which allows her to focus her complete attention on overseeing aspects of OWS on behalf of the FDA s Office of the Commissioner Her temporary replacement at the FDA Patrizia Cavazzoni is very aligned with Janet and where the agency is going according to media reports Cavazzoni is a former executive at Pfizer one of the companies producing a vaccine for OWS That vaccine is set to begin testing in children as young as 12 years old The extreme secrecy of OWS has affected not only the FDA but also the CDC as a CDC expert panel normally involved in developing the government s vaccine distribution strategies was stonewalled by Matt Hepburn OWS s vaccine coordinator who bluntly refused to answer several of the panel s pointed questions about the highly secretive operation More secret contracts While Moncef Slaoui and Warp Speed documents

vaccine data as part of this system Neither Google nor Oracle however has announced receipt of a contract related to OWS and the DOD and HHS similarly have yet to announce the awarding of any Warp Speed contract to either Google or Oracle In addition searches on the U S government s Federal Register and on the official website for federally awarded contracts came up empty for any contract awarded to Google or Oracle that would apply to any such pharmacovigilance system or any other aspect of Operation Warp Speed Given my previous reporting on the use of a nongovernment intermediary for awarding OWS contracts to vaccine companies it seems likely that Warp Speed contracts awarded to Google and Oracle were made using a similar mechanism In an Oct 6 report for The Last American Vagabond I noted that 6 billion in Warp Speed contracts awarded to vaccine companies were made through Advanced Technology International ATI a government contractor that works mainly with the military and surveillance technology companies and whose parent company has strong ties to the CIA and the 2001 Dark Winter simulation HHS which is supposedly overseeing OWS claimed to have no record of at least one of those contracts Only one Warp Speed vaccine contract which did not involve ATI and was awarded directly by HHS s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority was recently obtained by KEI Online Major parts of the contract however including the section on intellectual property rights were redacted in their entirety If the Warp Speed contracts that have been awarded to Google and Oracle are anything like the Warp Speed contracts awarded to most of its participating vaccine companies then those contracts grant those companies diminished federal oversight and exemptions from federal laws and regulations designed to protect taxpayer interests in the pursuit of the work stipulated in the contract It also makes them essentially immune to Freedom of Information Act requests Yet in contrast to the unacknowledged Google and Oracle contracts vaccine companies have publicly disclosed that they received OWS contracts just not the terms or details of those contracts This suggests that the Google and Oracle contracts are even more secretive A major conflict of interest worth noting is Google s ownership of YouTube which recently banned on its massive multimedia

COVID 19 vaccine With Google now formally part of OWS it seems likely that any concerns about OWS s extreme secrecy and the conflicts of interest of many of its members particularly Moncef Slaoui and Matt Hepburn as well as any concerns about Warp Speed vaccine safety allocation and or distribution may be labeled COVID 19 vaccine misinformation and removed from YouTube From the NSA to the FDA the new PRISM Though the nature of this coming surveillance system for COVID 19 vaccine recipients has yet to be fully detailed by Warp Speed or the tech companies the operation has contracted OWS documents and existing infrastructure at the FDA offer a clue as to what this system could entail For instance the Warp Speed document From the Factory to the Frontlines notes that the pharmacovigilance system will be a new system created exclusively for OWS that will be buil t off of existing IT information technology infrastructure and will fill any gaps with new IT solutions It then notes that the COVID 19 vaccination program requires significant enhancement of the IT that will support enhancements and data exchange that are critical for a multi dose candidate to ensure proper administration of a potential second dose The document also states that all data related to the OWS vaccine distribution effort will be reported into a common IT infrastructure that will support analysis and reporting adding that this IT infrastructure will support partners with a broad range of tools for record keeping data on who is being vaccinated and reminders for second doses Though some Warp Speed documents hint as to the existing IT systems that will serve as the foundation for this new tracking system arguably the most likely candidate is the FDA managed Sentinel Initiative which was established in 2009 during the H1N1 Swine flu pandemic Like OWS itself Sentinel is a public private partnership and involves the FDA private business and academia According to its website Sentinel s main goal is to improve how FDA evaluates the safety and performance of medical products through big data with an additional focus on learning more about potential side effects

health care or vaccine production experience Woodcock s temporary replacement at the FDA Patrizia Cavazzoni is also very active in efforts to expand Sentinel STAT reported earlier this year that Cavazzoni previously served on the sterling committee of I MEDS an FDA industry partnership which allows drug makers to pay for use of the FDA s real world data system known as Sentinel to complete certain safety studies more quickly Sentinel has a series of collaborating partners that provide healthcare data and scientific technical and organizational expertise to the initiative These collaborating partners include intelligence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton tech giant IBM and major U S health insurance companies such as Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield among many others In addition Sentinel s Innovation Center which it describes as the program s test bed to identify develop and evaluate innovative methods is partnered with Amazon General Dynamics and Microsoft Sentinel also has a Community Building and Outreach Center which is managed by Deloitte consulting one of the largest consultancy firms in the world that is known for seeking to fill its ranks with former CIA officials The Sentinel system s specific surveillance program aimed at monitoring vaccine effectiveness is known as the Post licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring Program better known as PRISM Sentinel s PRISM was developed to monitor vaccine safety but to date has never been used to assess vaccine effectiveness PRISM was initially launched alongside the Sentinel Initiative itself in 2009 in response to the need to monitor the safety of the H1N1 influenza vaccine after it was licensed marketed and administered Yet as previously mentioned PRISM has yet to be used to assess the effectiveness of any vaccine while quietly expanding for nearly a decade which implies that the stakeholders in the Sentinel Initiative have a plan to implement this safety surveillance system at some point The name PRISM may remind readers of the National Security Agency NSA program of the same name that became well known throughout the United States following the Edward Snowden revelations",

this association it is worth noting that the NSA as well as the Department of Homeland Security DHS are now officially part of Operation Warp Speed and appear to be playing a role in the development of Warp Speed s pharmacovigilance surveillance system The addition of the NSA and the DHS to the initiative of course greatly increases the involvement of U S intelligence agencies in the operation which itself is dominated by the military and sorely lacking in civilian public health officials CyberScoop first reported in early September that members of the NSA s Cybersecurity Directorate were involved in OWS with their role as well as that of DHS being framed mainly as offering cybersecurity advice to the initiative However the NSA and DHS are also offering guidance and services to both the other federal agencies involved in Warp Speed as well as OWS contractors which now include Google and Oracle Google is well known for its cozy relationship with the NSA including its PRISM program and they have also backed NSA supported legislation that would make it easier to surveil Americans without a warrant Similarly Oracle is a longtime NSA contractor and also has ties to the CIA dating back to its earliest days as a company not unlike Google Notably Oracle and Google remain locked in a major legal battle over copyright issues that is set to be heard by the Supreme Court in the coming weeks and is expected to have major ramifications for the tech industry The public health panopticon In the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks the U S military attempted to institute a surveillance program so invasive that Congress defunded it just months after its creation due to public outrage Known as Total Information Awareness TIA the program sought to develop an all seeing surveillance apparatus managed by the Pentagon s DARPA and officially argued that invasive surveillance of the entire U S population was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks bioterrorism events and even naturally occurring disease outbreaks before they could take place Before it was disbanded TIA sought to collect Americans medical records fingerprints gait facial and iris biometric data drug

invisible enemy of faceless terrorists abroad and ensure citizens safety security and health Today Warp Speed officially takes aim at a new type of invisible enemy a microbe invisible to the naked human eye In the years after 9 11 the public pushback against TIA was fierce The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU claimed at the time that the surveillance effort would kill privacy in America because every aspect of our lives would be catalogued while mainstream media outlets warned that TIA was fighting terror by terrifying U S citizens Despite Congress officially defunding the program it later emerged that TIA was never actually shut down with its various programs having been covertly divided among the web of military and intelligence agencies that comprise the U S national security state Unlike in years past TIA s apparent successor OWS has received no pushback from mainstream media outlets or advocacy organizations with many of these same entities now placing blind faith in the secretive initiative and lionizing it as the only way to resolve the COVID 19 pandemic crisis The national security state has carefully learned from and studied its past failures while many Americans in contrast continue to place their trust in the very agencies and government entities that have lied the country into multiple wars tortured and maimed countless civilians abroad produced a series of failed states in order to plunder their resources and are currently facilitating the pillaging of the American economy by Wall Street and the Federal Reserve under the guise of relief Allowing these same entities to surveil and track a majority of Americans and to use the country s population as guinea pigs for unlicensed understudied and experimental vaccine technologies is a clear recipe for

conceivable area of our everyday lives from health care and fitness to education and finance The influence of Google is so vast yet so hidden that most people simply have no idea just how controlled they actually are Most of us would vehemently deny that something as simple as Google search results can manipulate us into thinking a certain way about a topic yet research clearly shows that this kind of subliminal influence is profoundly powerful Robert Epstein Ph D who has spent the last decade of his professional career exposing Google s manipulative and deceptive practices as a senior research psychologist for the American Institute of Behavioral Research and Technology has also demonstrated how easily Google can shift our political and societal landscape Without Google the technocrats dream of a One World Government would likely never happen as it relies on social engineering and AI Google is a frontrunner and expert in both and has the ability to control entire populations As noted by Epstein in the interview above Google poses three unique threats to society They re a surveillance agency with significant yet hidden surveillance powers Google Search Google

thus deciding what people can and cannot see While Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act makes free speech possible for everyone it also allows Google and other online platforms to filter out and censor whatever they want The most crushing problem with this kind of internet censorship is that you don t know what you don t know If a certain type of information is removed from a search and you don t know it should exist somewhere you ll never go looking for it And when searching for information online how would you know that certain websites or pages have been removed from the search results in the first place The answer is you don t For example Google has been investing in DNA repositories for quite a long time and is adding DNA information to our profiles According to Epstein Google has taken over the national DNA repository but articles about that which he has cited in his own writings have all vanished They have the power to manipulate public opinion through search rankings and other means and the shifts in thinking produced are both rapid and enormous For example Epstein has demonstrated that Google has the ability to shift voting preferences among undecided voters by a whopping 48 to 63 and the power to determine 25 of global elections What s more this manipulation is entirely undetectable and untraceable The many reasons to ditch Google As a

the TSA digital ID is now accepted at 29 airports across the U S Along with the launch of digital versions of U S passports Google announced that it is expanding the number of states that allow residents to add their driver s licenses and state issued ID cards to Google Wallet We recently expanded the ability for Android users in California to save their state issued ID or driver s license

can be used for things like online tax filing signing a home loan opening a bank account or signing up for medical benefits all from your phone And the industry is working to make these things happen This will take time Legislation hardware updates and behavior change don t happen overnight We re working with various parts of the ecosystem including companies designing hardware for ID acceptance to speed up in person adoption Stapelberg cited digital versions of U S passports as another means to accelerate the overall awareness adoption and use of digital IDs by creating new ways for people to get them But for Hinchliffe The goal has always been to implement digital ID on a massive scale so that you will essentially need one in order to participate in many aspects of society We saw this

Three and a half years ago I contracted Guillain Barré syndrome GBS after getting the Jansen Johnson Johnson J J viral vector vaccine for COVID 19 The neurological disorder has left me hobbled by numb hands and feet staggering around imbalanced and battling debilitating fatigue It has also left me and thousands of others feeling ignored and unheard by the government and the public health establishment I wrote about the experience in 2021 in The Boston Globe after the U S Food and Drug Administration attached a warning to the J J shot citing an unacceptable occurrence of this adverse effect At the time I bemoaned that it was so difficult to talk about vaccine side effects and argued that government and public health officials should just face up to them honestly People could handle the truth I said and everyone would benefit because acknowledging those rare occasions when things go wrong would allow vaccine makers to design a better product Three years later that still hasn t happened Public health officials cowed by the anti vax crowd stuck to the line that COVID 19 vaccines are safe and effective And an existing system to address people injured by vaccines established under President Ronald Reagan has been all but abandoned Of course vaccines save lives But the nothing to see here posture regarding legitimate vaccine side effects is preventing the government from having our backs and following up on flaws in the products in the same way it does when romaine lettuce or lunch meat gets contaminated or airbags don t function properly And as is well known in the medical profession there really is a flaw Several vaccines have a problem with GBS In 1976 the swine flu vaccine triggered so many cases it had to be discontinued Flu shots are associated with a slightly elevated risk During the pandemic the J J shot was effectively shut down in the U S for triggering at least 100 GBS cases and AstraZeneca s vaccine was linked to many hundreds more Do you have a news tip We want to hear from you Contact Us More recently makers of shingles and RSV vaccines have had to issues warnings about GBS Intuitively it makes sense GBS is

this problem After vaccine makers were given immunity from lawsuits to encourage product development the 1986 Childhood Vaccine Injury Act established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program VICP The program allows individuals harmed by vaccines to share what happened to them and receive compensation funded by a modest excise tax on vaccines Eligible shots include tetanus measles mumps rubella polio hepatitis B and influenza The cases are decided by special masters in the U S Court of Federal Claims Unfortunately that perfectly sensible system has been eclipsed by a flawed and hastily arranged program put in place after the 9 11 terrorist attacks the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program or CICP If during a public health emergency someone suffers an adverse side

public health emergency of our lifetime it has become clear that it is not up to the task Many claims have been summarily rejected and aside from one recent large award administrative masters had compensated a grand total of 15 individuals for less than 60 000 none of them for GBS So why not make the COVID 19 vaccines eligible under the VICP the program that has worked so much better To do so

acknowledge empirical truths and thereby give lawmakers and public health officials the cover they need to do nothing Some doctors including one of mine at a prestigious local hospital deny to this

t risk getting any type of shot for the rest of my life he looked at me with obvious disdain as if I was an anti vaxxer and rattled off what seemed like prepared talking points to deal with crazy

Ascension St Elizabeth Hospital in Appleton Wisconsin can go forward Outagamie County Circuit Court Judge Mark J McGinnis last month rejected all motions by hospital lawyers to dismiss charges by Scott Schara that his daughter died from intentional battery by doctors and nurses Schara in April sued Ascension St Elizabeth Hospital personnel alleging that they committed medical battery against his daughter a legal standard doctors don t typically face which led to Grace s wrongful death on Oct 13 2021 According to the complaint doctors and nurses defied the informed consent law fraudulently labeled his daughter as a DNR Do Not Resuscitate patient administered a lethal drug cocktail known to kill and blocked attempts to save the girl s life Due to hospital protocols Schara said his

fully inform a patient about the risks of a leg amputation but the patient does agree to have his leg amputated the brief stated This violates the duty to obtain informed consent under Wis Stat 448 30

charges in 18 page verdict form to jurors According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel before closing arguments Judge Mark McGinnis read the 18 page verdict form to jurors but it didn t include the battery charge Successfully arguing the civil battery claim would have required the plaintiffs to prove intent and physical contact between Grace and the defendants and would have allowed jurors to award damages unrestricted by the 750 000 monetary cap that applies to medical malpractice cases in Wisconsin Scott criticized the 750 000 cap on medical malpractice settlements in Wisconsin suggesting it acts as a barrier He said The 750 000 cap makes it virtually impossible to file a lawsuit in Wisconsin Why Because a case like this takes just over a million dollars to bring to trial

We have not completely lifted the COVID veil We haven t completely lifted the veil of fear and we have a long way to do that Mendenhall said Mendenhall said one of the positive outcomes of the trial is that it showed that patients sign their rights away when they go to a hospital This trial is incredible in the sense that it paints a very accurate picture of what has happened in healthcare and it creates a roadmap of what people face when they go into healthcare What are you signing off on You re kept in the dark about your medications You re kept in the dark about your treatment You re kept

should scare anyone with ears to hear During Thursday s closing arguments attorneys for the defendants disputed the Schara family s version of the circumstances that led to Grace s death This was standard general ICU care in the management of these medications Giving these drugs would not have tripped any red flags said Jason Franckowiak an attorney for Ascension and McInnis Everybody in that hospital that was taking care of Grace Schara was doing what they could within the parameters of the family s wishes said attorney Randall Guse who represented Ascension Medical Group Fox Valley Wisconsin Inc and Shokar Guse and Shokar suggested that the hospital implemented the DNR order in response to the Schara family s wish not to place Grace on a ventilator But Michael E Edminister an attorney for the Schara family said There should never be confusion over whether a 19 year old girl is a DNR or not adding that the hospital could have honored the family s wishes to reverse the DNR at any time Attorney Joe Voiland who also represented the Schara family said at the press conference on Friday that they are evaluating their legal options following the verdict Scott told The Defender he is thankful for the opportunity to have Grace s death not be in vain He said The main benefit to the public is to be prepared for a hospital stay The jury ruled that no consent is required

FDA Agenzia federale per gli alimenti e i farmaci degli Stati Uniti per il suo vaccino contro il virus respiratorio sinciziale RSV e gli studi clinici in corso per vaccini per altre malattie Tuttavia il Dr John Campbell un importante commentatore medico ha sollevato preoccupazioni sull imminente futuro dell mRNA nel suo show su YouTube di questa settimana citando i noti problemi di sicurezza dei vaccini a mRNA e il processo normativo compromesso che ne circonda lo sviluppo e la diffusione Tutti i problemi che sono stati sollevati le preoccupazioni le reazioni avverse non sembrano essere stati presi in piena considerazione e si va avanti a tutta forza ha detto La FDA ha recentemente approvato il vaccino a mRNA di Moderna mRESVIA per proteggere gli adulti dai 60 anni in su dall infezione da RSV Sarà disponibile negli Stati Uniti entro la stagione del virus respiratorio 2024 2025 e probabilmente in diversi mercati mondiali mRESVIA ha ricevuto la designazione di terapia innovativa da parte della FDA un programma di approvazione accelerata per i farmaci candidati i cui risultati clinici iniziali dimostrano un potenziale miglioramento sostanziale rispetto alle terapie disponibili Questo è il secondo prodotto a mRNA di Moderna ad essere approvato dalla FDA il primo è stato il suo vaccino anti COVID 19 L approvazione non tiene conto dei rischi delle LNP e dell imprevedibilità della produzione di antigeni Stéphane Bancel CEO di Moderna ha dichiarato L approvazione da parte della FDA del nostro secondo prodotto mRESVIA si basa sulla forza e sulla versatilità della nostra piattaforma di mRNA Ma Campbell ha messo in dubbio le affermazioni di Bancel esprimendo preoccupazioni sulla distribuzione sistemica delle nanoparticelle lipidiche LNP acronimo di lipid nanoparticles utilizzate per veicolare l mRNA che potrebbero potenzialmente raggiungere più organi e tessuti Ha spiegato che quando si somministra un vaccino a mRNA attraverso un iniezione intramuscolare nel muscolo deltoide le LNP contenenti l mRNA possono rimanere nel sito di iniezione o entrare nella circolazione sistemica Campbell ha descritto il modo in cui le nanoparticelle viaggiano attraverso le vene raggiungendo la vena cava e il lato destro del cuore che pompa il sangue ai polmoni Da lì il sangue torna al lato sinistro del cuore attraverso le vene polmonari e viene pompato nell aorta che distribuisce le nanoparticelle in tutto il corpo L aorta le porterà ovunque a parte il tessuto polmonare ha detto Quindi le porterà alle orecchie al naso alle dita dei piedi", "chunk_id":

miocardio al cervello ai testicoli o alle ovaie Questo è il problema la distribuzione sistemica Campbell si è anche chiesto il perché della mancanza di controllo sulla quantità di antigene prodotto dalle cellule dell organismo in seguito alla vaccinazione a mRNA Questo va contro uno degli assiomi fondamentali della somministrazione di farmaci ha detto Si somministra la dose giusta del farmaco giusto al paziente giusto al momento giusto e per la via giusta Campbell ha spiegato come la risposta del sistema immunitario agli antigeni prodotti dall mRNA ed espressi sulla superficie delle cellule possa portare all infiammazione e alla morte cellulare in vari tessuti I tuoi linfociti T citotossici se riconoscono l antigene come estraneo will inizieranno a picchiarlo e probabilmente potrebbero uccidere l intera cellula ha affermato Ora se è nel braccio ti fa male il braccio Se si trova nel miocardio si avrà un infiammazione nel miocardio Per quanto riguarda il vaccino a mRNA anti COVID 19 Campbell ha detto che la proteina spike è particolarmente patogena e che la scelta di farne l antigene è stata molto molto strana Ha affermato che le aziende farmaceutiche e le autorità di regolamentazione non hanno affrontato il problema dei vaccini a mRNA che fanno sì che l organismo lotti contro se stesso provocando infiammazioni e reazioni autoimmuni Eppure il programma va avanti a

dairy worker marking the second known human case in the country public health officials are raising concerns over the adequacy and safety of stockpiled vaccines meant to protect against a potential pandemic according to Barron s The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC maintains bird flu is a low risk to humans the infected dairy worker only contracted a case of conjunctivitis pink eye and that there is currently no known mechanism for human to human transmission According to the World Health Organization WHO avian flu is responsible for 463 deaths worldwide over the past 20 years The CDC reports only two U S cases of bird flu and both were mild No Americans have died from the virus Still government agencies and Big Pharma manufacturers are building their capacity for bird flu vaccine production The U S government holds three U S Food and Drug Administration FDA approved H5N1 vaccines in its National Pre Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile The vaccines manufactured by pharmaceutical giants Sanofi GSK and CSL Seqirus all contain mercury a known neurotoxin according to product inserts The same companies plus Moderna are working to develop new bird flu vaccines Federal officials said they supply several hundred thousand doses within weeks and 10 million more using materials on hand and expect to produce 125 million doses within four months Dr Peter Marks director of the FDA s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research suggested the agency has a pretty low threshold to deploy the stockpiled vaccines We believe that if we needed to our vaccines would be reasonably good matches Marks said on April 1 at the World Vaccine Congress in Washington D C Given that all stockpiled vaccines were made for an earlier strain of H5N1 it s uncertain how effective they would be against the strains that are circulating now former FDA scientist Luciana Borio told STAT News The FDA approved H5N1 vaccines licensed in 2013 2017 and 2020 do not elicit a protective

Good Morning CHD said You ve got a dangerous vaccine for a nothing disease noting the low number of human H5N1 cases reported thus far It s supposedly for a life threatening illness she said Of course pink eye is not life threatening she said The whole purpose of bird flu is to make you think the pandemics are out there they re coming for you all the time and you need them the health bureaucracy to save you Nass said Sanofi vaccine contains thimerosol PEG Sanofi s H5N1 vaccine approved for adults in April 2007 was developed from a virus strain isolated from a Vietnamese patient in 2004 Our egg

partnered with BARDA in 2019 to expand pandemic influenza preparedness using the same recombinant technology as Sanofi s Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine Leveraging its existing technology would allow the company to more rapidly deliver a pandemic vaccine Moderna said in March 2023 that it planned to develop a bird flu vaccine stating its COVID 19 vaccine was developed from its H10N8 pandemic flu vaccine research Moderna didn t mention the bird flu vaccine in its March 2024 announcements However the company reported on its seasonal flu vaccine mRNA 1010 saying it had demonstrated consistently acceptable safety and tolerability across Phase 3 trials Early studies done by mRNA vaccine companies on seasonal flu are promising which could be good news here since mRNA vaccines can be made more quickly than vaccines using eggs or cells said Borio Why is it called a biodefense project Linking to a 2023 Global Biodefense article discussing BARDA s work with CSL Seqirus Dr Peter McCullough

the bird flu highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 human vaccine a US NIH BARDA project with CSL Why is it called a biodefense project The Daily Mail raised similar concerns about the U S Department of Agriculture USDA collaborating with the Chinese Academy of Sciences which oversees biodefense labs like the Wuhan Institute of Virology to develop more virulent strains of bird flu viruses ostensibly to aid in the development of vaccines The White Coat Waste Project disclosed details of the USDA China program in a February post showing numerous research project agreements beginning in April 2021 A bipartisan group of Congress members on April 12 sent USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack a letter stating This research funded by American taxpayers could potentially generate dangerous new lab created virus strains that threaten our national security and public health Dr Richard Bartlett an emergency room director and former Texas Department of Health and Human Services advisory council member in the April 10 episode of The Defender In Depth suggested gain of function research on bird flu viruses may be responsible for the current outbreak or could cause a future pandemic After everything we just experienced and all the loss of life and bankruptcy and damage to the economy families destroyed with COVID why would you continue gain of function research he asked Nass told Corbett she was skeptical of the push for bird flu vaccines Every single time we ve had an emergency and vaccines have been rolled out quickly it s resulted in disaster she said Nass cautioned against relying on centralized solutions pushed by public health authorities They want you only to be able to get the solution they have made for you she said They don t want it widely distributed where you have agency to decide whether you want it for yourself or not Don t be scared This is a scam", "chunk_id":
